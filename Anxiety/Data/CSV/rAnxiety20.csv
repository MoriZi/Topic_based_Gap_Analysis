1,I wish I knew what it was like to not have anxiety,[deleted],95,2020-04-16 09:38:14 EDT-0400
2,Probably the most exhausting part about anxiety is that the simple tasks are twice as difficult to do when compared to what I imagine non-anxious people deal with.,"Gotta get ready for the day? What is the step by step breakdown of every task I need to do before I‚Äôm presentable...

Gotta make breakfast? What is the order in which I need to make this smoothie...

Got a list of things due at work? What‚Äôs most important, did I order that correctly, alright I‚Äôm done...is my work good enough...

Ok I‚Äôm gunna send a text to this person. Did I say the perfect thing in that exact moment...

It‚Äôs so tiring.",62,2020-04-16 01:41:14 EDT-0400
3,Has anyone else ever exerienced a period where they are in a panic attack mode (basically a never ending panic attack),I'm currently in such a period and have no idea what's going on or what caused it. It's been like this for 4 days and i'm struggling to cope. I have no physical panic attack symptoms except muscle twitching but in my mind i'm extremely anxious for no reason and i feel like i'm dying,161,2020-04-16 21:48:01 EDT-0400
4,I fucking love Prozac,"It calms me down sooo much. Not always, I still definitely struggle with anxiety still, but it‚Äôs easier.

I get this calmed down feeling like almost every day on the Prozac since it started working, I have no idea how to feel this calmed down normally. I was maybe this calm one time in the 6 months prior to noticing the Prozac working, and probably way longer than 6 months. Now it‚Äôs almost every day.

I swear I wondered if I was high the first time the meds started calming me down, I‚Äôve never been high but if you told me this was what being high was like...I feel like I can breathe deeper

I‚Äôm out of the depression I was in too, so that‚Äôs cool. Starting to feel happy again.

My OCD is significantly reduced, things have been getting a lot easier there. 

I feel like I‚Äôm more able to handle rejection than before too.

I also apparently hit the jackpot because it increases my sex drive? Only other side effect I‚Äôm sure of is vivid dreams.

Not sure I‚Äôll ever get off this stuff lol

ETA: wow this got more comments than I thought lol, will try to respond but: obviously, consult a doctor before making any decisions with your medication. Anything I say is either my personal experience or what I believe to be widely accepted among doctors, and I‚Äôm trying to be clear on which is which. I can pull up sources if anyone wants them.

Also interestingly I feel like I‚Äôm not sure how much the meds help once something triggers my anxiety, but they definitely bring down the baseline. I think it‚Äôs a little harder to trigger but maybe goes just as high when triggered? Idk. I do notice a lot less nausea, which I would have a lot from anxiety before. I would say my current anxiety/OCD is still above average but lessened.

I got on them for depression but have also been diagnosed with OCD, depersonalization, and GAD. I would say the GAD is the mildest of them all, but I also used to think I had really low anxiety that I now know was actually just had a pretty constant level of significant anxiety lol. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack so I can‚Äôt speak to that.

I was diagnosed by a therapist and also had a full psych eval, so when I saw my doctor I had pretty complete documentation on all of my issues and had been in weekly therapy for a few months. So they didn‚Äôt really question whether or not they should prescribe me medication. I was also having thoughts of hurting myself so I think everyone kind of wanted me on meds lol.",122,2020-04-15 06:34:07 EDT-0400
5,Do y'all ever delete messages because your afraid what you said is going to be used against you to ruin your life even though all you did was make a minor error or say something that was no longer relevant,[this message was deleted],26,2020-04-16 04:20:51 EDT-0400
6,"I want to go home, but I‚Äôm already home..","I get this thought pretty frequently. I‚Äôm at home and all I can think, over and over, is that I want to go home. I realize this is some kind of safety/security anxiety thing but it‚Äôs very difficult to navigate. Sometimes I can get quite distressed with this constant dialogue. I am home, I am safe...but all I want is to go home üôÅ",33,2020-04-17 05:55:34 EDT-0400
7,so much of my childhood was undiagnosed anxiety,"my behaviors as a kid were so obviously undiagnosed anxiety and OCD. how did no one see or care. now, it‚Äôs on me to try to fix myself in a toxic environment with no access to help of any kind due to social distancing. poor child me had no idea what was happening or why she felt like that. poor thing. i feel so bad for her and her issues and why she didn‚Äôt realize they weren‚Äôt normal.


edit: i didn‚Äôt expect this many comments. thanks for sharing your stories and i‚Äôm sorry so many of us can relate :(",164,2020-04-17 12:55:50 EDT-0400
8,My #1 biggest fear is death. Losing my consciousness.,"Ever since I was little I have always entertained myself through my own weird and sometimes creative thoughts. And I always find myself having full conversations and discussions in my own head. And I think my biggest fear is losing all of that. Losing my consciousness. I can‚Äôt comprehend what it‚Äôs like to *not exist*, I just can‚Äôt imagine it. Losing all of the interactions and times with my loved ones. It‚Äôs fucking scary. I just think that whenever I die, I‚Äôm gonna feel like my life has been cut short, and my last minutes of consciousness will be regret. There‚Äôs just no way I can see myself living without any regret. I would love to, but I will regret losing my family and friends to death. It‚Äôs the scariest thing I can think of. Not existing. Like, no matter what, you always have your own thoughts, that‚Äôs the one thing almost every human is guaranteed, thoughts. But to just all of a sudden not have that, I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Like, what the fuck? You always have to like, be somewhere, you have to think of something. Where was my consciousness before I was born? Where will it be when I‚Äôm gone?",55,2020-04-15 05:51:37 EDT-0400
9,I always feel like I‚Äôm running out of time,I feel like I have to be doing something productive and if I don‚Äôt I feel like a lazy piece of shit and that I‚Äôm a burden. Even when I‚Äôve done everything I have to do it‚Äôs never enough. Relaxing makes me more stressed because what if there‚Äôs something I need to do but I forgot about it.,15,2020-04-15 09:28:40 EDT-0400

13,I've come to appreciate sunny days more than ever.,I never thought the weather could have such an impact on my mental health. It's been raining all week here in southern Cali. I had 2 anxiety attacks within that week. But today is such a beautiful sunny day and I can already feel a big contrast in my mood and the way I'm carrying myself out. Hope your all staying safe and please keep your head up ‚úåüôÇ,8,2020-04-15 02:19:07 EDT-0400

18,Went to the ER and held at mental hospital twice in the past couple weeks,"Two 5 figure hospital visits were basically them just doing my EKG, chest x ray giving me Ativan and something to calm my stomach down then sending me home but the 2nd time I said I was suicidal and they held me for a week at mental hospital that billed me again $5000. I was constantly having panic attacks everyday while at the mental hospital and bothered them so much to get my vitals checked all 7 days. If I was at home I probably would have had 2 more er bills that‚Äôs how bad my attacks kept getting. The doctor I had would ask me how my appetite and sleep was everyday because I was put on new medicine for anxiety and depression. The main thing the doctor asked me each day was how I slept and I would say about 5-6 hours but I didn‚Äôt know because we didn‚Äôt have a clock in our rooms. Today I feel much better than I have in the past month and it‚Äôs because I finally got a full night of sleep and changed my diet and I started walking everyday. The medicine helped my appetite improve and improved my quality of sleep. In the end I am thankful for the medicine but I was quite frustrated for the first week. No one might not read this but I just wanted to share my experience because I got bored.",9,2020-04-15 04:54:16 EDT-0400
19,My anxiety is awful about this virus. I can‚Äôt even sit on my balcony.,"I have been dealing with so much anxiety about this. I have always had bad anxiety but ever since the pandemic I have been a mess. I have a balcony in my apartment and I went out for a little and suddenly started to have a panic attack. I was gonna wear a mask but I decided to to go inside. Barely 5 minutes. 

Part of me knows I‚Äôm being irrational but the brain is a powerful thing.  Love to talk to someone.",20,2020-04-15 00:46:49 EDT-0400

22,can't ask for letters of recommendation because of fear of rejection,"I'm (24F) working on applications for my Master's this fall. I have the grades, published papers, good connections but I just can't bring myself to actually reach out and ask people to endorse me. I have a constant nervous pit in my tummy about doing it, and when I try I literally feel nauseous and shake so hard I have trouble typing. I've been procrastinating on this since like December, deadlines are coming up and I still find an excuse to do it tomorrow everyday because the thought of bothering someone or them rejecting me is so devastating. These are people who know and like me, which is part of why I feel so silly for feeling so scared.

I know this probably sounds super silly and irrational, but I'm desperate for advice, or at least a suggestion for some way of toughing it out... I've worked really hard for this for all of my undergrad, but I just can't get over this hurdle.",4,2020-04-15 23:14:33 EDT-0400
23,Waiting to find the right drug was worth it. Zoloft has shocked me on how wrong my world view was.,"I have spent most of my life (24m) being absolutely miserable for no damn reason due to anxiety. I remember spending my lunch break in first grade just running around the playground cause I needed to go the bathroom but couldn't bring myself to ask a duty. I have always had a feeling of being inferior to literally everyone and that something was wrong with me. Public speaking would lead to me just trembling as I try to say my presentation as fast as I could. Never told my doctor about these issues because I never really told anyone. Wouldn't have mattered since I was very against medication due to the belief it's all my own fault and that I could get over it. Never really have myself credit but I really really tried. Took speech class twice to give me that experience. Started rock climbing to get over my fear of heights (this took a long time). Despite my efforts I still found doing simple things like going to the bank extremely difficult. Would spend my days doing nothing and would stressed over doing nothing. I feel like I really missed the true college experience since I would never take people up on their invitations (or would force myself but still end up not talking to anyone). The thing that sucked the most is that video production has always been my passion and the anxiety was always in the way of succeeding in that. A bit after college I finally ended trying anxiety medication. It took a while and was losing hope but damn has Zoloft turned my mind around. The first time in my life I actually dont feel miserable all the time. Recently I went to the bank and felt so damn good cause it was actually easy! I see that I have worth and there's a lot to like. I can now see Im not too bad looking and dony feel the need change clothes five times before settling in something plain. I still have a lot of fears but can feel good that I am trying my best. Used to think I was super boring but now I think I'm actually a pretty funny and a genuinely caring guy (despite having the background I thankfully never ventured into the ""nice guy"" mindset). I have a lot of potential in video production and feel a lot more confident in producing some of my scripts (hell my film won best short at my University's film festival). Yeah I might not be strongest or the coolest person out there but I can now feel good about just being me. Not every one's gonna like who I am and for the first time I don't care.",10,2020-04-15 11:37:25 EDT-0400
24,"I wish I could convince other people with anxiety that people don‚Äôt hate them, they aren‚Äôt annoying, and their presence is not resented.",[deleted],99,2020-04-18 01:09:59 EDT-0400
25,Do you suddenly get a shock of anxiety that happens after you had a thought?,"I have social anxiety and it started because someone recorded me when I had a really embarrassing tic (I have tourettes, but nothing vocal). 

I'm worried that he's gonna post it in the internet and it will ruin my life. 

Since I've had anxiety, I've done many stupid things in order to relief the anxiety, but it makes the anxiety worse and worse. I keep thinking those things are gonna be used against me to ruin my life. I'm also worried about people videoing me and so on. I'm constantly looking out to see if people have their phones in the hands because they could be recording me or I just happen to be recorded. 

**Sometimes I get random thoughts about the stupid things I've done and I'm constantly thinking about them for days and days and days**.

**Does anybody else do something similar**?

31,I feel like no one is taking my anxiety seriously.,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety for a few years now. I am able to cope with it for the most part. I have my bad days but I can get through it. 

The past three weeks I have been in a constant state of anxiety. It is understandably higher. But I‚Äôm starting to feel exhausted from it. I have tried to talk to my normal support system and I feel like they just think this is my normal everyday anxiety. They tell me that normal everything is going to be okay stuff. And maybe it‚Äôs true but I am not okay right now. And I just feel like even after telling people it‚Äôs not being taken seriously.",5,2020-03-26 20:12:49 EDT-0400

Do you have any advice for me to concentrate only on the thesis?

38,Sometimes I worry about who'll take care of me when I get old,"I worry that I'll get Alzheimers, dementia or Parkinson's, or lose my ability to perform daily tasks independently and have to be taken care of til I die. What my concern is who'll take care of me? Likely I'll never marry or have children. Currently few friends that I keep in contact with. It'll probably always be this way.

40,Volunteers for 1-1 mindfulness / body attention online training?,"Hi,  
in normal days im a grinberg practitioner, which means i teach body attention to help deal with how one is in their body, their emotions, sensations, thoughts and responses. Meetings are done based on physical touch and verbal guidance to direct the person's attention.

As these not normal days, i'd like to experiment and see what can be done in the online space.   
So, if you are willing, id be happy for volunteers for online training of body attention.

44,"I was anxious about going outside at night, now I'm scared that I'm stuck in a web of lies.","So, basically, nearly 2 years ago I was working in a corner store. I was 16, it was late at night and those two teenager who used to come to the store every night, super high. They used to do stupid things and say stupid things to me. They always tried to buy alcohol though they were underage. They were these jocks who were in the same gang than the bullies I had in high school. But they were ok with me, only stupid boys.
One night, I didn't want to walk back home so I told my mother that two guys told me that they were gonna hurt me. So my mother went to pick me up. I know that sounds dumb, but I do have anxiety and delusional disorder. I was scared of walking outside at night. When my mother picked me up, I told her not to say anything about it to anyone. She made me promise to tell my boss so I went in the work group chat and told everyone that these guys thereatened to hurt me.
The next day, I went to see my boss and she wanted to file a complaint. I told her not to, because I made her think that they said it as a joke, though it scared me. When she asked me who it was, I showed her a picture of one of the guys on Facebook and it turned out she knew the kid. It turned out the kid played hockey with her son.
I convinced her not to call the police and I later told her he came apologize, even though he did not.

We live in a small city, so I later realized that my boss knew my whole family.

Nothing really happened about this. I sometimes regret lying about itz and to cover my ass I went and talked to the guy. I made him believe he told me he was gonna murder me after my shift and that even though he did it as a joke, he made me scared. He said he didn't remember but that he was deeply sorry and not to worry about it, that he was really high.

So, this is how one useless lie turned into a web of lies. All of this because I didn't want to walk home at night.

So, what if my boss confronts him someday?
What if the people from the group chat go back and re-read that again?
What if this comes back to bite me in the ass?

TL;DR: told my mother to come pick me up, said that someone wanted to hurt me. When my boss knew about this, she asked who it was, I showed her a picture and she recognized the person. I made the person believe that he actually threatened me.",0,2020-03-26 22:32:56 EDT-0400

50,How do I manage my anxiety at a new job?,"I'm a shy person and I already have prettty bad anxiety about my health, or my body image, especially at night. I'm also socially awkward but I try. I recently went to a job interview after a long time of being unemployed and the interviewers actually liked me. Like a lot omg. üò±üò≠

The problem is there is a lot to take in and there are a lot of people working in the same space. I can probably get used to that, but I just feel like if I somehow embarrass myself, that would be the end of me. Also, they think I am a very good bright candidate for some reason and expect really good professional work from me (when I myself don't even know wtf I'm doing most of the time), and that causes me anxiety. 

I am very thankful for my new job but I am sooo anxious. I'm the only tiny asian girl in the whole company (i'm not american born or first world country born) and I don't know how to make friends with other girls, or guys, for that matter. I would really love to. And to know how to act a certain way at work to make people like you and not be a ghost.

53,Scared,"I‚Äôm so lost in my anxiety right now it‚Äôs hard to see past it and see what‚Äôs real. 
I‚Äôve been in a severe episode for over a month now, the longest it‚Äôs lasted. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to convince myself it will end eventually. 

My relationship, one of the most precious things to me, is beginning to suffer. We‚Äôve been together almost 4 years and these episodes have been occurring since January. 
It‚Äôs so hard not to over think everything, analyze everything, obsess over everything. My boyfriend is patient, but everyone has their limits. And I know insecurity is poison in any relationship. I‚Äôm so scared of losing him over this.
I‚Äôve lost relationships in the past because of the same thing. 
My therapist keeps telling me to think positively, tell myself everything is fine. 
But it‚Äôs so hard when it almost hurts to even smile.

54,Separation anxiety as an adult. How do I resolve this?,"I've had a panic disorder since I was 14 (along with GAD and depersonalization/derealization). My core fear is losing my mind, and I have not been able to resolve this even though I am now 24 years old. It has grown into agoraphobia this year, I couldn't leave my house without breaking down. Not even to walk across the street. 

I've always dealt with panic attacks on my own, but 3 years ago I met my wonderful fiance and he has helped me SO much through my panic attacks and agoraphobia, so much so that I now feel I can't handle them on my own. If we have to be apart for even 1 hour I am a terrified wreck. My fear is that I'll have a panic attack, not be able to reach him, and then go insane/lose my mind. 

I resolved this temporarily by doing exposure therapy, but it has come back and in full force. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How can I treat this for good? I can't stand feeling this way anymore. Do I need to do constant exposure therapy to keep it away?",0,2020-10-21 23:23:00 EDT-0400

I'm terrified. To make matters worse I came home and my mom pressed me on how I was doing and when I told her about the letter she again pressed about what it said. She then blew up and started telling and throwing things. Telling me my mental illness effects everyone around me and that if I was anxious I just needed to go out and do stuff. I felt so ashamed and hurt that I've been hiding out since.

To clear up my harmful thoughts are excessive and detailed but they be are thoughts. I don't intend to act on them and don't think I could even if I choose to.

86,Im so lonely and i hate myself so much,"Im in my last year of school and have offers to study maths at uni next year, i never really thought id get to this point because ive struggled with anxiety and depression and shit mental health, for what feels like my most of my life. I know its a massive acheivement to get this far but now that ive got these offers even the thought of uni stresses me out to no end. Ever since i got my first offer ive just felt stressed constantly and its starting to take a real toll on me. Ive got my exams in June which decide if i go to uni but the stress and anxiety im feeling is stopping my doung work in lessons and revising. 

Part of me knows why im stressed, but another part of me doesnt. The idea of uni is freaking me out, ill be living away from home and have to make friends and interactt with people . I havent had any friends for years and i dont talk to anyone at school and usually im fine with that. I dont find myself craving the social interaction and the few times i ever manage to go to a social event i find it really boring and stressful and end up wishing i hadnt even bothered.

And tbh ive feel ive spent the majority of the last few years in a depressed haze. Ive been majorly depressed for my teen years and i feel like ive missed out on development not just socially but also mentally if that makes any sense. Like i have no personality, im the most boring person alive, i wouldnt be my own friend.

I just feel so lonely i have no one to talk to. And even though usually it doesnt bother me, infact often i dont even notice it. But currently i have so many thoughts going round and round my head and i have no one to talk to. The only person i talk to is my 9 year old brother. But hes half my age so they dont really count do they. I also talk to my mum but its usually just about my brothers. And i havent told her how im feeling about uni, partly because i know she will just say that i dont have to go this year but i know that if i dont go this year i wont ever go. I know it doesnt make any sense but i do know myself. Also she would just tell me i need therapy. And i know i do, god theres so much trauma that ive just sortof squashed and try to forget about. I know i need therapy but for one the autism complicates things also the idea of therapy makes me so anxious that i dont want to do it. But i also dont feelni can tell my mum how im feeling because i know shes already really stressed out dealing with my brothers who have there own share of mental health issues. Thanks for that dad.

I dont know what to do, i dont know who to talk to. I just feel like such a burden on everybody. And i know im as low as i could be but i also know if i leave things as they are then im gonna get to that point again. Where im wanting to chuck myself off the roof or just wishing for a car to veer of the road and run me down. But also why bother talking to anyone when there nothing they can do, my heads just so fucked up",2,2020-02-11 00:13:35 EST-0500

90,"Lost My Home, My Fire, and My Identity. Searching For a Light.","I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but really just sharing this seems warranted at this time for me. Forgive me if out of place.

Long story short, I had been self-medicating anxiety with sex, alcohol, work, and fitness for many years. I always felt the undertow of anxiety, pulling me into chronic dark mental places if unattended - and figured staying busy was the best solution. I took up meditation and other coping mechanisms in my teens, which seem to keep the wolves away from the door and instead roaming along the mental tree line, where they belonged.It wasn't until I turned 30 that I began to really investigate the subconscious origins of my anxiety. It was a very serious relationship, actually, that caused me to question my beliefs and my thought streams more seriously.

The origin wasn't a surprise. It was the root of a dark tree, sprouting rotten fruit that I knew very well, but pretended didn't exist. It was my childhood. I won't delve into it. But one of my first memories in this life was sitting in the back of a police squad car, with blood on my forearms, sirens dancing through my iris - desperately watching my mother try to murder her lesbian lover with a hammer in our front yard, in Daytona Beach Florida.

I decided to do what I've never done, go to therapy. Initially, they were impressed with the amount of self-awareness I had around the issues and the methods I developed to cope.

But they had a next-level solution. 3 milligrams of Klonopin per day.

I knew that road leads to a dark place, but in this moment, immediate relief was more important - as my inquisitive nature into my repressed memories seemed to have unleashed new bouts of rage.

I took the Klonopin as prescribed, and felt better than ever. In fact, I stopped drinking. The thought occurred to me that this is how life must feel for the more fortunate people with Rosey childhoods, or proper brain chemistry.

This newfound self-awareness, which felt like a lucid dream, soon became a putrid nightmare. My wakefulness and mood started to slip. My entire attitude became dependant on a refill.

I, against my better judgment, decided to stop taking them after a very fast 3-day taper.  Ambitious? yes. Stupid as hell? Even more yes.

I ended up waking up at work to police and EMT's standing around me. Apparently I had a seizure and was unresponsive for 7 minutes.

Me, being the well-adjusted adult I am, woke up in a rage that people were standing over me. My employer ended up letting me go because ""this makes us look bad"". My doctor, who is now under investigation for overprescribing patients, cut me off with a 3-week taper.

I had to sell everything I own, flee my home, and spend 90 days shaking in bed at my grandparent's house.

With the help of CBD, meditation, cold showers and the slow grind of time, I  have somewhat returned to this world.  Moved to a new city, started a new career. Slowly getting back into the gym, etc.

But, I will never forget the feeling of having to go through job interviews, my face is maniacally twitching with every word I speak and every smile I half- attempt.

I will never forget squinting at daylight with a raw nerve for a mind and hoping that this heart palpitation actually kills me this time. Egging it on to finish the job.

I will never forget finally falling asleep after 4 days of tremors and waking up to the bed soaking wet and shaking.

I will never forget these things, but I don't remember who I am.

It's been 8 months. I am going to keep going.",0,2020-02-08 05:05:00 EST-0500

96,Junior in University. Feel Stuck.,"Hello! To start, I‚Äôll give a bit of background.

I  go to a relatively prestigious ‚Äúbaby Ivy League‚Äù university. I  transferred into this school after completing my associates at community  college. I transferred here on a full tuition scholarship that several  other community college transfers were awarded. We were all members of a  summer program together at the university prior to transferring and  this experience was amazing to me and I bonded a lot with the people in  this program. Most of the people I made friends with in this program,  however, did not end up transferring to this university.

The  university I now go to is incredibly affluent, very preppy, and not  diverse. The summer program I was a part of was for low-income community  college students and I suppose is mainly meant to increase the economic  diversity of the university. Luckily, I am one of the more ‚Äúwell off‚Äù  individuals from this low-income group. In other words, a lot of other  people that did this summer program came from much worse backgrounds  than I and they had to go through a lot more shit in their past to get  to where they are now.

My feelings  of depression stretch back to the latter end of high school (I am 20  now). After getting out of the high school environment, I somewhat  flourished in community college. I felt like I could be myself and I  became happier, even though my social anxiety could still be crippling.  But everything was going well! In May, I met my first girlfriend and we  hit it off over the summer and we are now in a long distance  relationship as she goes to a school about 3 hours away.

I  typically think of myself as a pessimistic person and I always expect  the worst of the future. This led to me thinking the summer program  would be awful, but it ended up being amazing! So, my expectations of  coming to this university, for the first time in god knows how long,  were incredibly optimistic and I couldn‚Äôt wait to start my junior year  on campus.

But as soon as I arrived in August, it feels like everything that could go wrong did go wrong:

1. On night 1, I had to stay up until 5 in the morning because classes were already hurting that hard.
2. I  rarely saw any members from the group of community college students  that I transferred with, as I don‚Äôt share a major with any of them.  Also, I am very unproductive when studying/working around others, so in  order to get all my work done, I basically had to isolate myself at all  times. Also, they are all SO goddamn motivated. All of them. They own it  and love that that is a trait of our group. But I‚Äôm not motivated at  all, so I feel like I don‚Äôt have anyone in this group who I can relate  to.
3. I  joined the crew team, as their workout regimen is really good and was  similar to what I was already doing, but I figured it would be a good  idea to join to meet some friends and to force myself to stick to this  workout regimen. But, as a transfer, I was isolated from the  upperclassmen because I was a first year rower...and I suck. I‚Äôm like  54th out of 55th on the team. So as a transfer, it is an odd position,  as the first years live in the same halls together and they all have the  complete meal plan so they eat together, but I‚Äôm not able/willing to  socialize with the upperclassmen as they look at me as a first year and  have already known each other for 2+ years.
4. Long  distance relationships just suck. I found that out quick.  Miscommunication is easy and I am constantly missing her. It got better  as we both got more used to it though. Also, it sucks because we each  took turns visiting each other every weekend. So while I‚Äôm with her, I  don‚Äôt want to be bogged by work so I have to push really hard during the  week to get mostly everything done before the weekend. I love our time  together though and I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice it for anything else.
5. I‚Äôve  been sick since August essentially. I have a terrible immune system as I  have a chronic condition, so I‚Äôve basically had a cold for 5 months. I  got over it over break but of course as soon as I came back it came  back. I can‚Äôt take medication for it because it conflicts with the  medication that I have to take for my chronic disease.
6. The  overall social culture of this school is overwhelmingly stuck up, upper  class, and generally unfriendly. I feel like I‚Äôm on the outside looking  in. It‚Äôs to the point where you stick out if you wear sweats around  campus. It‚Äôs a very ‚Äúuppity‚Äù atmosphere and everyone just seems so damn  motivated and naturally smart. It‚Äôs a good thing, I don‚Äôt look down on  these people because of how they are, but I definitely don‚Äôt fit into  this culture. For example, at 9am in a very difficult physics class, the  majority of people will be sitting there, looking slick af, smiling  (like wtf), and asking competent and relevant questions to the professor  and seemingly understanding what‚Äôs going. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sitting there  tired and unable to understand what‚Äôs going on. It feels demotivating  and isolating.
7. Overall,  it just feels like people have their shit together when I don‚Äôt. People  are more mature, motivated, and overall just seem to be happier and  more well adjusted.

It  feels like everyone is very motivated in their major and truly enjoy  doing their work and searching for research opportunities and  internships. They enjoy speaking with the professors and having  intellectual conversations with each other. What do I want to do? I want  to get my work done, so I can watch a video game let‚Äôs play, smoke weed  and chill with my girlfriend, or just relax and chill by myself for 2  seconds. But these aren‚Äôt productive. But I have to be productive. I  feel like I cannot sacrifice this scholarship, especially in my junior  year, but I just feel no intrinsic motivation. I‚Äôm just motivated by the  fear of what happens if I stop. I have no motivation or passion in  life, so if I were to stop, I feel like I‚Äôd just become a loser.

In  conclusion, I feel out of place, lonely, overwhelmed, unmotivated, and  I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôve talked to therapists, but all of them have  said I‚Äôm completely normal. I‚Äôm going to my next appointment tomorrow,  as I really feel that my depression is getting worse.

Any advice? Thanks.",2,2020-02-08 01:27:20 EST-0500

I refused to go through one again and avoided them completely until yesterday, because it was where my friends wanted to eat and customers aren‚Äôt allowed inside. I was a bit nervous but I was surprisingly fine. There was no shaking. No stuttering. No wanting to cry. I feel like I could go through another no problem.

116,Getting a puppy is the best thing that's ever happened to my social anxiety.,"I've always loved dogs and have wanted one for years. Back in February, my boyfriend and I moved into an apartment that allows dogs, and last month we finally got our 7 week old puppy! 

I moved across the country to live with my boyfriend about a year ago and have made zero friends because of my anxiety. But one of the most important thing about raising a puppy is socialization! That means meeting 100 new people in two months and as many dogs and puppies as possible... yikes. 

I live in a super dog friendly apartment complex, and several of my coworkers have dogs. Introducing myself to my neighbors has always been a no-go, and making plans with my coworkers outside work sounded impossible. But now, thanks to my new puppy who I love very much and whose healthy development trumps my anxiety, I've met so many of my neighbors and have made plans with coworkers and acquaintances for puppy play dates!! It's a small step but it's a huge start. 

Not only is my puppy a great motivator for meeting people and making plans, he's a great ice breaker! And not even an awkward one. He's always doing cute silly things we can talk about, and he often leads to discussions about family and childhood pets. And I never feel awkward/bad leaving a conversation because ""puppy needs water"" or ""it's puppy's nap time."" I can't believe how much he's helped. I'm so grateful for this little pup.",7,2020-07-19 05:07:32 EDT-0400

Everything feels like a temporary solution and it never feels like anything will stay good for very long at all.

118,Finally got a job!!,"Hey y'all! I'm really excited so I wanted to share. I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for years and it's prevented me from ever getting a job because I could never make it through interviews or go at all because of anxiety or a panic attack.

But today I finally got a job!!! Yes I was late because I sat in my car having a panic attack before going in, but I was able to use some techniques that my therapist gave me to calm down and collect myself before going in. I'm so anxious about my first full day of working tomorrow but I think I can do it after today! 

I wanted to share this because I'm really happy that I'm finally making progress and I wanted to show others that are struggling with the same things that it does get better and you can do it.

119,"I hooked up with someone for the first time, it was great","So for a long while, I‚Äôve struggled with relationships, particularly those of a sexual nature. I‚Äôve also been bad at meeting new people and generally I will stay away from situations that are outside of my comfort zone. I‚Äôm a very solitary person, I don‚Äôt go to parties, I don‚Äôt see friends often and I mostly just stay home and do solitary things. 

I have a friend who I‚Äôve known since I was a child, yet we drifted apart a couple years back and have started talking to each other again only recently. Anyway, yesterday evening he invited me out with his mates, most of them went to school with me but I didn‚Äôt really know them well. I‚Äôve been feeling unusually rebellious recently and decided to go out with them despite how nervous I felt. I was mostly anxious because they were all guys and I didn‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd get along so well. 

We drove down to our local lakes in my friends tiny old car (that vaguely smells of weed). We went on a pretty long walk. A few of them smoked a cigarette each, which would usually make me feel anxious but I actually dealt with it okay. They‚Äôre all social smokers and I suppose I judge that less now than I did. During the walk we climbed up a pretty steep ledge, I would usually be terrified of falling but I felt spurred on by everyone around me doing the same. 

Later in the night we even went over to one of the guy‚Äôs houses. I felt kinda weird and unwelcome at first but I eventually became comfortable. Then by a stroke of luck, my Dad texted me saying he‚Äôd be staying over his gf‚Äôs that night, so I invited them all back to my house. Also pretty nerve wracking, but it was great, I made them pancakes and we all just had a chill time. 

Throughout this whole night, I was chatting/flirting with one guy in the group who I‚Äôd only met once, and despite how different we were as people we still hit it off. Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄòJ‚Äô. 

So for a long while, I‚Äôve been pretty insecure and in the past I would date guys I wasn‚Äôt so attracted to because I thought they were my only option. I‚Äôve eventually become comfortable with the idea that I‚Äôm not ‚Äòstuck up‚Äô for wanting to date an attractive guy, I‚Äôm allowed to raise my standards and I can afford to. 

Any way, J is probably the hottest guy I‚Äôve ever had interested in me. The guy was model levels of attractive. I was apprehensive to his flirting at first but I couldn‚Äôt help but flirt back as the night went on. He stayed behind after the others left and we ended up having sex. I was jittery with nerves as I asked him to come upstairs with me but I kept my cool.

I‚Äôve never hooked up with someone outside of a relationship, and I never thought I‚Äôd like it, but I really did. It was just so casual and not so anxious like my other sexual experiences. By no means was it perfect, but we figured stuff out together. It‚Äôs hard to really get into it when you‚Äôre both pretty tired, but it was still amazing regardless. He told me how pretty/hot/etc I was and hearing that from someone I found so attractive really hit different. I‚Äôm always trying to be ‚Äòmore‚Äô than I am and to feel so appreciated as what I am right now was great. 

I‚Äôm fucking exhausted from how late the two of us stayed up, but I‚Äôve never been more thankful to have stepped out of my comfort zone. I just had a great time and I feel so comfortable in who I am. I feel so attractive too. 

I was bullied in school and I‚Äôve often been teased for being too straight laced. I don‚Äôt drink much, do drugs or smoke at all. I always felt like a ‚Äòloser‚Äô. But last night I really owned who I was and I was still appreciated. 

I‚Äôm kinda cool just the way I am. For once, I really feel like I don‚Äôt have to be someone else. And you know what? That means a whole lot me.",4,2020-07-18 21:40:22 EDT-0400
120,Does anyone feel anxious when they think about being anxious,"I get really anxious sometimes when I think about the feeling of being anxious and that causes me to actually start feeling anxious like my heartbeat gets faster and my palms get sweaty and I even get a little dizzy sometimes, I just wanted to see if anyone else felt similar and if someone can help me to stop feeling anxious about feeling anxious.

122,A mindset my therapist taught me,"I do hope this fits the sub and the flair, if not please let me know!

I've been struggling with social and general anxiety as well as overthinking for a while now and some weeks ago, I finally got regular appointments again after I stopped therapy for a few months due to the lack of harmony and trust between my therapist and I.
Most strategies and ideas for reducing the severity of my anxiety are long-time things that mostly still leave me with some doubts, feelings of uncomfort, ... but in my last session, my therapist told me something that helped me out a lot so far. I've been in a somewhat rough and sensitive spot lately, taking a lot of things personal and questioning my own behavior as well as other people's opinions of me.

Basically, it's about trying not to interpret actions or things that might get you upset. Of course, some people do things intentionally to make others feel bad, guilty, or whatever but the issues I was facing were mostly just me overthinking - thinking why did he do that, why was she so distant, why didn't they respond when I asked something?

Like my therapist explained, it's like a dog wagging its tail and knocking over a flower pot. It didn't mean to make you upset by knocking the thing over, you might call it a collateral damage. It's just a dog wagging its tail with no bad intentions whatsoever, it's just what it does. Maybe she was distant towards me because of the bad thing that happened a few minutes ago that got to her, not because she was annoyed by me starting to talk to her. Maybe they didn't respond because they weren't paying attention, were focusing on something else, and not because they wanted me to feel ignored and left out.

Of course, I'm still extremely anxious, I still think a lot about everything and worry about my future, my relationships, or if I still have my bus ticket on me. But trying to see the realistic reason instead of my own interpretation helped me out a lot in many cases where I would've otherwise just felt attacked and cut myself off to some extent. I could comfort myself a little, take some of these doubts and thoughts off myself.

Maybe these thoughts and this mindset can help some of the anxious overthinkers like me raise your spirits and catch yourselves should you fall.",2,2020-07-21 02:50:26 EDT-0400

126,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.",267,2020-01-02 21:46:08 EST-0500

My agoraphobia has gone away and now I am actually having the college experience! I can actually spend money on stuff instead of getting anxious about spending money. I can stand up for myself and to my parents. And, lastly I am now able to use Reddit consistently because I'm not socially anxious to talk to people!

I have my bad days and honestly those days remind me why I take Zoloft in the first place, because it would be so much worse without it. This has kind of made me sad that it took so long for me to try medication but now it just makes me treasure every moment I spend not anxious thanks to Zoloft :)",19,2020-01-05 02:06:18 EST-0500

I could speak because for the first time in my life I thought i was RIGHT about something I didn‚Äôt start overthinking i just did it I stopped crazy lady from punching my friend by actually getting in front of her before she was able to get to her i am really really really proud of me :‚ÄôD

149,Anxiety over the recent political news,"Felt horrible when I read the news, with the fears that many have about potential war. Although I live in Australia, I‚Äôm still scared about the outcomes. Speaking to my dad, he reassures me this isn‚Äôt a global conflict (China and Russia, and other major players being unlikely to join the war). Nevertheless, I understand even a war between Iran and the US wouldn‚Äôt impact me definitively but the fear of escalation is still tingling me even after the initial shock.

I feel like I felt when I heard about the India/Pakistan news a couple months ago. The same feeling of when WW3 was trending on twitter a couple years ago. Knowing those have not led to the wars that people perhaps fear-mongered about is some respite from the aftermath of the panic.

Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for people to tell me it‚Äôs alright, telling me the straight truth or telling me a white lie to feel better (what I think my dad does at times, or others in other posts).

The rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, I‚Äôll be worrying about it twice. With a pretty important interview in a couple of days, I‚Äôm trying to stick that, but not sure how I‚Äôll cope as more news comes out (although I‚Äôm making myself keep off it).",29,2020-01-03 10:05:47 EST-0500

I was having night panic attacks, but my psychiatrist adjusted my medication and that seemed to improve. I can't keep track of days, even with a calendar.

Now every morning I wake up and panic because I'm, well, awake. I have to do another 24 hours of this crap. I'm so anxious I don't have energy to make my days different, either, however I'd possibly even do that.

Did anyone ever wait for teachers to come to them to ask if you‚Äôre okay, instead of actually ask them first?  

Or did anyone else never, idk, go to the bathroom cus they were too nervous to ask, or whatever the reason was? 

I felt like this quite a lot, but I don‚Äôt know what it was and why I never seemed to want any attention on me.

160,dae get anxiety from texting?,"i‚Äôve been talking to this guy for about a week now, and i‚Äôve been noticing that texting him in general gives me a lot of anxiety. i worry about what i say and whether or not it‚Äôs good or funny enough and if he‚Äôs gonna judge me or think i‚Äôm boring. 

all of this anxiety culminates into my brain just shutting down on me because i get so anxious and then i force myself to feel uninterested, so i reply really late or really drily to prevent myself from having to go through that whole process again. 

i will even go to such lengths as muting them or just putting my phone on do not disturb because i hate the suspense of waiting for a text message from them because im always overthinking how long they take to text back. 

this usually results in me forgetting about them and then i reply hours later, and i‚Äôm feeling insanely guilty but unable to find a better way to cope w all the anxiety i feel. i‚Äôm effectively pushing away the person i want to talk to most, and the cycle repeats itself and i only keep feeling worse. 

i find that this mindset happens with a lot of people i talk to, and the more i like somebody, the more often it happens. i am so frustrated by this because it really prevents me from communicating effectively with them, and i‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll end up getting tired of me because they think i hate them.

Edit: I am not saying to get rid of discussion or that I‚Äôm upset that we do it.

182,"I feel like the only way I will get any peace is when I die. I am frightened of everything, please help","\*\*\***EDIT: Having returned from the dentist, I don't even have a cavity, let alone having to have teeth pulled. My parents however decided to stop by my house today and I am terrified that I have broken some kind of lockdown law. That relief I felt from the dentist lasted around 1 hour. This is torture.\*\*\***

I've had anxiety for as long as I remember. As a child, I was constantly worried about my parents dying. Then it became about getting into trouble with the police/school. I used to pretend to vomit every Monday morning so I could stay home, as the world was just too scary.

At 13, I was diagnosed with emetophobia (fear of vomitting), and I completely shut myself off from all socializing activities because of it. I did have friends, but I never went the cinema, out shopping etc etc because I was too scared of being sick.

This then transpired into a general fear of panic attacks, most notably a fear of being in public in case I had a panic attack and looked stupid. This made Uni lectures very difficult. It made exams difficult. It's something I still have - i ""plan exit routes"" from every place I ever go into.

Ex-partners have commented on how much effort it takes to deal with me basically, with my ex-boyfriend I was paranoid he would crash his car, as he used to drive home from our dates at like 4am, and I thought he'd fall asleep at the wheel. I was constantly worrying about him. I feel like my neuroticism came across negatively to him, and maybe he found me really annoying. So I've decided at 24, that I won't get into another relationship.

When I dont have work or uni (im doing a Masters atm), I sleep. I can't do anything else. If I don't sleep, I panic - so what's the point? I get about 2 hours between 9pm and 11pm where I feel calm as the days over, but when I am falling asleep I can feel my heart pounding again, dreading the next day.

A lot of my anxiety comes from seeing topical things in the news, and applying them to my life, if that makes sense. I will always find an example from my past to become ""guilty"" The last 1 weeks have just been the worst I've ever experienced with this. The basic outline is:

1. **(Monday - Wednesday) Fear that my relationship failed because of my racial discrimination**: I am following as everyone is, in utter disgust at how complacent white people have been in response to the Black community's appalling treatment. My ex was Black and experienced fucking hideous treatment - driving with him, we were pulled over 4 times in a 5 month period - I've never been stopped before. We always discussed race openly, and the difficulties that he was experiencing with a relationship with a white women. We broke up 6 months ago, his decision (posted about ex before for the backstory as to why). Now, for the last 3 months I have been at peace with his decision, even though it broke my heart. Now that little voice has started: *""It's because you were racist to him, it's because he felt like you thought you were better than him. You're a racist. You're gonna have to pay for that. You'll lose your job.""* (and this one's fucking annoying because AS IF a white woman should be making this about herself)
2. **(Monday - Wednesday) Fear that I have plagiarized my whole dissertation:** I am completing my second Masters. I am a high scoring student. I know what plagiarism is and I would never do it. Yet, I have googled (individually) every. single. sentence. in my 35,000 dissertation and started rewording them all because I am scared it will flag up.
3. (**Wednesday) Fear that past one-night stands were lying about their age:** when I moved to my current city, I didn't know anyone so went on Tinder. Obviously matched with people my age plus (24 and over). I matched with one guy who I ended up sleeping with for a while, and we sent each other nudes. I haven't thought about this guy for a very long time (was 3 years ago). Now that little voice in my head has started: *""How can you ever really know ANYONE's age, without asking for their ID? You saw all your exes driving license, but you didn't see his!!! Sure, he said he was 30 and he looked it, but are you SURE? What happens if he just looks older? You've committed a crime!!!! You're going to be locked up.*"" This came from seeing a new story about a webcam girl who was jailed for not verifying ages for her shows.
4. **(Thursday - today) Fear that I have advanced decay and need all my teeth taken out:** I have had one filling in my whole life. I look after my teeth. I have a slight inflammation on my gum and a chip on my front tooth. I've spent 7 hours today googling images and videos of teeth extraction. I've calculated costs for extraction, implants and how I would get it/when. I am convinced that I will end up looking like someone who takes drugs with no teeth, lose my job, end up alone and unattractive and unable to afford new teeth. I have a dental appointment tomorrow and I am convinced they will pull my teeth. This came from the news that dentists are allowed to reopen after lockdown, and that there will be significant damage to vasts proportions of the population because of the 3 month closure.
5. **(Thursday - today) Fear that I've made a mistake in a previous job and a lawsuit is being filed against me.** This is a general one that usually rears its head every so often. I've worked in so many jobs were this is the case. E.g. previously in a drug store where we had a Challenge25 policy. Always thought I was going to fail to ask someone who was underage and therefore get a hefty fine. Another time, I took a job as a carer but left after my first shadowing shift due to what I thought was inadequate care for a lady (not bad, but not caring or compassionate) - I always think that company will eventually get into trouble and my name will be affiliated with them and I will be prosecuted (which is obviously not true, as I didn't do anything, worked for 1 shadow shift and quit because I felt like it wasn't caring enough).

These are just the ""big"" anxieties that cause me massive panic attacks, crying fits and vomiting throughout the day. There are more, but they're more general ones (about my parents dying for example).

I have high doses of Propranolol and Sertraline (i've been on every AD in the past). I also have had CBT and counselling. It's made a small dent in the anxiety, but not much.

I just feel like my life is unbearable. I know this is anxiety, but when I am ""in it"" it's so hard to see past that, and to see it as being irrational - it's like all of the above is TRUE and WILL DEFINITELY happen, and I feel so fucking helpless. I am ruining my own life and I don't know what to do.

Has anyone got any advice? Or experiences similar?

**TL;DR: my anxiety is spiraling thinking that I have made massive (sometimes criminal) past errors that will come back to haunt me, and it's ruining my life**",15,2020-06-15 02:59:04 EDT-0400

188,Is it rude not to answer a text?,"Sometimes I don't feel like answering a text even if I've ""seen"" it. I don't mind people leaving me on read either (I know it's common to feel anxious when someone doesn't answer but I don't).
However I feel anxious because I feel obligated to answer a text whenever I get it, even if I don't open it but the person see I'm online I get super anxious.

Articles or memes about how to ""treat"" people who don't text back doesn't help either. I'm nlt trying to be rude, I do value the friendship and never ignore them face to face or when they text something important or urgent, but sometimes I just don't feel like answering to you because text is a massive source of anxiety to me because I hate the idea of being available 24/7. Yeah I might be online and not busy, but me not wanting to answer has nothing personal to do with the person. Yet people do it so effortlessly, opening your text and leaving you on read and once again I don't care but once you're the one doing it to them they get mad. 


(I'm so anxious about it that I do actually answer all my text as soon as I read them)

Edit : I feel like my post came across as me never answering the text. I answer right away urgent text. I answer under 24 hours for not urgent text. My problem is on messaging app without the ""seen"" option you can read it and answer later and everybody is fine, but for some reason the ""online"" and ""seen"" options make people think you're ignoring them when I'm just treating it like normal text messages.",28,2020-06-16 21:34:52 EDT-0400

While we often perceive ourselfes as weak because anxiety can incapacitate us but the amount of physical and mental pain we endure hardens us in a way we never really think about. 
The absolute horror of a panic attack is what occupies our mind most of the time and we tend to forget that we're dealing with a two-side coin here.

199,"Stop cautioning yourself, stop implying threats to yourself, stop imagining dangers, stop focussing on worst cases.","There are countless resources, books, videos and analyses of how anxiety, OCD torture people for years.

One of the worst habits, the most depressing one, causing the highest sustained damage and singly maintaining your misery due to anxiety and worry, is **the habit of cautioning yourself in the belief that cautioning is beneficial or that it will protect you**.

**It does neither**. It only uses your memory and your inherent mammalian ability to fear, in combination, against you, to keep you in a loop of self-inflicted fear, suffering and misery.

If in addition you have panic disorder, OCD or have faced betrayal, trauma or violence, those get added on to this memory link chain, in the false pretext of protecting you by cautioning yourself, and grind your sanity to fine dust.

Edit: Also, **stop holding yourself to ransom**.

Don't do it.

Don't caution yourself. Let risks remain and train to live with uncertainty - don't take life seriously, take it less seriously each day.

Don't see only the dangers. See the positives too.

Don't caution yourself, encourage and praise yourself too and don't end sentences in ""but, again, ...""  No. Don't do that. Stop that. Start saying ""no buts, it'll work out, period.""

Stop using threats and cautions in place of legitimate reminders to do things.

Don't self-motivate by fear, threats and warnings. That's using the cruel Theory X of (de) ""motivation""  against yourself. Use the Theory Y - encourage, allow calculated risks, allow failures, allow creativity, say ""no"" and ""stop"" regularly and firmly.

It can be done.

**1000s of people recover from anxiety each year. This time, why not you?**

Yes, they relapse after a few years, but they recover again, and they spend those few years with 5-10% of their worst anxiety days. So why not you? They were all as or more miserable than you are today.

I, for one, was. And now look at me, talking impossible stuff, almost lying to your faces.

Either I must be a troll, or there must be some truth to what I'm saying.

What if there is?

We're all in this together because all our patterns of suffering and recovery are studied and solved, and many of our behvaiours and problems are the same.

----

*Recovery is real. It's not a distant fantasy of the lucky few. It is the eventual destiny of many miserable wrecks like we have all been.*

Happy recovery!",4,2020-06-21 02:29:45 EDT-0400

201,Death Phobia/Thanatophobia,"***If you have a fear of death, this might be triggering as I give specific details about my thoughts.***

&#x200B;

So... where do I begin? I'm really not too sure when this started happening but I think the first time I really noticed it was somewhere around six months ago. And probably within the last month or two, I am CONSTANTLY thinking about it. Obsessing. I can't talk about it... if I even try to I go into a panic attack. Just thinking about it fills me with such a huge fear. I'm terrified. Even physically I can feel the terror... racing heart, shaking hands, sweating, emotionally terrified. I'm not religious or even really spiritual. I don't think anything happens when we die. It's just the end. Total eternal nothingness. No memories, no nothing. I don't even know how to process this. I'm always worrying about the day I lose a loved one. My mother, my dog, my partner. My dog is my best friend, it's just her and I in the house. She's around 10 now and her face is almost completely gray. There are times, quite often lately, where I look at her face and just start sobbing and then go into a panic. I can't imagine my life without her and don't think I could even survive it. Then I go into these extremely vivid day dreams of her dying. Different scenarios. That are so real I feel as though it's actually happening and start to panic. My mom is starting to get wrinkles in her hands and around her eyes and I've become extremely aware of them. It starts to make me feel panicky and I have to really avert my brain to stay calm. My partner and I have a 20 year age gap. I don't think I've ever loved someone so deeply and I truly think I've finally found ""the one"". I'm constantly thinking about how much time I have with him. I imagined myself growing old with my partner but he will obviously get to old age much sooner than I. It's not fair finding your mate and being cheated on so much time.

The last two weeks have been so bad that I wasn't eating and slept as much as possible because being awake was impossible. My Xanax wasn't doing anything for me. And then I think since we're all going to die anyways, then what's the point in doing anything at all? It's extremely hard for me to have motivation or a hobby cause I don't see the point in any of it. And then that turns into me feeling like a loser and unworthy of other people because I'm boring and uninteresting. That's a whole different story though.... **Fucking anxiety am I right?** It's such a fucking joke feeling suicidal but also having a death phobia. HA. I was thinking how if I could run out into the street, get hit by a car, be put into a coma and dream the rest of my life away that I would be happy with that. This week however, my anxiety has eased up a bit. I'm not crying and having a panic attack every day thankfully, but I know it will return. I'm also bipolar so I think I'm on the opposite end now going up possibly into a manic episode.

She's been having a really hard time since the 10th, and I tried to help her long distance but it was useless and I can't even tell which one of her problems are real or not. 

If you listen to her, everything in her life broke all at once, her keys were stolen, the fridge doesn't work or is poisoned, or it sometimes works, the stove smokes and sparks when she uses it and will explode the building, the outlets are not working, but they are sometimes working, or some are working, the cellphone charger is burnt out but it also works, but only in some outlets, but then it's lost, and then found, and then burnt out again, her pension is about to be cancelled, there is a problem with her taxes...all at once and she needs me to help her with all of that, and get a lawyer, and go to the federal government because only they can help her....

And among all those problems, I know some may be real and most are not and some may be real but embellished with delusions because that's how she understands the world and everything gets added into the paranoid web of delusions, everything is related, connected, and has to do with her. 

I have no way of asessing the real situation over the phone and no friends or family to check on her, so I took time off work and now I'm traveling there to see her but I'm freaking out. Aside from travel being a horrible experience for me, always, her phone was dead all day yesterday, ever since the evening the day before, and I haven't been able to reach her, or confirm to her that I'm on my way. Normally we always talk when I leave and arrive.

 In only a couple of hours, I'll be there and will be able to see for myself whats going on, but my mind is filled with horror and I can't breathe. What if she electrocuted herself messing with her stove or her outlets? What if she fell and broke her neck? What if the last time I talked to her, I brushed her off because I was at work, tired and frustrated and she's been calling me literally up to 20 times a day for thr last 10 days at all hours of day and night, but that pushed her over the edge and she killed herself? What if I get there, and everything is broken but she refuses to replace anything or let the repair people in as she is suspicious of everyone? What if I get there and she doesn't let me in because she doesn't believe it's me? (Cuz she's already tried to make me recall obscure past events that only she knows about to prove I'm me).

227,Have you ever been amazed by people that don't seem to worry at all,"My sister is a prime example of someone that never worries, dont get me wrong I've seen her worry but never to a point of obsession. Recently she got a letter from the IRS saying that she filed her taxes wrong and she was overpaid. She had to set up a phone meeting with someone  to discuss it. She was more annoyed than worried, and after she read the letter she went out with her friends for dinner and was fine. If that had been me I would have obsessed and been so consumed with the entire thing. I started googling things and read horror stories about the IRS taking people's wages etc. I was worried for her.  But she just went on with life, when I asked her if she was scared she said ""Scared for what shit like this happens all the time I'm not the first person who's done it"". Long story short she spoke with someone from the IRS she set up a payment plan and will be paying them back, no big deal. 

I've always been amazed at how she can just brush things off like that and just go on with life. Granted she can be a bit careless at times and has done some risky things  but sometimes I wish I was like that.

I worked up the courage to go if my husband would come with me and stay with me and help answer questions so I didn‚Äôt start having a panic attack. I get way too overwhelmed. The morning of the appointment (today) I had two panic attacks and my husband was the cause of one. He didn‚Äôt mean to be, but I showed him something with my teeth and he made a disgusted face and it sent me spiraling. I still decided to go forward with the appointment, my husband said he would do all the talking and stay with me. He told me he told them I need to be with him during my appointment. Immediately upon getting there, They separated us and I had to do the appointment alone. I tried really hard to hold it together for like 25 minutes. I got through the scans and a million questions but eventually I started having a panic attack. My husband showed back up then but did not comfort me. Everyone kept asking me questions and my husband wouldn‚Äôt answer for me even though I was not able to speak. Eventually another dentist came in and was trying to talk to me again and I couldn‚Äôt do it. I said I had to leave and asked my husband for the keys and went to the car. I cried in front of 10 people (I do not cry in front of other people) and was in hysterics. My husband got the information from dentist after I left. I am so upset with my husband and I feel like he let me down in a profound way. I don‚Äôt know what to do. The dentist wrote me a prescription for Valium if I will come back but I don‚Äôt think I will be able to go back now. I feel even more embarrassed and traumatized about the dentist then before. I have also now lost all faith in my husband to be supportive with this in the future.

I don‚Äôt know what to do about my husband or myself.",0,2020-10-01 23:16:07 EDT-0400
230,"For those who take benzos as needed for panic attacks, do you get withdrawal symptoms, and if you do, what alleviates them?","I‚Äôm prescribed Klonopin as needed, and once or twice a month I‚Äôll take .25mg

231,I have a question for anyone who knows how to cut hair:,"So due to COVID, an already present extreme social anxiety and Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome- I haven‚Äôt had my hair cut in close to three years. I look like a cave man. 

I have clippers with all the attachments, so I was thinking to just clip it all off at the longest length and then style it from there with product when needed. If I do this, will I look stupid? I ask because I‚Äôve looked up videos on it and none suggest to just go ham on your entire head with one gauge of attachment- they all go into detail on different gauges for styling. My lack of a properly working executive function doesn‚Äôt allow me to understand any of these instructions. I get lost in the detail of it all. 

So, one attachment- entire head of hair. Bad idea?

My hair is down to the middle of my back if this helps for reference.",2,2020-10-02 01:52:13 EDT-0400
232,Anxiety about anxiety - a fantastically wicked circle,"First off, I started a new account to post this. I‚Äôve recently gotten into journaling my anxiety experience and wanted a separate place to do so. 

Quick background: Anxiety and what appears to be a panic disorder began for me roughly five years ago. I had a difficult five or six months coming to an understanding of it which then led to a respite lasting a few years. More recently over the past year, I‚Äôve experienced a resurgence. The frequency and length of episodes has increased. In a sense I can blame covid for making life full of stressors, but my anxiety doesn‚Äôt feel like it stems from social/pandemic reasons. In short, it feels like obsessive thoughts about falling back into a place where I thought I had overcome. 

Can anyone relate? I‚Äôve recently begun meeting with a therapist who seems fine, supportive, and understanding. She‚Äôs given me a few strategies to manage symptoms (grounding and mindfulness, although the mindfulness strategies were there from years ago when it started). Grounding hasn‚Äôt helped much yet; mindfulness/meditation is a bit more effective. 

The root cause of anxiety is fear. Fear of fear, in my case. Fear that the physical symptoms my body manifests will shut me down. Fear that my two kids (8 and 3) won‚Äôt have a functioning parent when anxiety takes hold. Fear that my spouse has to pick up the slack (note: he‚Äôs amazing and we‚Äôve had specific conversations about this) and because of his long hours at work, he‚Äôs physically unable to. 

So... tbh I feel slightly better after writing this. Maybe sharing my experience and journaling specific pieces of my anxiety is therapeutic after all. I welcome any and all thoughts, stories, experiences. I‚Äôll probably write again soon.

234,Does anybody else feel anything similar?,"I have major health related anxiety, I'm always scared I'll get some horrible disease or some major mental illness and no matter how hard I try I cannot get myself to stop, so far that I feel my anxiety just mimics symptoms to get me more riled up.

It started with the possibility of cancer, then a lump in my throat, then my eyesight after two bad trips all the while my anxiety mimics multiple symptoms related to such illnesses and now its about my ears. I talked to my therapist once about how it rings every so often and then I so stupidly did research and just dove deeper and deeper into the possibilities.

Since then, I've had this ringing in my head, not like gritting your teeth as hard as you can ringing but something much more subtle and no matter how hard I try, I can't get it out, so not only am I scared of it being something far worse, like tinnitus, but I'm also so unbelievably irritated because I feel like I'm the only person ever that has shit like this happen to them.

237,Doctors office Anxiety,"Hello! 

Today I went to the doctors office just for my regular checkup and as they wheeled in the machines to take my vitals, I just felt my heart rate skyrocket because of my anxiety, as it pretty much always has for my life. 

This doesn‚Äôt happen when they do any other tests but every time I get my heart rate checked I have to tell them about my anxiety and they, understandably, still get concerned when my resting heart rate is 132 bpm for an otherwise healthy 19 year old. 

What I wish to know is if there‚Äôs any way for me to just not feel this way when I go to the doctors. I always close my eyes and tell myself that there‚Äôs nothing wrong and it‚Äôs just a test but still i freak out and get a high reading. 

Thank you for your time!",0,2020-10-02 03:49:15 EDT-0400
238,Xanax as an anxiety reset button,"So I‚Äôve actually gotten to know my anxiety pretty well. I know what triggers me, sometimes, I know the physical symptoms, I can pinpoint where I carry tension, and I have a bag of tricks that work for me to calm down. I have anxiety induced IBS and haven‚Äôt had a serious inflammation in a bit. 

I started a new job and have a date this weekend. I woke up this Monday morning so nauseous. It‚Äôs like my college days. Everything I eat gives me diarrhea. No appetite. This time luckily I knew what was going on so I feel like I‚Äôm not really anxious in my brain, just in my body? And I‚Äôm sleeping like a rock which is a god send. 

Sometimes I stop sleeping for a few nights when I‚Äôm anxious. Sometimes it just goes away but before I‚Äôve taken Xanax, felt the blissful relief, get a good nights sleep, and that honestly does it for me, I keep sleeping well. It‚Äôs like I jsut need that little push, and it unites the knot, like a reset button. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve lost my appetite like this, and I was hoping it would take the week and go away but no such luck. 

I‚Äôm thinking of taking a Xanax jus as a reset but am not super sure on timing. My anxiety is at its absolute worst in the morning. By midday I usually can pick at some food and am pretty relaxed by night. I don‚Äôt especially want to be on Xanax for my date, but I‚Äôm nervous about taking one in the morning, and by evening feeling that terrible feeling of being flooded with panic for no reason. 

I could take it tonight, the night before, and hope I wake up fresh? Or tomorrow morning when I‚Äôm at my most anxious? Or a bit before the evening time so I keep it away for my date. What do you all think?",0,2020-10-02 03:25:17 EDT-0400
239,Nearly over my anxiety but the stomach...,"Hello, 38 M here. Back in May it started with a stomach flu and I looked up Covid symptoms. Anxiety triggered that same night because Dr Google said I had fatal symptoms of Covid. Long story short, my mind jumped from serious disease to serious disease for 4 months and prolonged the stomach bug for nearly 2 months because of the anxiety.

Fast forward to last month, my anxiety getting under control and my appetite finally back BUT I developed an internal hemorrhoid from all the junk food so unnaturally but naturally I thought CC. Next day I focused all my stress into stomach...like Goku made a spirit bomb...I could just feel all the anxiety channel to my stomach.

Last few weeks I've been getting control back but stomach issues (not nearly problematic but uncomfortable at times) flare time to time. I can feel the anxiety trying to work it's way back when that happens and worry about what I'm feeling. Anyone else get over anxiety related stomach problems? How long did it take to subside? Anyone still going through them?

What I feel random times throughout the day and majority of the time when I'm sitting:

Stomach might turn, not a pain but like a spot of discomfort that jumps around right side, nausea seems to be pretty much gone, light pressure in stomach. 

I feel like I'm so close to beating this but the finish line keeps getting pushed inch by inch.",1,2020-10-01 23:16:37 EDT-0400
240,Anxiety when sleeping alone,"I‚Äôve been together with my boyfriends for almost two years now. It‚Äôs not a long time, especially for our 30s, but we‚Äôve been in so many failed relationships before - we both just know we found the right one.

However, during this time I lost the ability of sleeping alone at night - I cannot really fall asleep anymore, in the sense that I‚Äôm too nervous about not so important topics around bed time.

When my boyfriend is around, I am not nervous and I sleep like a baby.

245,Anxiety - How 2020 changed me.,"Life in Los Angeles was changed dramatically during 2020 and I wasn't prepared for it.

It is hard to remember what life was like before, but I remember being busy. I was on a kickball team that played every Sunday, I worked a Monday-Friday Job which of course took up at least 40 hours a week. It is funny when you work a job that's 40 hours a week it really takes up a lot more once you factor in lunches, getting ready, travel and everything else. 40 hours means just sitting at your desk but it actually takes up even more time. I always thought, once I graduated college and found a good job, life would be complete. What I did not know is how hard corporate America is. If you get sick, if you have lots of Dr. Appointments and you are not on an executive or manager level, life gets difficult. At least that was my case, I could never keep any PTO time because I was always using it for my appointments. How are we supposed to keep up with everything if we get such limited time off, it just made it impossible. My last job in LA was working for Colliers International. Wow., I thought, I had a great boss who was flexible, treated me nicely and overall was excited to be working there even if my office was in a parking garage (which I hated). The point of what I just wrote is that once all this is taken away from you, your job which you spend so much time at, your social activities that you looked forward too, life changes and questions arise. Such as what am I on this Earth for? What am I supposed to do with my time. I remember my mom saying to me, how are you going to pay your bills. My response was, well isn't that why you made me - so I can work to make other people (companies) rich and pay bills to do basically do the same thing.

I was not prepared though for all these changes because on March 15th life as I knew it, really had changed. We were out at a Drag Show celebrating my Birthday with a couple of brave souls who came out even when the pandemic was just starting. That day, our Mayor issues that all bars must shut down and we partied until they closed. We did not know how long this would last or how intense it would get. Shortly after, Safer at home orders were issued. Suddenly, I am working from home and scared every day that I have contracted COVID-19. Suddenly my job went from manageable to beyond stressful. My boss‚Äôs efforts to make sure we were adding value to the properties we were managing meant harassing tenants for rent due and tracking a portfolio of failing businesses. Prior to Covid, I saw how small businesses in retail and restaurants were already struggling. I saw the difference between anchor tenants (Target, Ralphs, Best Buy) how they are treated versus small businesses. Large tenants are permitted to have large balances and avoid much harassment from the landlords, the philosophy that they will always pay in the end. With small businesses, they do not get the same leeway that large companies do. As these small businesses had their income drop to levels never seen before, the large companies were still open and, in some cases, thriving. How is this possible? Well the definition of ""essential"" really meant Target, Ralphs were able to stay open and were busier than ever while most small businesses were closed, restaurants struggling to conform to take-out only and sales dropped (we had to track sales each month and it was staggering the drop). All this really started to weigh on me as I am seeing small businesses go out of business and the owners pleading with me to help them.

Combined with what felt like my life being put on hold, my social life ended, my anxiety went through the roof. Suddenly, I was beginning to feel like I could not sort anything out in my head, work was becoming intolerable and I felt like I was falling apart. I become depressed, was not sure what my future held or what my role was on this planet. I became even suicidal thinking how much easier it would be to leave the world then continue to live here on the Earth. This of course scared me even more because I have battled depression and situational bi-polar disorder before, and I felt that it was back. Every day I was crying, and the ups and downs became too much for me to bare. I had to seek out help. Seeking out help wasn‚Äôt as easy as I imagined, I had a primary care Dr., who basically said it‚Äôs a tough time for everyone., you just have to hang in there and speak to a psychologist. Seems easy enough, except with my insurance I was not able to get an appointment for weeks which was like how am I going to make it weeks when I am not sure I will make beyond today. I called everyday and every location to see if there were any cancellations and tried to just keep swimming (just like Dory). Finally, probably about 2 weeks later and 3 over the phone Dr. appointments where I was having panic attacks, I finally had a video chat with a psychologist. He starts out by prescribing me about 4 medications, one to help me sleep, one to help my mood, one for anxiety and one for depression. I am not someone who likes to take a bunch of medicine, but I knew I needed a lot of help. My biggest immediate stressor was my job when I asked my primary care doctor or psychologist to place me off work each said the other doctor should be the one to do it. California has a short term disability program, which is basically a state wide insurance plan which money comes out of our paychecks for but neither of my Dr‚Äôs wanted to place me on disability instead opting to say it‚Äôs the other Dr‚Äôs responsibility. I decided I had to get another opinion. I reached out to my previous primary care Dr., who agreed to help me even though my insurance did not cover her. I would have to pay for some services out of pocket (a video call for 15 minutes is $450)., but I thought it is a small price to pay to get some much-needed relief.

This was the day my healing journey started and what a journey it has been. She placed me on disability for the month of June., and step one is to inform HR and then your boss. Colliers had a leave plan where basically if a Dr., takes you off work ‚Äì no problem just go through Liberty Mutual Insurance and they handle the leave claims. You just need a Dr. diagnoses which I had and a treatment plan which I also had. My boss was less than happy that I was taking time off and the last couple of days I worked he barely spoke to me. My district manager sent me a crazy email with a snarky reply, saying sorry working from home has been so hard on you. You must remember a lot was happening. George Floyd had been murdered, I had friends who had Covid; we had curfew in LA where we couldn't be out past 8 P.M. somedays. I was just not able to process everything that was happening. I would watch the news and just be crying the whole time. I would be crying during my meetings at work, I just was so unhappy and lost. Now its almost June and my Leave of Absence is approved by Colliers.

In June, I started therapy in addition to my psychologist and my therapist suggested I also incorporate Group Therapy. But by June I had already been surviving for about 2 1/2 months of extreme anxiety and depression with little assistance or understanding what I should do.

I was reluctant that this group therapy could help me but decided it was worth a try. The group was called mood boosters and it was a 6-week program that met virtually and it was starting at the end of June.

Even after not working during the month of June, I was still experiencing a lot of anxiety, depression and insomnia. I then had a follow up appointment with my previous primary care Dr., near the end of June. It was decided that I should be off work for July as well to continue working on my mental health. I sent in all the necessary paperwork into HR and my manager but didn‚Äôt hear back which I thought was odd because HR had even called me asking how I was, if I knew when I was coming back to work etc., a very cordial email exchange was had previously. I did not hear back for about a week until Friday about 2:30 P.M. I receive an email saying my Leave of Absence extension had been denied and that benefits would be ending in 4 days. This HR representative stated that someone would reach out to me Monday but that she had no further details for me. I was so shocked and texted my manager right away. He initially said he had no idea and would investigate. Later that day at about 5:30 P.M., he texts me that the company is doing poorly due to tenants not paying rent and that they‚Äôve decided not to extend my leave of absence along with he believed I‚Äôd still be able to return though.

The weekend hits and I am unsure what is going to happen, if I will have insurance ‚Äì my husband is under my plan or even have a job anymore. Monday roles around and I do not hear anything from them. I email everyone like hello can I get an update what is going on here. Finally, I get a call from HR who says my boss is also on the line although I never heard him say anything. HR goes, okay Alex your termination date is June 30th‚Ä¶..this lady did not even know who she was terminating. Alex is my boss who was on the line. They offer me 2 weeks pay and 1 month of payment for cobra which is $1300. The call lasted 2 minutes at the most and suddenly I had 1 more day left as an employee of Colliers.

This was a hard blow for me to swallow. First, I was not going to have insurance in 2 days in the middle of a pandemic, I had just started group therapy and take medicine every day that helps to keep me alive. I became even more stressed, anxious and just upset with how my life was turning out. They wanted me to sign a 6-page document which said, that I would not ever say anything about Colliers that would tarnish their good name, etc...

I declined to sign and got a lawyer. 14 days later they offered me my job back. I couldn‚Äôt believe it; I remember reading the email from my lawyer in disbelief. How could I go back to a company that treated me so poorly and what would my life be like if I went back. I decided I could not work for them and this was a ploy to stop me from suing them. Imagine going back to work like Hi everyone, just had to hire a lawyer to get my job back; I did not think I would be treated very nicely by management if I went back as well.

It‚Äôs important to note that my husband and I were able to get insurance for July 1st., through Covered California (thank you ObamaCare)., I was able to continue my group therapy because I found an option on there to go with a plan similar to the one offered by my previous employer.

What makes this story even crazier is that when I started working from home, the phones were forwarded to my personal (not re-reimbursed) cell phone. June 1st I texted my boss because I was surprised that even though I was off on Leave., in which you are not supposed to do any work (company policy along with a requirement of being on disability)., the phones were still forwarded to me. I gave him a heads up the phones were still being forwarded to me and his response was, ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù June 1st, I still took a meeting with a lady from our Marketing department because she had questions on a project I had been working on, even though I informed her I was already on leave. For the whole month of June, I was still getting all of Colliers calls to my cell phone. With no way of knowing which call was for me or which call was forwarded; I was still working. Answering tenants‚Äô questions and directing callers to the right resources. I thought this was what they wanted me to just to, ‚Äúhelp out,‚Äù even though I was on leave and not getting paid.

The day Colliers informed me of my impending termination; I sent out an email CC‚Äôing everyone of importance asking for them to please stop having the phones forwarded to me as I was still getting a lot of calls. No response. This continued until the end of July. Keep in mind, I would get phone calls any day of the week at any time and had sent many emails requesting that this be stopped, all which were never responded to. During June, I had even had to send codes to my boss and answer questions what I did not know is that they had a TEMP who was pretending to be me. I checked my work emails, to find that in June the Temp was impersonating me. He was using my work computer with my log in and had just emailed tenants pretending to be me. I couldn‚Äôt believe it because I had also sent a couple very personal documents to HR via my work email which this temp had access to; along with all my log in‚Äôs and chrome passwords etc‚Ä¶, it made a lot more sense too because I never knew what tenants were talking about when they called me but they made it seem like I had just been emailing with them.

Finally, the calls stopped, and it felt like a big sigh of relief but the scars of how I was treated remained.

My Dr. ended up extending my disability until the end of September. As I am still battling Anxiety and a little bit of depression, but I finally feel like I am on the mend. I finally feel like I am starting to be able to be myself again.

Starting tonight I am starting a 10-week Cognitive Behavior Group Therapy and my goal for the end of it is be able to move through life, stronger than ever. I think there is no shame in asking for help and recognizing when you need it. My healing journey is not linear and has found many obstacles, but one thing is for sure, each day I get a little stronger. With that I can smile knowing I am doing the work and starting a new chapter in my life. Los Angeles is opening up slowly, I am still scared of COVID but I know that no matter what happens the future is bright not just for me but for everyone. We are going to get through this and I believe be stronger than ever.

We have an important election coming up, so it‚Äôs important that if you not registered you do and then actually vote. This is our chance to have our voice heard and we need to hear everyone‚Äôs voice, it what makes a democracy work. Take your time when you fill out the ballet and read all the directions because we also must make sure our voice is not thrown out because we did not follow a direction or missed something.

I am excited to restart my blog and start my next chapter. Re-Birth

247,Can't stop fixating on my heart and it's ruining my life!," This paranoia and anxiety has become unbearable. Every day I get so paranoid about my heart stopping or something going wrong that it causes me to hyper fixate and hyperventilate. I check my pulse non stop and the stress leads to my breathing becoming erratic. This strong paranoia can happen randomly like in stores or in cars, but lately its been getting slightly worse. I've been having a lot of life changes happening from moving in to my new apartment with my boyfriend, trying to find a job and interviews. Last week I was given a 24 hour heart holter and the results came back fine. Several months ago I also had blood work done and it was all normal, so I'm low risk for heart issues.

then i tried doing omegle with camera. at first i did it with covered camera. i thought they probably think i am some idiot. they think i am ugly... u know but after i lot of 3 sec calls and me skipling bc i am scared. i got the guts to listen to what someone will say.

i couldnt talk. i was scared to say hi. i felt my voice shaking and just sounding akward. i thought people would think my hello sounds weird. with time i said my hello and closed imediatelly. they next call i stayed and waited for their hello....

and then i started asking questins where are you from. how you doin. i was able to keep a conversation. if someone skipped me i would stop feeling bad about myself bc i also skipped people. 

and now in real life i still have hard time but it is a little bit easier to adapt. i atarted learning to just say what i think, to stop overthinking and create imaginary thought of other people.

252,Anxiety making me physically ill - how do you guys cope?,"I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and anxiety basically my entire life, I just turned 40 last week. I‚Äôve seen therapists, been on meds, and have found little relief. Therapists have never been a help, and I‚Äôve been to half a dozen different therapists over the years. Meds helped, but I hated the side effects. The loss of libido is the big one I didn‚Äôt like, but I also was incapable of crying for years while on meds, even when my father died. I gave up meds because I don‚Äôt want to go through life being a zombie.

My stress and anxiety is always provoked by my job. I started a work from home job about a year and a half ago, and since then the anxiety from work has been manifesting as physical illness. I‚Äôm not underperforming, everyone at work praises me for how good I am at what I do. But we‚Äôve lost valuable members of my team over the last few months, and all of their work has landed on my plate. That in and of itself causes anxiety.

I started speaking up to management at work about the unreasonable workload and the fact that they haven‚Äôt bothered to replace the 2 employees who quit / got fired. We are given a quarterly bonus, and last week I was informed that my bonus is being docked 25% because I‚Äôve been complaining about the workload. That fucking pisses me off, especially when my employment agreement outlines that one of the criteria for the bonus is that we push back when the workload is too much. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter, they‚Äôre still docking my bonus.

This is basically the last straw and I‚Äôm coming to the conclusion that I need to quit this job. This decision is causing an immense amount of anxiety for me. On my actual 40th birthday last week is when this all manifested as illness. Total loss of appetite, complete exhaustion, body aches, I feel like I have a fever but the thermometer says no, I‚Äôm nauseous, and I can do almost nothing but sleep most of the day.

I‚Äôm sure depression is at play here too, but I think it‚Äôs the anxiety causing the illness. I am CONSTANTLY thinking about this job and how to get out. I wake up thinking about it, and the thoughts persist 24/7. Last night I tried some mindfulness and focused on my breathing when I‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety. That helped get me back to sleep, for about 20 minutes, and I must‚Äôve repeated that a dozen times throughout the night.

I‚Äôm thinking that I need to get out of this job immediately, even before I‚Äôve lined up another job, which I‚Äôve never done before. That‚Äôs causing anxiety and panic. Financially I‚Äôll be fine, I‚Äôve saved $30k in the past year and I can survive a while without a job if I have to. But that financial security does nothing to relieve my anxiety.

So I guess my question is - what do you guys do to prevent your anxiety from reaching the point of physical illness? And what do you do to recover after you‚Äôve reached physical illness?",5,2020-05-16 20:53:28 EDT-0400

260,How to cope with nighttime anxiety?,"Naturally we get more anxious at night, but for me it's very bad, every night. I blame it on the quarantine as I haven't been able to see my therapist for many weeks now and the whole lockdown thing has had a very bad affect on my mental health. My PTSD and guilt has come back stronger than it used to be, and every night I can't help but dwell on the abuse I've endured and paranoia about my ducks dying (they're perfectly healthy and there's nothing dangerous where I live, but when I'm trying to get to sleep my mind forces me to think about ""what if this happened to them?"" ) to the point of tears welling up in my eyes. It's affecting my relationships because I've been dwelling on past things that happened in those relationships, making me question them. I want to forget about the past and stop with the ""what if""s, but I can't. I'm a massive ""what if""-er, I get sad over things that haven't happened (for example, what if I stepped on a duckling in an alternative universe?). I know it's pointless because there's nothing I can do about it but I can't make it go away.

263,Reading isn't the same anymore.,"tw(??)

Growing up I've always been an avid reader. I used to be able to read books for hours on end, sometimes even through the night. I was in a stressful household. I felt like I could project myself onto these characters and take on a new identity.
Recently though, with the stress of everything happening in the world, it feels like there's a barrier in my mind. 

My anxiety causes me to re-read each sentence obsessively even though i know i have read and understood it. Before i flip the page I have to make sure i know every single detail of what happened.  Sometimes it takes me hours just to complete a short chapter. It's frustrating! I just want to be able to visualise everything in my head again without troubles. 

It might seem really trivial but reading has always been a  huge part of my childhood. Now i have all these books around me but I don't know if I can start one again. I can't describe it. I really, really want to do it, but I just can't seem to. 

 I used it as a coping mechanism, but now even reading is not enjoyable anymore.",14,2020-05-14 22:49:17 EDT-0400

This might sound stupid but I think it‚Äôs beginning to affect my enjoyment of movies I usually love. For example, the first time I watched the LighthouseI I absolutely adored it, but there was always a voice saying ‚Äúdo you REALLY like this?‚Äù ‚Äúis it as good as you‚Äôre making it out to be?‚Äù as time went on this voice got louder and not only is it ruining my memory of the film but it‚Äôs affecting my enjoyment of more movies that I love. I should have my own solid opinion, right? And as I‚Äôm writing this, I realize that this sort of thing is happening in other parts of my life. I love performing (acting, singing, etc) but there is that same voice in my head that‚Äôs giving me doubt even though deep down it‚Äôs my life long dream to pursue it as a career.  It‚Äôs doing the same thing with my crush!

5. Fatigue
6. Chills
7. Annoying sensation when swallowing nothing

I have a history of being stressed/anxious but those past months it's like I only have physical symptoms. Does it happen to you too? It feel like I am in a loop of having shortness of breath because of anxiety which make me anxious and so on. Or maybe it is a accumulation of years of stress/anxiety which explode now?

279,I‚Äôm feeling so self conscious about my job,"My industry basically depends on events and businesses being open and needing advertising materials - so we all received a temporary layoff. It‚Äôs a small business so my boss is really struggling to make ends meet. He‚Äôs still been running the office for people who on the off chance do need materials. So when he gets these small orders he deals with most of it himself but sometimes he has to enlist someone to help out if it‚Äôs out of his wheelhouse. 

So far I believe I‚Äôve been one of the very few people he hasn‚Äôt asked for anything, even though I run a department. I don‚Äôt know why he wouldn‚Äôt be asking me questions or looping me in on what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm worried he won‚Äôt end up bringing me back on once we can open again. 

Before we left he said to everyone that since the economy will be shit after all this, he may only be able to bring back totally essential people at first until they get some money coming in so he can actually pay all of us. I just worry that he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm essential enough to bring back at all. It‚Äôs a really horrible feeling because I‚Äôve put a lot into this job and these people are like family. I‚Äôm hurt that it seems like everyone else has had to opportunity to help and prove their worth, whereas I haven‚Äôt gotten anything... I really don‚Äôt understand, because I‚Äôve asked them time and time again to let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can do at all, even off paper. I‚Äôve made it abundantly clear. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being insecure and reading too much into it because I‚Äôve literally only had time on my hands to obsess. I‚Äôve spoken to other close coworkers about it and they think that he‚Äôs just trying to bug as little people as possible and only enlisting who he absolutely needs to. I understand that my department isn‚Äôt a huge one and he can do most of what I do - it just makes me feel so insignificant. I don‚Äôt know if I did something wrong or if he just doesn‚Äôt like me... I‚Äôve reached out to him a few times and asked him if he needs anything and he hasn‚Äôt gotten back. So I don‚Äôt know what else to do. :(",2,2020-04-22 00:19:46 EDT-0400

285,How to help my partner?,"My partner has told me how they felt everyday and I really want to help, in any way. I don't know what it is exactly, so to look up information on it, I don't know what to look for. I know I am not in any position to make a diagnostic, but I am only looking for a way to get a little more information. So I am asking in this subreddit if anyone can identify with what he has told me and tell me something that you would like someone you love to do, or stop doing. (excuse my english by the way)

Here goes. He gets angry very easily, but always, always makes an effort to control agressivity. He is constantly thinking that he HAS to be the best in everything, better than everyone, and gets really irritated when someone who did the same as he did it better. He knows this, hides it, but can't control the feelling. This is present in every aspect of life: sex, work, and in conversations, he always turns it to himself, even when the other person sometimes has something important to say. He also rarely really listens to anybody. He know all this and hates it. It came to a point when I, while not yet knowing this, got a bit mad for some things and told him. A day after, he told me that after the conversation, he cried like he hadn't in years and was so angry at himself to the point of some mild (""mild"" depending on your experience) self-harm. ""I was almost about to spend the whole night kicking a tree outside."", he told me.

And this worries me, and I don't know how to get better information on the subject, because when I look up anxiety, it's not exactly what I find on websites. He is a nervous person, he is insecure and NEEDS to be the best, he NEEDS to stand out, and he gets angry easily because of the minor competitivity or annoyance. (I should note that we never had a fight, and on the very rare times he shouts he is immediately sorry). And when I look up 'anger', I feel it's also a bit off.

I should note as well that he suffered from anxiety as a kid because of bullying and when things get very very bad, he still has panick attacks, but hasn't had in around a year.

I don't know if this is relevant or not, but with me being a relatively calm person, when he gets irritated or angry I always switch to a really calm and slow voice and try to understand what he's feeling (doesn't mean I always succeed ahah).

I should also add that he feels like this is a core part of him and that it won't ever change (we're both only 19 though, but this is coming from someone who doesn't know what it feels like).

I really really want to help, and being in isolation isn't the best. So if anyone has some advice out there, it'd really be appreciated :)",5,2020-04-22 19:32:41 EDT-0400

I‚Äôve been silently coping with anxiety and depression the past year and a half or so. It‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs affecting me at work. I currently dread going to work and the anxiety leaves me feeling nauseous. On my days off I sleep/stay in my bed most of the day. I‚Äôve lost interest in trying to socialize (even through text. Obviously can‚Äôt physically be around friends right now). I‚Äôm irritable and left work last week crying because of how stressed and anxious I was. 

I have 0 clue where to begin. I assume I can still seek therapy even with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. I just don‚Äôt know where to begin. Do I talk to my primary care doctor first? 

I rarely have a day off nowadays and thinking about dealing with it on my days off makes me cringe but I know something needs to be done. I can‚Äôt feel like this any longer.",2,2020-04-27 19:11:13 EDT-0400

300,"My anxiety takes over and ruins so much for my relationships! My anxiety makes me defensive, emotional and guilty. These traits in me have caused so many issues with other people! I‚Äôve tried hard at being conscious of it because I seem so fake!","I‚Äôve since I can remember have been filled with anxiety and it‚Äôs no secret to my family or people who have known me for extended amount of time. I have always felt with this anxiety a lot of guilt which I don‚Äôt 100% understand because I could have never even thought of the thing I‚Äôm being blamed for and I‚Äôll react guilty because I‚Äôm so fucking nervous! I‚Äôll have a million ideas running through my head including how believable is it that I could do that thing! With this guilt comes a lot of defensiveness. I‚Äôm defensive with everyone but not always. Meaning it can happen at any time with anyone. I‚Äôve had many people discretely point this out to me. I have also asked a few people very close to me about these things and they simply responded yeah that‚Äôs just how you are. But I don‚Äôt want to be this way! It‚Äôs ruined so many great relationships for me! Including my current relationship with my boyfriends. I am a very emotional person and I have extreme anxiety now, not always in life it‚Äôs this extreme but at the moment it is. I have had a lot of my own issues in the past with anxiety depression bipolar whether it was me or a close relative or friend. My boyfriend has bipolar and i think I‚Äôm more than understanding about his emotions and swings. I know I have these problems but I don‚Äôt think he has the capacity to deal with mine all the time because of his. I truely want to seek out a way to find less guilt for myself! Because with him the situation is so classic. He will get paranoid and blame me for something he thinks could be going on or he thinks he saw happen. I then get overly anxious that he first off could even think this about me and then that he wants to blame me for something with no facts. He has done this so many time it makes me anxious just thinking about it but I think he was testing my responses to see if I still seem guilty. I always feel guilt. He sees me feel the guilt and he thinks I did what he said even if I tell him no. This trait is horrific. I cry so easily. I get overwhelmed very quick. It looks so bad to look guilty and then if someone questions me after I‚Äôve started crying and get emotional it comes off very defensive which doesn‚Äôt help me at all. I honestly feel like a weak fucking child every time this happens to me. But I‚Äôm so overwhelmed with thoughts that I can‚Äôt stop myself, I can‚Äôt calm myself down. It very uncomfortable and I‚Äôm hopeful someone here has some insight? I just hope I‚Äôm not doomed forever because if I didn‚Äôt have this issue things would have been so much better, and so different.",0,2020-11-22 07:48:27 EST-0500

304,I make scenarios about me dying,"I'm not sure if this belongs here but here is a summary for anybody who might read this
Last year i went into the highschool entrance exam . i   had to take anti-depressant pills for 6 months (then my mom said i didn't need them . I obliged to not worry her) i had several anxiety and panic attacks during school but didn't tell most of them to people not to worry them not that i have a lot of people to tell. We move often so often that i haven't lived in a place for more than 1.5 years so the friends i did have i left and now i am unable to make friends since i don't care enough. I am currently  going to a science highschool which consists of some of the smartest students in the country and makes me feel like an absolute  moron.


 I have realised that i think about my death alot during  the times that i am alone (which is a lot more than i could ever inagine) . I make these wierd scenarios  about me dying  how it would happen and what the people around  me  feel about it. The wierd thing is im ok with it . The only reason im not dead is because  i dont want the only people in this world who care about me sad . But im sure that in the next 4 years (until the university entrance exam) i will have attempted suicide at least once 
Im still not sure if this is me just wanting attention or me being suicidal. And this is probably  not anxiety but i don't care .sorry for blabbering

About 20mins in I started worrying because my heart rate wouldn't go down and I feel like the worrying made it worse. Then during my zoom meeting I couldn't stop shaking my legs, my hands/arms started to feel numb, and it was hard to breathe and I think that's when I started worrying I was going to have a heart attack. And I know it might sound dumb but I tried calming myself down by thinking if I have a heart attack mid zoom at least there's someone to call 911 for me. I also tried taking a lot of deep breaths and drink a lot of water but it got to the point I left mid meeting to the bathroom and wash my face and do jumping jacks (yeah sounds dumb but I was doing whatever google said to do). It lasted for over an hour but I was so scared it wasn't going to stop. I texted two friends how I was feeling prior and during but none of them suggested it was a panic attack and told me I was going to be okay so that thought never crossed my mind until I saw someone's post on facebook about symptoms of a panic attack. If I did have a panic attack, I never knew panic attacks were actually this scary because I literally thought I was going to die. Just wanted to put this out on the internet because I mentioned it to my friends and they sorta just brushed the topic over.

326,Finally serious about getting a driver's license at age 26,"I've had huge amounts of anxiety surrounding driving from a young age. Luckily I've never been involved in a traumatic accident but I've still had a big fear of it. I have actually driven in the past and could have based on my skill already received my license but it was so unpleasant and terrifying for me that I avoided it at all costs and took the bus etc. The thing I find so difficult about a fear of driving is that it simply is not an irrational fear. To be ""normal"" in this current age you actually have to have an abnormal lack of natural anxiety and an abnormally high level of unearned self confidence to properly cope with controlling deadly weapons capable of going as fast as they do with as many other drivers as there are. But it's just the reality of life that I've got to drive to survive (although there have been many days I would rather not have to deal with the responsibility of living) It actually makes sense in a way that they have young people whose brains aren't fully developed yet start driving - because if someone had a fully developed sense of consequences for their actions etc many people wouldn't ever drive let alone be excited about it or view it as some kind of fun right of passage. I guess one thing going for me is that I'm an incredibly safe and alert driver who takes the roll of driving a car very seriously but at the same time doing this at the age of 26 makes me feel kind of stunted and weird compared to others. Other than really basic stuff like ""deep breathing"" (the way I respond to abnormal amounts of anxiety is to actually breath a bit slower and kind of zone out to be honest so that whole deep breathing thing has never been useful for me anyway) does anyone have tips on how to feel more comfortable behind the wheel while starting out and before exposure therapy kicks in?",2,2020-08-04 07:15:45 EDT-0400

347,7 year old with anxiety related nausea and headaches. Help?,"Our 7 year old was on the receiving end of a minor bullying incident back in Feb and has since been struggling with almost continuous daily nausea and headaches. He was checked by multiple GP & hospital physicians for physical causes, but the diagnosis is that he's suffering from severe anxiety, depression, and possibly PTSD. His nausea and headache symptoms are strongest when he's preparing to go to school or at school, and weakest when he's away from school and distracted by activities.

More recently, he's had five cognitive behavioural therapy sessions with a psychologist, which has so far been unsuccessful. We've also tried physical exercise, and breathing, relaxation, and meditation exercises to no avail.

He was a regular happy boy before the bullying incident and we're increasingly desperate to get him back to how he used to be.

I am constantly thinking of my future/possible failures/not being good enough for my parents. I just hate how anti-social/shy I am and wonder why I have no friends to talk to about this. 

Whenever I‚Äôm anxious, I get a tight pressure (squeezing) on my skull and chest. After, I just keep crying as if I‚Äôve been holding in so much emotions. 

I guess I just need more support and need to ask if I should see a therapist for this? Are these symptoms of anxiety or something?",2,2020-08-01 07:40:55 EDT-0400

351,I‚Äôm crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict,"(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don‚Äôt have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don‚Äôt have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l‚Äôm scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l‚Äôm so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice!

It got to that point where I was annoyed with myself but couldn't turn it off. He was still there. Listening. Never upset. He just wanted to make sure I was okay and calming down.

354,It was my birthday yesterday and I spent most of the day crying and depressed but we can't give up.. or we lose the chance that things can get better..,"25 was a hard birthday for me. Reflecting on my life and where I'm at had me feeling really down. It seemed out of no where my mental health started making things that were once easy, very very hard. It's taken a toll on my self esteem. I'm starting over with everything. Myself, my home, my career, my education, my health, my relationships, nothing is the same. I've been battling bipolar depression, panic attacks, schizophrenia episodes, constant suicidal ideation and started 2020 in a mental hospital begging to just die. I've lost my identity in the process of everything. I've never been more scared. I'm trying medication again, I'm back in therapy and am having more good days. I'm working on reaching out more to people.  I'm thankful for those who made my quarantine birthday special. My mom made me a home made birthday cake with all my favorite things, my boyfriend had a paint night with me, my sister ordered me dinner to enjoy at home and the birthday wishes from everyone did not go unnoticed. I'm thankful to still be here, still trying, and still fighting & I'm thankful for those that haven't given up on me when I've given up on myself. Here's to 25 and the rest of my life. ü•≥üôèüèª",59,2020-04-14 05:36:16 EDT-0400

It‚Äôs like I wake up the day of with the false sense of expectation about ‚Äúmy special day‚Äù and then am terribly let down that it wasn‚Äôt made special. Does that make sense? I don‚Äôt want it to be special but still end up being let down. I hate it so much and wish it would just pass like any other day. I‚Äôm a grown ass adult and feel like a child because I would rather lay in bed all day than to expect people to make it special, then they try to make it special while just wishing they wouldn‚Äôt.

356,Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?,"If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode. I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who feels like this because this makes me feel kinda ashamed and dumb.",104,2020-04-12 22:56:56 EDT-0400
357,I just got through an anxiety/panic attack without Benzos for the first time in my life!,"So about 3 weeks ago I started getting these attacks that'd last 2-3 hours, and occur 3 times a day on average. I immediately started on Clonazepam because I just couldn't handle them, I even called 911 twice and ordered ambulances (I thought I was having heart attacks).

I quit the Clonazepam 4 days ago (after having used it for 2 1/2 weeks) since I don't want to become dependent on it. I've seen Benzo damage first hand (dad tried to kill himself, withdrew for about 2 years in total).

Today I woke up at 3AM and had a 3 hours panic attack and handled it like a boss. I deconstructed each symptom, tried to relax, did breathing exercises, put a Clonazepam pill on my table to assure myself (but I didn't take it).

358,Does anyone else feel like if they don't become/accomplish something grand and great in life there's no purpose?,"This keeps me up literally every single night. I'm so terribly afraid that if I don't become famous, successful, achieve something great that I will be a failure. I'm 28 this year. I have trouble sleeping every night knowing that I'm getting older and older and my best years are slipping away. I'm not even sure what I would be great at. I'm terrified of becoming old, settling down, and being forgotten. It's just not for me. I know it sounds egotistical, but I want to leave the world with something good. Or have a lasting impression on it. And not in just a small way. I'm abosolutely petrified that I will not.

It makes my heart race, it influences everything I do, it makes me lose sleep. And the worst part is, I don't even know how to make this dream a reality. I don't know what to channel all this energy into . 

I know we'll all be forgotten anyway and nothhing matters anyway, but it just doesn't sit well with me. I need to achieve something while I'm here. I just don't know what.

360,Scared for when quarantine ends,"I can‚Äôt stand the thought of quarantine ending- being forced to go back to school and into the world. I‚Äôm so content staying at home, is still have periods of feeling down but I feel so safe at home that it‚Äôs hard to explain. My mind has stopped telling me bad things and I‚Äôm so scared that when I see people again it will be unbearable. Online school is starting in a few days and that makes my chest a bit tight as I‚Äôm scared of being seen through a laptop and speaking on a laptop in front of everyone. I was getting to the point where I wanted to see a doctor because everyday was very hard and I was feeling so worthless and my head was Always telling me that people don‚Äôt like me and I‚Äôm not good enough and I should kill myself. I can‚Äôt believe that is over. I‚Äôm almost glad I didn‚Äôt kill myself because now I go outside to exercise every second day and its great. I‚Äôm scared when quarantine ends I won‚Äôt be able to stop myself from doing anything bad.

361,Please stay off the news,"I just got my results back from my COVID swabs.. and they were negative.

Now let‚Äôs go back a week,

I couldn‚Äôt breathe , I couldn‚Äôt take deep breaths and I was coughing.
I figured it‚Äôs just a cold.. back to my phone.

Things got worse. I got chills and aches and my breathing was getting more difficult. Hmm maybe the flu? Back to my phone.


Still couldn‚Äôt breathe , now sweating and coughing harder. Hearts racing and on the floor scared and crying because breathing becoming impossible.

I went and had a hot bath, drank hot tea , then went to bed .. where I had the worst night of my life .

I couldn‚Äôt sleep... I was up for 72 hours exhausted in cold sweats with breathing troubles . I finally called the nurses line and told them I was afraid I had Coronavirus.
We talked and they said to get to the hospital if I got worse , but to phone beforehand so they could prepare for me. 

My heart sunk and my symptoms got worse. I cried as my kids slept, positive this was the end... I didn‚Äôt want to kiss them and infect them, i kept leaving the room and taking deep breaths so I wouldn‚Äôt drop dead. I texted my family that I loved them and was sorry for everything I had ever done. 


I finally passed out , then woke up and immediately ran to the bathroom where I threw up . I hadn‚Äôt eaten in 2 days and still puked my guts out.
Chest still hurt, still having cold sweats and still coughing .. and now nauseated with a bad stomach. Maybe I won‚Äôt even make it to the hospital. 


I watched a cnn video of one of their reporters who was sick with covid. He showed some breathing Exercises  and said To put your arms around your head and to hold it there . I kept doing that over and over and felt better each time. 
Didn‚Äôt feel like I was dying as bad as a few nights before .

However each time I read the news my symptoms got worse and my panicking was like nothing I‚Äôve experienced before .. I took some medicine and I cried myself to sleep. I finally slept.. briefly . I then woke up and had a bunch of mucus come up my throat and I began choking on it ..
It wouldn‚Äôt stop coming up and my chest pains started up. 
They called me and my covid test was scheduled for the next day. 

I took some mucus cold medicine which seemed to help as I slept for the first time since this hell started.. and I woke up feeling good. No coughing .. no cold sweats... no puking. Chest was still tight but I slept and that‚Äôs just what I needed.

My test was at 1 and I was nervous , I pulled up and everyone was covered and masked up and I felt so alone.
They asked about my symptoms as well as if I had depression or anxiety... both of which I do. They checked my temperature, my blood pressure, my throat and swabbed my throat and both nostrils.

I said I didn‚Äôt sleep much and I was spending about 13 hours a day on the news.. mainly watching New York City and Italy.
The doctor stopped by and said DO NOT.. watch any news outside of where you live (our province) she said ‚Äúwatch/read only your province news as everything else will only make your anxiety worse than ever.. Just focus on keeping yourself and everyone around you safe. Keep washing your hands frequently and stay indoors and away from others.. and that includes your grandma‚Äù 
She is my grandmas doctor and knows how close we were. 

I went home and cleaned and for the first time .. stayed off international news. That was a few days ago and I have yet to go back on any... and I haven‚Äôt had a single anxiety attack since. All my symptoms besides chest pain went away... when I start to think about it again (like right now) they come back a bit .. so I‚Äôll turn a movie on and they go away.

So when I got my results I just thought wow
Anxiety is one of the scariest things... I truly thought I was going to die.

I know there‚Äôs a lot of scary horrible things going around our world right now , and I hope it is over soon, but watching the news 24/7 isn‚Äôt going to help anything especially if you are mentally ill like me.

The best thing we can do, is stay busy and stay safe and stay off the international news .

I just wanted to post this incase anyone was like me browsing here wondering if you have anxiety or if it‚Äôs covid...

Anxiety is a true evil and will make you think you have whatever it is you‚Äôre scared of. 
Deep breaths and put your focus elsewhere.. like a meditation app.

A new one that piles on top of everything else. To the point you ask your self, is this what takes me under?
Meds, self medication, meditation, therapy, and self reflection? What more do i need to try!? 
At some point i just need to come to terms with the fact that i let my anxiety control my life. 
Maybe one day ill get it. Maybe one day it will click and ill just stop being this way, but probably not.

Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.

379,I just don‚Äôt feel... right?,"
I‚Äôm a very anxious person and last month I was spiraling into panic attack after panic attack and didn‚Äôt have one moment of calm for weeks. I recently got on Lexapro to hopefully combat my anxiety, which it has. But I still feel... not right?

It‚Äôs the craziest feeling. I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. I‚Äôve been to the doctor so many times and gotten everything checked out completely, everything was healthy and normal. But I still feel like something is wrong.

It‚Äôs not even in moments of anxiety I feel this way. It‚Äôs every second of the day. I feel paranoid, like there is something wrong with me. I don‚Äôt feel like talking or getting up. I feel extremely tired and fatigued all of the time. I feel like everything around me is an illusion. I feel constant dread. Constantly paranoid that there is something wrong with me or that something is going to happen, that I‚Äôm all of a sudden just going to die, without warning. 

It‚Äôs the craziest feeling and I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs never going to go away. I just feel off and I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. I just want to sleep all of the time and I don‚Äôt like being around people. 

It‚Äôs like I constantly feel uneasy; wrong. Like there is just something not right going on inside my body and in my brain. It‚Äôs unsettling.

I‚Äôd be dozing off and jolt awake because it felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting enough air and I‚Äôd end up sitting up until 1-2am doing breathing exercises. I changed my allergy meds and took mucinex thinking it was from post nasal drip, tried coughing and trying to clear my throat but nothing worked. But then today happened. After contemplating going to the doctor to check for a blood clot because that‚Äôs what my mind jumped to, the panic attack finally arrived. I had to break out an emergency xanax to gain some control while I paced around the kitchen. It‚Äôs been a few hours and my breathing finally feels normal and I haven‚Äôt felt lightheaded since taking the pill. Its like it never happened! It‚Äôs so crazy what stress and anxiety can do to the body. I was so ready to go to the hospital thinking I was about to have a heart attack!

Or it can be a scenario of something I‚Äôm afraid will happen one day when I‚Äôm catastrophizing and I act out how I would want myself to act my because I distrust my my inarticulate speech when overthinking. I can do this when pacing around in circles and what not and I have this weird tick where I blink aggressively, especially when looking at lights for some reason, but it calms me down. When I was younger I had silly impulses like walking backwards and counting steps to the number 8. Me being a Lunatic basically :/ . I only feel crazy when I‚Äôm alone and if someone were to walk in, I‚Äôd be perfectly normal but the stress from trying to act normal around others builds up on me and worsen my issues when I‚Äôm alone and leads to a meltdown where I might irrationally break stuff, cry, or hit my self for no reason at all other than everything....literally everything makes me anxious. Especially existing. I‚Äôve managed to keep these explosions private and only my mother has seen it happen but I feel so much suppressed rage towards my life including my past that sometimes I worry that the wrong person will say the wrong thing at the wrong time and it won‚Äôt be pretty. My fantasies get pretty violent when I‚Äôm ticked off and I image a lot of things that I know I would never do. I feel like I sounds crazy just talking about this and I think something might be wrong with me. Does anyone have any suggestions and or similar experiences???",4,2020-12-05 00:50:06 EST-0500

386,Extreme fear of cancer,"I overall have a pretty intense fear of aging and death, but the thought of cancer often keeps me up at night.  The fact that almost 50% of all people will have cancer at some point in their lives, the fact that although I‚Äôm still young, time is only a temporary buffer used to comfort myself from the impending statistics stacking against me.  It terrifies me that cancer can live and grow inside the body for years until it reaches late, possibly untreatable stages, and then kill me in a matter of months.  I always try to think positive and imagine myself living a long happy life well into my 80‚Äôs.  But it seems like the world and nature are just so against that statistically.  

Does anyone have tips on how they keep themselves from thinking so much about this?  And if there is a better way to not be so anxious about this without simply ignoring it?",6,2020-12-05 09:52:43 EST-0500

Its nothing I can do something about or change until January at least and then I might not be able too. Its not life or death, but I guess in my head it becomes that because of the way I feel about myself and the way I perceive the world to be a dangerous, threatening place where if I step outside I will be attacked  ridiculed, hurt, surrounded, suffocated, shouted at, laughed at. I am beating myself up about it and then beating myself up about getting myself into such a state over insignificant things and annoyed at myself and feel a sense of hopelessness about how these things don't improve for me no matter how much effort I put in or how much work I do or how hard I push myself. Why am I like this, why cant i change (asking these things of myself). I wish i could just cope the way other people do.

Today my kid who works with me brought me two sausage egg biscuts for breakfast. I couldn't eat both and offered one to my coworker, in part because I know my boss is often concerned about his weight. He was probably just messing with me but he came out, jokingly made a comment that I didn't bring enough for everyone, and then saw my coworker with it and said ""Shit, he got one!""

There was this guy that I really liked for a long time and he asked me once if we could fuck when I was giving him head and I said no. I kind of wanted to but I get too scared and can't go through with it. I mean I want to have sex but I'm scared it will hurt or I'll get pregnant and they'll leave me.

401,I get so anxious if im stuck at home. Everything I try and do to occupy my time is a trigger I feel so overwhelmed and hopeless.,"I find when im stuck at home all day, thats when my anxiety and depression act up. I try and do things to pass the time and occupy my mind, but it seems like everything I do just doesn't bring any enjoyment to me, or worse, they, for some reason, become triggers. For example, im sick now, and ive been stuck at home since saturday. I've been trying to watch tv or movies, but everything I try watching, it's like it triggers my anxiety. It's almost like everything on tv, every movie, holds a triggering memory, which im not even sure exists. There isn't really anything else to do, because my depression makes everything boring and unenjoyable. So I just stay in bed, try and find *something* which will bring enjoyment, but nothing does. So then I feel stuck, with nothing to do. Which brings about even more anxiety (the feeling of being stuck or trapped makes my anxiety skyrocket). It's like depression has robbed me of enjoyment of things, and the inactivity makes me anxious. Of course, when im not sick etc, I go to the gym, or just try and go out, but when im sick, or stuck at home, theres nothing I can really do.

I feel so hopeless. I've already sought help, but I feel like im not getting enough support. I also struggle with brain fog and stuff, and find it really difficult to explain what im feeling, even to myself. Im seeing a therapist, and am medicated (Cipralex and Wellbutrin). But every therapy session, I feel like I have way too much to get out of my head, that by the time im done talking, my time is up. I really feel like I can't be alone in this. I'd be open to support groups, but the ones ive found are either too costly, or im just nervous that all the talk of anxiety and stuff might trigger me. My body and mind feel so tense, and nothing i've tried doing can release it. I can't cry, even though I really want to. This anxiety has taken over my life. I'm 31, and had to move back in with my parents because living on my own was too much for my mental health. I'm working a shitty retail job because I don't enjoy anything, and anything i've thought about doing is too risky (i've always wanted to be a pilot, but I know i'll have an anxiety attack while in the air). Everything has been ground down to a halt.",1,2020-01-28 21:02:12 EST-0500
402,My anxiety is going to ruin something amazing,"So I am a female who is 22 and my boyfriend is 20.
We have been dating a month.

So, I just started dating him . I talked to him a whileeeee before we started dating though and I love him to death. However, my anxiety is really bad and all I do is sit in my head and think about things like, does he really love me? Or if he doesn‚Äôt respond for a few hours I wonder if he‚Äôs tired of me? I wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm annoying because of my anxiety too. I have tried to talk to him about it and I know most normal people worry about things like this, but these thoughts just consume me sometimes. 

He reassures me every time and tells me he loves me, but it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know. And he‚Äôs reassured me multiple times but at this point I don‚Äôt talk to him about it anymore because I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll get tired of reassuring me for the same things over and over and that he won‚Äôt love me anymore üò•. So not talking to him about it also increases the anxiety I have. I believe he loves me, I really do. I‚Äôm just, I don‚Äôt know...worried he just suddenly won‚Äôt? Or that one day he‚Äôll just stop? 

I literally love him so much. He‚Äôs my person. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the guy I‚Äôm supposed to be with for the rest of my life. But I don‚Äôt want my anxiety to ruin it, or to ruin my experience with him. I want to be present in the relationship and not worrying but I can‚Äôt make it stop and I want nothing more than to stay with him for a very long time. I don‚Äôt really know what to do at this point. I don‚Äôt want to come off clingy or needy but it‚Äôs like everything I do reminds me of him. I hear a funny joke and I‚Äôm like , oh! I have to tell him. Or I‚Äôm simply washing dishes and I remember a memory of us washing dishes together. It‚Äôs like even the little things. Everything. And on top of that, he has a new job working on a boat where he works for a month and then comes home for two weeks and then goes back for another month etc. and he starts Monday. I‚Äôm extremely stressed about that situation as well I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll realize he doesn‚Äôt want me or he‚Äôll enjoy being away from me.  But he assured me that he wants nothing more than to spend time with me and that he isn‚Äôt going anywhere. But I still and so worried. I know this was kind of everywhere but PLEASE tell me what to do. I can not lose him. He really is my person.

What do I do? I‚Äôm seriously at a loss as to how to go about handling this. I don‚Äôt want to be too needy and clingy by talking about my worries and how they consume me, but I feel like it‚Äôs something I should talk about, but it happens so often I don‚Äôt want to bring it up all of the time. It‚Äôs so lonely though not being able to talk about it every time. Then I‚Äôm just stuck in my head alone, and that‚Äôs almost worse. 

TL: my anxiety is consuming me with thoughts I can‚Äôt stop about my relationship. I‚Äôm finally happy for once and I don‚Äôt want to lose this guy. He is my person. I don‚Äôt know what to do",3,2020-01-26 09:17:32 EST-0500

421,"Sudden anxiety, especially while driving.","I moved across the country about seven months ago, and since then I've been a way less confident driver and it gets worse every time i drive. Starting about two months ago it has gotten to a point where it's starting to impact my life. I now walk to work every day. Doesnt matter if it's cold or raining really hard, I walk there and back every day. Luckily it's only about two miles. 

The biggest problem, though, is when I have to drive my wife to work on my two days off each week. She works 30 minutes away and I have to drive through the city (the most anxious part of the drive). I get super paranoid and have thoughts like, 

""what if I don't see a pedestrian?"" 
""what if I accidentally run a red light?"" 
""Did I just run that stop sign?""

First off all, thank you for reading this. I will try to keep this as short as possible...

Im currently 26 years old, and have struggled with depression for roughly 10 years. My depression have come and gone as the years have gone by, but at my roughest point I planned to take my own life. Luckly my family and friends notice that something was wrong and ""helped"" me out of it.

I have been very down lately and I have started to do something VERY strange, so strange that I have no clue whats going on here and Im kind of scared. I often don't sleep in my bed anymore, instead i sleep on the floor or in the bathroom (!)(?) - And I don't know why. I brush my teeths and I don't feel comfortable to go and sleep in my bed.

430,Looking for some input on a novel I'm writing,"Hey everyone,

I'm   in the planning stages of a novel I'm writing (currently doing   research) and thought it would be a good idea to get some input from people who have dealt with anxiety.

The basic elevator   pitch of my book is that a guy suffers from a really bad concussion   after drinking with his buddies, and the concussion just isn't healing.   His whole life starts to change, and as a result he's sent into a   hopeless depression and develops severe health anxiety. However, he   falls in love with a girl with cystic fibrosis and must contend with his   nihilism/pessimistic tendencies over having chronic health problems,   while his girlfriend is able to stay optimistic despite having a   terminal illness. I'm trying to make it a meditation on the paradox of   people with anxiety and chronic problems who can't escape their   suffering despite still having their whole lives ahead of them, while   others can remain positive even in the face of death.

The   book is very much inspired by my own experiences with concussion and   anxiety, as well as knowing someone personally who has cystic fibrosis.   I'm not trying to give an account of my story, but rather use my own   experiences to tell a compelling/impactful story.

So,   I guess the first question I should ask is the most brutal one: is  this  a book concept that anyone would ever have an actual interest in   reading? I'm enraptured by it, but I've worried that it's for such a   niche audience that it might not have much widespread appeal.

Secondly,   for anyone that has read any kind of similar stories, what advice do   you have for me? What are some things that you've seen books like this   do really right and really wrong? What are some staples that a book like   this needs, and some cliches that it needs to avoid?

Finally,   for anyone that has any of the conditions that the book is about, how   would you want to see it portrayed in a book? Have there been any other   standout representations (good or bad) in any other book/movie/etc?  What  are some experiences or feelings you've had that you'd like to see   covered or represented in a book like this?

Thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this and respond. Any input or advice is greatly appreciated.",1,2020-03-18 23:30:35 EDT-0400

I was already quarantined long before the government asked us to do so. I self-quarantined because the world scared me. After 15 months of exposure therapy I feel better than I ever have.

I've been diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety years ago. I recently got back into therapy after a while. I speaking with a younger guy that's a therapist/counselor. He asked me what I look to gain from therapy. I told him that I honestly didn't know, I've been through therapy before and learned certain skills. This first session was mainly just me talking and explaining and he didn't say much. He said the next appointment will go over a treatment plan. 

What should I look to gain from therapy ?. Maybe I expect this to solve my problems but honestly I don't know.

I'm at Uni but ive been in a pretty challenging mental state for around a year, been pretty depressive and always showed signs of anxiety but never been diagnosed. Only now do I realise how bad my symptoms are, the last few days have been some of the hardest days of my life, as I feel like I've been in denial for over a year about my condition and the sudden realisation has been overwhelming. I came home from Uni yesterday to take time at home to relax, im going to start therapy, begin excersising again, im going for countryside walks every day, im feeling positive while also really wanting this headache to clear. I'm not sure where my journey will take me or how long it will take but I'm moving in the right direction already.
 I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, I guess I want something to look back during my journey to remind me where I came from, might make a thought diary or some kind of online thought blog, if anyone has ideas of where I can do this best let me know sorry for the random post üòÇ",2,2020-03-17 03:10:14 EDT-0400

451,I'm so scared of going back to work,"I've always been an anxious person, but it has started getting worse earlier this year (April). I started getting panic attacks almost daily, some extremely violent and scary. It's forced me to work from home since then.
I've been going to therapy and I've been prescribed Xanax for my panic attacks. I've made great progress: at first, I couldn't get out of my house, but recently, I went on a ten days vacation.
But recently, my boss kept pressuring me, so I told my doctor I felt ready to go back to work. I actually kinda felt ready. I was still having attacks, but that was nothing compared to earlier.
Ever since I've made that decision, everything's gone to shit. The panic is back. I lost my appetite (again).

I have to go back to work tomorrow. I do not feel ready at all anymore. I'm so fucking scared I can't stop crying. I just want to call in sick, but I'm scared of what my boss and colleagues will think (I know I shouldn't care), and I'm scared that I could actually be fine and that I'm just exaggerating to convince myself to skip work. I just want to stop being an adult for some time and stay home to relax.

I don't know what to do. Just wish they would let me keep working from home, but that's a big no-no for them.

455,Is anyone else also super nervous and anxious in the morning?,"First of quick summary of me. I was in therapy for the last two months and have a break now. Therapy starts again next week but for now I'm by myself.
I got a diagnosis and anxiety certainly is a Symptome. I always tend to overthink, but what I've noticed is that my problems are always worse in the morning. Plus occasional anxiety attacks at any given time of the day. But as I said right when I wake up I am ALWAYS anxious.

It's not that I've got anything to do that day. In fact I got nothing to do for weeks now. No work, no school. But when I wake up I suddenly get anxious for no reason. My heart starts pounding, I can't think straight and I certainly can't think rationally anymore. I seriously get afraid of everything I can think about. I once panicked because I just thought about how I bought my pc a few years ago. I was lying there like ""oh my God you spent x amount of money on the PC"" even though I never regretted buying it for a single second in my life. I also tend to worry about relationships, day structure, completely neutral things I did in the past and so on. Everything I can imagine makes me afraid in some way. These were just a few examples on how absurd my anxietys can get.

The ice bucket is half water, frozen pizza are soft, cardboard boxes are soggy from water. I immediately took out my phone and ran a diagnostic, said it was ALL good, no problems.  My thought it‚Äôs probably on a standard defrost cycle. But the strange fan noise from the back is worried me. I then got out the manual from the draw and called the help line. Because of CV, I‚Äôm  on hold for over an hour with no one answering after talking to someone initially for 5 minutes. I hang up and ponder what will I do if the fridge is truly broken. There not an exorbitant amount of food but enough that it would be a waste and loss to lose it to spoilage.

I'm super anxious with the days leading up to when I'm supposed to leave, and sometimes go as far as to cancel my trip. I have general anxiety on a day to day basis, but whenever I leave for extended periods it just exacerbates it that much more. The things I get anxious about range from semi-plausible to full on ridiculous (ex: ""He's going to have so much fun without me around (fear of missing out)"" ""He's going to cheat on me"" ""I'm going to get into an accident/something bad will happen to him"" ""He's letting me use his car, is he enabling me so he can do something bad??""). I find myself checking social media, seeing if he's online more often too as a way to ""stay connected"" (even if I don't message him).

I have a trip planned to see my dad for the long weekend coming up. I've been mulling it over for the last few days and almost at the point of looking for excuses to not go and stay home (""Oh it might rain!"").

489,Anxiety increasing/harder to control,"Good morning!

In the past few weeks my anxiety is at an all time high.  I feel like I'm shutting down/losing control even though I know what's triggering my anxiety. 

 I'm taking steps to help it, talking to my husband about it,  finding a therapist, meditation, exercising more, eating better, little to no alcohol consumption and I still feel sad and anxious.  I've been trying to shake this and I can't.  

Of course the thought of medication crossed my mind but I keep telling myself no. I have been on them before and I felt brain fog, low sex drive, and just drugged by Zoloft or whatever it was.  

Anxiety feels like butterflies in my stomach, sprialing thoughts, worry, always saying I'm sorry for whatever reason even though I don't need to, sensitive, over thinking, etc

Does anyone else feel this way? How did you help yourself?   Feel free to vent or post your insight, I'm sure it will help of us!",2,2020-01-17 18:25:57 EST-0500

498,Walking is my release [TW - anxiety attack],"Hey, I wanted to share my experience of how walking helped me out of an anxiety spiral in the hopes that it'll be at least relatable for some of you.

Today was - an interesting day. A lot of very stressful things, related to my biggest trigger - friendships falling apart - happened at once. I held it together until I got home, but then I started shaking. I was on the verge of a panic attack, on the verge of freezing up and losing control.

So I turned around and walked right out the door. As fast as I could. Focusing on breathing and the path ahead of me. I walked faster than all the people ahead of me, and that was something I could focus on - weaving my way around people, crossing the road to avoid them, zigzagging from side to side of the pavement so I wouldn't cross the path of people walking the opposite direction.

I must've looked insane. Moments like this remind me why there's a stigma around a mental illness - it's so hard to understand the way people act unless you've been where I was and know how desperate I was to avoid people and feel safe.

So I kept walking. Heart pounding in my chest. Striding past people just looking forward to get home when I was trying to do the opposite, trying to push my fear into my muscles and find a home in the rhythm of feet placed one in front of the other, trying to block out the honk of horns and people chattering. 

The most insidious part of anxiety is it places you apart from the world, makes you feel as if every car is a threat, every man has a knife. But if I can control the movement of my feet, the speed, I can start to regain control of my world. Very slowly, I started to come back to the present. Heart beating, but out of exercise, not terror. I am here. I am present.",2,2020-01-18 00:24:53 EST-0500
499,Had a suicide attempt a few years ago. Stable since then. Worried if my life is ruined.,"So in May of 2017, I attempted to end my life and was hospitalized at a psych facility at a hospital for about three days. I got an increase for my antidepressant and was prescribed a mood stabilizer.

About two and a half years later, my PA is in the process of tapering me off these medications and I am worried about what's to come. Some medical professionals said that I may be doomed for a relapse, others say that everything should go back to normal once I am off the meds for a few months, and some say that I may have permanent side effects.

I am honestly concerned about my health but so far the loved ones in my life are too busy or too distracted with their own problems to focus on my own. Right now, I am just on the fluoxetine 10 mg and my PA should stop it I'm about two weeks.

So is my life ruined?",6,2020-01-18 00:36:24 EST-0500

And then I come home and get on my phone and see ads such as ""They turned OCD into a game"", and of course,  the ad is about organization and perfectionism. These kinds of things really hurt. I know these things can be expierienced by some people with OCD, but it is a very small percentage.

I don't have actual reasons but probably the following ones.

1. I saw a post about someone's death
2. I have a lot of work to do, still, I'm wasting time.
3. As I said before, My parent's were talking on the phone ( In my country people really talk loud at home and phone )

I tried listening to music. It works but I was way too anxious, so It didn't work!

So, as many people do, my bf watches porn. Obviously when I'm not at home. And a year ago, I was sorta okay with it  (It's not like I can do anything about it, and I didn't want to be the strict and possesive gf, so I tried to accept it) But over the year I've become more anxious.. 
I also by accident discovered his search history regarding the topic..  and the things he searched...... 
I am nothing like those things. Polar opposite to be exact. And also stuff that I know he likes or would like to try, but that I've said no to. 
And ever since I've had stomach aches, a feeling like a stick through my heart everytime he jokes about his porn searches. I've been thinking that I'm not good enough for him since I could never give or be those things. 
We've been together for almost 2 years, but still.. I've cried myself to sleep about not feeling good enough for him and being afraid of losing him to someone who could be like/give that...

541,"How to ""let anxiety run its course,"" and what does that mean?","*(Sorry this ended up being so long, much appreciation to those who read it!)* Hey everyone, I have moderate health anxiety that periodically flares up whenever I experience something even remotely in the same area as something I worry about. For instance, I got a small surgical procedure on my tailbone a over half a year ago and was doing really well with it until I noticed a tiny little bump that appeared to be an ingrown hair. I simply tweezed it out and that was it, but my worries about it and what it means for my problem potentially recurring have run amok. Despite completely trusting my surgeon and going to about 5 follow ups and him telling me everything looks all healed and that I shouldn't be overly worried about recurrence, I find myself having a tiny ingrown hair and a tiny bump erasing months of my psychological and emotional progress.

Upon reading about health anxiety on psychology sites, I came across [this](https://psychcentral.com/blog/hyper-worried-about-your-health-3-tips-to-help/) incredibly helpful article. It all makes sense to me, especially in terms of seeking reassurance about my symptoms and my position online. That's only temporary and simply perpetuates the problem. This I understand. But does anyone have any advice in terms of letting my anxious thoughts and feelings ""run their course""? This is what I am having trouble understanding. As I'm sure many can relate, I have an extremely difficult time putting these thoughts out of my head. I go watch a movie to distract myself, in the back of my stupid head I think ""Well those actors don't have to worry about a \_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert whatever health concern I currently have on my mind)."" It is completely irrational and yet I don't know how to deal with that. It's also all the more unusual because reasonably, I know its not a big deal. Even the absolute worst case scenario (such as, with this current issue, needing to go through the procedure again), isn't even that bad. I liked my surgeon. He also told me there's nothing to worry about. And I do believe him. But for some reason, I can't seem to let it go, and I certainly don't know how to or what ""letting it run its course"" means. If anyone has any tips or advice in this regard, I'd be very grateful!",4,2020-07-14 21:25:46 EDT-0400

I feel like I have extra weight on my shoulders like everybody else has, BUT in my situation I cant just take the weight off and be done for the day. I am constantly living in the future it feels like. I worry about stuff that is in the near future, in 2 years or even in like 10 years. I will push through tho.

545,Day after drinking.,"I feel tons of anxiety and guilty feeling after spending a fantastic night drinking with my friends. 

Yesterday we celebrated my friend's birthday in the beach, we drank, we laugh until no more, we played some drinking games... 

I don't know why, but this always happens to me after a night drinking that i regret about a stupid comments that i told (just silly comments being drunk without harm anyone) and this kind of things. I feel anxiety for no reason, i just want stay calm after this meeting and don't not remember all I did, and blame myself without sense. 

I feel so stupid, does this happen to you too?",19,2020-07-09 19:23:51 EDT-0400
546,Constantly scared of losing friends bc of anxiety but that's the reason they left,"I don't like making hundreds of friends. I make friends after I make sure we can potentially become close friends so I always only have one or two best friends and no one else

I constantly worry that I'm not worthy and I overthink everything, thinking that I mess up all the time. When I mess up, I just send them a lot of messages because I feel like I need to explain the truth and say how much I value and care for them and beg them not to leave because I always lean on my best friend

That always scares them off cause it's annoying to receive so many of these messages. Nonetheless, I still send them because I can't reduce my self hatred and my low self worth.  
I already lost a few best friends the same way and it's all my fault. I have my mental illnesses to blame but at the end of the day, it was me who texted them

It eventually became a trigger of my depression and I just want to end my life because I don't deserve to be loved and I screw up every single thing in my life",8,2020-07-14 19:19:28 EDT-0400

548,My anxiety isn‚Äôt ‚Äòenough‚Äô,"I went to my physical a few weeks ago (20F) feeling brave enough to talk about my anxiety, which I feel like has been getting worse.

I‚Äôm not diagnosed with any type of anxiety  currently, but my intention was to talk about it with the doctor. To me, the level of anxiety (+the things that come with it) I feel surpasses the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù meter.

Something important to note is usually when I go here I don‚Äôt see my primary care doctor, as he‚Äôs male and I‚Äôm just more comfortable around the female doctors/NP‚Äôs for my own reasons so I usually see the same 2-3 women every time I come but this time I had one I hadn‚Äôt seen. She isn‚Äôt a new doctor but I think she was fairly new to the office.


I had mentioned my anxiety to a different doctor here the previous year and I mentioned to her it‚Äôs the main reason I don‚Äôt drive‚Äî driving gives me a huge amount of anxiety. I don‚Äôt remember if I specifically mentioned this to the current doctor I had seen.


Fast forward to the Dr‚Äôs appt and it comes to the ‚Äútalking‚Äù portion and even though it‚Äôs weeks later thinking back on it I feel like I did a horrible job at trying to describe my anxiety properly to her which resulted in her basically giving me an informational packet about it that she thinks will help with most of it. 


It basically had things like breathing exercises (which I already knew), to avoid drugs and alcohol because they‚Äôll worsen the symptoms, and things like that. Even though this is the second time I‚Äôve brought it up to a doctor there it felt like she said my anxiety isn‚Äôt ‚Äòenough‚Äô to really need to do anything and that a certain amount of anxiety is a good thing.


Now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs my fault because I did awful just explaining how I feel but it‚Äôs because even bringing up anxiety to my doctor made me anxious, even just going to the doctor!


I tried to explain how I often had been getting a huge sense of dread when everything is perfectly content, or how Id get a lot of anxiety before work too. She asked if it‚Äôs ever stopped me from going to work and I said no because it hasn‚Äôt- even on my worst days when I‚Äôm crying up until right before work I still force myself to go even when my mind feels awful. However in person I really wasnt able to elaborate that, all I said was I just push through it usually and go to work. 

I also told her the overthinking keeps me up at night because my mind just won‚Äôt stop, for this she mentioned melatonin (which I do take occasionally). At this point though I smoke some weed/eat an edible to help me sleep and be calm at night.


The thing is don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal to have to wake up and automatically feel anxious with a tight chest and no desire to get up because doing anything may give me that anxious feeling where my mind won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm a homebody anyways and with the pandemic it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs much reason to leave your house besides work (for some), but generally even when there isn‚Äôt a pandemic I don‚Äôt like to go out besides with my really close friends.


Another thing that gives me a lot of anxiety is social interactions, before any social interaction with cashiers, etc, I‚Äôm always extremely nervous. This part of my anxiety I feel like I‚Äôve helped myself with as usually it‚Äôll be fine if I rehearse what to say in my head, make sure I have the exact money out because I don‚Äôt want to fumble, etc. but strangers *still* give me a lot of apprehension and don‚Äôt even get me started on what phone calls do to me.


At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do, I feel like I tried to get some help to improve myself and it failed. It‚Äôs already hard enough for me to express my feelings as it is so I guess I‚Äôm just feeling pretty bummed and decided to come on here and just vent.

I‚Äôd love to see what you guys think, if you have any advice or experiences yourself it‚Äôd be deeply appreciated. 

*also, sorry for any typos or if this post is just everywhere, I‚Äôm kind‚Äôve stressed at the moment and on mobile*",5,2020-07-14 19:04:12 EDT-0400
549,Hello ! Got my tests done.,"Had/Have Left arm pain, burping, Jaw pain. Chest pain come and go. Tingling in arms and sometimes fingers. Anxiety abiut heart rate and heart issues.
Neck stiffness. I do attribute alot of these to my already anxious mind and long sitting laptop work and weird postures. Random shortness of breath and shallow breaths aswell. 


But for the peace of mind got an ECG done. Came out perfectly normal. BP 126/83. Pulse was 95. Spo2 99. Sooo I am feeling a bit relaxed. Also doctor mentioned that a pain in arm that has been there for months wouldn't be related to heart and leans towards posture related issues.

552,Tired of doctors making me feel guilty/ashamed of using Xanax,"I just need to blow off some steam on this. 

I have GAD and CPTSD and have tried pretty much everything medication wise with not much luck (got serotonin syndrome from Cymbalta once), and the constant trauma of medications making things worse for me made my therapist suggest I take a break to reset and recenter. 

The one thing I have as a safety net that DOES WORK when I am in severe crisis is Xanax. CBT has helped me manage my triggers and has been insanely helpful, but I still have sudden intense flashbacks, nightmares, or times where CBT techniques fail. And so, I use a Xanax, and I‚Äôm able to work through whatever I need to work through. It works, it helps, and I only use it when I absolutely need to. 

EVEN SO every. Single. Time. I see a doctor or have to refill the Xanax Rx, they make me feel like sh*t for even using it in the first place. They lecture me on how I shouldn‚Äôt depend on it, how it‚Äôs harmful, etc and it makes my anxiety skyrocket. Once, it even prolonged a panic attack because I was terrified of using Xanax even though I absolutely should have. 

I KNOW not to abuse it; I KNOW it‚Äôs not a long term solution and I‚Äôm not trying to make it one. But it legitimately helps me when I need help in between me finding an alternative. Stop making me feel like an asshole for using something that helps me.

(Want to make it clear I‚Äôm not bashing on SSRIs/SNRIs; they are wonderful for so many people. I just don‚Äôt respond well to them).",13,2020-02-23 23:42:03 EST-0500

I made some stupid dissions the last 5 years but it's so hard for me to let it go. My birthday was the other day and it was so hard only seeing my grandfather's name signed on the card.

573,I found something that is working!!!!,"Disclaimer: Not a doctor and not saying this will work for everyone, but it's really helping me!

So a while back I was taking something called NAC (N-acetylcysteine). There is lots of research about it, so look into it if you're curious. Anyways, back when I was taking it, I thought it was helping, but I ran out and forgot to buy more and life went on. Anyways, my anxiety has been out of control since this fall. Probably the worst it's been in my life. I don't want to drive, I feel anxious in any social situation, I can't go to church at all, anymore... doing basic things like showering and housework felt completely overwhelming to me. You get the idea.

Anyways, my husband reminded me that we both used to feel better when we were taking it, so I started taking it. I have to say that I have been more productive in the week since I started taking it than I have in months. I'm caught up on laundry, I'm working on some house renovations, and I feel happy and calm.

578,I took an appointment today to talk about my anxiety!,"Hi!
I suffer from some sort of anxiety since I'm young. I still remember panic attack from when I was 7 or 8 years old over some silly stuff

I always kinda (with lot's of difficulty) took care of it by myself. I spent mostly all my puberty self harming, then, succeed to stop to move on anorexia with the single goal than to hurt myself.
I used to have panic attacks every single day on my last months of high school, even if I remember of this period as a happy time. 

I always ""fixed"" my self alone. And I was mostly OK. Still some panic attacks, but mostly because of some trigger (emetophilia mostly) 

But the last few weeks, I started to have this anxiety feeling coming again strong, not just the occasional panic attacks.
In between few personal issues + covid, there are all reasons for, but I decided ""no more, not alone, not again"".

I took an appointment with my GP for advice on who/where to go to start a therapy or something like that.

It's something so small, but it took me 20 years, since my first memory of anxiety issue, just to do it.

Next step will be to actually follow her guidelines, but I'm already proud of myself",3,2020-08-18 00:28:38 EDT-0400
579,Overwhelmed By My Need To Be Liked,"I‚Äôm sure this has been asked plenty of times before, but I‚Äôve not been able to find anything and could really use the suggestions/advice. I‚Äôm sorry if this is a bit of a lengthy post, I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as I can. 

Basically, as the title says, my anxiety causes me to care way too much about what people think of me and it‚Äôs really negatively impacting on me and my life. I am almost obsessed with needing people to like me and cannot stand the thought that someone might not. This isn‚Äôt limited to friends, family and/or acquaintances either, this includes people I‚Äôve had barely any contact with and people who aren‚Äôt in my life anymore. I know it‚Äôs irrational and that not everyone is going to like me, but when I come across people who don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt bare it; it causes me such extreme levels of anxiety and upset and massively ruins my self-esteem. I know that, to some degree, it‚Äôs normal to feel a bit hurt/put out if someone doesn‚Äôt like us, but the way it effects me is just not normal and it‚Äôs hugely impacting on my life. It‚Äôs exhausting and has gotten to the point where I feel like I have to prove myself to everyone around me. I‚Äôm not sure how common these feelings are with anxiety, but if anyone has ever experienced anything like it, I could really use some suggestions on how to break these thought habits and reduce (even to a small degree) my need to be liked. I have tried counselling and CBT but, unfortunately, these have not helped this issue and so I‚Äôm hoping someone might‚Äôve found something else useful? Any advice would be really appreciated or even just the acknowledgment that this is something someone else has been through because I feel so alone with this and unable to talk to anyone I know about it...again, due to my need to be liked/seen in a certain way.",5,2020-08-18 03:04:52 EDT-0400

591,I feel like my life is ending.,"I‚Äôm a 26 years old male and my life has no meaning to me. I‚Äôm an infantry veteran of Afghanistan and I was medically retired from the army for depression, anxiety, and suicidal idealization. I went to school to become an electrician and after working in the field for a while, I found that the work negatively affects my already poor mental health. I‚Äôm currently working in retail but I feel like it‚Äôs a dead end. I can‚Äôt leave it because of my spotty job history because I worked with three different employers within a year before my current job, and I still need a job to support myself. I‚Äôve thought of going back to school but COVID is going to prevent that to a point and I feel obligated to stay in the electrical field rather than pursue a different education. And I honestly don‚Äôt know what career to pursue because I just think I‚Äôm not good enough.

What makes it worse is that I feel like I‚Äôve missed out on a crucial point in life: dating. I didn‚Äôt date in high school because I was focused on my future in the army. And in the end I feel that women would be put off by a guy who hasn‚Äôt had a serious relationship before and would walk away.

596,I‚Äôm going into 6th form and I don‚Äôt know if my bullies will be there and I‚Äôm stressing out,"TL;DR The people who made me try to end my life are most likely coming to my school and just the anxiety alone is tearing me apart. I need any help/ advice you can give.

Just for a bit of background, these are horrible people and drove me to attempt suicide a couple years ago, which opened the door for me to improve and get support. I moved schools and I‚Äôve come a long way, but I‚Äôm really terrified because that was upper school and my new school has the most popular sixth form in our area, so there is a high chance at least one of them will be coming to my school. Furthermore, we will likely be travelling on the same bus if they do, and because of COVID our entire year will be in the same building, so I‚Äôll likely see them often.

If/ when I bump into them I want them to see they can‚Äôt trample me anymore and to see how far I have come, but every time I think of them I feel small again. None of my friends get on my bus and so I‚Äôll be sat alone and I don‚Äôt know how to handle seeing any of them.

My main emotional support is my sister but she‚Äôs going to be miles away in uni and I won‚Äôt see any of my friends until I‚Äôm in school, but there is only one I can open up to. I am having a panic attack right now I think- that or I‚Äôm just sobbing because I feel so out of control and scared.

600,"How do I help my bipolar and anxiety riddled brother that refuses to get help because he deems himself ""normal""?","So, my brothers been like this ever since university. I'm pretty sure the stress of deadlines and responsibilities made him the way he is today. Prior to studying he used to be in a band, used to play video games, was always playing his guitar and was generally a happy person. Now all he does it philosophise about life, tries to convert everyone is to a vegan and says he hates the way the world is. He believes that hobbies are a waste of time and deters you from more important things in life. He preaches how he wants the world to wake up and spends all his time in thought. You can barely have a conversation with him because something is always troubling him and on his mind. Some things are laughably trivial. We keep pushing him to get help, see some psychiatrists, try some medication, but he seems to think he's okay. Some days he'll be so much better and he'll listen to you, but most days he'll brush everything off and won't listen to you because he's over encumbered with thoughts.

 My family and I don't know what else to do, we're all so worried. I just want my brother back, my brother who used to wind me up for my shitty Justin Bieber haircut, my brother who I used to look up to because he was cool as fuck playing guitar on the stage in front of hundreds of people.

Today started pretty great until I went to a craft and grocery store. While at the craft store, and maybe because of all the extra stimulus (adhd) I started to rapidly move my eyes either voluntarily or involuntarily and started to feel disoriented. I pushed through and checked out with little issue. 

The grocery store was a different story. I had to stop what I was doing a few times and ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù myself to my surroundings. I forgot to pick up half of my list of things, couldn‚Äôt tell what was real (still kind of can‚Äôt) and I‚Äôm having trouble cognitively and my hand and other things around me doesn‚Äôt seem real. 

I seem to come in and out of this ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù as I type this? I‚Äôm going from real foggy to clear kind as I relax. I find that if I‚Äôm home I seem to improve slightly. 

I‚Äôm stammering over my words, typing so fast I am making mistakes, and just generally drained. All I wanted to do the rest of the day is shower and sleep. I ended up pushing and taking the kiddo to the park, cleaning, and doing laundry, but was very very nervous, fidgety and not present.

I'm not religious but sometimes when having these thoughts I'll talk to go or whoever if anyone is listening and just ask, why? Why does death have to be apart of life?

619,"I have a really powerful imagination and when someone tells a story about some accident , something harmful that happened to them it runs wild and I start feeling like I will faint. Is this a kind of anxiety?","Hi guys.

I always have this problem. Someone starts telling me a story about an accident they had or some gory thing that happened to them and I start imagining it with lots of details and I start feeling like I¬¥m about to faint. It also happens when I just start thinking about gory stuff or remember some gruesome story someone has told me.

I tend to imagine everything that I¬¥m told with great detail and it sometimes triggers this reaction. It¬¥s not like I¬¥m worried all the time that I¬¥m gonna faint in the middle of nowhere or anytime but when I¬¥m in the circumstances described above I tend to get into ""dude , you are about to faint"" mode pretty quickly. 

Over time I have managed to somewhat try to mitigate it. When I feel like this is about to happen I grab my phone, open Youtube and start watching a random video of my interest while telling myself ""Just relax, nothing is gonna happen, you are fine"". It works but it really takes time to get to a point where I¬¥m normal again. It really sucks because I think it hinders my ability to take part into some social interactions and I¬¥m also worried when I watch movies with gore because I¬¥m afraid of fainting in the movie theater.

The only time I fainted because of this was after watching a video of some girl suffering of pain because of an infection and rotten skin caused by some drugs. I watched it with my friends for a brief moment and 40 seconds later I fainted. The other time where I have been really close was when I was watching a video about skin removal surgery and the guy talked about the post-op and showed the scars that the surgery left (totally cured , not gruesome at all).

Is this some kind of anxiety? Do I just have a phobia to blood or gruesome stuff? Is this treatable?",2,2020-03-01 11:46:31 EST-0500
620,Relationship help,"Hi,

So I've been with my partner for over 2 years. She's my rock, my best friend and is everything to me. I live with her in rented house and we have just purchased our full house (agreement in place, contracts not exchanged yet). We have 4 kids in total, 3 from her previous relationship and 1 from mine, all kids under age of 12.

We used to make time to go on date nights and we still go on occasional getaway and up until recently I thought all was well, I'd never second guessed it really other than our occasional spat.
It's important to say I've just had a promotion also to manager at my job which I love - it's second nature to me but the commute can be stressful to me. She recently.got a night shift job as an admin and we only see each other in early.mornings during weekdays as well as an hour usually before she leaves for work when I get back from home.

The honeymoon period ended a while back so that's no concern to me, our sex life slowed down a bit but I suspected that's just how relationships go (certainly has been the case in my prev relationships at least). Our kisses turned more to pecks and lips aside from during intercourse where we are pretty active bit not as so we were at the start. She comments on this occasionally over the last half a year or so but it's never caused is any great problems.

Fast forward to yesterday, we went to take the kids for a viewing of the house we are planning to move into once solicitors have finished their work etc. I was just getting ready to leave combing in the mirror and bam - full blown, shaking, stomach cramps and panic attack. Pure anxiety. I've no idea what caused it, but all I could think of after was do I love her the same still? If you asked me if I love her I would say yes, I believe I do with eveyrthing I have but there's thoughts running throughout my head asking if I'm in love with her, why doesn't it feel the same as it used to? We are also moving the kids away from their schools to new place 35 minutes away so they will see their dad less and have to go through new school process.

I'm terrified, I feel like everything I've felt and worked for over the last year's is falling apart. I've spoken to her about it and she's trying to be understanding but I know I'm.scaring her and we are on a time limit to pull out of our purchase of the house. I don't know what to do, where to go or how to act. I can't sleep or eat and I've been sick with worry and an anxiety thinking about it.
I'm going to see a GP tomorrow morning to see if they can give me anything to calm down but important try and see a therapist or counciler of some sort as I know I need to speak to a professional.

I hate what's happening. I don't want to lose her but I know I'm making it worst being this way - I simply can't help it.
I'm usually the bottled up type, I keep myself to myself mostly to a fault and only express anger on a whole, but I've been crying on and off over last 2 days over this.

Is this relationship anxiety? I spoke to my parents who my dad suffers with anxiety also and says this is nothing to do with my partner it's because of the major changes and stress in my life recently.

If I could take a pill to go back to feeling how I did 2 days ago I would in a heartbeat.

Does anyone have any advice? Please, I'm desperate.",0,2020-03-01 18:26:55 EST-0500

623,Proud of myself/getting back on track,"I had a totally mental breakdown about 3 years ago to the point where I was non functioning for basically the first 2 years. I started to pull myself together with the right medications and treatment and it‚Äôs been a lot harder and taken a lot longer than I wanted to escape the constant daily anxiety, but every few months goes by and I notice ‚ÄúWow I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do this last month.‚Äù One of my big triggers has been exercising. When I exercise and my heart speeds up and I get a little dizzy and my tinnitus would get worse and it would trigger a panic attack and I would become even more terrified of trying again. This has caused me to take a break from focusing on physical health at all and just focusing on my mental health, because I have a hard time between differentiating living a healthy lifestyle and obsessing over my health because my anxiety tells me to . I‚Äôve gained A LOT of weight, which creates a vicious cycle because I worry more about my health and can do less about it without experiencing the racing heart and shortness of breath and dizziness. 

Today I went on a long walk and exercised for the first time in probably a year. It was a nice day out and I told myself I‚Äôm not going to obsess over being healthy, I‚Äôm just going to choose to do healthier things. I enjoyed it. I experienced a little anxiety towards the end but I got past it and I‚Äôm going to have a great day going forward. My ears are ringing a bit but it‚Äôs NOT A BIG DEAL. I‚Äôm so proud of myself!

627,A life ruled by anxiety is exhausting,"When I was a child I was afraid of disappointing my parents, afraid that others would reject me, afraid of being left alone.

When I was a teenager I was afraid of other people, afraid that my health would fail, afraid of school, exams and speeches, afraid of not knowing how to choose my path in education and work. On top of that I developed a heavy layer of shame and depression and sense of inadequacy.

When I became an adult I was afraid of not knowing how to succeed at university, of getting and keeping a job. I spent miserable years unemployed and deeply depressed after my worst failure which was trying to enter the workforce after uni.

When I was 30 I was afraid of what would happen if I killed myself, afraid that I'd mess it up, afraid of how it would affect my family.

When I was 35 I was afraid I would be alone forever, afraid that I was so damaged that there's no path to positive change anymore.

Now I'm afraid of losing my job and being too old and slow to succeed at anything else, of having made social mistakes and strategic miscalculations, of relatives dying before I can see them again, of the future in general, of speaking about my fears with the only person I'm close to, afraid I'm going to cause that person more problems instead of being a net positive.

None of my anxieties have resolved, instead anxiety keeps adding new layers and complexity the longer I live. It has robbed me and continues to rob me of joy, it makes life miserable and exhausting. And yet...my anxieties seem justified to me. They're about fundamental uncertainty. They're about real weaknesses I have, things that I don't know how to confront or mitigate.

I don't have a point, but I'm so tired of it. Enough already! And yet I already know, no matter how fed up I am with it, it will continue to be my life.",23,2020-12-18 15:14:00 EST-0500

I laid there and could feel my panic begin to rise, I did my box breathing (In hale 4 sec, hold 4 sec, exhale 4 sec. repeat)., but continued to toss and turn, scared I‚Äôd stop breathing. 

Some of the best advice a therapist gave me was to just get up. You don‚Äôt have to lay there in the torture while getting more anxiety that you can‚Äôt/ won‚Äôt be able to sleep. 

Getting up to just go to the bathroom, make yourself some tea, lol even a 2am bath/shower does wonders.

It‚Äôs new for me, and frankly, the feeling itself is giving me anxiety, but beyond that it doesn‚Äôt seem to occur when I‚Äôm feeling particularly stressed. I was first diagnosed at 19, and I‚Äôm 35 now, so I‚Äôm certainly not new to this. My doctor‚Äôs plan is to put me on a new SSRI (I was on one when it started but stopped because it was causing crazy jaw clenching and I thought that might be causing the facial burning). I‚Äôm just not convinced it‚Äôs because of anxiety, but then again, it‚Äôs so random, nothing else really makes sense.

647,Anxiety making me feel sick/nausea constantly. Making me miserable.,"Does anyone else here get constant nausea due to their anxiety. Recently, nearly every day I feel sick because of my anxiety/depression. Particularly when I need to eat. Just chewing food can sometimes make me want to throw up. On two occasions it did make me throw up. Not even dry foods help, just the chewing alone is awful. It‚Äôs mainly worse in the mornings or when I‚Äôm in situations that raise my stress and anxiety levels. For example I struggle to eat on dates without wanting to puke. It stops me from eating a lot which gives me more anxiety about losing weight (I am already incredibly skinny and cannot afford to lose weight).

I just want to try and live my life, but the constant anxiety makes me feel miserable. Sometimes to the point where I even get suicidal thoughts. It‚Äôs incredibly draining just feeling nauseous constantly. It makes working hard and it makes relaxing hard. Sometimes I‚Äôm around my friends or girlfriend and I cannot enjoy myself. I‚Äôve tried counselling and therapy but they failed me. I am currently taking beta blockers that also seem to be useless. I‚Äôm trying to get a doctors appointment at the moment, but in the U.K. the wait is long particularly with covid. I‚Äôm gonna ask for some alternative medication. 

I know this was long but I would really appreciate it if anyone could offer me advice or any useful tips to deal with this.",20,2020-12-18 01:23:43 EST-0500

It‚Äôs the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I‚Äôm tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I‚Äôll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for ‚Äúoutstanding attendance‚Äù which quickly made me realize I‚Äôm the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break.

652,What would you do if you wanted to be depressed/miserable tomorrow?,"I saw an interesting post today, apparently it's a question that therapists often ask, ""what would you do today, if you wanted to be miserable/depressed tomorrow?""

Obviously, nobody wouldn't want to be miserable tomorrow, but what the exercise shows is that a lot of the time things that you see as coping mechanisms actually often contribute to why you feel bad. Many patients, answered things like 'sleep all day', 'stay away from family'. These are things that you may often do because you are trying to deal with anxiety, depression etc. But in reality, these often contribute to how you feel, not make you feel better in the long term. So overall, think about the things you do for short term gratification, that negatively effect you in the long term. Maybe eating sugary foods may be one for you, drinking alcohol, drugs, sleeping, not getting a job etc. 

This idea helped me a lot today, but I may have explained it poorly so sorry if I did.

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes, didn't expect anyone to see this so sorry for not spending some more time and making it better to read. I'll like a better explanation I saw

We live through our fears and survive it everytime.,"A lot of people who don't deal with anxiety, or have a panic disorder/generalized anxiety disorder think it's just fear, or being nervous. It is WAY deeper than that. We go through hell. It is more than just having a "" phobia "" . It is really scary to go through . For some of us it's like being on a bad trip of LSD or weed 24/7 . To everyone reading this , don't be ashamed of your anxiety. You are a freaking warrior. A freaking soldier. I don't care if your anxiety ""isn't as bad"" as others , or if you don't feel included because you haven't felt the most severe of panic attacks. Maybe your panic attacks are small.

654,Feeling like I'm the only responsible person who cares about covid anymore,"I got to work today and one of my coworkers immediately said ""Hey, don't come near me. One of my friends tested positive for covid this morning, she and (other coworker's name) and I have all been hanging out lately. I'm feeling like crap and I can't smell anything"". I asked why they didn't try to get someone to come in for her shift this morning, and she said she didn't think it was that serious.

Later in the afternoon after she had left, another coworker commented that I was being extra quiet. I responded to her saying I was a bit anxious because of the whole deal with our other coworker. She said ""oh it's no big deal, my roommate and his girlfriend have been sick and couldn't smell anything, etc. and that was like a week ago and I'm still feeling fine!"" She said they never even got tested. I asked her if she knew that she could just be asymptomatic and still spreading the virus around, and she told me she didn't think that was the case because she never felt sick.

... I feel like I'm surrounded by people who just don't take this pandemic seriously. It's making me so anxious to go into work. I can't afford to miss work at all, one of the reasons being living paycheck to paycheck. But another reason is I recently found out my boss was really mad at me for being sick - in September I had a fever on and off for 3 weeks. I'd feel like I was better, I'd go into work, and all of a sudden I'd be so weak I couldn't stand, my fever would spike to 101ish out of nowhere, and I'd get sent home. I tested negative for covid but every health professional I spoke to during those 3 weeks told me to stay home, don't go to work, don't go anywhere because I probably had a false negative test. I was trying to do the right thing by staying home, but I literally can't afford to not work. I hate having to choose between doing what I know is right and going into work because I can't survive without income, and now I'm just terrified of getting sick from covid or anything else because I don't want my boss to be angry with me. With covid just getting worse, it's making me so anxious just to go into work. But I don't have a choice if I want to be able to pay my bills.",28,2020-11-16 06:51:47 EST-0500

664,To The Girl Who Feels Like They Need To Be Perfect,"Hi. *Take a breath*. See‚Ä¶ that feels better, doesn‚Äôt it? I know you‚Äôve been holding that in for a while.  

Between the constant studying, the sucking up to people you really don‚Äôt like, and doing all the activities that you feel will please your parents, you don‚Äôt really get time to breathe anymore. 

*But at least everyone likes you. Don‚Äôt they?*

That's what you want anyways. You work hard to please anyone but yourself. You were raised to think that your only goal in life is to make everyone else happy. Someone in your band class is struggling to learn scales, and despite your hectic life, your band teacher asks you to stay after class for a few hours and help them. *You could say no*, of course, but at the same time, you‚Äôve built the reputation of always being helpful. 

You don‚Äôt tell your teacher that tonight was the only night you didn‚Äôt have basketball practice, the only night you have to finish your big English project. 

*But it would be rude to say no, right?*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a great leader!‚Äù they say - little do they know that you don‚Äôt really like being in charge. You feel stressed in positions of power, but everyone votes you into them because that's what you‚Äôre known for, *taking charge*. It was fun to be in charge at first but then problems arise. What if everyone doesn‚Äôt agree with you? What if they don‚Äôt like your ideas? What if they think you‚Äôre being too bossy? It seems like people disagree with you just to see you break down. So you stop sharing your ideas. You become more of a moderator in the student council instead of the president. You hide in the shadows instead of shine on the stage.

*You‚Äôre there to please everyone else, aren‚Äôt you?*

You go home after a long day of classes, band scales, and student council meetings. It‚Äôs 7:30 pm by then. On the counter is a plate of cold pot roast and potatoes, saved for you but meant to be eaten 2 hours ago. You kiss your mom on the head and thank her for saving you a plate. Your dad is sitting in his chair watching the news, Fox of course. You shake your head and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how a man like that can be voted in as president‚Äù, a rookie mistake. 

*You can‚Äôt say anything that could create confrontation.*

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done more for this country than any other president, I don‚Äôt like the man, but I like the results.‚Äù You stay silent and let him talk about the president like he wasn‚Äôt a racist, sexist piece of garbage. 

**‚ÄúYeah Dad, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù**

*You always have to be the one to apologize first.*

Time for homework. You have an A- in English, so adding 5 extra slides to your presentation for extra credit is what you must do. An A- is not a grade that you can handle having. A‚Äôs are the only acceptable grade for someone of your reputation to have. You feel a pit in your stomach when you see that little minus sign; it taunts you. Your grades have to be perfect, nothing less. It's something you‚Äôre known for. When you don‚Äôt do as well on tests, and your classmates see that red, bolded C+ written in Sharpie, they torment you. ‚ÄúWow I got a better grade her, she must be losing her touch.‚Äù 

*Shape up, your imperfection is showing, isn‚Äôt it?*

Your parents put you in therapy; your need for perfection leads to eating disorders and extreme anxiety, after all, love handles aren‚Äôt perfect. Panic attacks are common: in the hall, on the court, in your room. 

*Perfect girls don‚Äôt go to therapy, right?*

But things start to improve slowly after. You tell people ‚Äúno‚Äù when they ask you to do things that you don‚Äôt have time for. You stand up for yourself and your ideas, you start to enjoy leading again. Your appetite returns. It wasn‚Äôt the fact that you went to therapy in the first place; it‚Äôs the fact that you found someone, your therapist, *who didn‚Äôt expect you to be perfect in any way.* She lets you cry and hyperventilate. She listens instead of listing expectations. 

*You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.*

If you couldn‚Äôt tell, I have been you.

Sure, I still strive for greatness, but I have learned that perfection will never be obtained. I must remain open to failure. Does it still hurt from time to time when I don‚Äôt get the grade I wanted? *Yes*. Do I feel a little guilty when I have to decline taking up that extra shift at work because I have homework? *Yes*. Despite this, I am learning to do things for myself. I still help out when I can, teaching scales, tutoring, working overtime, but only when I truly have the time. I make time for myself, I let myself have my own voice instead of conforming to avoid conflict.

I finally realize:

*I deserve to be happy too. So do you.*

Sincerely, 

the perfectly imperfect girl",8,2020-11-17 16:14:07 EST-0500

I am a doctor dealing with COVID patients. The anxiety has been so hard to handle. The shifts are nonstop busy with crazy sick and complicated patients. There are more patients than beds and staff can handle. After shift ends I sign out but continue to worry about the patients I took care of. Im worried if they are getting sicker, did I miss something, will something go wrong. I have trouble falling asleep and will review things in my head before I finally pass out. When I wake up within first thirty minutes I am up and remotely checking in with patients and also seeing how the busy the shift I am coming onto will be.

I start getting compulsions to check my texts and Snapchat, etc again and again and again. I have the need to text them to see what‚Äôs happening, and so on.

674,i finally found an anxiety medicine that works for me :'),"\*potentially triggering, i briefly mention my worst type of panic attacks, not sure if it'll actually be triggering. better safe than sorry though!\*

hey you guys. i was diagnosed with a panic disorder about four years ago. i was diagnosed with general anxiety about six years ago, though i've always been very anxious but didn't realize it was abnormal until i was in the deep end. in the last six months, i was finally diagnosed with emetophobia, as feeling ill gives me extreme panic attacks (the 8-9 hour, rocking on the bathroom floor ones). these panic attacks have been so bad and so frequent since may that i haven't been able to eat like normal until very recently, and sometimes i can't even do that. obviously, this hasn't been the easiest way to live. i've spent countless nights wondering if life could ever get better. i've been going to psychs for the last two or so years, and so far, i've only gotten terrible bruising from medicines and way more crying than usual for some reason?? the only anxiety medicine that i've ever been prescribed was klonapin, which totally didn't work for me. and that's extremely disheartening! imagine paying $30 for a medicine (WITH INSURANCE), and it just not helping with anxiety.

but last week? my psych prescribed me .5mg of ativan. the first time i took it, it was just to see if i was allergic or not. it didn't really make me feel any different, other than being a bit more focused on small objects, so i didn't have high hopes for this medicine. the next day though, i felt a terrible bout of anxiety coming on, so i figured, ""f\*ck it, might as well see if it helps"". dudes! it actually helped! i wouldn't say that it completely stifled my anxiety, but once i noticed that it didn't work fully, i just took another .5mg (which is prescribed, so it was fine!). i can't truly express how much this little stupid pill has improved my quality of life in the last week. it seems absolutely ridiculous, but i feel like i can finally breathe, knowing that if i feel sick after eating, i can just take a pill and be able to better manage my anxiety on my own. 

it's a little silly that i'm sharing this story on here, but i just wanted to talk about how this is really helping me :) hope you guys don't mind.",2,2020-11-16 09:09:18 EST-0500

I was never interested in him because he was just not my type and lived far away so the relationship wouldnt have made it. I tried to reject him as politely as I could and give as little reasons why to not hurt him. He said that everything is ok.

We haven't talked for few days and then he started messaging but was sort of creepy. It took me a while because I am bad at comfrontations and said that I think it's not best for us to continue our friendship and this is when he exploded. He was telling me very disturbind things. He began to threaten me with various things and despite blocking him everywhere, he began to harras me through snail mail.

&#x200B;

I have closed majority of my accounts as he always found a way to find me. I have changed passwords in remaining very few accounts. I delete and recreate new social media accounts frequently as he have somehow stalked me out and found me (I have pretty unique name and surname so I stopped putting these on my facebook, linkedln is hardest to hide, I can't put a fake name there).

Only those I love know my sexuality and my girlfriend or boyfriend will know and my kids will definitely know to be honest. It‚Äôs my personal business. But I do get anxiety that multiple will know one day and that gossip and hatred will continue like it did in high school.

And for some reason when I masturbated to gay porn now I get anxious for no reason. I went through a life changing experience in high school my life was never the same since to be honest o and I do legit suffer from general anxiety disorders I take me since and all for it that I‚Äôm trying to get worked out.

at the end of that day I want peace In my life and being half out of the closet is my ticket to happiness everyday doesn‚Äôt need to know my business",2,2020-03-12 01:08:14 EDT-0400

683,I need support/advice,"I am feeling so incredibly overwhelmed and sad lately, and really need some support or advice .

I started taking 5mg off adderall about a week ago. I find that it has helped stabilize my mood slightly . Overall small improvements.

My entire life I have struggled with self regulation because of my ADHD and childhood Abuse. Although I am a very functioning person on the outside, I struggle a lot internally. I feel like no matter how hard I try I cannot keep up with life. As of lately I have become even more overwhelmed. I don't normally struggle with depression but I've noticed that I've become more depressed lately. I got some blood work and it was noted that I am low in Vitamin D.
I feel like I'm stressed about absolutely everything, my job, my relationship , money etc . 

My mood seems to change either daily or hourly . Sometimes it's consistent for a week. One minute I'm motivated getting stuff done , positive about life the next I'm having panicking attacks, crying at work , worrying about absolutely everything.
Ive had this cycle for years although I notice it much more now that I'm in a relationship and live with my partner. 
I'm struggling so much. When I'm not anxious and calm . The things I normally worry about don't bother me as much but when I'm upset everything feels like the end of the world. I can get so overwhelmed that I become suicidal .
I can't always get to therapy so I try and follow a lot of therapy, psychology , self help pages on Instagram and Facebook . I find them to be somewhat helpful but I feel like I'm getting waaaay too much information and I don't know what to do with it all. 
I try and have a healthy diet, take supplements and get exercise. My job consists of being outside all day ( traffic flagger ). I try so hard to not have any vices ; smoking too much weed, smoking cigarettes, drinking everyday, playing video games everyday, watching YouTube everyday . Sometimes it's so hard though and I wish I could just have 1 glass of wine or I'm stressed or smoke weed. I force myself not to when I'm overwhelmed though because I want to find healthier ways to get through things. I only smoke weed when I'm in a good mood , same with alcohol. I feel like I analyze everything so much to make sure it isn't toxic or unhealthy. I analyze the content I watch/listen , it gets to the point that even if I enjoy watching it, if part of me thinks there are bits that are ""toxic"" I stop watching even if it made me happy. I don't pursue friendships with many people because I can never find people who are ""healthy"" enough and thus I feel lonely. 
I wish I could just live. I wish I could just stop thinking. I can't handle this, I don't know what to do, I'm so scared and overwhelmed. I wish I could stop worrying if things were right or wrong , toxic or unhealthy . 

My boyfriend ( 27 ) has mentioned that this can be normal for my age (21) and that after age 25 I will begin to get better at emotional regulation . He has been incredibly supportive and I love him so much but I'm even getting to the point where I want to break up just so he doesn't have to deal with me and I can just hide away.

I really need help. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so fucking sick of these cycles. It's like a never ending hell vs heaven . Please help me .

TL:DR: Feeling incredibly overwhelmed, stressed, anxious , sad. I haven't been depressed in awhile and have begun getting depressed. Tired of my emotions bouncing all over the place . I don't know what to do and just need support üò≠üò•",1,2020-03-12 02:51:35 EDT-0400
684,Therapist texting during session... is that normal?,"Last week during my therapy session, my therapist was texting. He crossed his legs and had his phone on his lap, trying to hide it from me. He was looking down for a solid 30 seconds, then looked up at me for a split second, then back down at his phone for another little while. 

I felt so embarrassed when this happened because I was obviously talking about something very personal. Being shy and introverted I just didn‚Äôt know what to say in the moment... I wanted to say ‚Äúare you f*cking kidding me??‚Äù Not even my therapist wants to listen to my issues...... He clearly wasn‚Äôt listening to a word I was saying because all I was getting was ‚Äúmmhmm‚Äù or just silence. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a normal thing for your therapist to be sneaking texts? I found it very inappropriate as I have been seeing him weekly for the past 9 months. I don‚Äôt even want to go back now.",9,2020-03-12 02:31:23 EDT-0400

686,I resigned today,"And honestly, I have so much relief. My work life has not been great the last few months and in the last few weeks I‚Äôve had a seriously reduced appetite, panic attacks, constant anxiety and reflux. But I resigned today and have until May 2 to get another job. It‚Äôs not how I planned it or ideal but I think I‚Äôd rather risk a short unemployment than continuing to work under constant anxiety and stress. 

I spoke with someone I currently work with and she agrees with my friends that it sounds like most issues stem from my boss not communicating or expecting too much that has been causing issues. I feel vindicated a bit. 

I don‚Äôt know how I would have gotten through a few incidents without this sub so thank you. I‚Äôll always have anxiety and I know that but it‚Äôs really awesome to realize I can cut out the things that are causing it.",1,2020-03-10 20:18:15 EDT-0400

The slightest thing can send me down a rabbit hole of I‚Äôll never be successful, never graduate, never make friends in this new state I moved to.  

I wish I was a different person so badly. I wish I was confident, calm, collected. Instead I just radiate anxiety. I feel like everyone can tell I‚Äôm a fraud and I‚Äôm doomed to be a failure. 

I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist but she can only help so much and honestly the more time that passes the more discouraged I‚Äôm feeling about therapy. Like am I doing therapy wrong?? 

Medication has helped ever so slightly but I‚Äôm afraid to try an SSRI because I‚Äôm worried about the side effects. 

I feel like I am so focused on being a failure and doing poorly in school like it‚Äôs like a self full-filling prophecy and I actually did fail two courses last year.

do you understand what i‚Äôm saying? 

i feel like i don‚Äôt really have anxiety. it feels like i‚Äôm just making myself feel like this, and i feel like i‚Äôm bringing the symptoms onto myself.

It was the perfect relationship, pure love and enjoyment, during the time we dated I had trust issues and was anxious because of it but never really told her, we started having problems around 4 months ago with little stuff like her being always late and both getting annoyed from each other so we both decided to break up sorta ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù. The thing is she has a friend (a girl) that is helping a guy get with my ex and since my girl and I ended things with getting back together in mind (even going to prom together) I‚Äôm scared of losing her, my ex gf keeps hanging out with that guy and his/her friends even when she knows that guy is trying to get with her.

707,High School Senior,"It is my (17F) second semester of senior year. I go to a smaller, private, college-prep Christian school. I took a leave from school in 2018 due to mental health issues, then returned to the same school. Last semester, I missed the last two weeks due to anxiety and health issues. Second semester just started and I missed the first two days because of anxiety. Anxious because I am disconnected from the people at my school and because I disappeared at the end of last semester. Also anxious of judgment due to very judgmental and not understanding people at my school. I am super anxious about going since I have been gone so long. We are making a list of possible 504 plan accommodations that would help my success in school with my guidance counselor. Possibly spending the period of a stressful class in the guidance counselor‚Äôs office. What are some ideas of accommodations to include? 

The days I‚Äôve spent at home I‚Äôve done nothing. I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone or worked on schoolwork which makes my anxiety worse. I also have depression so I do not get pleasure from anything and it is hard for me to do anything. I am not close anymore with the people at my school, but I wish I could hangout with some outside of class as that would be the most helpful in lessening my anxiety about school. There are some very nice acquaintances I could reach out to, but I don‚Äôt know how to suggest hanging out. My mom suggested I express my fear of judgment with them, because they likely know the feeling but I do not know how.

709,Barely getting sleep for few weeks,"So the holidays finished, I had to take valium to chill now to write this

It's been rough few months... I finally got diagnosed with anxiety, hypochondria, form of OCD, basically what I thought I had (actually posted about this before)

I started having these pressures on the right side of my head, thinking I had a tumor, but my doctor said it's probably from anxiety since I don't have any physical symptoms... But I've kept stressing and stressing, drinking sometimes, but also tried to have a good time, anxiety always prevailed...

On early christmas morning I was out and got threatened with a knife randomly, which spiraled me through terrible anxiety on Christmas and I've felt really bad.. I was stressing a lot, I barely got any sleep, I fucked up my circadian rhythm, my hand tremors got worse (I have essential tremor) and started stressing even more thinking I have neurological problems and that I have tumor even more... Every time it's just random worrying. These mild pressures (keep in mind I don't have any problems going through my day ""normally"") also came on the left side of my head

I started having dark stools on and off and started worrying even more. I think I'm going to die, and I feel that everytime I write is my last thing I'll write and I keep imagining my funeral... What do I do?

722,Hello from the Midwest,"First... I apologize for the long-winded post.

Like many others, everything happening in the world has thrown my anxiety into a tailspin. I open r/WorldNews and see thread after thread about either the Iran-US situation or Australian wildfire. I go on Facebook and see posts about Australia, or WWIII/Draft memes. I‚Äôd had this feeling of dread and lots of anxiety. I‚Äôve been afraid about what could come - what if WWIII actually does happen, what if it escalates to nuclear war? What if we get plunged back into the dark ages? I‚Äôve been so afraid that Trump is going to press the button or do something really bad.

This subreddit has really helped relieve my anxiety. It‚Äôs helpful knowing I‚Äôm not crazy or alone. Reading through this subreddit has made me realize that maybe I‚Äôm overreacting, and I shouldn‚Äôt be as anxious as I am.

I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression about 6 or 7 years ago when I was about 13 years old. Ironically, I was diagnosed after having a constant fear that the world was about to end and we were going to be in a nuclear war. Those fears were primarily propagated by religion - so for a few years now I‚Äôve been non-religious. (Despite my family‚Äôs criticism - they‚Äôre deeply religious.)

I was on medication and seeing a psychiatrist (and a licensed counselor) for a few years until I lost my health insurance a couple years ago. Ever since, I haven‚Äôt been able to see a psychiatrist or receive my medication because I can‚Äôt afford it. I‚Äôve been on my own since, talking to counselors provided through my university.

I‚Äôve been through a lot. I was feeling optimistic that 2020 would be my year and things would give my anxiety/depression a break. But I had my doubts, because it seems like the last few years have been getting worse by the year.

In 2017, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and my dog passed away. In 2018, within a two-day span my grandmother passed away and my parents separated (after being married for 40 years, they split on my birthday.) There was some fallout between me and my mother (who had severe mental health issues) after the split, but I‚Äôm thankful to say that we were able to reconcile.

2019 was by far the worst year of my life. Things were going smooth until April, when I found out my mentor would be leaving. The next Monday, I received word that my mother had unexpectedly passed away. Immediately following that was the extremely traumatic and horrible fallout that followed with her family, who has essentially be enemies with my family. Two of her family members blamed me and my father for her ‚Äúbad life‚Äù, said we ‚Äúabused‚Äù her and then proceeded to threaten me and my father‚Äôs lives. In May most of my friends graduated. When I returned in August I found out I no longer had a job, which forced me to scramble to find a new job. At that same time my counselor dropped me, so I‚Äôve been seeing a free counselor provided by my university that isn‚Äôt as good since. And in October I had to go the ER, where I fell $2,100 in debt to the local hospital. I can barely live on my wages after paying the hospital.

I was hoping 2020 would be better but so far it‚Äôs not looking it. Politics and this conflict have surged my anxiety. I‚Äôm a liberal, non-religious person who lives (and grew up) in the Midwest in a deep-red state. My entire (extended) family is super-conservative and very religious. Many of my friends are conservative. (My high school held a mock election in 2016 and Trump won like 80-85% of the student body.) I want de-escalation and don‚Äôt want war. I don‚Äôt want to see innocent people (on both sides) die for nothing. But many of the people around here want war. Ever since the bombing I‚Äôve seen more Trump flags and ‚ÄúTrump trucks‚Äù than I have since the election finished. I do not like Trump and constantly live in fear of what he may do next.

I‚Äôve been really trying to focus on my mental health (and my health in general.)

I‚Äôve been trying to do things that I enjoy to take my attention off everything. I‚Äôve been watching positive TV shows and trying to play positive, non-violent video games. I‚Äôve been focusing on continuing to build my Minecraft world and have started playing Stardew Valley, both of which are pretty relaxing. I‚Äôve been riding my bike, setting new goals each day and trying to push myself to go further each day. I‚Äôve tried to think positively in general and think about a great future.

I hope some day I can get back on my feet financially and be able to afford professional mental health. I‚Äôve wanted to see a licensed counselor rather than my current one, which never provides feedback but just listens to me and jots down notes. I hope to some day get back on my medication that helped reduce my anxiety/depression, and maybe even get an emotional support animal to help. I can‚Äôt afford it now (especially with the whole hospital situation) but I hope some day in the (hopefully) near future I can.

I am a MA student in the UK in the field of Media Business. That stressing time has come: gotta start writing my dissertation! I want it to be a meaningful, practical, and feasible project and I am not going to let the COVID19 stand in the middle. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (and recently with dyslexia too); stats say one in five Britons will experience depression at some point.

In my past (and current) romantic relationship, I realised how my condition affects my partner's mood, and utterly, its wellbeing. I also noticed that they had little awareness of what depression is like, I found them both (current and ex) with absolutely no idea of what it's like to have depression, or what is depression itself; they didn't know how to cope with it or how to effectively support me, and (at least as far as I could see and feel) they did little effort to find out how to do it themselves.

That was not a rant, it was my reality as someone who suffers from depression. It's tough, distressing, and consuming. However, I managed to realise they were affected by it too. They would be more hostile, upset, mad and tear more often; and it soon became a trainwreck, the relationship deteriorated and left us (my partner and I) on the edge.

Although I have noticed the UK healthcare system likes to prescribe pills (every time I have been to the GP, I was prescribed pills without much care), I managed to access therapy too (sadly, free sessions are up to 8). I found myself a charity and start going to psychotherapy (outside of the NHS) too. I have been to the Samaritans several times. I do care about my depression because I am sick of it, and now because I realised the horrid side effects it can have on other people as well. In my research, I found out many resources available online for self-care, but they are little services for caregivers (with this word I will refer to my partner, my care-partner, who takes care of me as we are in a romantic relationship).

I truly believe care-partners need support, too; and firstly, they need information (rather education) of the issue. I don't see any encouragement for them to go see a GP when they are feeling unwell because of it, I don't see any leaflet, I don't see any communications, and I see little only tools tailored for them. It is always the question of ""Are you worried about someone"", instead of the statement of ""we worry about you, too"".

Communications tackling this issue could be highly beneficial, and not only as prevention. I do believe many young couples could benefit from it, improve their mental health and overall wellbeing. I am decided to go ahead and own this project, and to put effort into delivering a game-changing paper. 

Due to the non-contact policy, I am forced to find you online.

Partners of depressed loved ones, I NEED YOU. Depression warriours, I NEED YOU. Beyond my personal experiences, I need to talk to YOU to prove my thesis realistically and objectively. 

If you are 24 or over living in England (London preferably), and in a relationship affected by this condition, I would be happy to talk to you.

Knowledge is underestimated; it is absolutely powerful and is an agent of change. This project goes not for me, but for you, for us together, for all of those struggling.

I can't and I am not guaranteeing any help or any results (sadly).
I am not a professional in the area (I am just a student that struggles with this issue).
I am not in favour or in opposition to any treatment (what I said it was based on my personal experience).
I would like to post this in several communities related to the research; it's not spam; I signed up in Reddit today as an non-contact alternative to get to a community. I am happy to answer any queries and show you my project proposal.

If you are up for it, let's get in touch!

Also, on mobile, so sorry for any formatting.

Music is very important to me. It has helped me through a lot of things and I love a little bit of almost every genre out there. However, I hate sharing what I like with other people, either by telling them or making them listen to anything because I'm terrified of any possible reaction. It's happened before where I tell someone ""oh I like *insert random band*"" and they get a face of ""ew why do you like that that's so weird.""

He always says he is right and we should respect his ""right"" point of view, even if he is wrong.

I've gone to a handful of doctors and taken dozens of tests in my lungs and nothing has come up so they believe its anxiety.

752,advice on how to overcome cooking anxiety?,"I haven't struggled with anxiety in a few months (which I'm very happy about) but I still get super anxious when I cook and it's fucking annoying, I'm sick of looking stupid because it takes a while to sort out what I have to do. 

Whenever I cook something, no matter how simple it is, I have to have everything sorted out, be sure that I know the exact order of the steps. I also have to make sure that I'm as efficient as possible because I feel very guilty if I use too many utensils, let alone break them. And things work out fine when I'm on my own and I can take my time preparing everything.

But if I'm with someone else and I'm rushed, I just kinda freeze until I have everything sorted out in my head. And I feel stupid doing it with someone around because all I can think about is how stupid I look being unable to follow some simple instructions. And then I get overwhelmed and my only option is asking the person exactly what I should do, which, again, makes me seem even more stupid. 

For some context (why this is plaguing my mind), a few days ago my mom melted some chocolate in a bowl, and since she didn't use all of it for her recipe, she asked me if I wanted to use it to make some hot chocolate. Which would be simple enough: heat up the milk, pour it into the bowl to melt the chocolate, put it back in the pot. Except I just froze because I was too scared that the glass bowl would break from the heat, then got scared that the milk had stayed too long in the pot without being stirred and would then burn the pot, and i had to ask mom to guide me through all the steps so I could actually do it. It was fucking hot chocolate, why was it so difficult for me to do it.

759,At my wit's end with wife in downward spiral,"Wife has struggled with many times diagnosed but never treated anxiety and depression. Since we had a kid it has gotten progressively worse. She is now at a stage where she is unable to enjoy anything, and switches between two modes: completely unemotional (neutral to everything) or angry. Almost everything sets her off: kid not brushing his teeth or washing his hands correctly, me putting something in the wrong place, her mom calling at the wrong time. She is so distant I feel like I live with a very angry stranger who doesn't have any empathy for anyone else. It is very difficult, especially with a small child in the house.

Any talk of therapy or even just talking to someone  immediately results in fury, uncontrollable crying, and shutting down. ""I never want to talk. I'm fine. I'm upset now only because you want to talk."" Etc.

No suicidal thoughts or direct self-harm, but she is massively self-destructive. Pushes the few friends we have left away, same with family. Gives up on exercise. Weight gain, compulsive eating, then beating herself up for eating, endless cycle.

Doctor told me he can't do anything unless she is willing to enter therapy or other treatment. She is ""close to a mental health crisis"" but ""too strong willed"" to have a breakdown which puts her in limbo where the health care system is concerned.

I realized this morning i actually dread waking up because it means dealing with the anger and distance caused by whatever happens during the day. And we're just entering two weeks of covid Christmas. Which she wants to cancel because ""presents are stupid and a waste of time.""

Is there a proven way to calm this sensation? 

Going for a walk helps a bit, but once I get back to work, it happens all over again...

764,Anxiety Induced Speech Impediment?,"Hello \^-\^ 

Wasn't sure where else to post, and I hope this is an okay place.

I grew up with a few anxiety disorders (panic & social) and a few learning disabilities. I have recently come to understand that my speech impediment is most likely caused by my anxiety.

I was ridiculed by family, peers, teachers, coaches, etc growing up for my lack of clear speech. I was quiet because I had bad volume control/awareness (mostly an ADHD thing), I couldn't and still struggle to articulate my words and stutter to this day.

Because of this constant nagging growing up, I realized I totally shut down. I thought I was just a shy kid who didn't talk a lot, but I realize now I wasn't talking because I was afraid to. I even notice now, how at 21 years old, I restrict my speech to the bare minimum. If I don't know exactly what I want to say and how to say it without a stutter or pause, I won't say anything. This makes me seem sort of rude sometimes when I can't respond to simple questions like 'what's your favourite colour' in a fully fleshed out manner. Unless I'm with the friends who I feel totally comfortable with (maybe 2 people), I just can't get the words out.

I guess I'm just wondering how I get over this? I'm getting better, I've tried talking to more friends one on one, practicing my speech and to professors. But the second someone tells me to speak up, be more clear or laughs at my stutter, I shut down. I completely regress back to that scared little kid and I don't know how to break the cycle. I'm trying so hard and love my friends so much for helping me. 

If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it with my whole being. I just want to be able to be the person I know I am deep down.",2,2020-12-22 07:51:09 EST-0500

There are some other symptoms as well, and I finally made a doctor's appointment, but it just got me wondering... I've been avoiding this for six months because, well, it's probably just my anxiety, right? 

My fiance ended up getting mad and made me make an appointment because he'd rather me be safe than sorry. And I agree with him. 

I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this? 

I know avoiding doctors because of anxiety is common, but I'm not scared of the doctor. I just don't want to waste anyone's time and tend to assume all of my symptoms can be tied back to my anxiety. 

Anyone else?

**TL;DR - I don't avoid doctors due to fear of the doctor or office, I avoid them because I tend to assume everything wrong with me is due to anxiety. Anyone else do this?**",59,2020-07-04 22:53:43 EDT-0400

I tried to think of the thing that makes me relaxed, but I couldn‚Äôt come up with a single thing.

I ended up saying that I‚Äôm relaxed when I listen to music in my bed, which is sort of true. When I do that, I forget a lot of my worries, but the general feeling of anxiety is still there.",55,2020-07-06 00:50:56 EDT-0400

When I'm out with friends or my boyfriend, I feel carefree for a while, maybe 30 minutes or so (depending on if I'm drinking... but that's a whole different story) and then I quickly ""snap back"" to my reality and quickly become filled with guilt. My brain searches for things to be anxious about and I don't remember the last time I went a full day without being held back my anxious thoughts.

How do I live more carefree? How do I live presently? Man, I need to start meditating.",59,2020-07-04 06:50:40 EDT-0400
780,Helpful tip for constant anxiety,"This is going to sound preachy and hella cliche but I find exercising very strenuously helps tremendously with anxiety. I have had anxiety for pretty much my entire life and have panic/anxiety attacks, sleep phobia, social phobia, GAD and all the likes, and have been on all types of antidepressants and benzos to help me. 

I had a resurgence of anxiety this weekend for some reason and found myself unable to eat for the entire day for a few days now, constantly shaking and feel nauseous, and staying up at night for hours having anxiety attacks before eventually tiring out around 6 am each night. It‚Äôs awful. 

but today I ran maybe 3 miles and then did some strength training (a total of 1 hour of pretty intense exercise) and holy moly I feel a lot more relaxed now. I know it sounds like a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù or shallow advice, but it really helps me so maybe it could help someone else. I just visualize all that pent up energy in my chest and stomach being released as I exercise and it really does feel like i‚Äôm letting my anxious energy be expended. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that I‚Äôm getting in shape too lol. 

Hopefully this advice may help someone like it helped me",13,2020-07-06 03:29:17 EDT-0400

788,I get intense death anxiety almost every time I get anxious. Any tips?,"It‚Äôs so tiring. If my s/o doesn‚Äôt reply to my texts for an hour, I‚Äôll get this feeling of dread in my stomach and my anxiety flares up like the shortness of breath, the shaking, the sweating, the nausea and if it‚Äôs a particularly bad one, I‚Äôll struggle with talking properly and being able to be coherent. 

When the virus was only starting off in my country and there were no lockdown rules, my partner went to Amsterdam for the day (they had to come back home the next day because Amsterdam went into lockdown) I spent the entirety of the time in and out of anxiety attacks because I was convinced they were gonna die of coronavirus. I was so relieved when they came back.

Today, when my s/o got upset and needed to be by themselves, I convinced myself that they had died in my bathroom and I had a full fleged anxiety attack over it even though I tried very hard to keep it from forming in the first place.

Later, when my partner didn‚Äôt answer my texts, the first place my mind went to was death. And more anxiety. It‚Äôs so frustrating, especially since it‚Äôs something I should definitely be able to work through myself. Nothing anyone can do can calm me down until I‚Äôm certain the person didn‚Äôt die. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Any advice is very much appreciated.",8,2020-07-04 04:12:00 EDT-0400

[my experiences ](https://medium.com/shady417/how-medication-helped-with-my-anxiety-1e15da0a7dac)",8,2020-07-06 01:27:37 EDT-0400
791,Recovering from burnout - is it normal to still feel like this?,"I left a job 7 months ago that left me feeling anxious, depressed and chronically stressed out. I regularly didn't sleep well and would feel sick most mornings before starting work. It got to the point where I resigned because I just needed to get out. This role lasted over 3 years.

Throughout the role I had been a high performer - I had good appraisals and good client feedback, but I just found the whole experience of it and pressure of it far too intense. I'd raised it several times with management but they ignored it as the results were still coming through, and despite me raising my concerns the workload just kept piling up which greatly exacerbated the issue.

During this period I'd also been on anti-depressants and been to therapy to see if there was an underlying issue making it worse, and it turns out there wasn't. I was in therapy for six months and on medication for over a year.

I decided to take 3 months out between leaving the last job and starting the current one to give myself some time to recover. The new job is the same role but in a different organisation, one that's a lot more supportive and definitely less intense. I've got two good managers who are easy to talk to and have my back.

Even though the work environment and the people around me are much healthier now, I feel as though I've got some sort of anxiety ""hangover"" from the last job, as though it's a learned response. I can still feel myself reacting the same way now as I did in my last job - even though I've moved on, even though the people and the environment are different. I can still feel the anxiety bubbling up each morning before I log on, even though I know I logically don't have the same things to fear. I essentially feel as though my reactions to events in the current role aren't proportionate and are still being influenced by the last one.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Is this typical of recovering from burnout?

My hope is that maybe the anxiety will just subside over time, but I would be really interested to hear from other people about their experience and what it was like for them.",0,2020-07-04 23:01:42 EDT-0400

793,I‚Äôve never had an anxiety attack like that..,"So something happened about 10 minutes ago. It triggered my OCD which triggered me to have an anxiety attack. I‚Äôve had attacks in the past but that had to be the worst. My face was tingling all over, my hands started curling inwards, I couldn‚Äôt breath or see properly, my ears were blocked, it was horrible. I managed to get out of it myself, I kept counting to 10 and focused on my breathing. I really just needed my mum in that moment and when I finally got to her, it started up again, this time a lot less worse... 

My head feels so hazy now and my face feels hot. I always find that after crying I get super exhausted. I never want to have an attack like that again. I feel so horrible for people that suffer with attacks like that regularly. You‚Äôre all so incredibly brave because that truly scared that crap out of me.

794,Feeling like an outsider in my own friend group,"So I just finished a video call with my friends and I have been having this thought for quite some time but, today specifically I felt kinda left out?

We normally call each other when all five of us are there but these days it‚Äôs like only two of them call each other or the four of them with out because of time and being busy with different things but when I‚Äôm with them I truly felt like an outsider. It tends that they all compliment each other and I‚Äôm kinda just there, or they will directly ask each other questions and rarely ask me anything. I‚Äôm try to tell myself these are just thought but especially today I just felt a kind of weird vibe??? I hope this is all in my head because time and time again when I would tell them about my feelings they would say that they actually really love me and feel very comfortable with me. Maybe they show their love to me in a different way? Do I give them that feeling that I don‚Äôt like the way that they compliment each other? I‚Äôm very conflicted because they‚Äôre my friends for many years it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know what to do and don‚Äôt know what to believe because I don‚Äôt want.

797,Progress & what I think has helped me,"I struggle with various mental health issues, the main two being depression and anxiety. Since quarantine has started, my anxiety has skyrocketed. But, today I feel like I've made some real progress! Here are a few changes that have helped me, and maybe they could help you too! :) 

* TECHNOLOGY
   * I'm 18 years old and social media is pretty big for my age group. A couple of weeks ago I randomly decided to stay off all social media platforms for 24 hours, and then last week I went without social media for 3 days. This has helped me to decrease screen time overall, and I always felt that I used my phone as a distraction from my anxiety, and I don't do that anymore. It honestly feels relieving to not feel pressure from social media. 
* NATURE
   * I know everyone's probably heard this a thousand times, but sometimes I just go outside and sit on my deck and watch the sunset/rise. And all I do is literally sit there. I don't touch my phone. I just sit and admire how beautiful this planet is and how lucky I am to be here. 
* FAMILY
   * I've always struggled with my family, and sometimes I feel like they trigger my anxiety whenever someone gets mad or starts yelling. So what I've begun to do is greet everyone, every time I see them. It makes me feel more comfortable and connected to the people around me. And I kinda think it puts everyone else in a better mood. 
* I've also been keeping my room clean and using essential oils in a diffuser
* I've started taking multivitamins and probiotics 
* Overall, I've been trying so hard to keep a positive mindset, which is VERY difficult at times but I have to believe that it's possible and worth it! 

I hope everyone is doing well! You are all beautiful people and an amazing support group! Also if anyone is struggling feel free to message me, I'm always down for a chat! Sending you all love and support!! xx",0,2020-07-04 02:28:46 EDT-0400

799,Art and perfectionism do not mix. :(,"I've been drawing all my life but recently I've been haunted by the evil trappings of perfectionism. When I draw a face that I'm proud of, inevitably I'll look at it again in the coming minutes and hate what I've drawn. I get the urge to tweak it or draw it again even though *I know for a fact* that people aren't going to notice or even care if they do.

Right now I'm working on a piece that I've redrawn maybe 8 times because I fear if people see it they will find the entirety of my work repulsive and stop following me. I keep falling into a cycle of catastrophizing and It's really waring on my psyche.

I hate it so much, guys.

For reference [here is my most recent render of said face.](http://imgur.com/a/GxBRsO0) (He's supposed to be yawning.)

I know it's not bad at all, but I see so many flaws that I want to erase it and start over again. I've spent a week on this one page alone all because of his damned mouth! Something feels off about it. maybe a lack of emotion, or a stiffness that I can't shake. Something I'm missing. 

Maybe I just need fresh eyes? Idk. I feel so sick of him. If it were paper I would have torn it up by now.

edit: I guess another part of it is the desire to balance realism with stylization. I'm always scared that if I go too far off the character model that it'll loose the audience. This is really stiffling my capacity for expression. When I'm not focusing on character design I can really go all out.

804,Anxiety never goes away,"My anxiety can go away but not at my own will. Once my body is incapable of being stressed out I will feel relief for a few weeks. Then I just am bombarded with anxiety. The kind of anxiety that does not let you think clearly. Specifically in social situations. I have to try so damn hard to stop my mind from spiraling out of control. This includes obsessive counting, thought stopping, many strategies to distract myself physically. Yet it is so relentless it never left and just gets more intense. It has taken a toll on relationships heavily. Even when I‚Äôm around my gf who is my most trusted friend I ‚Äòtip toe‚Äô on egg shells around her from being anxious which is just insulting. It‚Äôs not fair to me or anyone I meet. I always make the situation noticeably uncomfortable because my voice constantly trembles or goes high pitched. I thought I had ptsd but my psychiatrist said ‚Äòbeing traumatized by your own mental health conditions without external source‚Äô didn‚Äôt count.  I eat healthy and just started exercising again. 

TLDR; i went through some stuff at 16 and was never the same. Anxiety is relentless and almost never goes away. Feels like I have no control. Even diet and exercise won‚Äôt make it go away. 

Edit: closest things I can think of are ptsd or panic disorder. Otherwise I‚Äôm always self diagnosing different possibilities like a hypochondriac.",3,2020-01-31 22:58:16 EST-0500

815,I feel better when other people are anxious too. Why?,"I have a pretty consistent feeling of anxiety(even when alone and not doing anything). So I tend to go to the same places over and over so that eventually it's not so stressful. Recently I've been trying to do low waste and support local businesses more and therefore have been trying new places to see if I can upgrade any of my normal places from linear economy chains to more of a circular economy that helps locals not corporations.
Today I was at a co-op market that has a bulk bins section and healthier food than the baby Food Lion closest to me(my normal place). As per usual, I got pretty stressed out by not knowing where things were and all the people (and it didn't help it was in a different section of the city so the demographic of people was as different as possible so they were acting differently than strangers in my area). When it was time to go I went to check out and the cashier was pretty much at the same level of anxious as I was and for some reason that made me feel better. Like she is there presumably 40 hours a week and she is still not completely okay with the crowd and everything so my feelings are reasonable being completely new to this environment. And we didn't exchange any words or eye contact because we were both concentrated on the transaction going smoothly and quickly which took some stress of interacting with strangers away. 
I don't know why she was the most memorable part of that trip but she was. Maybe it's because when I see anxious people out and about I feel proud of them and more comfortable at the same time. If they can be there then I can too and no one will think I'm that weird since someone else is behaving the same way. Does this make sense? I used to have a friend that loved going in public with me cause we would both be nervous wrecks but she would just apologize all the time while I was just weird and low key rude and it was always funny in retrospect especially since we weren't insecure just nervous.",1,2020-02-02 02:01:24 EST-0500

820,what can i do,"My parents argued since i remember myself. There were death threats, flying glass and other stuff. They got finally divorced last year. My father left home, he still has no job. I (17F) live with my mother, going to highschool nearby. Since the divorce, my mother found stuff to fight about, the shoes i wear, boyfriend i had and things like that. 2 months after divorce i found the-day-after pill in our house. And a male watch in bedroom. She was having sex with a stranger, yet she was screaming at me for kissing my boyfriend. Months pass and the fights became more and more violent. She doesn‚Äôt let me say a word, even if I say something, she makes me regret it. I have been using medication for my OCD and yes, it did stopped my intrusive thoughts , but my anxiety and my manic attacks got worse. I got super nervous around adults and I really can‚Äôt do anything, I tried to tell her this, but she didn‚Äôt give a fuck. 
 My grandpa came to visit us, and as always I was nervous so I couldn‚Äôt talk with him. She made fun of me ( after she said she wanted to prove she was a good mom to his father) . I couldnt take it so I didnt left my room while grandpa stayed at home.

827,Advise? Help? Need something.,"!!!!!!WARNING ESSAY AHEAD!!!!!! Hello, I am 30, 31 in two days time. I've been living with depression and anxiety for 16 years, managed quite well for  13 years, then due to work and health related circumstances I had a break down and had to reach out for help. I have had CBT, multiple medications and nothing has worked to help me get back to a manageable mind frame, I am currently house bound, I can't work as I can't leave the house without my wife anymore. My anxiety is heavily focused on the social aspect, I can't talk to a stranger for more than about 2 minutes while alone, and then even when with my wife she has to input on my behalf heavily. My insecurities and paranoia are centered on my own self critical thoughts, I have lived the better part of my life believing I am scum, worth less then the air everyone else breathes, undeserving of happiness, I was a huge self saboteur, used to self harm a long time a go. This year has been horrendous, we lost out baby, was to be our third child, at the beginning of the year, we had to make the choice to end the pregnancy early, then coronavirus happened, getting stuck in the house, not a huge loss for me being a huge hermit and anti social and full of anxiety, more of a impact on my wife though. Which leads to the past week, I thought I was handling this year better than I actually am, thought I had everything under check, more motivation, less shouting in my mind, calmer and cooler. However this is not true, my wife, whom I should clarify we have been married for 3 years, together for 9 years and known each other for 15 years, best friends, we are each others soul mates, not a term I really like to use but it is the case for us, which is why I am having such a difficult time. My wife has started doing a great thing, doing things to make herself feel better, just little things, getting dressed daily, started yoga, make up on daily, she also deals with anxiety and not liking herself, so it's great that she is taking steps to feel better in her own skin. She watched a lot of YouTubers, especially The Sims tubers, which led to twitch, which led to other streamers that don't really play games she's interested in, but the people themselves are grand people, then she becomes friends with some of them, super, we are both friendless, have been for ages, just been us, especially this year, this took place over a few months, then this past week, she became best friends with one of the streamers, male, straight, long distance girlfriend, has issues of his own not my place to say. He needed a friend the other night, my wife was there for him, good, answered the phone to him, the only person she will talk to on he phone is me, has been for years, she has huge anxiety when it comes to phones. First time I felt it, paranoia, jealousy, the undeservingness, then I thought I picked up on her being secretive, putting headphones on, so she doesn't distract me, taking her phone upstairs on a night more, talking to this new friend, a lot, like the level we did when we first got together, like when you have a crush, I got so stupid with it, started ignoring my wife, acting like it was falling apart, when there was no evidence of what I was thinking, in fact the evidence proved the opposite, my wife still told he daily she loves me, there was no gap, no love lost, she was just, or is just having a new friend, and her own anxiety makes he need to talk that much and respond fast so in her words doesn't upset anyone, she finally pulled the truth from me, and understood me, understood why I was being this, why it hit me hard, and I got over it for a day, then got stupid again, my paranoia and anxiety niggling in the back of my brain, shouting at me that something was happening, I got quiet again, we had another good cry and talk and I told her more of my feelings, again got back to normal, then without realising I was still judging her, kept looking when she picked up her phone, this was yesterday, we argued, cried, talked and all the soppy stuff, she still loves me, and now I hate myself even more for letting things get like this, I loathe myself on a daily basis, my biggest flaw is how critical I am to myself, every time I have looked in he mirror today, I have felt physically repulsed, just wanting to hurt myself, punish myself. My wife has offered for me to talk to her friend, even asking me to just lurk on the streams, join in when I'm ready and join the group become friends, or at the very least find someone to talk to, make friends of my own of I can't join hers. So TLDR, I am a mess, need advice or just a friend, I have no-one, don't want to worry my wife more than needed with my inner most thoughts, but I can't keep going on like this, I am so angry at myself right now, like I am the devil incarnate on my own eyes, I usually play video games to distract myself from my thoughts, works for the most part, but right now I can't do it, I have no interest in anything but despising myself and wanting to make sure I don't upset my wife more, the only thing in my life that matters to me is making my wife and children happy, somehow giving them the life they deserve, but I think I need to do what my wife is doing right now, find a way to be happy with myself or at the very least for the mean time not hate myself so much. I profusely apologise for the length of this super essay, but I don't talk to anyone at all so, I have less social skills than a limbless mime, so I find it hard to condense or just talk, sorry.",0,2020-12-08 20:25:25 EST-0500
828,"I just recently started struggling with intense, physical symptoms of anxiety.","Hello everyone, heres a little bit of background: I am a 21 year old male who has always been somewhat of an anxious person, but around January this year, it got a whole lot worse. I would notice that when I was at work or would meet up with friends in a public area I would start to feel extremely short of breath. Not just like, mildly winded, but I mean barely breathing (or at least thats what it felt like). My fingers and toes would go numb and I would feel like I was going to pass out. I noticed that eating a full meal before leaving the house would help a lot with that, so that gave me a peace of mind and I was able to continue doing the things I enjoyed. Then COVID hit. While we were on lockdown, i started running daily and that helped with my symptoms as well. When we came out of lockdown and I went back to work, I noticed my anxiety manifested itself in a different way. If I was around too many people I would start to get dizzy/ feel unsteady and would start to have a mild panic episode. The only thing that would calm me down is if I got away from everyone and sat down and took deep breaths. 

When summer came along, I noticed a little bit of relief, but not for long. More confusing symptoms just keep arising when I am put in anxious situations. At the moment I am mostly dealing with a strange heat sensation creeping up my spine when i start to get nervous. It's so weird. Other times it's uncontrollable shaking. My therapist thinks I'm having mini panic attacks. 

Does anyone else experience these physical symptoms? If not, how does your anxiety manifest physically for you? Does klonopin help with the physical symptoms?

836,I ran out of Sertraline,"I ran out of my medication for anxiety, and because I have the worst memory, as usually I forget to order it. I usually do it on the day it runs out and go down to the pharmacy to pick it up after 5pm, but not only did I forget to order it until the day I ran out, but this time I also forgot to go and get it. 

That meant I had to go the full weekend until Monday with no medication. I started having mild withdrawals and felt like shit. 

That being said, I am incredibly proud of myself. I forced myself to eat tea downstairs with my family, and I then refrained from buying alcohol to make the night easier. I barely smoked too, compared to the usual amount.

Today was my grading so that I could move from my blue to red belt which meant I had to do 6 consecutive 2 minute rounds of sparing.

On my 5th I was pared up with a much bigger guy to just to boxing and he knocked me around good. He got me good a few times and it really took the energy out of me.

For my sixth round I had to spar with one of the very advanced people in my class but that 5th round really took the energy out of me. During the 6th round to catch my breath I backed away and sort of adjusted the pads that I was wearing but in a way I was just trying to catch my breath. 

Now I feel this extreme guilt because I was being graded on these fights and it feels that I cheated in a way.

844,I get it now,"Hello all  
Like everyone, I have had some anxiety throughout life, but have always managed to put it into it's proper place in my mind to be able to deal with it. (""this is a sort term situation; this too will pass; remember that compared to X happening, this isn't so bad;"" etc.)

My SO has always had some level of anxiety, at times crippling. Over the many years we have been together I have tried to help when things get bad for him.

But recently I was put on an anti-cancer hormone blocker. I was having some typical physical issues, but the WORST was the anxiety. Any little stressor was sending me into spiraling thoughts that would not stop. And the thoughts were always the worst-case scenario type. My heart rate would go from 0-60 and then not calm down for hours.

I felt like my body was betraying me. My mind was trying to have the same calming conversations but my body was like ""RUN RUN RUN this is BAD"".

I had a follow up with the doctor last week and while in the waiting room I read an email that, on a normal time would piss me off but I would deal with; this time my blood pressure shot up, heart pounding, face flushed and honestly I was glad because the doctor got to see what I was talking about first hand. 

He immediately took me off the drug. It's been 5 days and I already feel soooo much better.

All of this to tell you all that now I understand the inability to get into a more calm place no matter how hard you try, your brain just won't let you. I told my SO the same thing: *I get it now*.",0,2020-12-08 16:34:09 EST-0500

849,My Struggle With Anxiety,"Alright. So this is gonna be a sorta long post, and most probably gonna get buried. So if you're reading this, thank you, I really had to get this off my chest.

Me(16) and my family moved to a new country just over a year ago, and the first 3-4 months were terrible. Constantly anxious, and super alone. It was terrible. The main issue my anxiety stems from, is being alone. I just hate being alone. It's terribly unhealthy, I know, but I just can't help it. I need constant connection to someone, to something. 

Several times, the remedy for anxiety is 'work on yourself' or 'take time for yourself, forget everyone else' and I'm sure it's great advice for many, many people, but it just never works for me, just makes me feel more disconnected, and alone. I've always had anxiety to an extent, but before moving I always had friends to distract myself, to make myself feel better. Moving was terrible, and shook me up more than anything else ever could.

The reason I'm making this post is the past couple months I finally felt like I was a bit better. The anxiety was there, but not constant anymore. The last couple of days, I feel like I'm right back where I was a year ago, and I feel absolutely terrible. I honestly just so tired, and I wanna be 'normal' so damn bad. Like I said, I just feel like I had to shout this at the wind for my own sanity. 

Hope y'all are having a good day out there.

My dr has recommended medication before but my mum has always steered me away from it, she has the concern I‚Äôll be dependant and has I‚Äôve tried herbal medications and things like nytol to help reduce symptoms like inability to sleep.

857,I feel like all my friends hate me,"In highschool I had a real close group of friends who immediately stopped talking to me the second we graduated. Even when I tried to reach out to catch up I'd get ignored and left on read. This has left me terrified of loosing the friends I have now, and I'm hyper aware of everything I do that could possibly make them dislike me.

Some examples, we play D&D over discord, and my mic is a bit delayed, so I end up interrupting people when I don't mean to. Also, sometimes I'll mess up and get some information wrong and I always feel so stupid, and I think they're judging me for getting things wrong. I worry about every little thing I say that could be interpreted the wrong way, I feel annoying and like a burden and that nothing I do is good enough. I care about my friends a lot and I don't want them to hate me but everything I do feel like the wrong choice. 

They've never done anything to make me feel this way, they're all great, so it's not like I even have a reason to feel like this. I just do and the weight of it is crushing.

858,My mental health has been deteriorating for a few years now and the quarantine hasn't been helping that at all,"Trigger warning: mention of blood (mild) 

So I'm a 20 year old female and I'm currently a student. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD and I've had some really bad experience with bullying in the past. 

I was bullied from age 6 to 15 and although I had a supportive family, my home wasn't as stable as I would have needed it to be.
Ever since I was 10 I started having really intense feelings of stress, slowly increasing from just monthly bad days to soon being anxious all the time. At 12 years old I started to get overwhelmed. At some point I dissociated a lot of it though and lived in this kind of unreal autopilot mode for a long time.
 
I've been working on my mental health with professionals for 2 years now and discovered a lot about myself. A downside to this is that it's really taken a toll on me. I've been remembering suppressed memories and regaining other feelings than just anxiety. I've started to experience daily flashbacks and I just don't know if I can handle all this.

I've already messed a year of my studies because I can't get a grip.
After the quarantine started I've really lost my sense of everything. I don't feel time. I'm in pain all the time. I have slight hallucinations here and there and my intestines have just given up by starting to bleed from all the stress.
I don't know what I should do with my studies. I'm too afraid to contact my teachers because I just see a hatred and judgment on everyone's faces.

In the end I know all this is just from my stress and I don't think everyone hates me but the feeling still hurts.",2,2020-05-12 02:17:13 EDT-0400

I wonder if i didn't have a shit family, maybe i could have been normal

Maybe if my dad at least cared about me A LITTLE BIT, I would be okay

I get angry thinking about how my dad kicked me out right after highschool, for no good reason

Maybe if I had SOME support i would even know what i want to do with my LIFE

Im upset I had to move around all the time and now i don't know anyone where i live, and all the friends I made have forgotten about me

And no one talks to me any more, just the occasional ""hey how's it going"" i cant talk to anyone about how i feel

Im so anxious i can barely work and i feel like a failure

Im trying therapy but we just talk about what happens week to week, i feel like theres something WRONG with my BRAIN

I have never been ACTUALLY diagnosed with anything, i went to the doctors said i was anxious and sad, and they said ""yeah sounds like anxiety/depression"", threw medicine at me and said to schedule therapy

I want to do things with my life, but i don't know what, and i get so upset thinking about what i COULD be doing RIGHT now if i grew up okay

Everyone i knew in high school is about to graduate college, and here I am, worrying about money, work, bills, food, family, what i want to do with my life, and how/if im going to go to college.

And now i feel like an asshole complaining about anything because I have a home and a job, I should be happy and happy to be working.

I dont have a dream job because i dont want to waste my life making someone else money

863,how to not feel depressed and suicidal due to covid?,"I am a 19 year old male in California and honestly my entire life I have been very shy and introverted, almost no friends and never dated before. This has lead me to being extremely fucking lonely and depressed, I really crave affection and love since I never got any of that since I am not close with any of my family. 

This has lead me to being depressed/suicidal since I was 15 and I knew about 4 months ago if something didn't change I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got up and started doing shit got my license, started working out, tried to get confidence to be more extroverted and got my resume ready for some jobs in my local mall

Literally two weeks into me going to the gym and 2 days before going to the mall to apply for jobs lockdown began. Now I can't go the gym, socialize with anyone in person, or apply for a job. I feel so angry but depressed now, like SERIOUSLY THIS COULDN'T O F HAPPENED ANY POINT IN THE FIRST 18 YEARS OF MY LIFE!?!?!!? NOOOOOOO IT HAD TO HAPPEN WHEN MY LIFE FINALLY STARTED LOOKING HAPPY. I feel awful for the first time in my life I tried to be happy and the world said fuck yoju, you can't do that. Who knows how long this garbage lockdown will last and with 30 million unemployed the chances of me getting a job after this is FUCK ALL. 

I was so happy finally getting healthy, and getting my confidence, getting a job, making friends, and finally dating. Idk what to do ik realistically in the coming months and years depression and suicide rates WILL be higher due to the affects of covid but I think I may contribute to that number. Please anyone reading this what do I do?????

And I'm assuming people will give these two solutions for two of my problems, work out at home which is what I am doing but of course it is nowhere nearly at effective as a gym due to lack of equipment. And to make friends online, almost all of my friends and social interaction I have ever had is online and I am fucking sick of it. I want to meet and build connections with people IN REAL LIFE. And Ik online dating is what's popular right now but I don't like the idea of taking and connecting with a potential romance partner via a fucking Skype call, sorry not my thing plus I don't look good on camera like many others do.",7,2020-05-11 02:07:29 EDT-0400

After binge eating really bad processed food on May 4th-6th, I have been having the worst constipation and bloating of my life since then. It kept me up for 50 hours straight and I had to go to the ER on Friday night because I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I slept from 4AM Saturday to 2PM and haven‚Äôt slept since. I keep having sleep paralysis and I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm dying whenever I sleep. I had to get emergency benzodiazepines today because I can‚Äôt stop being scared. I have to wait till 7 tonight to take them so I can sleep. But I feel so terrified and lonely. My world is coming undone.

Sometimes, when it's over, I'm depressed because I feel I didn't make the most of it or have nothing ot show for it.

880,"My family got me a gift, but I don‚Äôt like or need it...can‚Äôt bear to tell them. It‚Äôs giving me so much anxiety just thinking about it.","My family bought me a gift...but I don‚Äôt have much use for it. This causes me a lot of guilt and anxiety and sadness.

I guess first world problems...

I just moved out of my mother‚Äôs house and got married and have a place of my own. My husband is a gamer, but sticks to consoles. A couple years ago he thought he‚Äôd get into PC gaming, but didn‚Äôt so he has a REALLY good PC that he built himself. It has tons of storage and like I said, he never got into PC gaming so it‚Äôs just been sitting there being used for menial tasks. That‚Äôs where I come in. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Sims and own from Sims 2-Sims 4 and play it a lot. Right now I‚Äôm on my Sims 3 binge so if you know Sims, you know that Sims 3 isn‚Äôt an easy game to play.

But my husband‚Äôs computer has it running within 2 minutes and runs really smoothly throughout the game, even with CC and the mods - no lag or anything. This isn‚Äôt a problem, again, because he mainly plays his consoles so when we‚Äôre doing alone time, I gravitate to the living room with the computer and be gravitates to the bedroom with the consoles. 

My birthday was August 22nd. My mom told me that she was working on a birthday gift that month but that it was running a bit late. No big deal. She gave no hints as to what it could be or anything. I had zero clue what to expect. My family has been struggling financially - especially with my wedding because my mom wanted to do things like buy my dress and help pay for catering or gifts, but has always been well, not great with money. 

But my mom told me that because of money, the gift would be delayed. No big deal. Got married October 3rd, went on the honeymoon and then came back. My mom dropped off my gift today and well, uh, wasn‚Äôt expecting it but she gave me a computer that she had her friend build and test...

It‚Äôs not a bad computer as far as I can tell - but my husband‚Äôs graphics card alone is 92% better in his words and we have zero need for a second one whatsoever. She said she wanted to give me my own Sims machine and that her, her partner, and my sister all contributed and thought it was the perfect idea, and again, mentioned that it was a lot of money and time put into it. We don‚Äôt even really have space for a second one. She said she wanted it to be like a his & hers gift so that my husband and I could do our own things - but again, when he‚Äôs on the computer, it‚Äôs usually to Google something. He has a few games, but nothing he plays a lot so sharing is not complicated and we just express what we want to do that day and plan accordingly.

She was so excited and asked if I liked it. I said I did, that I was just really surprised. I‚Äôm scared that she could tell that I didn‚Äôt like it. Or that if she couldn‚Äôt, my sister could.

I actually would have preferred a laptop because he‚Äôs been using a laptop for voice over stuff and we broke ours.

I hate gifts, by the way - because I hate the idea of not liking something and disappointing them. This is an on-going internal problem for me - I‚Äôm not the best at reactions and I always feel guilty if I don‚Äôt like something or love something; especially when people put a lot of time and effort into something. This feels doubly bad because I know how strapped for cash my family can be (even if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not responsible for it) and that a lot of thought and effort did go into this gift. 

She told me that whenever we get it set up, she wants to see it. She even brought over a table and chair because she couldn‚Äôt get us a desk.

Guys, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm probably going to cry and set it up, take some pictures, and shove it in the closet and only take it out if she‚Äôs coming over. My husband says I need to be blunt, but that‚Äôs just not in my nature.

899,How can I tell my doctor I need my medication raised? Currently on 0.5mg Clonazepam once every other day.,"So my doctor is very adamant about not having me take Clonazepam every day. She fills my script for 15pills for the month. Which I guess I‚Äôm okay with, though I‚Äôd really like to have more on deck, just in case. My schedule is all over the place, so I never know when I need to take my meds and that makes it hard to plan out my months worth of meds. I mean, when I have only 15 I really have to use them sparingly. Which is okay, but if something happens on one of the ‚Äúoff‚Äù days, it messes up the pills I do have for the rest of the month. My anxiety is unpredictable. I‚Äôm getting overwhelmed trying to ration them... I would feel so much better having extra, just so I know I have the option in case something happens. I don‚Äôt need to take them everyday, But I‚Äôd rather have some left over instead of stressing out about running out. 


Also, It‚Äôs been a little over two months now, and I don‚Äôt feel like 0.5mg is helping as much anymore. I know it‚Äôs the lowest dose, but I‚Äôm afraid if I ask for an increase on top of asking to be scripted more monthly doses she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm drug seeking. I‚Äôm new to anxiety meds, but I know the stigma against benzos. But I see so many other people being scripted 30 pills a month, and sometimes even more for those who take it twice 

daily. I‚Äôm just frustrated. She‚Äôs very against taking it daily, but I don‚Äôt feel like things are working the way they should. I have anxiety every single day so why shouldn‚Äôt I be taking anxiety meds just as frequently?? I just don‚Äôt get it....",12,2020-10-15 14:39:26 EDT-0400

901,Just looking for some advice via Propranolol and Sertraline,"Hi all,

I was taking 50mg of Sertraline for about 3 weeks but stopped after suddenly feeling 1000x worse after the 21st day. Felt amazing the day after stopping, but then about 1am that night started to feel the adrenaline rushing and being completely on-edge and hyper-aware. Took a quarter of my 50mg tablet at about 2am and started to chill out a little bit, but couldn't sleep til 7am.

Spoke to my doctor today and asked him for Propranolol to stop the physical effects while I wait for an appointment with a psychiatrist. Just wondering if they'll actually help my brand of anxiety? It's non-situational. I can just be sitting in my office like I have been for a couple of hours then suddenly feel a tinge at the back of my throat and descend into panic.

I'm just constantly on-edge, constantly worried I could slip into a panic attack any second.

Edit - just one other little question - is it likely I'll get proper withdrawals from Sertraline if I was taking 50mg for only three weeks?

903,Can't seem to move on?,"Hello, I am a long time lurker of this sub and I decided to post here, because I suffer from daily anxiety and honestly I am so exhausted of it. I can't seem to move on?

It began back in December, on the third...I was at school and I got this chest pain on the left side and I freaked out when googling because I seriously thought it was a heart attack! I freaked out so much that I became a little lightheaded in class and so my teacher called security to come and get me to the office, so my dad could take me home because I felt sick and dizzy, and couldn't breathe. 

&#x200B;

After that experience I couldn't go to school, and I vomited every time I ate. I became ill, weak and lost weight. I would scream for my parents to take me to the doctor every day  because I legit felt I was gonna die. 

This lasted until Feburary, I think...though I did have two doctor visits in March but that wasn't really part of it. 

&#x200B;

But its October now, I can't seem to move on? Every time I start to go back feeling a bit normalcy, the anxiety spikes again and I feel unsafe and vunerable again. And it's ruining my relationship with my parents. My mom is frustrated at me, she's always angry that I can't just ""grow up"" because I am eighteen and I shouldn't act like this, cause its not normal for my age.  The doctors I went too also called me ""attention-seeking"" and ""oversenstitive"".

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't see a pyschologist cause of the pandemic. I am always crying because I feel so bad everyday.  Sometimes I question if its really real or maybe I am just faking it to get attention, like everyone says. I feel like a coward..

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long rant...I just wanted to get it off my chest.  No one really wants to hear how I felt, people tend to shrug it off in if I tell them what happened, because it isn't a big deal..i guess.

If anyone has coping methods that would be very helpful. Again sorry for the long wall of text.",1,2020-10-13 03:14:28 EDT-0400

When I wake up I think about it, when I go to bed I think about it, been to the doctors numerous times and everything is fine, but im still scared to this day and thinking about it every second when there is nothing to worry about, I have no interest of sex, relationships whether I‚Äôm attracted to someone or not, it makes me uncomfortable, however I feel that if I face my fear, and have sex again (with protection of course) and then go to the doctors and everything comes back normal I should be fine? I should get over it? 
Thank you for reading I appreciate it",0,2020-10-08 12:21:23 EDT-0400
912,idk what to title this i just need advice,"ive been feeling a lot better lately. my anxiety hasnt gone away, but i barely have any damaging thoughts. overall ive been more positive lately for some reason and rn i probably feel the best ive felt in the past 2-3 years. i also struggle with an impostor syndrome. and because of me getting better (i even started making small plans for my future, like taking up a few courses, nothing major, but i NEVER had the energy to do things like this before) i for some reason think i faked my anxiety? even though im diagnosed and i still often feel anxious (every day to be exact, just not as often as i used to). i just feel guilty for not feeling as bad as i used to feel. 

i used to struggle with feeling like i faked my mental illness even in the darkest moments. thinking i do it for attention even though i dont share this with almost anyone. and when i do share i feel like it proves my point. 

right now i feel guilty for being better (especially cause it happened so randomly). and i think ive been faking it all along. has this happened to anyone and how do you deal? 

also i had this really weird ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling like a day after i suddenly got better. if any of u have done m*m@ (which i dont condone at all, please dont, it ruined my life) its like that but veeeery saturated. i felt like i love everyone and i even had that lightness in my body as if im floating. i used to have many grudges but now theyre suddenly gone and i just forgave everyone? i dont know what happened, it weirded me out. nothing in my life has changed and ive been sober for almost 2 years now.

this is so chaotic, i hope you get what im saying, im just really all over the place rn

915,Anxiety at work,"Hello, I  was just wondering if I could get some advice really.
I work as a tattoo artist. I love my job and have worked hard to get where I am however It can be quite overwhelming with the workload and pressure to continue doing my best work time and time again. My confidence is very easily shattered and it often snowballs into anxiety and depression until I brake down and have to take time off work. I am currently taking setraline to keep me on track and have been advised to find work somewhere else if tattooing is causing me so much anxiety. As I said before I do love my job and would be heartbroken if I had to give it up.

I have tried to cut back my work load and give myself Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays off work so I have time to keep on top of admin work such as drawing designs and replying to emails. This is working out really well for me and I feel a lot more in control. I can't help but feel guilty about taking the extra day for myself. Although I am self employed I feel that I'm letting people down and that people will think I'm lazy. I realise I may be over thinking this but it keeps going through my mind and I can't seem to shake it. I was wondering what other people think about the subject? Thank you in advance.",2,2020-10-08 17:11:36 EDT-0400

He has 2 older sisters and his mother. They are all very nice and welcoming to me. But in my head they hate me and think I am not good enough for him. Any comment they make, I spin it to be horrible and negative about me. This turns into debilitating anxiety - panic attacks and episodes that can last from 1 hour to 3 days. I am struggling to get over this anxiety and lack of confidence in myself. Has anyone experienced somethinf similar or have any advice?

922,I‚Äôve hit my peak,"Hey everybody, so to preface I‚Äôve hit my peak of anxiety. I wake up panic attacks and have then almost daily. I can just feel the immense tightness and weight of it all bearing down on my chest. My brain feels so tight from all my conflicting thoughts and feeling insane for my overthinking slippery slopes. Almost to unbearable. I‚Äôve made an appointment for the therapist. However, it‚Äôs not till early November and I am in a bad spot right now. It‚Äôs really manifested itself in my marriage. My husband knows I struggle with it bad and has been very generous and patient. However with this peak, I believe he‚Äôs hitting his limit of bearing through all my slippery slope overthinking accusations and constantly having to reassure me it‚Äôs all in my head. Which in return, I am having a massive panic attack about that. I don‚Äôt want my marriage to end over my anxiety when I‚Äôm this close to my appointment. I know my anxiety is my issue, but he doesn‚Äôt help. He will leave details out when I ask him things or not mention things or leave things out when I ask vague questions, to the point where I have to be extremely specific about things and I‚Äôm constantly thinking well was I specific enough or was there a loop hole. Why didn‚Äôt he mention it, is he trying to hide something? I don‚Äôt know how to cope until my appointment though. Should I just stop being some burden of stress to him and take a break from talking to him till then? should I tell him the marriage for whatever reason is the main source for my anxiety? Help please I feel like such at a loss. So frustrated that brain is arguing against itself and logic.

926,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn‚Äôt see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn‚Äôt right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn‚Äôt see my partner anymore. I didn‚Äôt have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don‚Äôt know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren‚Äôt the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I‚Äôve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I‚Äôll try to respond to you all later today.",72,2020-09-14 01:13:43 EDT-0400

929,Anxiety is not just feeling a bit nervous,">Let's squash that misconception right now. It's not a fleeting panic that can be corrected with reasonable effort and a bit of time. It's a pervasive, hungry, nasty monster. It doesn't listen to reason. It eats reason. It eats peace. It eats time. It eats joy. It eats the heart out of good days and makes them into rotten things.

930,One side-effect of anxiety that doesn't get talked about much is the self-doubt,"I am not talking about self-esteem. I am talking about doubting your own judgement due to awareness of your own anxious tendencies. Here's what risk analysis often looks like for me:

Me: 

> That seems risky, XYZ things could *definitely* go wrong, we don't want that to happen, best to avoid!

Also me:

> But wait! I know I'm prone to being overly anxious, this is probably just my anxiety talking. I should try to suppress my anxiety and carry on so I can have fun and fulfilling experiences like a normal person!

Also me:

> But... wait... am I now *overcorrecting* for my anxious tendencies and venturing into the realm of recklessness? Am I ignoring a REAL risk because I am blaming my anxiety issues on thinking this is a bad idea, when it is actually, logically, a bad idea, even to a normal person? 

Also me:

> So.... what did we decide? Are we doing this or not...? 

And round and round I go. I have anxiety about whether or not I have anxiety for christs sake. 

And don't even get me started on how this has effected my parenting since having a baby last year....",33,2020-09-14 02:45:48 EDT-0400

932,I suffer from pharmacologically induced anxiety and I feel like everybody invalidates my experience,"Hey!

I, like many balding men, took a drug name finasteride for hair loss. It is a potent drug that inhibits the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. I took 1.25mg/daily (which is a recommended dose for hair loss) for a year and half until early 2019, without any side effects that I was aware of. After that time, strange anxiety started to set in. Unfortunately, my father was dying and I was bullied at work, so I naturally thought that the strange anxiety must have been connected to my life situation. After some time my father died and the bullies were fired. Everything seemed to be getting better but my anxiety was only getting worse. I hit the rock bottom when I went to a vacation in Greece. I spent it all having extreme anxiety. Naturally, I was thinking I had something like a trauma so I became visitting a psychiatrist and a therapist. Nobody knew what was going on because I could not tell what I was having anxiety from. So they drugged me up. Meds did not help, I started being severely depressed because the anxiety was unbearable. I tried several different meds (SSRIs, benzos, atypical antidepressants, pregabalin) and half a year later my psychiatrist suggested getting off finasteride, because I **told him I read it could cause anxiety.** I saw improvement in early 2020, about two months after I quit finasteride , with almost full recovery in the coming months. By that time I have already forgot about finasteride being a possibility behind my anxiety, because both my psychiatrist and therapist kept constantly telling me that the bullying and death of a parent caused my anxiety (which was plausible I admit). Due to all the people taking finasteride on r/tressless and my doctors invalidating the possibility that finasteride could have caused such severe persistent anxiety, I was truly convinced I had experience some kind of trauma.

Fast forward, July 2020,  9 months after stopping finasteride I felt happy again. I became more productive at work, I even bought an apartment with my boyfriend. Life was normal again. After visiting a barber, I noticed my hair was progressively thinning again. I impulsively decided that I should restart finasteride. I thought I would start with a lower dosage at first, 1.25 mg but only 3x a week. I told myself that if even a miniscule amount of anxiety appeared, I would immediately stop. Unfortunately, I only took two doses and hell already broke loose. I was having extreme anxiety again, the same type as before. It became progressively worse over time, until I crashed a month ago and I was not able to do anything but lie in a bed because of my severe anxiety. I thought I damaged my brain or something. Fortunately after two months (which is now) I am seeing a slight improvement so I am hoping that I will fully recover again, like I did in the past. The drug is really scary, I saw reports on this site called [propeciahelp.com](https://propeciahelp.com) of people who took the drug and after stopping they have persistent side effects that never went away, even after years. Some of them lost jobs and committed suicide.   


Every day, I feel like everybody, especially doctors, invalidate my experience. They don't know much about finasteride, they don't bother to read something about it and keep telling me **it is all in my head.** The say that the anxiety from finasteride can't still be present two months after stopping the drug, ignoring that it is in fact supported by literature and lot of anecdotal evidence that finasteride can cause persistent neurological, physical and sexual side effects. It's really frustrating and makes me feel alone in this fight. Even my boyfriend does not believe me that much. I never had any generalized anxiety problems before I took finasteride, although I have OCD that is successfully under control for years and does not require any medication . I advise all of you who are taking medication based on steroids or hormone analogues, like hormonal contraceptives, corticosteroids, finasteride, etc. to at least think about the possibility that your anxiety can be caused/aggravated by the medication.",9,2020-09-13 23:05:23 EDT-0400
933,Please just read this. Wanna know I‚Äôm not completely alone. This is my story.,2 months ago. I had my first panic attack ever. Had no idea at the time what was happening other than the fact I was terrified and something was wrong. Went to ER for chest pain. All was good. Chest X-ray and EKG. All clear. It happened during an extremely stressful week. Since this happened I‚Äôve been crippled with anxiety. Like it‚Äôs not fun and it‚Äôs caused such a wide range of symptoms in constantly thinking something is wrong with me when I know there is not. I‚Äôm a healthy dude. Just graduated college where I was an Athlete for 5 years on the track team. I‚Äôm healthy like I know I am but this anxiety can feel so real with the symptoms it causes. It‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôve been getting better I really have and I‚Äôm going to beat this. I went thru some things like this when I was a kid but it was just very different type of anxiety. I‚Äôve always had it off and on but never this bad. If you‚Äôre still reading. Thank you. I appreciate you a lot. Guess I just wanna know I‚Äôm not alone in this and that someone can relate to me in some way. I‚Äôm gonna beat this anxiety and leave it behind me forever. I refuse to let it have a hold on my life.

how do i stop my brain from thinking of the literally worst option possible? i'm on the pill form of xanax and have been for a month now but i don't see it helping, instead, i've been even more anxious and paranoid. i was on diazepam for 4 months and it didn't help at all. the only thing that helps is 58508 drops of xanax but my psych stopped prescribing them after he saw that i was using them every single day and way above the dosage he recommended. it's so annoying that i can't tell if it's just my anxiety acting up or if i have some deadly disease (as luck would have it, i already have other illnesses and it makes me super paranoid that i might die from this shit). 

i'm scared to even go to the doctor's office cuz what if i don't have the virus now but i go there and get it?

i hate having anxiety so much. like it wasn't bad already, the universe really said 'fuck u ppl and ur already shitty mental health, here's a worldwide pandemic to make your life even shittier than it already is'.

945,"My brother has extreme anxiety that causes him daily physical pain, im worried he's capable of violence ...I don't know how to help","Hey y'all. Here's the story, my brother has had anxiety, ocd, and depression symptoms since he was a little kid. He's now a grown adult man with a family. Hes an alcoholic, he's suicidal, has anger issues, and he's exhausting everyone around him who wants to help. It has been terrible for YEARS for him. We, as a family, are almost to the point of giving up. We don't know what to do any more besides wait for the inevitable. 

He's seen psychologists, counselors, and therapists and has made zero progress. He actually just keeps getting worse. I fear that any day now, he will kill himself or worse, possibly kill my family along with his. I don't know what to do.

He currently takes klonopin which he said turns him into a zombie so he doesn't like it and he worries that he will become addicted to it if he takes it too often. But he said it works to stop his panic attacks. Otherwise he drinks himself into oblivion regularly to avoid feeling the pain, emotional and physical, that he feels every day. 

He has been abusive to his family and his wife. He has hurt himself (stabbed himself in the arm in an argument). He has problems with infidelity and his marriage is a joke and despite having this violent hatred of women, he seeks their approval so much that it consumes him entirely.

He basically can't function in life because of his condition. I just don't know what the fuck to do for him. He's lucky to have a bunch of friends that watch him closely and a family that lives nearby or surely he'd be dead by now. 

I've suggested he see a real psychiatrist but I'm doubtful that will help and doubtful he will try. I've suggested trying to get into a clinical trial for microdosing. I've tried to think outside the box to help him. I tried to start a new hobby with him so he could have an anchor. Something that would make him happy and get him to spend time with me. Last time we got together for, he got incredibly angry for no reason
and stormed off. 

I...just don't know what to do. anyone have any ideas or advice? I want to help him, but I and the rest of the world around him are üëå close to giving up.",6,2020-09-13 00:38:29 EDT-0400

I feel like I've missed out and I'm never gonna be able to catch up. I'm my mid-twenties and it feels like my life is flowing between my fingers. My mental state hinders my chances to even get close to experiencing something, it's exhausting. I'm a wallflower, the background actor, an alien. I have vibrant worlds in my head, which, ironically, makes me feel isolated even more, because none of it is real.

I feel like I'm not made for this world and even though I'm seeing a therapist, I don't think I'll ever be able to adapt.",5,2020-09-13 17:36:32 EDT-0400

At the time I thought huh, I must be sick or something because no I don't have mental health problems. And then it went on, I didn't address it, I forced myself to school on days I was really not wanting to go and now I realize it got a lot worse. Currently I don't want to go to school at all, I want to be back to distance learning because being away from everyone seemed to really help me come to terms with my thoughts.",5,2020-09-13 22:24:47 EDT-0400

949,My spouse gets exhausted with my anxiety,"To the person that feels like no one understands their anxiety, I am feeling that my spouse doesn‚Äôt understand mine. I have only recently identified the phobias and triggers related to my anxiety and they affect the trust I have in my spouse (we‚Äôve been together 10 years). When triggered I get really anxious about what my spouse is doing and I become overly paranoid. There is absolutely no reason for me to feel this way and I‚Äôve suffered from it for so long without giving it a name. 

I occasionally get triggered and my spouse notices my behavior. I have explained to him what it is but I am always so ashamed because it paints a horrible picture of him and it makes him feel extremely frustrated and hurt. 

Recently I tried suppressing the urge to seek reassurance so I won‚Äôt talk about it with him when it comes up. Sometimes he catches me off-guard and I break my silence and talk about it . This results in the same cycle of leaving him hurt and frustrated about dealing with the same thing over and over again.  
I have explained my anxiety before and I have explained how it‚Äôs not how I really feel about him. He thinks this invalidates his feelings and puts his feelings in the backseat. I understand this but knowing this makes me feel worse. He told me today that it‚Äôs just like most things that come across our minds in life. ‚ÄúWe have to suck it up‚Äù

I feel completely at fault but I know I need to be more forgiving of myself because this really is apart of me. I constantly try working on managing my anxiety with what resources are available and I will eventually make my way to therapy. 

Thank you to everyone apart of this community, it helps to know that so many people understand and experience the same thing.",6,2020-09-13 09:48:18 EDT-0400

However I still can‚Äôt help but be hesitant hearing about the sexual side effects. Having a sex drive is one of my favorite parts of being alive. And while my anxiety has impacted it. I‚Äôd still rather try to do something else. Then not be able to have one

I know that with cognitive behavioral therapy it can be just as effective if not more than medication. I know exercise and getting regular sleep can help it

this is kind of a dumb question to ask because I know I should be taking my medication that my doctor prescribed. But is there any luck with trying to make lifestyle changes and doing other methods as opposed to medication. In the case of severe anxiety",4,2020-11-06 23:47:51 EST-0500

963,Anxiety trigger is stomach aches,"Hi, one of my anxiety triggers is stomach aches. I don‚Äôt like stomach aches because I am very much afraid of vomiting. So I associate stomach aches with vomiting. Even though I have not vomited in like 7 years, I still fear it. So every time I get a stomach ache I also start to get anxiety. It is not always bad. Although since my stomach aches can last a while my anxiety tends to fluctuate. So when I am feeling my worst with my stomach ache such as feel like I am going to vomit then my anxiety picks up too. I get sweaty feet and hands. My heart rate goes up and I start to have some thoughts of what is going to happen such as vomit. The thoughts are not good because I just scare myself in which makes my anxiety worse. I have always felt like this. Since I can remember. Maybe because I can specifically remember the 4 times I have vomited throughout the years. I am now 24 so it infuriates me a bit that I‚Äôve been afraid of vomiting my whole life. Well since I can remember. 

Anyone else with a trigger similar to mine. If so are there any tips you have. I try to calm myself when my thoughts are racing. Or I sometimes pace around. But I haven‚Äôt found anything else that can help me ease my anxiety with this trigger. Oh I also do take medicine for my stomach ache such as a tums, pepto bismol, tea, ginger tablets, and other. Sometimes these help me in the moments but after a while if they aren‚Äôt working my anxiety goes back up.",4,2020-11-03 14:34:06 EST-0500

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.

Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm‚Äô.",245,2020-06-09 20:39:45 EDT-0400

983,Always paranoid my friends will leave me or they they secretly hate me/ think I‚Äôm annoying!!,"I‚Äôve felt like this for YEARS between my close highschool friend group and my close college friend group. I‚Äôm always so scared and anxious my friends will leave me because I think they are talking behind my back or because they think I‚Äôm annoying or any other reason. I am definitely more introverted but I do enjoy and value having friendships and going out with friends. The past year I have only seen my friends (from HS and college) a few times a year and I feel like they pick me last over their other friends (from HS or work friends) to do things with. I almost feel like a second class friend. I feel like I‚Äôve lost you with them and I don‚Äôt know how to get more ‚Äúin touch‚Äù with them without it being awkward or weird. I don‚Äôt know how to really describe. When I am around them hanging out I always feel liKe second choice even though there is no reason for it. Or sometimes I will be alone with just one friend (not a group) and I will freak myself out that I don‚Äôt know what to say to them or that they think they are annoyed that they have to spend time with me etc etc. Does anyone else feel this way with their friend group? I am ALWAYS paranoid they will leave me for someone else. There is no true reason for this paranoia. I don‚Äôt know how to stop this. Maybe this is part of growing up of only seeing your close friends a few times a year while they hang out more with other friends? Ugh I‚Äôm just sad, frustrated, and anxious I will have absolutely no friends. The thing is that I do have friends from both HS and college (2 years out of graduation) and I just don‚Äôt feel as close wirh them and they have chosen other friends besides me to be closer with. Most of the time on weekends I have no plans or anything and they ALWAYS have plans for something. I‚Äôm getting paranoid it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like me.

I was kicking ass at my job, I have sorted a long term medical problem, I achieved dreams this winter by freeride snowboarding a mountain. I came out as bi / genderfluid to my family and it went well.

But this year since then has fucked me up.

I haven't touched another human in three months. I've been single for 12 years. I have no contact in lockdown, not even a pet because I'm allergic to all of them.

All my healthy coping strategies that took years to build have been destroyed by lockdown and now rather than going to the gym or socialising i just drink all the time. I'm getting fat and i can't motivate myself to exercise. Booze, food, and escapism feels like my only pleasure.

Before this shit I was going to start dating, finally working up the resilience to do so, but now that shit has been torpedoed by the virus.

Now i have thoughts of self harm happening again every day recently.

I don't want to see any more fucking therapists any more i hate the idea of it. I can't go through reopening all that painful old stuff again i don't want to deal with this bullshit any more.

I don't want to burden my family with this, I've put them through enough.

992,Today has brought my anxiety back worse than it‚Äôs been in years.,"I‚Äôve always been anxious, I take my medication and I try my best to go about my day without it having to much of an effect. It used to be really bad, especially socially. I started taking propranolol and having small wins. It helped me a lot and I started doing really well in work and life etc. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of 7 years about 6 months ago. Moved into a studio apartment and 2020 hit. We got sent home to work which I knew wouldn‚Äôt be very good for me since I really suck at doing any type of work at home. 

I had a lot of health issues recently: low vit D, extremely low iron, low thyriod. As you‚Äôd expect these also had a huge impact on me being productive and I‚Äôve really been sucking at doing more than the bare minimum. It doesn‚Äôt help that I work from my couch or bed because I don‚Äôt have space for a table. 

Today though, I woke up and did some work from 9-9:30. Then I sat back for a bit and fell asleep. My phone had accidentally been turned to night mode so everything was silenced. I woke up at like 12:30 with missed calls from my boss, lots of messages, and no work done since 9:30. As things have to be actioned or else they sit there, my boss knew it had been like 3 hours. 

Because I didn‚Äôt have time to think anything up I said I was on a long phone call? For 3 hours? He obviously knew that was a lie but didn‚Äôt press. He was obviously annoyed. I worked through lunch and worked late but it‚Äôs not like he can really tell. 

Now I just feel like I don‚Äôt want to speak to another person again and I‚Äôve been on the verge of an anxiety attack all day/night. I feel sick and depressed at the same time and angry with myself. Social anxiety has come back like crazy and any customer calls I was almost speechless. Just really sucks and I almost feel like I‚Äôm back to square one after so much progress.

997,My own tips to relieve stomachaches caused by anxiety,"I have always had stomachaches caused by how I felt emotionally, as far back as 1st grade, and I'm 23 now. Largely they are caused by social anxiety and emetophobia (me/other people/seeing it on tv, etc)

I have a few tips that I thought I could share from my experience. They still happen but here are a few ways how I cope:

1. Remove yourself from a public place if possible - bathroom, bench, hallway. Fake a phonecall or be honest that you need some air, you don't have to hide that you don't feel well. Not having eyes on me reduces the feeling immensely.
2. Lay down or sit. Breathe.
3. Drink water, sparkling water, sprite/ginger ale, ginger/peppermint tea.
4. Chew mint gum, mints such as altoids or mentos, or ginger chews (such as chimes).
5. Blast anything on youtube that comes up under ""anxiety relief music"" in some headphones.
6. Turn on a video or show you can get engaged in. Something instructional such as makeup or a furniture DIY helps my mind forget.
7. Massage your stomach, sometimes I feel like my intestines need help with the gas building up.
8. My favorite over-the-counter remedy is a liquid medicine such as maalox or mylanta, it seems to cool down my whole throat and stomach. But the issue is I can't carry it everywhere. Tums and other tablets don't do it for me, but you can choose your own options.
9. Press the acupressure point at the junction of your thumb and index finger. I've helped many people by suggesting this haha

At this point, if these methods don't help me after 2 hours and only get worse, I can assume what's coming next and accept my fate. Even if it is scary, I know that I've been through it before and lived. Unpleasant but I know my body is only trying to help me.

There are some preparations I take to prevent stomachaches before they even happen. I'm sorry if you also suffer from the same endless cycle as me: stomach hurts > oh no my stomach hurts what if I...> stomach hurts even more.

1. Learn and take food safety precautions. Label food in your fridge. Store food at the correct temp. Wash hands.
2. Don't overeat. Order food that you assume is ordered more frequently (order a burger at a burger place, not a dish that is out of place like oysters). Don't get drunk!
3. Locate a restroom or escape plan in your head when you enter a new place (consider sitting at an aisle seat!) Carry some of the remedies above like gum. ball up a plastic bag and keep it in your pocket or bag.

I hope this helps someone! I know it's a tough thing to control, but having options will give you power!!",5,2020-06-12 07:10:01 EDT-0400

1000,Here‚Äôs what I did to help with my anxiety! It was very helpful to me so I thought that I‚Äôd share!,"I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety for 5 years now . Even though it‚Äôs not as bad as it was before, it‚Äôs still there. 

A while ago during one of my anxiety attacks and a usual dose of self hate and criticism, something in my mind clicked. My brain was being a toddler. I decided to try something new. I thought about it and realized that my anxiety was basically a toddler with major temper problems. I separated myself from myself to talk  to myself in my mind with the tone one would use when confronting a toddler. 

Say, for example, I‚Äôm panicking about visiting a friend. Me panicking was that toddler throwing a tantrum and refusing to go anywhere. I‚Äôd use my voice of reason and talk to this toddler in my head in a calm voice. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you want to go see your friend?‚Äù this would prompt me to think about a valid reason. I‚Äôd ‚Äòlisten‚Äô to the reasons and rationalize them and give a response to the toddler to help deal with being afraid of going to see a friend. Explain in a calm voice and try to not lose your cool because if you lose your cool, you‚Äôd have an upset toddler who wouldn‚Äôt listen. Be patient. The more you listen, comfort care for and try to help the toddler, the behavior of the toddler would get better and the ‚Äòtantrums‚Äô would decrease. 

I have no idea if this makes sense to anybody reading but I hope it helps in some way. I‚Äôm not sure what doing this would be called though lol. Doing this has helped me avoid many more anxiety attacks. Though it mightn‚Äôt be completely effective, it could help in some way!",46,2020-09-18 12:58:51 EDT-0400
1001,Spending lunch in the bathroom my first day of work just like my first day of high school,My trainer abandoned me to wander around the facility trying to find the lunch room on my own and all my coworkers didn‚Äôt bother to acknowledge me or say hi.

Stressed I‚Äôm going to cry in front of my trainer after being totally normal the first half of shift.

We have made friends here , we work with them , we have gone out with them but I feel like I am just faking it , i try to think of the conversations we are going to have before we have them so i can prepare myself and sometimes i don't know what to say and feel really awkward of anxious but I feel like I hide it well .

I just feel so alone , i don't feel comfortable with anyone, I can't talk to anyone without freaking out inside , I constantly cancel plans because I feel too anxious to go out and to self conscious too..I don't know what to do...",1,2020-09-18 18:27:38 EDT-0400

1006,Sometimes I feel normal then anxiety will hit and I literally lose control,"It's insane, I become a different... Well more all my coping strategies have been burying the anxious fears and they just stop working..so I'm the same but with no barriers.

I believe I am a complete burden to everyone around and feel physically sick over the idea of interacting with anyone. I ask myself why the hell am I talking to anyone, why would they care about what I have to say

I believe I have to cut everyone out of my life, I start deleting apps, removing myself from group. I'm so close to just snapping and telling everyone to stay away from me

I'm crying constantly, my head tells me I'm worthless, ill never amount to anything, everyone worries about me and they will so angry when you realise they're worrying over a nobody

I genuinely feel like I am an awful human being, I should subject anyone to me and I should hide or just die.

I fight so hard to overcome it, I force myself to interact with people, to go into work calls but I just... Don't exist. I actually wonder if I'm a ghost. I'll write messages (trying to be happy and light hearted) and it'll be ignored and the subject will be completely changed.

I try so so hard to be a good and kind person (because it doesn't actually feel natural, I have consciously be nice like wtf is wrong with me) and I find out people are actually uncomfortable with me and I'm too nice and giving.

I don't actually know who or what to be because everything I do is just not good enough.

Sometimes I can cope through it. I can gaslight myself ""no, you took that the wrong way"", ""no, they are just naturally good enough. You have to try harder"" until I'm hit with actual stress and I just snap.

I can't stop crying, my mood fluctuates so much I need a mood tracker, I'm self harming

I'm actually scared, I don't know what to do and I don't have anyone to turn too because literally everyone around me struggles with mental health and I can't add to their stress.

I don't actually feel safe because I know now I feel somewhat normal but if I crash again I don't know what happens. I am so scared and I don't know who to turn too",0,2020-09-18 15:21:31 EDT-0400
1007,Beating myself up over a bad day...,"I had a terrible anxiety day and had to talk to people about it to calm myself down...and now that it's passed I feel like an idiot. Why did I let it get the better of me, why did I feel so powerless when it happened? Why did I have to bother everyone with it? It's silly, and if I keep thinking that way it'll just get me right back to that state again....",0,2020-09-18 18:48:11 EDT-0400
1008,Worried that my life is passing me by - how to cope?,"So a little background on me: I‚Äôm 23, just graduated college in June, and my life has been completely derailed by the pandemic. I was dealing with some bad health anxiety and generalized anxiety during my senior year after a bad experience with MDMA left me with months of brain fog and visual disturbances, and just as I was starting to get better the pandemic hit. In the space of a week I go from having a promising future ahead of me to just disappointment and misery with seemingly no end. My graduation was cancelled, and was rescheduled to next year (but probably won‚Äôt happen if the current vaccine timeline is correct). I got accepted to journalism school at Columbia University, but ultimately had to turn it down because I didn‚Äôt think it was wise to pay such high tuition for what would possibly be more online classes, which I absolutely hated. I was supposed to move out and start and exciting new life, but that‚Äôs not happening anymore. And to top it all off I can‚Äôt even get a journalism internship, just rejection after rejection. 

Now the fall is coming and I‚Äôm feeling completely miserable. The summer was ok, since I live in New York State and I felt relatively safe with the low cases and the opportunity to do stuff outdoors. But now, since my family is all public school teachers the small circle of people i was in contact with is now high risk and I don‚Äôt feel safe seeing them, especially since my niece and nephew are attending preschool unmasked. My mom and dad are fed up with my worrying about long term effects, and I have essentially decided to isolate in my own house since my older parents refuse to see the risk in having said niece and nephew come over to play indoors multiple times per week. 

I might try to go back to journalism school next fall, but who‚Äôs to say it won‚Äôt be more of the same online bullshit? I just feel so upset knowing that probably 2 whole years of my life were just thrown away at the drop of a hat, and when this ends I‚Äôll be so far behind in starting my adult life. I‚Äôve only been on one date in my life, and I‚Äôll have missed out on two more years to do that. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that what should‚Äôve been the best years of my life were completely wasted and I‚Äôll never be able to make them up. I‚Äôm trying to cope by reading and writing and watching movies but it all feels so futile since I‚Äôm worried this will never end and even if it does I‚Äôm just going to have to prepare to drop my life on short notice for a few more years. How should I deal with this situation, and how should I have any sort of hope for the future? 

[TL; DR: Recent college grad, entire life was derailed by pandemic. Feel like my best years are wasted and I‚Äôm going to miss out on adulthood because of quarantine. Have to completely self-isolate for months since family isn‚Äôt taking risks seriously. How to feel like life is worth living at all?]",1,2020-09-18 18:48:12 EDT-0400
1009,My therapist said I'm making progress today!,"Today was a very emotional therapy session and even though it was hard initially, it felt good afterwards. 

I have always had a hard time expressing my feelings and emotions and it felt great to have her validate them and say ""yes you ARE making progress"". It is really hard but I'm hoping it gets even better from here. I'm noticing small things like sure I still bawl my eyes out with any confrontation, but I don't do it as quickly or as hard as I used to. I can start to process some of my feelings even when I'm emotional. 

The realization that my emotions aren't a problem just occurred to me at 23 years old lol.

1014,Please tell me i‚Äôm not alone,"So recently I‚Äôve been getting a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôm 14 and it started on my birthday when i first smoked weed (please don‚Äôt judge me bro i regret it sm) 
I always feel like i‚Äôm in a dream since then and i keep having panic attacks thinking i have memory loss or thinking i‚Äôm going crazy or i‚Äôm gonna die
If my mind doesn‚Äôt stop racing, which it doesn‚Äôt, i have an attack about it.. 
I can literally be thinking about anything and I‚Äôll get scared, and think that i‚Äôm overthinking too much...
One thing i‚Äôm also really scared about is self harm and suicide... I really don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd ever do it but when i get the panic attacks (which usually happen everyday) it‚Äôs like i‚Äôd do anything to stop them. 
I got one the other day and i had a cramp while i was going through it and it took my mind off it for a bit until i started thinking ‚ÄúWell what if i just hurt myself a little, it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôd commit suicide and it might take my mind off it..‚Äù After thinking that these panic attacks just got worse and worse, because on top of everything else,,, i‚Äôm terrified i‚Äôm going to hurt myself.. 
I‚Äôm also really scared this isn‚Äôt going to stop.. I want. life and career and husband I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with this shit i‚Äôve been going through it for about 3 weeks and i‚Äôve already had enough.. And everything i read says it‚Äôs not going to go away... this just scares me even more...
This might seem rude but knowing other people are going through this the same as i am or even worse helps me a lot... It makes me feel like i‚Äôm not alone..

Last night i came to the revelation that nobody really knows me. I never speak outside of my mind, and when i say never i really mean never... I‚Äôll go on a day to day basis saying the necessities like ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù ‚Äúyes ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù and i‚Äôll answer questions if people ask them... but i never speak besides that and that scares me

absolutely nobody knows ME

i don‚Äôt know when this started or if i was always like this... everything is just all f√ºcked up 

please tell me i‚Äôm not alone bro I can‚Äôt even focus on the simplest shit

i remember scrolling through insta or something and i‚Äôd see someone talking about having an anxiety attack and i‚Äôd think ‚ÄúOh it can‚Äôt be that bad...‚Äù

it really fucking is that bad 

I‚Äôd also see people being happy that they didn‚Äôt self harm and id think ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre happy about not doing it why would you do it in the first place.. why would you do something that makes you unhappy?‚Äù 

And it scares me because i understand why they would do it now.. I mean i haven‚Äôt done it but I understand why... 

I really fucking hope someone sees this I really don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore. Please rant in the comments about what it‚Äôs like for you, get it all out... it may help you.. i don‚Äôt know.. but what i do know is it will definitely help me.",6,2020-09-18 21:17:38 EDT-0400

1020,I am running out of hope.,"I‚Äòm 22. I‚Äôve suffered from anxiety + depression since 2011. In 2014, PTSD was thrown into the mix.

I just think my existence is a huge mistake and I am not meant to be here. I am terrified of other humans. I haven‚Äôt had a real job, other than working for my parents. This obviously doesn‚Äôt help with my self-esteem. I graduated high school early and have not been to college, again, due to my anxiety.

I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to survive when I can‚Äôt do the two basic things that everyone else seemingly does with ease. I also need to do those two things to live.

I don‚Äôt want to blame my parents, but they were very uninvolved in my life (too busy with work), so I feel like I had a loooot more ‚Äúalone time‚Äù than others growing up. Once I graduated high school, I feel like I was left like there was no longer this illusion of structure to hold me up, so I basically just fell into the pit of anxiety and depression, spending all day alone and in my head.

That‚Äôs why it has gotten really bad since graduating high school. The worst it has ever been. I‚Äôve been in therapy for almost 4 years, and while she helped me so much at first, I feel like she has turned into a... friend? She was recommend by family. She no longer has her license. I see her at her house since she lives nearby. I love our conversations. She does hold me accountable. But I feel like the boundaries have been blurred. For example, I can text her whenever I want and she‚Äôll respond. I think this has left me texting her when I should be utilizing coping mechanisms.

But what do you know? I‚Äôm too anxious to bring this up to her.

I‚Äôm too anxious for anything. I remember that I exist and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm on the brink of a panic attack. Sometimes just perceiving everything overwhelms me, like I‚Äôm being suffocated by stimuli.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I was young enough to remember the entire ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù phase that was happening a few years ago and... it‚Äôs only gotten so much fucking worse. So much worse than I could have even imagined.

And then I wonder: is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? Am I just doing this to myself? But I‚Äôm suffering, why would I want to suffer? No. I want to live. But I‚Äôm being bombarded by messages that tell me it‚Äôs my fault, that I have to help myself, as if I haven‚Äôt been trying.

A million realities and perspectives bombard my head by the fucking second. What this person sees. What the other sees. What they think. How they‚Äôll react. What it‚Äôll mean.

The only times I‚Äôve ever felt relief from this are when I took a bar of Xanax or Vyvanse. Which I think are both controlled substances? And highly addictive? And don‚Äôt last as long as I need them to?

So then I think about how it is actually possible to exist in the headspace I desire but I‚Äôll only ever achieve it short-term and through a pill... it makes me want to cry. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm suffocating and drowning. I want it to end.

I have no talents, I have no qualities, no strengths. Nothing to give anyone. I‚Äôm just a ball of anxiety and fear, and I don‚Äôt belong here.",6,2020-09-18 23:32:54 EDT-0400

Hey guys 21 m here help me out

Can someone explain me what this is, 

I feel on autopilot all the time for the past 10-20 days. I don't feel anything much. I do feel really depressed or my emotions suppressed,  I sometimes  feel like what's happening around me feels so unreal or just weird. Like i'll be laughing and talking but in within a moment i feel numb. 

But more importantly this feeling is what I don't understand, i am zoned out alot, i am doing things normally and suddenly realise i have been zoned out or i feel like i just got out of zoning out, and before i know it i am  again zoning out, like it happens constantly i guess, even right now maybe

And this feeling like I'm talking to someone, (i can hardly keep up the convo, I've noticed i forget things while I'm speaking in a long sentence) . So i'm talking to someone, normally it appears normal , maybe cause I'm speaking in autopilot, and after speaking I walk away  and when i think or look back , I'm like did i just have the convo? Felt so weird, like did i or not? I clearly remember i did, but I don't feel it, and this is not just with talking to people but with everything else. Like i drive which suddenly feels  overwhelming and I suddenly reach my destination,  or even the smallest things, like I'm in the washroom doing my business i come out and sit and feel like did i just go or not? Like i did go, but it feels weird like I didn't feel it

GUYS PLEASE HELP ME EXPLAIN THIS I HAVE BEEN FEELING THIS FOR THE LAST 10-20 days. 

I had a breakup for month which was really stressful, i was in a toxic relationship where we fought physically too but always made up, holding on to the breakup was painful cause i kept going to her and got rejected so came home feeling numb couple of times. And cried alot too, didn't sleep properly for a week(4/5 hours) , which actually triggered this , and i had left weed, 1/2 years ago which triggered a bit of anxiety. I have patched up now and things are great but i've been experiencing this and feel totally numb even around her. which is really disappointing cause I don't feel engaged i want to engage. I don't feel engaged with my environment too, things get slightly better for a few hours and really foggy or disoriented at times.

I just have to go to the doctor to get my drug test done so... not a fan of that but I'm pushing through lol.

When I started this whole process, it was incredibly, almost debilitatingly scary, but I'm here and it's nowhere near as bad as my anxious brain was making it out to be. Anxiety can keep you down, and it's really hard to get anywhere in life when you're worried out of your mind about the worst case scenarios.

1047,"Me: ""I hate my brain"". Them: ""I love your brain""","Its a sentiment I've heard a few times from loved ones.  The thought being that despite the anxiety, the fear, the pain, the shame, the inability to function like a normal human being, there are qualities that redeem it in there.  The idea that I'm not a broken person, just a person with problems that can be dealt with.

But who the fuck cares what they think?  It's easy to love something when you don't have to deal with it every day.  It's easy to love someone when you don't have to be in their head, to hear the horrible thoughts 
they can't force away, or to break down and be unable to move because your brain decided to be a dick that day.  ""You love my brain"".  Fuck off, MY brain isn't making YOU second guess every fucking decision of every fucking second.  MY brain isn't making YOU want to hurt yourself because it's the only way to cope with your emotions sometimes.  YOU loving ME doesn't change the fact that I hate MY brain for putting ME through this.

Sorry if the rant comes off as preachy or edgy, but it's just an honest train of thought based on recent experience.

And I understand the sentiment behind what these people are saying, and know that rationally its their way of expressing love and support.  But it sure hurts to hear it some days.",7,2020-07-22 17:05:21 EDT-0400

Hi everyone, I am feeling lost, and I really, really don't know what to do.

I don't think that anybody will have a miracle solution for me, but I really need to vent, because I am constantly on the verge of crying...

In my country, we are forced into mandatory service for about 3 years. I was recruited, obviously, against my choice, and worked in an office job due to asthma and various problems. I basically did the dirty work for officers at higher ranks than me, arranged schedules, summed up things and made coffee, a secretary. I feel like I've ""Wasted"" 3 years of my life doing practically nothing, but that's okay, I felt more than overjoyed when it was over, and always dreamt about how I'd pursue my dream career and fulfill my dream, living as a free man and working at a moderate job that I'd be happy with. It's been a year since I've finished my service, and during the first months, I couldn't ever be more overjoyed. I soon after started taking something called a ""Psychometric Exam"" (Which are pretty much the local SATs, only that they are taken way more into consideration here when enrolling to University more than anything for some reason) and paid for it with the grand the army gave me. I worked part time as a teacher assistant at school and things were quite stressful but okay. Covid stroke mid-way through my course, delaying it from 3 months to 6, but at the end of things, I aced this exam and enrolled onto quite a good University at a Computer Science major. Ever since I was a child, I grew up with a Gameboy Color and a copy of Pokemon Silver in hand. I was infatuated with this small machine, and told myself that I want to make things just like this when I grow up, I decided that my dream was making videogames, and that this is the career that I want to pursue. Although, as I grew older, I found out that I am also fascinated with just creating my own projects in generals, I think I'd be pretty happy making apps, games or websites. When I was 12, I began pursuing my dream and learnt art and animation out of all, and I was horrible at it at first, but now I think I make some quite decent graphic design and animation in 2D with Adobe Flash CS/Animation CC. Even though I had the art and visual aspects of a game, I never had the programming talents. But I decided that once I'd start my degree, I'd get hang of it and be able to profess and maybe even mix both of my loves for art and creation. About 3 weeks ago, I have started my Computer Science degree. A degree I've pursued for a while, and was sure that I was on the right path in life. Yet my whole world fell apart quite quickly. I don't do well at all under pressure, and maybe it was very naive of me, and please, don't judge me harshly there, I am already super hard on myself, but I simply collapsed. I was never the top of my class when it comes down to mathematics, I was pretty average. Yet, I just couldn't comprehend that this is the level of math required for this degree. I was overwhelmed, I barely Understood a thing, and 90% of my classes were mathematics. I found myself studying it all day, every day, at home from my small room with my PC 8 AM until 6 PM, then overflooded with assignments every day from 6 PM until 10 to 11 PM, yet I \*still\* couldn't keep up with the pace. I barely made it in time for my assignments, I barely understood my professors, and more than anything, I felt lost and anxious. My body reacted badly, very, very badly. I felt the constant need to vomit, I was crying all the damn time, my heartbeat was rising out of the blue like mad, I had headaches, I felt fatigued all the time, I couldn't eat a thing, and I even couldn't sleep. I remember the last week fondly in that regard, where I actually had to wait for the professor to upload the next assignment, it was the first night in two weeks where I had ""no assignments"" at all whatsoever until the next one was uploaded, yet I was so tired, it was 7 PM and I've just finished school, so I decided to go to sleep. Yet all that ran through my mind was formulas that didn't even exist, I felt insane. I tried so hard not to think about a thing, I just wanted to sleep, yet I woke up every 15 minutes, during the whole night, I waited in tears to tell my mom that I just couldn't sleep at all that night. And I felt myself collapsing. I saw a doctor, which offered me pills and a psychiatrist, but I've turned the offer down, not wanting to take chemical pills on a regular basis, I went for a natural remedy, which did basically nothing, if anything, it made me feel even more fatigued. I talked to my friends, to my family, to people who had completed this degree and people who were one year above me, looking for answers, for a tiny peak of hope. The people who did it told me that if anything, things gets worse, you get even less free time, and you get even more courses, and the courses obviously, too, get harder. I felt myself suffocating until I couldn't handle it anymore, and last Friday, I quit. I didn't feel relieved until a few days ago, but now the anxiety had replaced itself with depression. Suddenly, the whole world seems gloom, gray-scaled. I can't find any passion that I want to pursue, I can't even focus on my hobbies anymore. I've been told by friends that I absolutely dont need a degree in this field, yet that it would certainly help. But I am dreadful, I at first thought that maybe this profession ain't for me after all, and to be frank, I still ain't so sure. But earlier this week, I took some courses on uDemy, learning some different things rather than the abstract mathematics and C langauge they've told us in this brief while that I already collapsed during. I found Javascript and Python quite enjoyable, but of course, I am just a beginner, so it might not reflect anything, but I do enjoy this front-end course I am taking. Yet, I am filled with dread and confusion, I don't know which path to take, everything seems so big and scary, I am afraid of finding out that I won't even like computer science, because I absolutely have no other passion, I am afraid of not having a degree, that no employer will look at me seriously, or heck, that I might even find myself 5-10 years into the future at some lousy job/fired and then stuck with no degree in my late 20s/30s. I thought about maybe taking night courses that are spread across 3 semesters instead of 2 a year in college instead, which means a less prestigious degree, and also nobody promised me that it'll solve the problem and make things easier on me. I just wanna calm down, I wanna know that things will be okay, but everything is so scary and depressing all of the sudden. I still cry a lot, and now I am also in debt to the University, demanding 40% of the first year's payment because I quit, which is ridiculous. I come from a poor family, and I really want to break the cycle, but for the first time in my life, ironically, just now, when I tried to, I feel poorer than ever. I actually feel what it's like not having money. Courses are expensive, so is University and College. I don't know what to do...",6,2020-11-07 22:00:48 EST-0500

1069,Do you ever think about how we're all figuring it out at the same time? It's honestly beautiful.,"All of us. We all don't know what the fuck we're doing. We haven't the slightest idea. Its trial and error. We fuck up so that we can pass that knowledge on and possibly help the next person. All we have is a shitty ""road map"". Slight guidelines we've picked up from rom-com's and Disney movies. You grow up, you find a fantastic job without any issue, you just happen to run into the person thats ""meant"" for you. You buy a house, get married and fall deeply in love, pop out a few kids and Ta Da! you did it. 

We all know its bullshit. And it is so comforting for me to think about how we're all just trying to figure it out. Trying to figure out how to be happy. No one truly know how to do it. And no one ever will. So we just have to help each other. To find out own personal versions of happiness.The ultimate goal in a world where it's near impossible to keep a straight and narrow path. 

This was on my brain and I felt I should share. As a person who deals with anxiety and depression, I found this thought to be very refreshing. It helped me and made it a little easier for me to breathe. I hope it helps you too.",4,2020-11-08 05:24:49 EST-0500

I am so insanely depressed. I don‚Äôt want to stand, shower, brush my teeth, anything. I quit my job because I thought it to be unfair to just call in sick every day because I can‚Äôt even go outside without freaking out. I feel like I‚Äôm dying every second of the day, and I‚Äôve been self harming after a year clean from it. I feel hopeless.

I have an appointment for my doctor on the 16th, but that‚Äôs just too far away for me to continue living like this. I‚Äôm on propranolol to help with my anxiety, but no matter how much I take, it doesn‚Äôt take away my anxiety, which freaks me out more.

1076,I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fianc√©. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me.",58,2020-06-28 21:13:20 EDT-0400
1077,"If you're overwhelmed right now, take a walk.","Take a walk, whether it's around your house, or even in your room or lounge room if you're afraid to get out of your house.

1078,"Does anyone else only allow themselves to do things they enjoy when it‚Äôs deserved (ex: after accomplishing something, or on the weekends)?","I have always worked from home part time, and I realized lately that what I thought what just good discipline might just be anxiety and guilt derived from anxiety. 
 
I‚Äôm starting to realize that life is really short. I could go at any time. And what will my life have meant if I stopped myself from nearly every innocent little desire I had in the name of being disciplined? I think weekdays should be filled with taking care of your responsibilities of course,  but also with your favorite meals, books, tv shows, video games, etc. 
I feel like society tells us that it‚Äôs admirable to be burnt out and that you‚Äôve given every last bit of yourself to your work or schooling, hardly eaten, and waved off simple pleasures in the name of productivity. But these little pleasures are what life is all about. And I‚Äôll be damned if I let anxiety or society tell me I can‚Äôt have an extra special dressed up sandwich for lunch or take a bubble bath on a Wednesday night. 

With anxiety and depression especially for me personally those little things can sometimes make the difference in how bad a day was. Just wanted to share in case anyone else does this to themselves...have the lunch you really want, play the video game, and let yourself smile like a kid again at the simplest joys of life. You‚Äôre not a bad person, you‚Äôre just another little life form trying to make it by on this planet and you have every right to make it a wonderful ride.",9,2020-06-22 18:52:20 EDT-0400

Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying.

1090,A fable that helped me today.,"A Japanese Zen fable I read today made me smile and helped put some things into perspective. 

Two monks were crossing a river and met a woman who was trying to do the same. The woman asked them to help her cross the river, now they have taken advanced vows and were not supposed to touch women. The older monk shrugged and guided the woman and put her on his back and  crossed the raging river. When they reached the other side, he put her down without a word and continued on. After a few hours, the younger monk asked him: You touched a woman, why did you do that? 

The older monk answered:  we left her hours ago, why are you still carrying her? 

I dont know, there is something about this fable that made me think I am the one carrying all these things from the past that is making me suffer (anxiety and overthinking) maybe it helps to let it go and continue on like what the older monk did.",2,2020-06-28 04:36:26 EDT-0400

But yesterday I randomly remembered that I owned an adult colouring book which I‚Äôve only used a couple of times (like years ago when I had purchased it). 

So I sat down at my study table, dimmed the lights and played my favorite calming music (which is, not that anybody cares but, korean r&b, but you can even play some soothing piano music on youtube, there‚Äôs lots of amazing options. even rain sounds on YouTube!) and I just started colouring. I think I was colouring for an hour? All my anxiety and racing thoughts vanished. It was such a beautiful, calm hour.

I‚Äôm 27(M) and these thoughts keep me up at night, during the day they stop me from pursuing any of my interests because I get overwhelmed with the thoughts and anxiety that in 20-25 years all of it will have been for nothing. I believe that the ultimate goal and purpose in life is creating happiness in your own life and how you live it. But with the way things are trending right now I struggle to envision a future that is full of happiness, a future for myself where anything I pursue will actually still matter or have any effect. I have things that I‚Äôm passionate about but the anxiety of these thoughts that it will all be pointless and futile in my near future stop me from pursuing any of them. Sometimes it almost feels similar to playing a game you love, but you don‚Äôt finish the final level because you never want the game to end. So you put it down and subconsciously satisfy yourself by never finishing it. Maybe if I never pursue these goals the future that looks so bleak in my mind will never come to pass. Maybe these goals I want to achieve and the person I want to be won‚Äôt be futile and pointless in the near future because I never created that possible scenario of success and happiness in my mind in the first place.

1114,"Okay, So I've Become Afraid of My Shower","I need to take a shower. I have pushed it to my absolute limit (4 days, with ""bird baths"" in the sink to keep stank away). My hair needs to be washed, and I need a proper shower.

Here's the problem. Over the past month or two, I have developed a slowly-building fear of my shower. I know that sounds stupid, but I'm afraid of falling. My shower is set up like a death trap IMO. It's a small, rather narrow stall with one side completely made up of a big pane of glass. If I did fall, I would very likely hit that glass. If I hit it, I would go through it. it's just inevitable - there's no room in there. I keep imagining myself falling through the glass and getting horribly maimed, face destroyed, or even killed. I live alone, so no one would even come rushing to my aid. 

The fear has been getting worse and worse, until hitting its apparent peak this week. I just can't bring myself to go in there. I bought some little gripper things to stick on the shower floor, but they don't seem very sturdy, and I'm not sure they're really all that useful.

 It started with depersonalization and derealization, as well as being a bit more uncoordinated, but my chest started feeling way tight and it's hard to breathe deep enough and my throat feels tight. I got really dizzy a couple of times and had to sit down, and keep getting hot flashes. I also feel like my brain is moving sluggishly and it's hard for me to think fast. Usually with anxiety attacks, I get all of those, but with little electric-shock pulses up the back of my scalp and the surges of anxiety.

While I can understand firsthand how isolating it can be before finding out your diagnosis and treatment plan, Reddit should not be your primary source of information.  To my knowledge, there isn't a medical professional in the world that could diagnose someone from a few lines of text; yet, I see people with presumably no qualifications doing it on here often.  You can be socially awkward without having social anxiety.   You can feel vulnerable in places or nervous without getting a panic attack.  The only way to know for sure is to see a licensed professional and if you do have something, then you can be put on a treatment plan and come to this subreddit for support.  But getting premature ideas on here is like googling how to treat a minor cut and finding that one random article that says you might die of sepsis (and letting that thought consume you).  Don't do it. It's dangerous to go down that rabbit hole.  Just because I've had GAD (diagnosed) for 13 years, I am not qualified to take on your particular diagnosis.   Seek professional help first.

1124,I need some reassurance about taking medications,"Hi. I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl and i‚Äôve had severe anxiety and depression with bpd for most of my life. 

I have a SEVERE fear of medication, and also throwing up, fainting, having a seizure. I won‚Äôt even take benadryl or medicine with caffeine because i am so scared of disturbing what little control i have over my body already... So i‚Äôve suffered with nothing to help me mentally for a very very long time. 
I was prescribed Celexa at around age 14 but i never took it bc said reason, but i have taken LOW LOW (like .5 mg) of ativan for some crazy panic attacks in extreme emergency‚Äôs where i was desperate. I don‚Äôt even think it did anything and it was more of a placebo effect but now i‚Äôm getting off topic. 

Today i saw a new doctor and he prescribed me 10MG of celexa, and 10MG of Compazine for some nausea problems i‚Äôve been having. (i‚Äôve taken zofran and was fine, but i guess you can‚Äôt take that with celexa) 

Obviously, being the idiot i am i looked them up. and freaked myself out. bad. 
I‚Äôm basically certain that i‚Äôm not going to take the Compazine at all bc of what i‚Äôve read, it seems to be a ‚Äúfear pill‚Äù. 
I also read some stuff about celexa making people feel ‚Äúworse‚Äù and like a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù until it fully kicks in. Everything i‚Äôve read about it almost seems like it‚Äôs horrible at first. 
This is really really scaring me, I really don‚Äôt know if i can risk my anxiety getting worse. But i know i finally need to just take the leap and actually take the Celexa if i want to try and live normally again. I‚Äôm 19, i couldn‚Äôt finish highschool, I haven‚Äôt worked in 2 years, and i‚Äôm bordering agoraphobia. Just getting into a doctors office was so hard for me. 
Can someone just please, calm me down about this? I‚Äôm afraid of upsetting my doctor if i tell him i didn‚Äôt take it like he asked. and i‚Äôm afraid of taking it. I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my Dad and everyone who seems so proud of me for actually trying to get better finally. 

   Isn‚Äôt it weird how living so long with anxiety, you become almost comfortable in your uncomfortable-ness? like i‚Äôd rather be at a level i know is caused naturally, than risk having it be disturbed by a medication. I‚Äôve lived most of my life this way, I obviously pray and wish every day i could just be normal.. But that almost scares me because i‚Äôm just so USED TO this horribleness.

Fast forward and I hadn't been back to the dentist since. A lot of it had to do with anxiety about ""what if I have gingivitis?"" and ""what if they say all my teeth are going to fall out?"" 

I had an appointment with a new dentist this week. 

Also, I asked my new hygenist if I had gingivitis because I could taste blood when she flossed.  She said ""most people will bleed when I floss and clean because I'm reaching areas that they can't. Most everyone has a little problem with gingivitis at some point, just like most everyone has issues with low vitamin D.

Sometime my anxiety transform into anger  and I'm so afraid  at what i can do when i am like this.

1131,"Can anyone else relate to the general expression about ""an idle mind"" being the ""devil's"" or ""anxiety's plaything""?","Hi.

The reason I am asking is that whenever scenarios that come up in which I sitting idly, without something to engage with or focus my mind on - (fidgets, a book, journal), my mind starts to kinda spiral into a mess of disorganized chaos. I need activities to focus my mind on to keep me tethered to calmness and nor spiral from anxiety. Some things I do include gaming, reading, writing, walking/hiking, watching TV, and journaling.

More on the journaling- I'm not suggesting that I am neglecting or ignoring my anxiety; I dedicate times to journaling so I can appropiatley process my thoughts and feelings. It frustrates me a little when people on the internet are quick to coin the term ""distractions"" in what appears to be a demeaning way. Keeping in mind that I do devote time to acknolwedging my anxiety, there's nothing wrong with otherwise devoting my free/leisure time to my hobbies/passions for not only my enjoyment, but a relief from my anxiety, is there?

Any input I could get would be immensely appreciated, please.

Thank you.",2,2020-05-22 23:03:00 EDT-0400

I have had anxiety and depression on and off for many years now. I‚Äôm currently on valdoxan for depression which works amazingly. I do CBT which has helped me in the past, and up until recently I think was helping me a lot.

Two weeks ago I found out my aunty, who has had terminal cancer for some time, is no longer receiving treatment and will only have a few months left. My mum (her sister) died very suddenly from cancer two years ago, and this aunty is like my second mum. I never got the chance to grieve properly for family, work and study related reasons, and currently in therapy, I‚Äôm working on coming to terms with my mum passing. This news is stirring up a buttload of memories and emotions, which is fine, but my anxiety has gotten so bad to the point of me being unable to function day-to-day. I can‚Äôt sleep, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna throw up or choke, I have crying fits, I‚Äôm scared to leave the house, and my mind is so noisy. I do yoga, running, mindfulness when I can (at the moment every other day). The anxiety often passes in the afternoon, but the mornings at the moment are unbearable, I can‚Äôt live like this. 

I should add that I‚Äôve just recently moved abroad, and don‚Äôt think I can get back to my home country Cos of travel restrictions. I don‚Äôt speak the language here and so there‚Äôs the anxiety from that building up too. 

So basically, I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs something that I can take occasionally when the anxiety is so bad that I can‚Äôt do anything else to soothe it for a little bit. I have an appointment with psychiatrist tomorrow but I think it‚Äôs always good to go in with some kind of idea. 

I really hope you guys can help. Thanks in advance.",3,2020-05-22 21:39:41 EDT-0400
1145,Dating anxiety,"Hi all. This is my first ever post. 

I am a 30 year old male. I haven't been on any dates in about 2 years. 

I'm very good at talking to matches from dating apps and at calls/video calls, but the thought of meeting up on a date fills me with first anxiety, and then dread. 

I have arranged dates multiple times over the past 2 years and each time as I have drawn closer to the date I have cancelled. I have lost many great girls like this. 

Up until about 2016, I could go on dates quite easily. I didn't have this sense of dread. Then about midway during 2016 I started to feel small degrees of panic. Losing concentration, intense nausea during dates, hot flushes, tight throat, sweating, unable to focus on what's being said, heart palpitations and perhaps some other things I can't remember right now. 

This panic builds to a point where I'm possessed by a compulsion to ""escape"". I have to get out. 

This has plagued me since then. Strangely enough, if I meet someone randomly, I can handle myself well. Similarly if I meet a female friend I don't have the same problem.

Does anyone have any helpful thoughts or advice? 

Thank you,
Chris",3,2020-05-23 00:03:19 EDT-0400

Distractions are not working, even when I'm watching TV or listening to music or talking to others I can still experience and feel these sensations. 

Meditation and Yoga? It's my 3rd time doing YOGA and I don't know if it's helping but i kinda feel the same. Been doing meditation since last month, I feel it works during the moment then I'm back with the same sensations. 

Exercise? I love doing workouts, I do it daily.  I do at home dance exercises and go for a jog and walk. 
I don't know if this is helping either. But when I'm outside I kind of feel back to my regular self. 

Help? I've been trying.. I've been trying all week and since the start of this month trying to get through to my local doctors and university doctors and still no luck. Every day I'm tempted to call the ER/hospital because I fear something is terribly wrong with my heart and breathing and I'm dying inside. I'm also going to call those anxiety helplines because I need professional help and I need a resolution to this HA. Everybody is just watching me suffer. 

I need help... I need therapy, I need treatment, I need advice and support, I'm open to medication.

1151,How do you cope with high levels of nausea from a panic attack?,"My biggest problem with panic attacks is nausea. I can't find anything out there that relates to this. It's that heavy and deeply uncomfortable feeling of nausea that is the problem.

The faster heart, perhaps a bit of sweating and shaky speech are not too much of a problem, it's the heavy and distressing nausea that is. How do you cope with this? During these episodes I feel like I often can't move because I am too nauseated. I recently had a panic attack whilst driving (something that has never happened before, driving usually calms me down) and I pulled over to the side of the motorway. Once things had eased slightly and I had to re-join the motorway, I had to turn my neck and body to look almost 180 degrees behind me to spot a gap in the traffic and I felt like I couldn't even move my neck past about 45 degrees otherwise the nausea would intensify.

This has always been the main problem for me. Not the fear of dying or that I am ill. Not the fear that I am having a cardiac event. Not that I am in danger. It's the NAUSEA.

I am unemployed and I don't see how I am going to cope in a more serious environment. At least when I was in the car I could choose where it went, how fast it went and when to pull over or even get out of the car. At work you don't have those choices and I was blighted by anxiety at my previous jobs. It really scares me. No amount of talk therapy or medications have helped, except for benzos, however they are not always available and I don't want to become dependent, plus very occasionally they fail to stop these feelings. I have so much fear of this happening. I have had this my entire life.",18,2020-08-25 05:49:18 EDT-0400

1163,Waking up in the middle of a full blown panic attack?,"So I've had more than 5 but less than 10 panic attacks in my life. They always involve two things, my heart beating fast enough to shake my body and me contemplating if im dying. They all last roughly 15 - 20 minutes and usually involve me jumping into a cold shower to slow my breathing down which tends to bring my heart rate down enough for me to contain myself. Even though they're terrifying for me, they seem to be pretty mild compared to what I've read other people talk about. Anyways last night was the first time I actually woke up in the middle of one and it was absolutely wild.

I went to be bed pretty stressed out, fell asleep really hard (5ish am) and woke up only about an hour later (6:22am) with my heart racing so hard that I jumped out of bed. Immediately the first thing I noticed was that I did not recognize my room in the dark, the picture frame on my wall looked different my mind went full blown disorienting with me wondering ""where the fuck am I and wtf is happening?""

I make my way out of my room into my dark hall and still feel as though I'm not in my home and my panic intensifies a bit, I make my way into my living room and kitchen (all still in the dark) and everything felt bigger and different, it was really spooky for the roughly 60 seconds it was going on. I make it back to my room, throw my lights on and immediately recognize my room and start to realize my symptoms and that I'm having a panic attack which actually calmed me down a bit since I knew what was going on. I went to my bathroom, said ""what the fuck was that?"" and then crawled into bed and did some googling about waking up in the middle of a panic attack.

1176,Heart Palpitations (Heart thumping/pounding) & Anxiety,"I've had anxiety issues for a long time, some periods much worse than others. But I spent a lot of years in denial about how bad it really was. I thought that because I could function reasonably well, then it must not be much of an issue. Early last month, I was definitely feeling nervous and overly anxious due to the pandemic and a lot of issues in my life surrounding that. I didn't realize how much everything was impacting me until it all just came over me, a flood of panic. It started by just laying down with heart palpitations, being unable to sleep. Then I spiraled into panic mode and couldn't seem to calm myself. I didn't sleep for two nights. 

Since then, I've reached out for some help. But the past almost two months have been the most difficult my anxiety has ever been. The physical symptoms have really kept me in a spiral loop of constant fear. The palpitations have never gone away. It's a constant noticing of my heartbeat all day every day,  unless I'm completely distracted or walking, doing something that can help me forget. I had blood work, heart test, all normal. My doctors fully believe it's a symptom of my anxiety and I do too. But it doesn't make it any easier.

1185,the worst panic attacks are just the fear of fear itself. if ur not afraid of being afraid then u don't creature the circle of self perpetuating anxiety. That's what I realized I thought maybe it could help someone who reads this.,,6,2020-06-01 02:05:59 EDT-0400

1187,"It took 40 years, but today I finally realized that I have anxiety.","Hello everyone!  As I mentioned in the title, I am 40 years old and I have suffered from anxiety all my life.  But I had no idea.

In short, since I was a child I have always felt an obsession with death, an irrational fear of dogs, of being robbed, anguish, sadness, lack of interest in others and socializing and an excessive concern with everything.

When I reached adulthood, I unconsciously realized that if I consumed alcohol, life would go better.  And, unfortunately, I chosed  this path.  Unsurprisingly, it didn't go well.

As I drank only at night, alone, at home, I increasingly isolated myself from the world.  I have reached this stage when I have no friends.  The only interaction I have with people is at work.

Also for professional reasons, today I visited a website of a clinic that also has psychotherapy and started to read.  I freaked out.  That was the description of what I have always felt.

Conclusion - I learned that all symptoms are not who I am, that is, they are not marks of my personality.  After all, I need help.  And that help exists.

Tomorrow I will make an appointment and start this journey towards a more serene, balanced and happy life.  I am anxious, but determined.

However, I also discovered this sub.  I am reading your posts, and I must tell you right now that you are heroes!  thank you for sharing your life, your struggles, the small defeats but, above all, your big victories!",7,2020-06-01 01:44:10 EDT-0400
1188,How do you manage work anxiety?,"As a result of being given a ton of extra work after a colleague left, all of last week I experienced a lot anxiety which involved nausea, tension, fear of failing, insomnia, sadness, and inability to focus. I don‚Äôt know how I managed to get through the week, but it felt awful and I really don‚Äôt know how to manage it. 

I talked to the direct boss about my concerns and that decreased my anxiety by 5%. But I‚Äôm still feeling it.

Any suggestions from people who have experienced this and managed it well? Thank you!",8,2020-05-31 23:36:33 EDT-0400

1192,DAE feel like the events in the US/world this year reads like the origin story of a post apocalyptic YA novel?,"Like when you read a Post apocalyptic story and it tells you how they got to this terrible new reality, this could easily be that story. 

But my anxiety is constant I feel nauseous and scared and there‚Äôs a ball in the pit of my stomach, and my heart is pounding and I‚Äôm on edge.. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs all anxiety or normal reaction to chaos but I‚Äôm scared of where the world is going and that it‚Äôs only going to get worse.

My stomache is in knots, I see/ feel everyone‚Äôs unrest. I know both sides thoughts and see them being pulled to further and further extremes ( due to growing up and training in vastly different types of communities I have constant input on social media from both sides).
I feel everything is getting pulled apart and a fire has been set to already high tensions.. and a have this constant ball in the pit of my stomache I want to help I want to bridge them cuz they aren‚Äôt that different. But I know nothing I do will help. No one wants to listen to a middle view. I couldn‚Äôt even have a say as a health care worker about the virus, how am I supposed to say do anything on racial and police violence matters. I don‚Äôt know what the truth is and I truely don‚Äôt think anyone does. Left says ins white air premises ya coming in with violence, right says its antifa but no knows...

P.s.
Sorry for the rant and I‚Äôm really not trying to be political and don‚Äôt want to be convinced of either side. Promise I‚Äôve read both sides and understand the concern of both... and don‚Äôt know the right answer... I just needed to write about the anxiety and feeling of being torn apart somewhere, couldn‚Äôt on my social media.. I hope my fellow anxious people can just support and we can share our concerns and feelings on this craziness together so maybe we feel less alone.",16,2020-06-01 05:32:15 EDT-0400

1194,Is anyone else afraid of what to post about what's going on in the world?,"As we all know, there are currently protests happening in the United States about racial injustice after George Floyd was killed last week. People are saying that if you don't say anything, then you are just supporting the racists. I've been trying to figure out what to post on social media to show my support but I have clue what to say.

Would ""#blacklivesmatter"" be enough? Do I need to write out a long post? If so, what should I say? Everyone says you need to say something but they won't say what you need to say. It's up to the individual to figure out what's right but with so much going on it's difficult to come up with something to cover everything that won't either piss people off or be seen as not enough.

Sorry for the rant but just want to know if others are feeling the same. This is very nerve-wracking and so much to take it.",13,2020-06-02 00:24:00 EDT-0400
1195,Not sure how to describe this feeling? Physical manifestations of anxiety?,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been working through some issues with anxiety for a long time now and I‚Äôve noticed that whenever I feel very anxious, I get this tingling/tightness but not quite either of those things in my chest. Sort of like stomach butterflies, but more like heart butterflies? Also like someone is gently squeezing my heart, enough that it doesn‚Äôt hurt but feels incredibly uncomfortable. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a rapid heartbeat, although I‚Äôm sure my heart is beating much faster than normal. Does anyone else experience this and kinda understand the feeling I‚Äôm trying to describe? I‚Äôm curious if other people‚Äôs anxiety manifests in the same physical way and if anything helps you calm it down. 

I‚Äôd also just like to hear how anxiety affects you physically in general, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing!",12,2020-06-01 06:17:35 EDT-0400

1198,A letter to non Black people who are experiencing woke shaming online right now,"I'm sorry people are approaching your small attempts or frightened non-attempts to support the Black Lives Matter movement  with rage, shaming, and arrogance. I understand the feeling.

 I hope you will not give up. I hope you will not hide. But I understand why you would. I hope you will overcome the shame spirals. I know you can use your voices, your time, your money, to do other things for the BLM movement offline. You don't have to be good at all the things. I would be proud of you if you just do one thing to help. 

There is not much written on anxiety as a barrier to activism. It's not your fault if you're afraid of saying the wrong thing, or if you are already so debilitated by your mental health symptoms that it seems too much to add anything more to your plate. I say this because I have been there. I say this because seeing posts shaming others about saying nothing or doing the bare minimum or doing it wrong have only ever sent me into shut down mode. 

There is no compassion for others who are held back by anxiety in this shameful messaging. No compassion for people with attachment injuries. No acknowledgment of panic attacks and emotional flashbacks. I know MANY OF YOU CARE AND ARE JUST SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW.

If you want to know more about what you are experiencing on top of your base anxiety that is giving you this stress please read the book ""White Fragility."" I also recommend ""How to Be an Anti Racist"" and ""The New Jim Crow"" 

If you can't call your representatives, email them or write them letters. 

If you can't speak out right now: donate, read, buy yourself some comfort food from a black owned business near you. 

You can donate to: the Black Visions Collective, the Minnesota freedom fund, and many other options",22,2020-06-03 21:37:40 EDT-0400
1199,Just want to vent my frustration..,"Ive been struggling with the physical symptoms of anxiety the past month...

it started with chest tightness and feeling the little pins and needles all over my chest, arms, shoulders, and head. After visiting the doctor and ruling out any heart and lung problems, i feel like all the physical symptoms just decided to move all up to my head. I haven‚Äôt felt any pain on my chest or arms ever since.

I‚Äôve been suffering from migraines from time to time and unfortunately it runs in my family, but ever since the doctor visit my heads been hurting every day and I don‚Äôt know if its because ive become so hyperaware of my head, but the needles, tension headaches, the neck stiffening, and the migraines are just driving me nuts......

just wanted to vent...it‚Äôs actually calming my mind right now...

thankfully my head doesnt hurt during my therapy session but it creeps up every other time.",8,2020-05-31 23:21:33 EDT-0400
