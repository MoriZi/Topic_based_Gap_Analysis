What Could Go Right?,"The internet threw up a cheesy quote recently: “Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and start being positive about what could go right.” I pinned it, because I do that sort of thing, and thought it was forever filed in forgettable fuzzy trivia. It wasn’t. The notion buzzes around in my bonnet all day, and at night when I can’t sleep. It grabbed my attention, spoke to me, just me, and now I can’t let it go. I get mad at myself when I’m sucked in by second-rate, feel-good soundbites — which is fairly often, so I am pretty consistently vexed, if in a minor way. But here’s the thing — I am afraid — very afraid — of what could go, and often has gone, wrong. I tiptoe through my days imagining what could go wrong. What could go wrong?! (For the record, I haven’t always been a maniac — this and this explain that). I have become the queen of worst case scenarios. Example: I woke up at 3:30 a.m. last night and lay there for hours worrying mightily about the following: Clearly, the mind of a madwoman. Why don’t I lay there in my messy but lovely, peaceful house surrounded by my healthy family and feel happy about my relatively nice life? Why is everything so much worse at that hour? Does anyone else do this? Back to the quote. It is occurring to me that I don’t often imagine what could go right; I panic about what will probably go wrong. Is this crazy? I think maybe this is a little crazy — not batshit whacked (things do go wrong, after all), but maybe a wee bit mad. Perhaps it’s time to revisit this skewed perspective and feel somewhat positive about what could go right. So much can — and does! — go right. Perfectly, tidily, seemingly magically right. The sun comes up, we’re all alive, we eat, we laugh, we sing. Appointments are kept, cars work, the lights come on, there’s plenty of toilet paper. Why haven’t I noticed this recently? How did I become a ‘glass-half-empty’ person when the glass is clearly at least half full (and often brimming, let’s be honest)? Yes, shit happens, and sometimes a lot of shit happens, a lot. But the days are full of gems — perfect, right moments — for all of us, even when things go wrong. The sun comes up, the tea is hot, spring comes — we can actually count on some things going right. And sometimes, most things go right — I just don’t notice because I’m so tweaked and agitated about what could go wrong. That’s crazy. And I’m going to try and leave crazy behind for a while. It’s an effort for a hand-wringer like me, but it’s a new year and I’m feeling bold (it won’t last). So, now I’m going to make a cup of tea and ponder — what could go right today? What will go right this year? I know all about the stuff that will go wrong — I could write a book or two about that stuff — but let’s shine a brand new shiny light on the stuff that will go right. It’s there, lots of it — we just have to notice it.",2015
Mindfulness Deconstructed,"Almost every week we hear new ways that mindfulness and meditation can help with our problems. Anxiety, insomnia, depression, stress, binge-eating, substance abuse, ADHD… the list goes on. In some workplaces such as Google, mindfulness has become ubiquitous in the culture, with on campus meditation rooms and mindfulness seminars offered. Mindfulness concepts were also featured on the first episode of the new NPR podcast Invisibilia. It’s a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot as a solution for distress, but it still feels out-of-reach for many. How do I know this? When I mention mindfulness to patients, I often hear agreement with a hint of dismissiveness. “Of course, of course…” followed by an excuse (i.e. can’t sit still), “it doesn’t work for me (I can’t make my mind blank),” or “I like to go to yoga sometimes,” as if that should be the end of the discussion. Some people might admit that being left alone with their thoughts is the last thing they want to do. Not surprisingly, when asked to explain what they think meditation entails, most people talk about making their mind blank or they might say it is focusing on breathing, which are both misleading. If you search the web about mindfulness, you will find many resources promoting a path to mindfulness, but it is hard to get a clear, concise description of what it is and how it works. What is the actual definition of mindfulness and meditation? How are they related to each other? Do you have to go to an ashram and fast in order to be a legit practitioner (No)? What is mindfulness? Mindfulness is a state of mind in which you become the observer to your thoughts and feelings so that you no longer have to react to them. This might make more sense with the use of imagery. You can think of most people as swimming in the river of their thoughts and feelings at any point in time. Some people can go their whole lives swimming in that river without a problem, assuming that anything they think, feel, or do is valid and consistent with who they are. But most people will at some point experience rough currents, often precipitated by stress. And if you have a predisposition for mood dysregulation, anxiety, or other mental illness, the waters can get quite turbulent. For example, Johnny gets passed up for a promotion and feels worthless. His mind fixates on thoughts of his worthlessness, which triggers a downward spiral of negative thinking and depression. This is Johnny being swept away by his unexamined mindstream. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is the state of mind in which he can stand on a bridge overlooking the river of his thoughts and feelings so that he doesn’t get swept away. Johnny can see his negative thoughts go by and choose not to react or pay attention to them. What is meditation? While mindfulness is a state of mind, meditation* is the practice that leads one to be able to achieve mindful states more easily. There are other ways to access and exercise mindfulness states (nature meditation, guided meditation, visualization, body scanning), but meditation cuts straight to the core of it. You can think of it like training for a race. It would be nice to be in shape and be trained to run when you need to (some people may need to often). Similarly, meditation is the practice of standing on that bridge so that the mind muscles are in shape to be able to stand on that bridge when needed. At first it is tedious and painful. Meditation involves sitting still for longer periods of time than you are used to, so the back muscles might also have to get trained. But just like training for a marathon, little by little, over time, you can begin to sit for stretches of time. What exactly are you doing when practicing meditation? A lot of what you are doing is focusing attention on your breathing. It is a useful sensation to focus upon because your body does it automatically and it can feed back into the nervous system to change your autonomic state. Slower diaphragmatic breathing puts us into more of a rest and digest state conducive to mindfulness states. Much of mindfulness and meditation involves focusing on body sensations because it is a grounding experience that gets us out of our heads (that river of thoughts and feelings) and into the present. The breath is used as the grounding experience that we can return to in order to let go of the thoughts that are generated in our mindstream. So, while focused on the breathing, thoughts will inevitably come up. It is important to keep in mind that you cannot stop thoughts from coming up. They just bubble up from somewhere in the mind machinery. After the thought surfaces you focus your attention on that particular thought and label it as a thought. Then you examine it like a compassionate scientist and handle it gently. Oh, this is a thought that my mind came up with. Hmmm, look at that. If it’s a negative thought, you might recognize it as such. The goal is to remain in the observer stance to give space to examine the thought without reacting. Next, you let the thought go. How do you do that? By focusing back on the breath. You might even imagine your exhale as blowing the thought out of your attention. Why is this important? Because if you can intentionally shift your focus and let go of a thought (after looking at it) then the thought loses power over you and becomes like any other thought. Like water under the bridge. Now back to the breathing… and then another thought pops up… label… examine… let go… focus on breath… rinse, repeat. Unfortunately, you may have to get past boring thoughts of your to-do list before more interesting thoughts occur. And you may only be able to sustain this for 5 minutes at first, but that’s ok. You will gradually train the mind muscle to tolerate and maybe even enjoy longer stretches. Mindfulness during distress When we are in distress there is often a component of negative thinking that is perpetuating distress. These thoughts can be powerful and intrusive, commanding our attention. It is highly compelling to react to these thoughts by avoiding, lashing out, pushing down, or distracting oneself. You can think of these thoughts as terrorists hijacking your mind. For example, Johnny thinks that everyone in the room is judging him negatively. He is highly tempted to flee (calling negative attention to himself) or drink heavily (shutting down thoughts). Instead, he takes a time out in the bathroom and uses mindfulness concepts. He looks at his anxious thought that everyone is judging him negatively. He recognizes that these are the same old terrorist thoughts that hijack his mind and lead him to bad outcomes. He refuses to negotiate with terrorists. He chooses instead to focus on his breathing, shift his attention to more reasonable thoughts, and wait for his anxiety to subside. He then returns to his function in a calmer state of mind. This process is much easier once the mind has been trained through mindfulness practice. How does mindfulness fit into your life? While meditation cuts to the core of mindfulness practice, it may not be the right fit for everyone, especially to start. You may need to walk before you run, and some people are just fine with swimming. There are other forms of mindfulness practice that use body sensations or visualizations to help focus attention away from the mindstream and there are plenty of ways to explore this**. But now that you have read the nuts and bolts of what mindfulness is, how you can do it, and what it can do for you, I challenge you to leave the theoretical world of the mindstream and experience it for yourself. * There are different forms of meditation, but we will stick to mindfulness meditation (most similar to zen meditation) to stay in the clinical rather than the spiritual realm. ** consider Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction techniques created by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the writings or lectures of Dan Siegel , free guided meditations from UCLA’s psychiatry department, or apps such as Buddhify.",2015
How To Deal With a Bully,"Lessons From Kindergarten With An Update The saying “all I really need to know I learned in kindergarten” may have some truth, especially when it comes to dealing with a bully. However, as an adult, the situation can be more complicated, and there is often no one there to teach you how to navigate these treacherous waters. Can you really trust your HR department with this? As a psychiatrist in downtown San Francisco, I find the issue of dealing with bullies, on top of dealing with difficult people/situations, to be pretty common. This is also because dealing with a bully can exacerbate anxiety and depression symptoms, which will funnel people to the mental health arena. Whether it is a client, boss, coworker, or classmate, I hope that the following pearls of wisdom will help guide people through this potentially distressing and difficult situation. How did I get into this mess? Nobody would willingly choose to work for/with a bully, and yet many people end up in that situation for some period of time. It is difficult to understand who you will be working with in a job interview since difficult personalities can turn on the charm for an hour. Often, I see people start a new job and be caught off guard by a nasty person that other people have found a way to cope with or avoid. Sometimes people don’t realize until they go to therapy that they’ve been dealing with a bully in their life. A recent survey found that 27% of people are experiencing or have experienced workplace bullying. Regardless, bullying can be found anywhere and there’s not much you can do to avoid it. Is this really a bully or something else? Difficult people can come in different shapes and sizes and can depend on where your issues lie. A bully is more than just someone who pushes your buttons; they have a consistent pattern of using dominance and aggression as a way of getting what they want. That’s not to say that it is obvious, as bullies can be sophisticated and manipulative. Threats could be implied. They can be quite charming to people in positions of authority. They could also be highly respected people who have achieved great things. But it is worth taking a good look at whether someone is a bully or whether this person is someone who can be reasoned with. For example, is it something about the work/school environment that forces them to be this way? If you took that person and put them in a more supportive environment would they treat you differently? Do they remind you of someone who bullied you (but may be quite different in reality)? It certainly can be hard to see straight when you feel you are being bullied, but oftentimes seeing the truth can be the path to set you free. To add a complicating factor to this scenario is that even relatively well-adjusted individuals can become bullies if put in the right setting as evidenced by the Stanford prison experiments. Stanford undergraduates displayed sadistic behaviors after four days of role-playing prison guard roles while other students role-played prisoners. It can be useful to distinguish bullying behavior from an otherwise nontoxic individual versus dealing with a real bully (not that the behavior is ever excusable). If someone is being mean, tell the teacher. If only there was someone who could make this behavior stop! But in the real world there are any number of reasons that bad behavior goes unchecked. The boss is already overwhelmed, the boss needs this person for good reasons, the bully is the boss/professor, the HR department might not have any authority to make real change. Or, even worse, they may see you as the problem since you are the one making noise. But if you want to be strategic about gaining ground on a bully, the best strategy is to ally yourself with your peers, or their superiors, so that you either have the advantage of numbers or influence with an authority figure. Bullies respond to a show of force, just as the schoolyard bully was less likely to pick on those who stood up to them. But this doesn’t mean you are quite ready to take down your bully… Don’t cut off your nose to spite your face! When faced with a bully a person’s emotions will intensify and those emotions could include rage, fear, or hurt. These emotions can be so powerful that an otherwise put-together person might cry, yell, have a panic attack, flee, throw things, or act out in a desperate way. Oftentimes, the reaction to these emotions can reflect badly on the person and cause them to lose ground against a bully who can now say that you are the unreasonable one. Or now they know they can cause you to “lose it,” which may bring satisfaction to a bully in and of itself. The phrase “don’t cut off your nose to spite your face” refers to 12th century religious women who were so afraid of being raped by Vikings that they cut off their noses to make themselves less attractive and thus less likely to be raped. However, the Vikings were so disgusted that they ended up burning the womens’ buildings to the ground. Similarly, your emotions in the moment seem like a natural thing to act on, but in reality this can often cause an even worse outcome. Sometimes if you can create space from the emotion through time and distance it can lose its potency. A good rule of thumb is that emotions such as anger will fade after 90 seconds, assuming that you remove yourself from the inciting event and don’t perpetuate negative thoughts. And you are certainly allowed to cry about it when it’s an appropriate time for that. Don’t take the bait! Sometimes I see people get worked up over a bully or bullying behavior and the injustice they have suffered to the point that they lose sight of their goals. And that is just what the bully would want. They are hoping to get a rise out of you to have the satisfaction that they are the boss of you. You are not in control of your destiny; they are. But wait, it’s a trap. Of course injustice has occurred and it’s not fair that they go unpunished. But is it really that important? Do you really think you can get your bully to show remorse and hold him/herself accountable to their actions? The answer to these questions is likely no. And if you take the bait every time this type of injustice occurs, you might start to believe in your own victimhood and disempowerment rather than regaining the empowered perspective of someone who is the master of their own destiny. You know you are on the path of healthy coping when you can say, “I may be on the receiving end of bullying behavior right now, but I will work through this like any other challenge in life.” Making reasonable choices (and making lemonade?) Once you recognize and accept that you are being bullied and have managed to find a way to cope with the emotions (talking to a friend, finding a counselor of some type, meditation, crying it out, exercise/hobby, time) you can then take a look at your options on how to move forward. Is it worth it to stay in the situation? Or are you locked in due to high incentive such as wanting to finish your PhD or keeping an otherwise perfect job? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Can you file a complaint that could benefit a future victim? In order to decide on action you may need to make a pros/cons list or a decision/balance box. From this observing, analytical vantage point it becomes just another problem to solve rather than an emotionally-charged sinkhole. There may be challenges to any decision you make, but at least you have the confidence to know that you made a reasonable decision given the circumstances. After all, sometimes life gives you lemons, and we all know what to do with that.",2015
Pink Water Bottle,"A man, whose name we’ll never know, searched through his backyard with a stressed diligences that suggested he was drowning something out. He was a tall but not overly tall red-headed man who just remembered that one time he equated a girlfriend’s friend’s baby with a dog. “It was supposed to be funny,” he said out loud through tight, gritting teeth. He lifted a lawn chair by its seat, tilting the plastic furniture slightly to observe what lied underneath. “Nothing.” He did this to three more chairs and a large wooden outdoor table that was built by some family member. He doesn't remember which one, only that it was only one generation old and no one wanted it. “Fuck.” His muted tone echoed slightly under the emptiness of the table. The man looked for his water bottle. A pink recycled plastic reusable water bottle that was the last of the 4-pack he bought. He had lost the other three. “Where the fuck did I put it?” You had it when you drove home. He looked at the garage where his car was and visually traced his steps, looking at the usual walking path he would have walked from the garage. He couldn't find any hint of pink. “Fuck.” He walked inside and closed the door behind him but he never stopped moving through the rooms of his house. Inside then. It’s probably inside somewhere. Check the freezer. You leave shit in there. Did you go to the freezer yet. No you didn't. You got home, got inside, then went to the bathroom. Maybe in the bathroom. God, I hope you didn't leave it in the bathroom again. “I gotta stop doing that.” The moment the lights flashed on in the bathroom he could tell it wasn't there. He knew it wasn't there but he felt like checking. Good. You didn't act like a dirty fucker and bring it into the bathroom. “Then where is it?” He was going to kill himself once he got home. He had everything planned. He didn't have a large list of things to prepare. He wasn't picky. Just before he was about to do it he noticed his water bottle wasn't on the table. He thought he had put it down on the table but apparently no, he didn't. Why do you need the bottle. You won’t be needing it. It doesn't have to do with anything you wanna do. He usually carries the water bottle around because of an article he read shamed him into drinking more water. “I need to stay hydrated.” Who told you that. It’s just something people say. You don’t have to worry about it. “Well I should deal with it.” But you’re going to kill yourself. Plus you don’t actually have to get those eight glasses from just water. Juice counts. “I need to find the bottle. I lost the others.” But. You don’t need it. Those others are irrelevant. It doesn't matter. “Well. No. It does matter. I just need to find it then I can kill myself.” Why do you need to find it so bad. He checked the freezer and it was empty but he still looked through the rest of the kitchen. Any place he would put something down without thinking. “It’d just be nice if I found it so, I don’t know, not be a dick to someone.” Who’s gonna be mad. “Someone will be.” Who told you all this. “Well. No one, I guess. It’s just someone will be upset.” No one will be upset. They’ll be concerned with other things and such. Who taught you all this. “The burden would fall to someone else and that would make me a dick.” He stopped rifling through his backpack of random shit and stared at the wall, easily remembering the time when someone close to him told him he made bad first impressions. They were just some person you worked with. It was at a staff party. You were drunk. You don’t remember It properly. “She was being honest. She said I was nice but that it takes time to see that.” That seems positive. He physically cringed. His body shuddered for a hot second and he pushed the thought from his mind. “Enough of this. I gotta find that bottle.” He continued his search by increasing the speed in which he walked between all four rooms of the ground floor of his house. He hadn't been upstairs yet. There was no way it was upstairs. No one said you were ugly. “That’s not really what I'm getting at.” You think you’re ugly. “I've gotten over that. I have matured in some ways. I can give myself some credit when needed.” He looked in his mostly empty bedroom. The clay coaster on the ground next to his bed had an empty Coke bottle on it. The sight excited him slightly. But of course that brief moment turned to disappointment once he realized what it was. “It’s not even pink…” Who said you were ugly. “No one. It’s just,” he stopped talking and looked at his IKEA bookshelves, knowing full well the bottle wasn't there. Half the books he hadn't even read yet. Most were inherited from his dad, a newspaper man before the Internet, so he had a very large and very random selection of reading materials. A lot of original pamphlet propaganda from Mao and other Chinese communists. He never got a chance to ask his father why he had this stuff. “I know because of the way people look at me.” What if you don’t actually know how others look at you. You’re not the best judge of character yourself. “I've learned to read the way others treat me. It’s fine. I'm nothing special. I'm aware. People don’t like me.” You’re seeing people and the world in the wrong way. What if you’re wrong about people’s opinion of you. He walked closer to the nearest bookshelf, his eyes saw the titles but didn't really registering who or what they were. “That sounds horrible. Then that means I am truly broken.” Rather than being out of place. He stood unmoving. He clicked his tongue in his mouth like he was mulling an idea over in his head but it was simply a habit at this point for him. It meant little. You just hate people. “Yeah, maybe I do.” He picked up a small pamphlet off the shelf and held it up to the light. It read: Mao Tse-Tung WHERE DO CORRECT IDEAS COME FROM? Foreign Language Press PEKING. The inside said (May 1963). He held the thin paper booklet with both hands and ripped it in half. “Now no one will have it.” That was Dad’s. “Why the fuck did he have it in the first place?” He left the room to quickly check outside, again. Just in case he missed it. Why are you doing this. “Because it’s all I can think about.” He crossed the living room, his eyes scanning the wooden floor in case he had missed it there. It’s not your fault. “It usually is my fault.” Of the times he let people down, angered them, cheated them, he couldn't remember ever doing it on purpose. That doesn't excuse the fact that he still cheated, angered and let people down. It’s just a fact he always remembered. You’re exaggerating. You did your best. “My best isn't good enough.” The automatic light turned on once he opened the door to outside, the yard once again bathed in its dull luminescence. He couldn't see any sign of pink or even a bottle shaped object. Nothing. It could still be in the car. It could be in the car. He was surprised that he never fully considered he just didn't bring it in when he got home. There are no rules in place telling you what to do. “I’ll go check the car then.” The man walked through the house for what felt like the thirtieth time of the night. He grabbed his shoes and headed for the door. There is no one judging you. No one will shame you. “I'm just tired of remembering what I've done.” He walked along his usual walking path to the garage, instinctually holding his keys balled in his fist. The metal teeth dug into his palm enough that they left an impression. But none of that is important. No one remembers that stuff. More to the point no one cares. “But I do.” He got to the garage. He opened the door and turned on the lights to see the small coal-grey car that an uncle sold him. From outside the car, he could see the pink handle and cap of the water bottle. His grip tightened on his keys, digging them deeper into his palm. You don’t need to do anything. “That line of thinking is what brought me here.” He entered the garage and closed the door behind him. He opened the door of his car and sat himself down in the driver’s seat. He placed his hand on the top of his water bottle like it was the stick-shift. You’re really good at blaming yourself. “Yeah. I know.” Originally published at thesammacdonald.tumblr.com.",2015

Self Appreciation,"“Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life, but define yourself.” Harvey Fierstein “One’s dignity may be assaulted, vandalized and cruelly mocked, but it can never be taken away unless it is surrendered.” Michael J. Fox There is so much talk, about allowing other people to define who we are. I wondered why we never observe the good qualities within us. It is time to admire, and appreciate ourselves. The greatest road to anxiety, and depression, is to believe you are not worthy, can’t accomplish things and are a useless person. This belief in your low opinion of self, is based on the estimations of others.It begins as a thought, and within a short time, travels throughout your brain. It finishes by convincing you, that you are behind in life, and likely will never catch up. I suppose it isn’t so much the sentiments others express to us, that makes us feel this way, as much as it is our negative perceptions about ourselves. The more we hear only the negative estimations, the greater the chance of us feeling defeated. Do we ever ask ourselves what we are really looking for in life? I would surmise that most of us including myself, are not ever sure about the choices that we have. It seems easier to just let things happen to us, rather than work on making something happen. By floating along without a care, we live and survive in a dream-like state of mind. Others form our attitudes, and give us agendas and goals to meet. I think it works for most of us for a while, until we begin to wade through problems and issues. Then we begin to question our outlook on life in general. Where have we been, what have we accomplished, and perhaps our most profound reflection is where have we made a difference. That is probably the arrival time for doubt in ourselves, and discouragement for what we are currently doing. We want to accomplish something. It feels good to speak of attainments of public stature, wealth, fame or job status. The majority of people simply are not famous, involved in politics, wealthy, or at the top of their field. I would likely say one to five percent of the population are likely to reach those goals. The rest of us are in the ninety-five to ninety-nine percent, who struggle most of our lives. Knowing that fact will not automatically bring cheer to someone, questioning the importance of life, and their life in particular. As soon as we review these subjects, the confidence and security dwindles, and the doubt and fear rises. We begin our life track with inflated egos, and huge goals. We finish even before we are actually done, with crushed egos, and no goals. How did we get to this point, is the challenging question, we don’t understand. Finding the bottom line to this dilemma is a beginning. Our wife or husband is not a super-model, perhaps doesn’t always do their share of the tasks around the house, and at times gets angry for no apparent reason. It is possible, that both husband and wife feel the same way about each other. Both parties at times, overlook doing their share. On the positive side, the spouses sat by the hospital bed, encouraging the other to feel better. They helped out, without being asked, when a spouse lost a parent. They spent numerous hours talking things over, when there was a job loss. They compromised about a vacation or other recreational activity. They gave love when the other was without any hope, or love left. Maybe we hide these sad moments in the back of our minds, so we don’t think about them. We can recall the negative reactions from our spouse, but the positive remains unobserved. This area needs a lot of attention, which most of us don’t give, or have the time to give. The love is solid, true and deep, just ignored. Perhaps by bringing it out into the open, we can resolve some issues. Our kids appear to be the worst behaved at a function. We are so embarrassed and angry at them for their misbehavior. We lash out at them in front of others, and later feel ashamed of ourselves. The kids are upset with us, and not quite sure what they did wrong. Our spouse is mad that we didn’t just overlook the problem in the first place. Now we want to go home, escape, and not set eyes on our spouse, or kids, until the next day at least. Children can surprise us with the good deeds, we never saw coming, as well as the bad conduct, we didn’t prepare for. Kids don’t think about who is present or watching. They are spontaneous and impulsive. They were not considering how mom or dad or anyone else was going to feel about their performance. That’s what makes them innocent and children. If we reflect on how much attention we gave to the negative acts and the smaller amount of attention given to the positive, perhaps we might see a pattern. Most of us do pay notice of poor behavior. Complimenting good behavior is also a worthwhile thing to do. Kids never mean to necessarily hurt parents by their exploits. If they want something, the younger the child, the more impulsive they will be to get it in any way they can. In this whole learning process of raising kids, has it ever occurred to us to pat ourselves on the back? The fine qualities we observe in our children, are the result of our own hard work. We are their first teachers. We set the rules and boundaries. What a magnitude of a job we have taken on. Every positive gesture we see in our kids is a reflection of our teaching. The kids still have free will, as do all of us. They can choose the wrong thing at times, regardless of our instruction. It appears that parents are still there to catch their kids, and help them out. How do we not see how selfless and worthy we really are. Some of us have more challenging kids, and a more difficult time in managing them. We give our life to them, and that is such a virtuous and moral accomplishment. By now we should be building up our confidence. Neighbors who need us for one thing or another, can count on us. The friends of our kids can depend on a welcome smile, and support when required. We uplift our kids for as long as is necessary, and gradually pull away when it becomes unnecessary. The difficulty in letting go is so painful, yet we do this painful action, to help our kids be strong and independent individuals. As much as we want to keep them contained, what we want more is for them to have their own life. How selfless is that kind of person, especially when it is done with no strings attached. The workplace can be a scary and trying place. If we have made it easier for even one individual, we have accomplished goals that nobody else was in the position to accomplish. We work hard at even a meaningless job for the sake of our families. How dignified that really is. We miss so much of our own movie about us, that it is no wonder we don’t have more confidence. Failure is a part of everyone’s life. If we learn from the mistakes, then it wasn’t in vain. Our inner beauty is thriving and strong, because we either accomplish something the first time, or we learn, and attempt it again. Who is to say when we are judged by God, what he will measure or assess us with. Perhaps it will be our generous smile, and quick but kindly few words of a greeting, or comfort to others. How far-reaching our smile and words may have traveled. Perhaps we’ll be judged by the times we got out of bed and off to work when we were so tired. What was our reason for getting up. Our family depended on us and we were there. I could go on and on with praiseworthy empathy that is seen every day. Someone lost their wallet. Another person found it, and mailed it without sending their name. All the money and cards were still in the wallet. The person had no debt to repay, except to pay it forward one day. Goodness like that just can’t be discussed enough. Perhaps the person who did such a kind deed, never thought about any meaning to there life. We all have such profound meaning, and such an intense influence on each other. Just review one day in your life, and recall all of the people you helped, or encouraged with advice, or any other form of support. You can’t buy that. Some things may appear to be so simple, yet when a person is at the end of their rope, you were the one who made a difference in getting them through. As we search for meaning in our lives, remember to recall your awesome and supportive words and actions for everyone you met. I remember being exhausted yet I had to pick up a food item that I just couldn’t find. I finally asked for help, and instead of telling me where to find it, the clerk offered to walk me to the aisle. I can’t tell you how much it meant to me, because I was feeling overwhelmed and ready to give up on the Holiday. This person brought it back to me, that it wasn’t the gimmicks and Holiday, that made things special, but the people themselves. You are priceless. Your value is immeasurable, and the love you have to give to others, cannot be duplicated in any way. There would be so much less love in the world without your presence. “When you’re different, sometimes you don’t see the millions of people who accept you for what you are. All you notice is the person who doesn’t.” Jodi Picoult “You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.” Gautama Buddha “How would your life be different if…You stopped allowing other people to dilute or poison your day with their words or opinions? Let today be the day…You stand strong in the truth of your beauty and journey through your day without attachment to the validation of others” Steve Maraboli “I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.” Edward Everett Hale “Until you value yourself, you won’t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. ” M. Scott Peck Originally published at Pam’s Relationship Blog.",2015
On Productivity Anxiety,"When I get into bed, one verse from The National’s “Terrible Love” swells from the middle of my skull, rolling across the expanse until it laps against its walls. “And I can’t fall asleep without a little help; it takes awhile to settle down.” It’s matter-of-fact perfection. It’s also, for me, a dumb joke, devoid of any lovelorn root. I have a tendency to seek out scraps of text and song that neatly encapsulate a set of circumstances, no matter how mundane. But these days the song foretells a weary predicament: I no longer tacitly accept sleep as a biological imperative. It has become an earned indulgence, something I only deserve when I have labored according to cartoonish standards of diligence. And because I am neither Bob the Builder nor Leslie Knope, I crawl under my quilt awash in defeat, a cacophony of self-reproach jangling inside my head. My husband Paul, a night-dweller, nevertheless follows for the express purpose of tucking me in. He comes armed with podcasts and ritualistic assurances. Such has become our tradition. “Did I work enough today? Did I seem productive?” I do not ask so much as beg. “Yes,” he soothes, and turns on a podcast — measured voices to compete with my nagging brain. I ask variations on the same questions — So, you really do think I was productive? I wrote for hours, right? — until the weighty bulk of my fretting pulls me beneath consciousness. Professionally, I am three things: freelance writer, teacher, and doctoral student in literature. You can find me wringing my hands at their junction, pained by the macabre joke of my adjunct paycheck and apprehensive that, by pursuing a writing career, I hereby condemn Paul, also a graduate student, and myself to years of financial uncertainty. This financial uncertainty, I want to clarify, is buffered by the privilege that comes of being two white people steadied by their generous, white middle class parents. The rare predicaments that induce us to seek their help are guilty, shame-riddled events, but whatever unease I experience is swaddled in the promise of a financially sturdy family. Still I want to make it, in every sense of the word, and I want to do it bootstraps, big-girl-pants style. I want so much that my desires contort into anxieties about the scope of my limits, about the contours of control. I’m seduced by the elusive concept of “enough,” and I grapple with unshakeable suspicions that I have never achieved it. In my first year as a doctoral student, I tried to kill myself and failed. As I lay in the emergency room, aswoon with Tylenol and ambivalently aware of a heartbeat I recognized as my own, I remembered that I was supposed to submit a term paper the next day. Turning to my landlady who, bless, was sitting at my feet, I asked if she would email my professor and, obscuring the details, explain that my paper would unfortunately be late. Three days later, hours after I was discharged, I emailed him myself to assure him that my essay would be completed within the week. It was. These circumstances are, of course, rare, but they exist on a continuum where I measure my control over the world according to a metric of productivity. The professor in question is a kind man who, if uncertain as to what had happened, must have guessed at its severity. He thus expressed no concern whatsoever regarding my late paper on Charlotte Brontë’s Villette. But I interpreted the unfinished paper as a promise, a token awaiting its magical purpose. If I could fulfill this one obligation — one that, as a funded graduate student, doubled as my “employment” — then perhaps the life I thought I’d give another go ‘round had not plummeted into a bottomless canyon. Perhaps I was still peeking over its edge, but my heels would eventually grind me into place. Four years, one divorce, one marriage, heaps of therapy, and a fledgling freelance career later, I’m relieved to have stuck around. But I have not yet learned to work without shame and desperation at my back. Cobbling together a life from writing and teaching gigs, I’ve succumbed to a value metric determined by words written and read, papers graded and student emails answered. This mindset does not allow for pauses; it does not honor the silent energy of thought. Despite my best efforts to recalibrate, productivity remains, for me, inextricable from the tangible evidence of production itself. Even as I type, I am frustrated that my word count for this essay has not yet exceeded 1,000, although I know that arbitrary number offers little indication as to the composition’s cumulative quality. I forget that I do not want to be further than I am, not yet, because writing is a barbed pleasure all its own. But more often than I care to admit, I’m dazzled by fantasies of an automaton’s singular focus. Anxiety, my ever-present houseguest, rattles me at times both expected and unforeseen, leaving me with no alternative but to cease work, take a Klonapin, and retreat to bed, Paul and podcasts in tow. When my mother underwent rigorous chemotherapy this past fall, my anxiety attacks wreaked walloping havoc. Often, they were coupled with nightmares so chilling that I began to live them in wakefulness. These, too, are extenuating circumstances. And yet, what consolation is that when I return to open Word documents, a cursor winking — teasingly, the fucker — midsentence, and scattered ungraded papers? I either achieve my publishing goals, or I do not. My students receive their papers back in a timely manner, or my teaching evaluations run the risk of suffering. I cannot offer myself to the working world with an asterisk and accompanying footnote detailing the ways I have lately suffered. We all have our asterisks, and as they go, mine is far from uncommon. For this reason, I struggle to interpret my limits without fears of professional calamity. I wrestle with self-forgiveness, straining to see it as something life giving, rather than enfeebling. These are things that I must learn, and on my own: to set my own pace, and turn away from the fray. Because the Internet’s gaping maw will be there, hungry for content. So too, will social media, with its invitations for unfavorable self-comparison. These must be firmly declined, lest I wallow (and wallowing, of course, is not writing). Work: this is something I know how to do, at length and well. And in the traditional, labor-based sense of the word, I also know how to be productive. But I long for it to mean something else. I want a productivity unfastened from the concept of unremitting production, production we, I, interpret as meaningful only when it is voluminous and publicly sanctioned. I want a productivity that refers, instead, to humane creation according to one’s own terms and rhythms. How to achieve this? That’s something I’m still learning.

Ditching Someone for Depression,"You know when you do things but wish you weren’t doing them at the same time? In your head it’s like, “What’s wrong with you?” But you follow through, you keep doing the thing anyway. Here’s my example, and it’s an example that has happened a thousand times, including just moments ago: I feel depressed or sad or exhausted or just stupid and anxious and uncomfortable, so I cancel social plans with someone I like. And I’ve probably canceled on them before, so I now am confirming that I’m a flake and unreliable. I have the power to prevent this by just keeping my word and carrying out the plans. But I can’t. I won’t. I have decided. It’s so dumb. I really, really don’t like myself in these moments. But apparently the fear or whatever I’m feeling is stronger than the desire to be a decent friend. What does that make me but a coward? If I give in to my depressive instincts to hole up, I will never grow and become bigger, become better than them. I think all of these things every time I make the decision to cancel on someone. I feel the failure. With the action of calling (or usually texting or emailing out of shame), I experience very acutely the weight of being a lesser person. I recently started reading a book about self-compassion. I’m having a hard time with it. I feel like I’m already aware of the concepts it’s teaching in the beginning chapters, that humans are imperfect and deserve to be treated with kindness despite that. I’m not articulating it well, but it’s touting basically the definition of compassion, particularly from a Buddhist standpoint. And I’m super into that, I think just inherently. I don’t need to be told, to use an example from the book, not to judge panhandlers in order to feel better about myself. I mean, when I see them I always wonder about their lives and how they got to that place, and how incredibly hard it must be to be there, and I wish I could do something for every single one of them. (If anything, I judge myself for feeling pity for them and not mentally treating them with more dignity, although I do find that concept confusing. I don’t mean to be demeaning with my sorrow for them being in a difficult place….) I thought by reading the book I would come away with an understanding of how to feel that way about myself. The thing is, I already understand all the ways I’m imperfect and the reasons I do the things I do sometimes. I know that I struggle and live with a real disease and all its delightful facets and offshoots. I know that sometimes I just am not up to the challenge that comes with social interaction, especially with people who are new in my life, when there’s more pressure to try and make that relationship meaningful and one that will stick. I can allow myself to make behavior choices based on how my condition is affecting me at a given time, but that doesn’t take away the awareness that I’m alienating someone else, someone who doesn’t know the whole story, and that this will affect how they experience me. It also, more importantly, is just not nice. It’s not respectful of the person’s time or feelings. Acknowledging my reasoning for being a flake also doesn’t remove the guilt of not trying to rise above the disease, not letting it define me, not doing things that challenge me. Isn’t that what smart, wordly people say you’re supposed to do? I’m sure there’s some Oprah quote out there about doing something that scares you every day, preferably blindfolded and before breakfast. So basically every time I cancel on someone, I do it with a voice in my head telling me I’m disappointing myself, my family, my therapist, Albert Einstein, the Dalai Lama, and everyone else who’s ever made an appearance on a refrigerator magnet. That sounds like I’m using sarcasm as a defense mechanism, but I’m actually completely sincere. I feel this incredible amount of pressure to be just… better than I am… every time I do almost any little thing. I don’t know how I’m ever going to change if I don’t consider my behavior at all times. I’m sure that sounds uptight and that such scrutiny is unnecessary, but I can’t turn it off. I find myself sometimes thinking, “Let it go. Just let it go for a second.” That inevitably leads to the song, which gets stuck in my head. I’ve tried to embrace it and feel empowered by it as like a mantra or something, but mostly it just makes me think, “Broadway is awesome. I want to crawl inside it.” I guess it’s a good but fleeting distraction. I suspect that if I bothered to keep reading the book (we’ll see), I would learn that self-compassion would dictate that I don’t need to focus so much on trying to change but just to accept… all of it. Acceptance is lovely in theory, but it doesn’t address how my behavior affects other people. And I like other people. I want to not suck at being part of the human hive. If I go giving myself a break every time I screw up plans because I don’t feel like doing them, if I start to think that’s okay, I will end up alone. You may be thinking, “Geez, plans are not that big a deal sometimes. Lighten up.” Okay. But have you ever had a friend who was a flake? I’ve heard tons of people complain about that. I’ve done it. “She’s always an hour late; that’s so inconsiderate.” “You can invite him, but you know he won’t come, so I wouldn’t waste your time.” “I’m sick of being canceled on, so I don’t call her anymore.” It’s not fun to be jerked around. I don’t blame people for deciding to not bother anymore. But if I just accept that that’s going to be what repeatedly happens to me, as a serial plan-ditcher, I’m looking at a lonely future. There are already numerous fizzled-out friendships in my life. Can you blame me for wanting to fix the problem — me? I don’t know the answer. I’m not looking for one at the moment. I just want to write it down. I want to say what I’ve thought so many times: I hate myself when I act like this. I hate trying to take care of myself by canceling something, but then feeling like a total asshole for it. I hate that I know I’m going to feel awful and having to choose to let it happen. It’s not like I don’t already feel bad enough that I’m canceling something. Now I have to feel worse on top of it. And I hate that most people I know, people who seem normal and well-adjusted and have endless social energy and just get to walk around enjoying life… I hate that I can’t explain this to them. I hate that this struggle is a secret because I think it makes people feel uncomfortable to talk about it if they haven’t experienced it. I hate feeling like a hypersensitive, overthinking weirdo. I hate that look on someone’s face when they are trying to be helpful and they advise me to relax, just… let it go. That really is a great song. Problem is, the cold has always bothered me anyway.",2015
"<strong class=""markup--strong markup--h3-strong"">Facing Social Judgement: It’s Only Twenty Percent You</strong>","It is human nature to care what people think about you. How are you supposed to know what you are and who you are to others? Not to mention that when you are brought into this world you are utterly dependent on the care of others who, for some reason, choose to protect and nurture you. You also inhabit a poor vantage point to gauge how others perceive you. Now advance our society to the digital age and things get very confusing about what people think about you and what to take seriously. Social anxiety and preoccupation appears to be rampant under these conditions. There are a lot of things that happen between two people, not to mention what happens in group dynamics. We are ultimately social creatures that both crave social interaction and fear negative social judgment. We may not be chased by lions anymore, but social judgment can feel like a threat to our existence. When we run into conflict, you may hear feedback such as “try not to take it personally.” But this is easier said than done, of course. If a person is coming at you with criticism or judgement, how can you not pay attention and react to this? Here is a perspective to keep in mind when you find yourself giving someone else’s criticism (real or imagined) too much weight. Since we are social primates, we have ingrained emotional reactions to situations and people. Whether we like it or not, it is natural to feel jealous of peers who we perceive to be doing better than us or to feel sibling rivalry. We tend to distrust outsiders at first. We befriend those who can give us opportunity or who can protect us. Most of us like people who are vulnerable with us. And there is certainly truth in the statement “haters gonna hate.” If you are perceived to be happy when another is miserable, that person will tend to resent your happiness. In a similar vein, a recent study showed that female capuchin monkeys will protest if their peer is not being treated fairly at their own expense, which suggests that social primates (including humans) have a tendency to react strongly to perceived unfairness. The 80/20 rule Outside of these primate dynamics, inevitably you will run into people who just have a problem with you, people who react critically to you, or people who will make a seemingly offhand judgement about you that is not consistent with how you see yourself. Like Aristotle once said: “to avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.” A good rule of thumb to employ in the face of social judgement is the 80/20 rule. Eighty percent of the criticism you experience coming at you belongs to the person doing the criticizing and twenty percent of that is what you should examine. Maybe there is a grain of truth to the criticism, especially if there is a repeat theme in your feedback. Maybe you were being ignorant, rude, or inappropriate in that moment. But think about it this way: don’t we all have a friend, colleague, teammate, or group member who is awkward and rough around the edges who we excuse for their behavior? Isn’t it a choice to be kind versus to call out someone’s flaws? What does it gain someone to voice unsolicited criticism (assuming no one is being harmed)? If you break down the situation later, which many people will privately, it may become clear that the criticizer has another process going on entirely that is landing on you at the moment. For example, This American Life (545) recently featured a story about Lindy West, a blogger who routinely receives bullying comments from trolls. Despite the conventional wisdom not to feed the trolls, she ends up calling out one of her trolls who crossed a line, taking it very personally. A cathartic dialogue ensues after the troll outs himself and apologizes. What she learns is that the reason he targeted her was due to his suppressed misogyny and her perceived confidence and happiness. What is the take home from this story? You can be doing nothing wrong and still be on the receiving end of this type of criticism/hate (especially in an anonymous online arena). A secondary point is that perhaps if you express vulnerability to the criticism, the trolls/critics can become humans again (if it’s worth it to you). In a similar story, tech editor Sam Biddle discusses his regret at his role in the public shaming of PR executive Justine Sacco for a distasteful racial tweet. He accepts her invitation to dinner six months after her fall from grace which results in his sincere apology and his feelings of regret. Again, the critic becomes human again after he is engaged in a real way by the object of his criticism. Another aspect of this shaming is the silver lining of social judgement. Tragically, she lost her job, lost her reputation, and was unable to date. Yet a little over a year later she landed on her feet and ended up as a sympathetic story in the New York Times with her former critic painting her in a positive light. Perhaps this demonstrates the ephemeral nature of social judgement. Even if you are judged and judged harshly in the moment, people generally have a short attention span. People will accept a different version of you when the outrage dies down (quicker than you think) and when you venture to put another version of yourself forward. How many times have we had a bad first impression of someone only to change our mind later when we get to know them? We are generally not that committed to social judgements about a person, especially when that person becomes more real to us. Maybe the best reason not to fear social judgement is that, for the most part, people are not spending time thinking about you. There may be a momentary thought, but people are mostly thinking about themselves and being their own harshest critic. Even when a judgement is expressed, it is still more about the critic himself as in the case of Lindy West. And even if it is the worst-case-scenario shaming you can still recover and make a comeback like Justine Sacco. And perhaps the most effective weapon to combat social judgement is to just be real and authentic. Show your once and future critics that you bleed just like them, which will make them realize that you are not an object to be projected upon without consequence. Despite the complexity introduced by online anonymity and social media, we are still social primates underneath it all. We still have the unique and redeeming ability to feel hurt, regret, empathy, and fairness within our communities online and in real life. So, the next time you catch a judgement coming your way take it as a glimpse into someone’s mind or use it as data about the dynamics of the situation. And then give the twenty percent that is about you about twenty percent of your attention later.",2015
Should I Stay Or Should I Go Now?,"Facing your fear of career change Right up there with relationship issues and anxiety, I frequently hear patients say some version of, “I hate my job, but I have no idea what to do about it.” Years can pass between the moment those words are first uttered and the moment anything meaningful is done about it. Work is a huge part of people’s lives and it can determine where someone finds meaning, identity, confidence, and community. It is hard to be at peace when your job is not aligned with your vision of yourself. There can be a lot of emotional work to be done before someone feels ready to quit a job and/or change careers. A person may have to grapple with change and uncertainty, confront feelings of failure, or grieve the loss of the career path they thought they would have. A common barrier to change is also when there is no mental space left to think about change. When you are caught up in the chaos and drama of a distressing work situation you can sometimes barely address your basic needs much less contemplate how life can be different. So for those of you who struggle with roadblocks to quitting your job, here are some things to consider before you dive back into misery and chaos. Flow State Put your current job situation in perspective: Imagine a job where you go to work and time passes effortlessly and you leave feeling satisfied with your day’s work. Everything you do at your job, even the menial tasks, feel easy because they are consistent with who you are and what you want to achieve. This tends to be the case in careers based on flow states. Being in flow is a state of hyperfocus where you get out of your own way to accomplish a task. Nothing else exists in that state other than what you are doing: no to-do lists, no extraneous thoughts, no discomfort, no doubt. Even your heart-rate and breathing slow down. When you get to achieve states like that on a regular basis, you know you are in a good spot with your career. Going to work now feels like walking downhill. As an example of someone who has capitalized on a flow state, Oprah talks about giving up a career in journalism to follow her instincts. That process has led to an empire built upon her natural skill at making personal connections with strangers. Anybody who has watched her interview can see how effortless it is for her to get people to trust her and confess intimate revelations. Perhaps the best way to find and achieve flow states regularly in your career is to listen to your instincts and follow your natural skills where you feel most confident. Of course, this process is a journey that does not happen overnight and does not allow for staying put at an ill-fitting job. Excuses Recognize excuses for what they are: excuses. For example, “I’ll never get it as good as I have it now,” “I owe it to my co-workers or boss to stay,” “It’s not a good time right now,” “What if I want to start a family?”, “I’m too old to take a risk like that,” and “I can’t afford to take time off.” These excuses can seem really understandable. I may agree with you in the moment. But are they really insurmountable problems or even that big of a challenge?? Don’t people face these same obstacles every day and quit anyway? National labor surveys have suggested that the average American changes careers seven times in a lifetime. People find a way to make this change work if they have to. Try not to get caught up in these seemingly important considerations if it means getting sucked back into the grind. Who knows when you might be able to resurface to make meaningful career change. Remember that, if you are stuck in a job that is toxic to you, it also affects your thinking and perspective. Removing yourself from that environment will often allow you to see things from a different and more positive perspective. Taking the Plunge Maybe you already have a good idea of what you would enjoy much more as a career than what you do now. But some people just don’t know for sure and don’t know how to find out. That uncertainty can be terrifying and paralyzing, often adding another year of misery before change can proceed. Some people think if they sit tight that somehow they will become more enlightened over time. But when you stay at a stale or ill-fitting job under duress from fear, your mind will be unable to access inspiration. What it boils down to is just taking the plunge. Quitting is the fire under your butt that will make you explore and find out what lights you up. Not Quite Sure? If you are still harboring doubts as to whether you can make meaningful change in your career, then consider this. How many times have you heard someone regret quitting a job they were unhappy at? Not many. That’s because if you are consistently unhappy at a job it is a sign that it is not a good fit and you need to move on. Everybody will agree with your choice once you are honest with yourself—even your employers. Of course it helps to understand why, but that may come later. The sooner you can accept and embrace that idea, the easier the process will be. Nobody can do this for you except you (unless you are fired). Some people may find it scary to have to change course, but there is no good reason to stay. Waiting for that next bonus is a slippery slope that leads to nowhere. The most successful people know that time is the truly limited resource, so stop wasting it! Action Stations! One of the best ways to get ready to quit your job is to set reasonable expectations about what the process will look like. In my experience it takes one to two years before you can feel emotionally solid with a new career. If it is just a job change then you can expect to bounce back quickly. Totally give yourself two weeks to veg in front of the tv in your PJs until you are ready to explore networking or job opportunities. You deserve it. You did the right thing; now keep going. Feeling uncomfortable about the uncertainty you have introduced into your life? Congratulations! You have officially taken the reigns to your career. Start listening to yourself and see where it takes you. Stop making excuses. The hard part of change is over and now you can move forward with your career life on your terms.",2015
Thin (H)air: A Portrait in Courage,"It started, as many personal crises do, in front of a mirror. I was a sophomore in college, and stark light from the naked incandescent bulb was bouncing off a part of my scalp I’d never seen before. I peered at it curiously in the glass. Before that very moment, my forehead was a finite plane: from my heavy Marx Bros. eyebrows, it had always ascended a moderate few inches up to a sheaf of tousled, wavy chestnut-brown hair. My grandparents always doted on the thickness of my hair. Healthy hair. Handsome hair. Good Italian hair. That was always that — or it used to be. In front of the bathroom mirror, at the ripe age of 19, my forehead had very clearly begun a northward march, which would have been less concerning but for the fact that foreheads don’t march anywhere. No, this was a retreat from above. For the first time, I felt the peculiar, knotty dread of genetic inevitability in my stomach. I switched off the light and left the room. It would be the last time I’d look in a mirror for a month, and it would take another nine for me to accept the truth I saw in the looking glass that day: I was balding young. There is no more immediately visual indicator of human deterioration, I think, than a bald head. Wrinkles are only clear up close. Sagging breasts & backsides may be lifted with bras and compressed with Spanx and swaddled up beneath all manner of yoga pant. Erectile dysfunction has been so widely commercialized that these days it seems less like a failure of youth than a feature of age — one that medical science is all too glad to remind you that it has solved. But even from a great distance, the message a bare scalp sends is unmistakable & undeniable. Here hath begun youth’s exodus. Over the course of the next two years, I tumbled into a tight, manic spiral of hirsute obsession. I spent free time poring over Wikipedia pages on follicular stimulation. An avid collector of baseball caps, I ceased wearing them, for I’d heard that over the course of time, hats might damage hair’s roots. I made weekly trips to the pharmacy for Rogaine, and applied it to my head with the reverence of sacrement. I spent hundreds of dollars on Propecia — at this moment in time, the only FDA-approved prescription drug designed to treat male pattern baldness — because as a cosmetic ailment, it wasn’t covered by my medical insurance. Pomades, gels, conditioners, oils; you name it, I bought it, then slathered it onto my noggin. Did it help? I don’t know. I don’t think so. But besides their upfront costs, these remedies didn’t hurt, either. The mirrors were a whole other story. After my initial aversion, I became utterly fixated on my reflection. It was crippling insecurity masquerading as vanity: every mirror was an opportunity to ensure my hair was parted (combed, brushed, raked, swept, etc.) just so to mask the thinning wedges between my temples and the crown of my head. I was Bizarro Narcissus, so disgusted by my appearance that I couldn’t stop staring at it. Every haircut, my pulse would ratchet uncontrollably as I bore holes in the barbershop mirror, straining to see if my hair loss had reached levels so obvious as to become unbecoming. I missed classes. I showed up late to parties. I could not leave a mirror ‘til I was satisfied my good Italian hair was as thick & lustrous as it always had been, and always would be. I was a wretch. Despite it all, a million hairs fell from my head each day, as silently as snowflakes. Half a decade later, I’m still not what most people would call “bald,” but my hair is leagues beyond the waypoint of virulent youth. I wear it martially short in the summer, and slightly fuzzier in cold weather. It’s honey-brown now, because it’s got less density, and it’s undeniably thin. That’s for sure. If 19 year-old Dave saw what was in his future, he would’ve wept in horror. But 26 year-old Dave doesn’t spend a single red cent on hair-loss products, nor does he waste undue time gazing wistfully at his wispy dome in the mirror. I’ve recovered from the torturous flat spin of hair despair, at least for the moment. I stopped caring. It ended around my 25th birthday. That knot of dread in my stomach untied itself, quietly skulking off into the far reaches of my psyche. Like a five-year fever, my obsession with my own decay had broken. Would I prefer to have a tangled mane of curly locks cascading over my brow? Duh. I’m human, and most of us are at least a little vain. Borne away on a current of thousand-year-old hormones & biochemicals, my follicles have betrayed me. But they say the best revenge is living well, so I grew a mustache & shaved my head. Each time I see myself in the mirror, I grin bravely, and think: My hair is gone, but I’m still here. Then I turn off the light and leave the room. Our reflections can only grip us as long as we stand in front of them. Originally published at fiveoclock.harrys.com. Illustration by Tim Lahan.",2015
I Feel Nothing — The Struggle of Depression,"While fighting an episode of depression one day, I started writing to give my hands and mind something to do other than just sit and stare into space. This is the result of that moment… I feel nothing. I can barely feel the keys as they are pressed beneath my fingers. I check my pulse with my heart rate app to make sure it’s still beating. I feel like I’m floating in space, but not the exciting kind that’s the result of a ride on the shuttle. My breathing feels shallow, almost like my body is saying, “I’ve had enough of this feeling. Just let it end.” With that last sentence, I remember why I continue to breath. My husband. My son. My friends. I fight the sadness, but it doesn’t feel like I’m fighting at all. It feels like I’m sitting, alone in an office I don’t want to be in, struggling for my life. Struggling to find that happy place. Heck! Struggling to remember what happy is. I start to name off things in my head that make me happy. My husbands smile, my son’s laugh, hugs from my friends, but as I name things off, I start to realize I can’t remember anything else to add to the list. What a sad life it is to only be able to name off three things that make me happy. I start to think back to trips on the Disney Dream and a glimmer of hope shines, but then quickly fades. I remember once again that I’m trapped in an office that I don’t want to be in, doing a job I’m not fully satisfied in. I want to reach out for my teddy bear, but he’s on the other side of my office and I feel paralyzed in my current position. It’s hard to keep writing, but it’s how I’m reminding myself that I am indeed alive. I hate it when someone says “this too shall pass” and they’re right. This will pass. And eventually, another episode will hit. My only hope is that I will have a happy moment when it’s over to get me through the next one…",2015
"Environmental Silencing of the “Love Hormone” Leads To Altered Fear Response, Says Study","Oxytocin is an agile molecule. Often called the “love hormone,” oxytocin plays a starring part in both bonding and caregiving behaviors; however, in recent years, scientists have also come to realize that it has an additional, extensive role in regulating the human stress response. Now, a new study suggests that signals provided by the external world can can halt production of the brain’s oxytocin receptors on a molecular level. Thanks to subtle rewiring of an individual’s DNA, these changes appear to predict that he or she will experience negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, and anger differently — and perhaps more intensely — than others. Whether we know it or not, our worldly environment acts in constant concert with our genes. Through choice (the foods we eat, the behaviors we choose to carry out) or fate (events in utero, our family upbringing), over time our DNA accumulates minuscule chemical tags that ultimately determine which of our genes are expressed, and which are not. This is the magic of epigenetics. One of these changes occurs by way of a process called methylation, a method of biochemical silencing that is triggered at so-called CpG sites — areas where a molecule of cytosine, a building block of DNA, sits next to both a phosphate group and a molecule of another building block, called guanine. Once a methyl group is added to the CpG site, it can no longer be transcribed. No transcription means no translation — and therefore, no protein synthesis or function. In the new paper, researchers at the University of Virginia discuss what happens when the gene that governs the production of the brain’s oxytocin receptor (the OXTR gene) is silenced in this way. Without a functional receptor in the brain, oxytocin has nowhere to bind and thus cannot exert its influence. Since oxytocin has such a vital role in both social connection and stress management, the authors hypothesized that this kind of silencing would have a significant effect on the way the study participants observed and processed intense emotions. A sample of 98 Caucasian adults, aged 18–30, were divided into two groups, based on the results of a simple genetic blood test: those whose DNA revealed greater levels of methylation in regions that coded for the oxytocin receptor, and those whose genome was less methylated in these areas. Then, the participants underwent fMRI scans while being shown images of human faces displaying potent emotions, such as fear and anger. Indeed, the group with greater silencing of the OXTR gene — and therefore less ability to bind oxytocin — had a pronounced response in a region of the left brain called the amygdala, a bilateral almond-shaped structure that processes our most primal drives and feelings. These same individuals also showed decreased connectivity between the right amygdala and other areas of the brain that are involved in emotional processing and facial recognition. Taken together, these results imply that individuals with less available oxytocin tend to have both a heightened anxiety response and an impaired ability to empathize or take social cues. These ideas could inform research into emotional and social disorders already believed to arise (at least in part) from dysfunctional oxytocin signaling, such as autism spectrum disorders and depression. “Defining biomarkers like this epigenetic tag associated with the oxytocin receptor may help us to predict future social developmental problems and inform interventions for those with social deficits,” explained Professor Jessica J. Connelly, one of the study’s co-authors. Ultimately, the researchers hope that their work will contribute to the development of faster and easier diagnostic tests for psychological disorders — a vision of a world that requires only a blood sample and epigenetic analysis to cure all of a person’s social ills. The research was published in the February 9 issues of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A copy of the paper is available here.

Using this technique you can overcome your social anxiety and start leading the life you you want.,"Using this behavioral technique you can overcome your social anxiety and start leading the life you want without fear getting in the way. If you suffer from social anxiety, you most likely face situations that fill you with fear and dread to the point where you avoid these parts of your life completely. Maybe you find yourself anxious when you meet new people, or you feel incapable of simple activities like eating out or driving a car? Watch this video and if you find yourself relating to it, you may have social anxiety. Don’t worry, this isn’t one of those articles that just tells you to “take a breath” or “wait it out” next time you have a anxiety attack. Instead, I want to share with you a technique that I have personally used that will not only alleviate your stress in the short term, but also teach you how to handle your anxiety triggers for the long haul. So if you are one of the thousands of people that suffer from social anxiety, I’m here to help you beat it for good using a technique called “exposure hierarchy”. This form of therapy begins with you writing down a list of 10 anxiety-provoking situations and putting them in order of severity. It helps to rate them on a 100-point scale (zero being no anxiety; 100 being severe anxiety). Your list might start with talking on the phone and end with going out by yourself. The ideal scenario is to gradually introduce yourself to increasingly more difficult situations and stay in those situations until your fear subsides on its own. This type of exposure training can be done in real life or in your imagination. Personally, I ended up doing a mixture of both. It sounds simple enough, but there’s a lot of mental power involved. You’re not going to cure yourself overnight, but each day you use this method you’re one day closer to a more confident you. It’s important to note that I’m not a therapist or doctor, but I can attest to the fact that this type of treatment has helped me tremendously. I’ve had issues with anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been the odd one out growing up, and although my “weirdness” made me a better artist it didn’t really help me be more social. If anything, it made it ok to be an outcast. I’ve shared a little about myself and my personal struggles in my past with social anxiety. Since then, I’ve experienced drastic improvements in the way I feel and act when I’m in my usual anxiety-filled situations like going out, talking to clients and being in crowded places. The first step is always realizing you have a problem. And after living in new city for over a year and still not going out or making new friends, I knew something was wrong. So I did some research and stumbled across this article on Psychology Today and started on my own exposure hierarchy therapy. Here are my top 10 anxiety moments rated on a scale 1–100: First I began with the easiest thing on my list, talking on the phone. This isn’t something that I get too worried about, but I still get a little shaky when I’m talking to new prospective clients for the first time. So to properly prepare my mind to overcome my phone anxiety, I envisioned different conversations I would have with a new client. I thought about things like “How would I introduce myself?” and “How would I describe my services?” I ran this mock conversation over and over in my head until I felt completely prepared to make a great impression on my next phone call. Then, after I was done doing my mental homework, I simply started making more phone calls. Don’t get me wrong, making these phone calls still sucked and I was still anxious at this point, but this time I had the tools to push through it. Meditate and mentally prepare to conquer your fears, only then will you have the tools to overcome them. So I made some phone calls. A lot of phone calls. I cold called local businesses and agencies. I called previous clients. I called so many people in a matter of a few days that my social anxiety around talking to clients on the phone had completely vanished, and I was able to gain a bunch of new business because of it. I found a new sense of confidence in overcoming my anxiety that I felt secure in tackling the next phobia on my list. So far I’ve overcome 4 out of my top 10 anxieties in just a few months. This time next year I hope to be through all 10 and live closer to an anxiety free lifestyle. I hope this article was helpful and that you will join me in washing away your fears and removing the stress from your life that’s preventing you from being happy. Please share this article if you think it may help someone you know that’s currently struggling with social anxiety. Originally published at lettershoppe.com on March 24, 2015.",2015
The Chinese Finger Lock: Traps of the mind and how to be released from anxiety,"Have you ever found yourself obsessing over some aspect of your life, which you can’t seem to fix? In fact, the more you worry about it the worse it gets? I call these Chinese Finger Lock states. Just like with the classic toy trap, trying to get out of the situation only gets you more stuck. I’m going to present some of these fairly common anxiety scenarios that run rampant among goal-oriented types. People will try their hardest to find a reasonable way out, but the reality is that the way forward is opposite of what the mind wants to do. Remember the last time you had a sleepless night? You rotated sleeping positions, counted sheep, drank some chamomile tea, but your mind remained alert. The idea of sleep was like salvation, but your body had other ideas. Alertness refused to drop its guard even though your mind knew you needed to be rested for an important meeting the next day. Why oh why is sleep, delicious oblivion, the one function you have no control over? Nobody enjoys this inevitable scenario, but sometimes insomniacs fall into a cognitive trap much like the finger lock when they encounter this situation one too many times. Instead of taking it in stride and using their lost sleep as a drive to get more sleep the next night, insomniacs will start to worry and anticipate. The thought of another sleepless night is just too much to bare. They start to TRY to sleep. And as soon as sleep becomes something you can try and fail at it becomes a threat. Now the brain’s arousal systems become tied to the idea of sleep. To make it worse, insomniacs will start to revolve their worlds around their sleep, so they don’t even have a life to distract themselves from sleep worries. They go to bed earlier in the off chance that they might catch some ZZZs, but it just means more time that they lie in bed not sleeping and being in a high arousal state. Pretty soon all things related to sleep become triggering to them. This includes just getting in their bed, napping, or even looking at a clock face. The real way out of this mess is counterintuitive to what insomniacs will tend to do. The most effective recommendations (as per Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) for insomnia are to 1) actually restrict time spent in bed, and 2) not climb into bed until you think you might actually fall asleep. One of the main goals is to maximize sleep efficiency in order to create a strong association in your mind between your bed and the state of sleep. This is done by increasing the time asleep over time in bed, which means decreasing the amount of time in bed not sleeping and also decreasing the total time you are allowed to be in bed. When you experience this type of restriction, your body will tend to use the time you are allowed in bed more efficiently and overcome some of the arousal that you have associated with going to bed. This counterintuitive strategy is a good part of what releases the “finger lock” state of insomnia. An additional counterintuitive strategy is to start living your life again and stop putting so much pressure on whether you will sleep. The bottom line is that if you get tired enough, your body will sleep. And you won’t die in the meantime. Another common example of a “finger lock” state is when people become obsessed with a bodily sensation (heart racing, shortness of breath) as in panic attacks or a bodily function (sweating/blushing/shaking) as in social anxiety disorder. A panic attack starts off with a physical sensation related to arousal, perhaps during a time of stress. Our bodies have physiologic changes under stress that can feel strange given that we are no longer chased by lions. This can lead you to believe that feeling heart racing must mean that there is something wrong with your body. Then worried thoughts about your body activate more arousal systems and more of the sensations that come with arousal, which cause more worry. This is a positive feedback loop that escalates into a panic attack. You feel like something terrible is happening, but in reality a panic attack cannot actually harm you. In social anxiety a person may be sweating in an uncomfortable social situation and start to worry that others may notice and judge them. This leads to more sweating and then more worry. Another “finger lock” feedback loop. The way out of both panic attacks and social anxiety is not to try harder or care more, but to just let it happen and not give weight to the worry thoughts. In fact, treatment may involve exposing you to more of these situations and sensations in order to desensitize. That is the real way out of the finger trap, which is the opposite of what people tend to want to do. The intrusive thoughts associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), also called the doubting disease, is yet another “finger trap”. A classic example is driving down the highway and running over an amorphous blob. You’re pretty sure it’s a garbage bag, but you just can’t be sure. Some part of the brain keeps nagging you that it could have been a body. The uncertainty that you might have run over a person is so distressing that it takes over your thoughts. How can you not pay attention to the possibility that you have run over a human being with your car???? These obsessional thoughts can encompass all sorts of taboos from fear of contamination to thoughts of harming a child. The more you try to avoid thinking about it the more it intrudes into your thoughts… like telling someone not to think of a pink elephant. This “finger trap” feedback loop is very distressing and hard to treat. In reality, the thought is just a thought with a negligible possibility of being true. The uncertainty feels important, when in fact the thought does not deserve any importance. The way out of the “finger lock” in this case may involve using mindfulness techniques to observe the thought (but not avoid it) and strip it of its importance so that it loses its power. From the examples above you can see how the concept of Chinese finger lock states can apply across a range of anxiety disorders. The cause of many of these situations stems from placing importance on distressing thoughts whether it be the thought of having a sleepless night, the thought of something being wrong with your body, the thought that someone is judging you, or the thought that you can’t be sure you won’t do something awful. It seems important to pay attention to these worries, and it seems like you should attack these worries the same way you would attack any other problem in your life. But for some reason these thoughts don’t have the same properties as other problems in your life and you have to rethink your strategy. So, the next time you wonder if you might be making your own anxiety worse, consider taking a counterintuitive strategy. Take a good look at your thoughts, lean in, relax into it, and let the trap release.",2015
A Story That Will Open Your Eyes About Worrying and Anxiety,"What is the meaning of worrying and anxiety? Why are we as people given those feelings at all? The curiosity about the future is deeply rooted in our nervous system. We worry because our ego wants and tries to control everything. But we can’t control at least half of the things in our lives. And understanding, embracing and giving in to this insecurity can help us live present, happier and more fulfilled lives. Worrying is not a means to an end — it a response of not feeling one with the universe. It is a response of detachment from the universal power. Worrying can be quite hard to fight. All kinds of ugly and unpleasant scenarios follow us daily. No matter how bad life can get, worrying about it has no affect whatsoever on the outcome. And this is the message that I want to share with you through this Story That Will Open Your Eyes About Worrying and Anxiety In a mountain far away lived a young shepherd, Sam, with his wife, Kaya. They had just gotten married and were having their first child in a couple of months. Kaya’s father, an old man with a big sheep herd, had given Sam 50 of his best sheep to start providing for his new family. It was the first time that Sam owned sheep — he had taken care of many but never his own. The sheep were growing and so was Kaya’s belly. Kaya noticed that her husband is constantly worried about the rain that was supposed to make the fields green, full of feed for the sheep. “If there is no rain, the fields won’t go green with grass and the sheep will have nothing to eat” was constantly worrying Sam. “If even one of them dies, what will I tell your father? I will be shamed! What will I do?” he was asking to his beloved bride. Kaya decided to go to her father and share with him her groom’s worries. “Father”, she said, “he is constantly worried and can’t even feel the happiness that comes from having our first child. How can I help my husband?” “Go back home and tell him that he shouldn’t worry because the last two years were dry. After two dry years, there is always plenty of rain. I am 60 years old and I have seen this happen again and again.” The old man did not know if there would be rain but he knew that his son-in-law needed peace of mind. Kaya went home and told Sam what her father had said. Sam trusted the experienced shepherd and happily started preparing for a rainy season. Sure that there will be rain, Sam stopped worrying and could enjoy the birth of his first son. And so rain came, not much but enough to have green grass and healthy sheep. The time was coming for the sheep be freed of their fleece to be sold on the annual market that happened three villages away. Kaya was happy with her son and the course of life but she couldn’t be fully satisfied seeing her husband taken over by worries again. He had never sold sheep’s fleece before at the market and was constantly thinking if anyone would buy the wool so he could feed his family for the next couple of months. Kaya decided to visit her old father again. She brought his grandson with her and told the old man about her husband’s worries. “Listen daughter, tell Sam that I have a buyer for all his clip. But this buyer only purchases the best quality wool — clean, good quantity, from healthy sheep and well taken care of. If he can provide the best wool that can be found in our region, I can arrange for the buyer to purchase it all” The old man did not know a buyer but he knew that the best wool will be sold out on the market within hours. Kaya went home overwhelmed with happiness and told her husband that if his sheep produced the best wool, her father had a buyer. Sam got really excited and all his worry disappeared — he worked hard, took his sheep to the best fields and cleanest springs, kept them clean, gave them plenty of love and exercise, and at the end had such wool that he couldn’t even dream of. He was headed to the market with more of the best quality wool than he had expected. As soon as he entered the market area people started asking for the price and soon buyer after buyer wanted to buy from the high quality wool. When Kaya’s father arrived he was glad to see his son-in-law happy and successful. Sam said “I am sorry, father, but there is not much wool left for your buyer. Almost all is sold and we will have a plentiful year!” “Don’t worry son”, said the old man, “there is no other buyer I know but the good judgement of tradesmen here — I knew that as soon as they see your great wool they will buy it all. You see there is no need to worry about anything — if you can do something about it, do your best as with the clip; if you can’t do anything about it — expect and pray for the best, but accept whatever comes like with the rain.” “Thank you, father”, said Sam, “now I see your wisdom. Worry doesn’t solve a problem but would have stolen my attention from my son’s birth. It would have also limited my efforts to have the best wool. Worry is not something a good shepherd endures.” Worrying doesn’t do anything good for us. As Sam finally understood, to worry means to miss opportunities for enjoying life and doing a better job. If someone around you is worried ask them this question: Can you do something about it? If YES, just stop worrying and focus your energy on doing the best you can. If NO, stop worrying and start thinking and praying for the best result. There is no need to worry at all. There are two types of problems — the one that can be fixed, so why worry? And the ones that can not be fixed and we must accept — why worry? Stay HAPPY Minty aka Antoniya If you liked this story and want to learn more about fighting anxiety, you might like this.

"<strong class=""markup--strong markup--h3-strong"">On Living with Darkness</strong>","The first time the lie slipped out of my mouth, I knew I had found my way out. The words simply rolled off my tongue and popped out into the world. I told everyone I left New York because I needed the change. I answered every question like it was no big deal, like, “Yeah, it was time for a change.” As if my heart started to yearn for something new — started to yearn for another adventure, one that would push me into the unknown once again. The lie sprouted white wings and I held onto it as I flew across the Atlantic Ocean and landed in London; the truth is my heart wasn’t yearning for anything — not when I had you. But while the truth was hooked into my skin that weighed me down, the lie kept giving me the kiss of life every time I needed oxygen. No, I didn’t need a change. Not when you introduced happiness and light to my life. But happiness is a writer’s worst enemy; it takes our muse and defiles her right in front of our eyes. Which is why I had to leave. I left the island of Manhattan because it — you — made me so ridiculously happy. I left New York City because you made me the happiest girl on earth. I left NYC because my writing suffered. Because I couldn’t write anymore. I used to be able to write. I hopped on a plane to Los Angeles a couple of years ago, ready to tackle an MFA. I used to write about the dark, the ghosts of my past that played with me ever since I was a little girl. I used to run with ghouls and monsters, and gladly allowed memories to haunt me every midnight. I used to write about rape and abuse, about perverse sexual thoughts that should never be found dining inside a little girl’s mind. I used to write about all the wrong reasons why loving the dark, dark night was the best thing to ever happen to anyone. That was my happiness; that was me never being alone. Not with thoughts like that swimming around in the ocean of my mind, not when I had a mind that was never quiet, that would never shut up, not when I had a mind that would never stop snarling and shouting and screaming. Anxiety and depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder were the greatest friends I could want, and they would join me every single day and night as I put pen to paper and words poured from my fingers and found new life in the universe. Anxiety made me rush into the darkest corner of my brain and sit and write while depression kept vomiting green liquid inside my head. I tortured characters I created and loved, characters who should’ve left me a long, long time ago, but they stayed; they stayed as I wrote chapter after chapter after chapter. Characters who slowly started to look a lot like you. Obsessive-compulsive disorder made me get out bed every single night in my apartment in West Hollywood at 3:33 a.m. to check if the stove was off. It made me turn it back on and off — just to be sure — before stopping by the light switch to turn that on and off again. I turned that light switch on and off three times every single night, exactly six hours after I texted you goodnight — once for God, twice for Christ, and thrice for the Holy Spirit. Obsessive-compulsive disorder also made me stare at the lock on the door for a full 33 seconds — just to make sure it was locked. Just to make sure I was keeping all of the bad things inside my apartment, to make sure my demons stayed and hugged my body because you were all the way in New York; just the way it was supposed to be. I experienced Los Angeles through black ink — never wrote in anything other than black. “To match the colour of my heart and soul,” I joked when you asked me why over Skype, and it was then your turn to snarl and tell me my heart was filled with colours of the rainbow, as if God was smiling down at us at that very moment. And somehow my black pens became replaced with blue and purple and dark green once I made the move to New York. Coloured pens were all I grasped for when a thought invaded my brain. Somehow, I stopped playing with distorted memories of faces and started staring at your picture in my wallet — stared at it before I fell asleep instead of the lock on the door. Sometimes I would look at it for 30 seconds or maybe for five minutes — I don’t know and I wasn’t really counting anyway. But I stopped checking the stove because you made everything inside my head go quiet. Somehow, you slipped through the cracks of turning the lights on and off every night — you fell into my heart and soul long before you fell into my bed, into my very body, and I was falling in love with you faster than I ever thought possible. My ghosts started to fade in the background and I began to stop pleading with them to stay. My demons weren’t screaming inside my head anymore; the only loud noises I heard came from your mouth when we were alone in your apartment. My fingers ceased searching for the holes in my ears attempting to keep all the loudness inside me; I quit hoping for bad thoughts that usually rolled around whenever the clock struck witch’s hour. I even stopped washing my hands for 180 seconds every time I needed to because your body was the purest form I had ever touched. When I had you in the bed next to me, the world fell away and I could see no germs trying to assault my body. I knew the stove was off without checking and I could worship your body like it was the gates to heaven and I would find immortality in your, “Oh my God, please don’t stop.” I could keep the lights off too, because your soul was the only lantern I needed to find my way home. Oh yes. You made me deliriously happy. But the castle you built with those high walls inside me — the ones that told me I was enough, the ones that taught me to look up because the sun rises every morning, as the storm passes every night — kept words locked outside. And I couldn’t write anymore. I didn’t have to write to save my soul, and I didn’t really know what to do. Because while you gave me myself, I lost those friends that kept me company all those lonely years of growing up. So I jumped on a plane and crossed the Atlantic like there was nothing to it. Like I wasn’t tearing my own heart into pieces, like it wasn’t shattered; like the demons weren’t rubbing their hands as they feasted on my mangled body. Like I wasn’t leaving you behind, like my head wasn’t starting to chime all over again as I lost you in the crowd at JFK. Now I find myself writing on cold London nights in black ink again — I also find myself switching lights on and off, watching the flame on the stove live and die. I am only able to leave the house during even minutes — never odd — and write in two documents side by side on a 90% scale; I also rearrange my desk with objects that are perpendicular to each other. I find I circle dates that would have marked anniversaries and I’m terrified of reaching the one year mark of when I last saw you — because the day after that I’ll no longer be able to think, “This time last year…” Perhaps the only thing I no longer do is wash my hands after I hold your photograph.

Fé,"Tempos depois de ter acabado, me perguntei: se não era possível, então, era amor? E se não era amor, o que era? Na vez seguinte e depois de acabar, era a mesma coisa. Não, não a mesma, mas similar: cada vez era possível. Até que não era mais. O que é isso que corrói este sentido de possibilidade? Algo em nós nos leva a essa alegria desenfreada e depois nos contêm. Quando eu olho para o passado dos meus relacionamentos, eu não posso ver o que me aproximou e depois me expulsou de cada lugar tranquilo. Eu tento entender como cada um falhou, quando cada um parecia tão cheio de promessas. Eu não posso ver as mesmas espécies invasivas que me perseguiram da mesma forma que perseguem qualquer um de nós, a videira florescendo em ansiedade, expectativas, dores antigas e raízes profundas de medo. Eu não sei o quanto essa videira se retorce a minha volta e me puxa para trás, mesmo enquanto eu prossigo. E é quando eu corto a videira pela raiz que eu finalmente entendo o que é estar apaixonado. Alguém pergunta: “Como você sabe, como eu sei, como nós sabemos se é real ou se estamos nos iludindo?” “É tão real quanto nós acreditamos que seja”, responde o outro. A primeira carta de amor que eu escrevi deve ter sido digna de atenção, como todas as cartas de amor são a sua maneira. Eu posso imaginar como deve ter sido, porque eu tenho escrito muitas desde então. Todas elas, sublinhadas por questões e dúvidas e ansiedade, que se mantiveram comigo tempos depois do amor ter acabado e a correspondência terminado. Há algo sobre despudor naquelas cartas de amor, com suas promessas destemidas, sua exuberância e desejo selvagem. Eu acho que por trás delas, tão nuas com suas necessidades, ainda existe ânsia por uma resposta. Eu penso que deveria me sentir constrangida com isso. Mas eu não sinto isso. Uma carta de amor não é uma declaração da verdade tanto quanto é um tratado sobre esperança. Não há nada vergonhoso nisso. Então eu acho que, cada uma daquelas cartas, uma depois de outra, são rascunhos. Eu estava escrevendo meu caminho para você.",2015
Butterflies,"I can spend a lot of time telling everyone who cares to listen about all the things I am excited about and looking forward to in my impending new gig (I think I already have been doing that!). But the real story is probably hidden away in all the things I am nervous about, the issues I hope I will be able to handle well. Its probably not fashionable to talk about the butterflies in one’s stomach, but in the interest of transparency, here are three key ones. Notice how I never mentioned core product strategy in this list. Well, you better have a core you are good at and I suspect that one is mine! These other things… they are the butterflies in my stomach, a sprinkle of nervousness. I have never gotten on to the stage without feeling a tad nervous, and for most part, it has only made me operate at a higher plane. So bring on the butterflies! They usually hover around good things.",2015
My Travel Anxiety and Me,"It was amidst this jumble of emotions that I found myself packing a series of backpacks at midnight 2 weeks ago, followed by a late night waffle eating session in a kitchen that still had to be cleaned before my trip to Mumbai, India. Less than 24 hours ago, I returned home extremely jet-lagged and still speechless trying to process everything I encountered. It was a dream come true for someone interested in international urban planning and cultural observations; and yet, I could not bring myself to even begin to clean and pack until hours before my departure. Why, you may ask? Well, let me try to explain. I am not the kind of person who hates flying — I actually love flying, and always pick a window seat so that I can watch the plane take off and grin like an idiot. I am not afraid of exploring new places, either alone or in a group. And I love the unexpectedness of travel, where you cannot possibly fathom what you are about to see, hear, and experience. But I love these things because they scare me a little. I like forcing myself out of my comfort zone — it’s where I function best, and it’s where (I feel) I am truest to myself. I guess you could say that the person I am when I travel, when I am fully immersing myself into a new situation, is the person I like most. But it takes work to get there, and that work involves a lot of mental and physical anxiety stress. So, here are some tips I have found that help to prevent some of the more taxing after effects of any kind of travel. I LOVE making lists. Sometimes I make lists of lists that I need to make. Nothing is quite so satisfying as crossing off a completed task. It is often difficult to pack a week or two in advance, BUT it is easy to make a list of what items you are taking with you on your trip! If you are anything like me (and I hope you are not), you subconsciously set yourself up for further stress by leaving things until the almost last minute. It truly is a form of masochism. I now know myself well enough to account for this time, which usually consists of me sitting rimrod straight on my couch silently going over my mental to-do list and panicking as to why I have not yet accomplished any of it. As such, I can plan accordingly for this small freak out, and schedule around it. Procrastination and anxiety is okay! As long as I have my passport, visa, and flight confirmation, I am good to go. Anything else I can figure out later, but a missing passport means no travel and potential detainment (yikes). So while I’m packing, while I am in transit, as I make my way through the airport, on the plane, and even at my destination, I feel around in my bag for my passport. In some circumstances, I sleep with it underneath me. It’s much better to be safe than sorry in this situation; or in my case, it is better to be neurotic than trapped at customs. Also known as my flight checklist, along with the latest issue of Runner’s World and headphones. For those who tend towards anxiety, prepping your stomach and your head for the long periods of sitting and the pressure changes can work wonders. And those tacky U-shaped pillows are GODSENDS. I went from having horrible neck soreness when flying to sleeping like a baby. Just don’t wear it around your neck as you walk around the airport. Just…don’t. Unless I have a new book I am particularly excited about, I like to spend my time on planes and in airports perusing through some of my well-worn paperbacks. These are books I have read at least twice, and are ones that I know I enjoy enough to get lost in the story. This way, I am confident that my mind will be taken off of the magic and mystery of flight, and I can find comfort in a familiar tale. And by this, for anyone who was not a Disney Channel Original Movie fan of the 1990's, I mean drink water like you are turning into a mermaid (or man). Staying hydrated means less headaches and earaches, less stomach pain, and also helps your skin deal with the hours of stale plane air. It also means you have to get up and go to the bathroom, providing ample opportunity to stretch your legs and avoid swollen feet/ankles. I make sure to drink water before going through security, then refill my water bottle at least once before actually getting on the plane. I am not referring to the person having a loud and obnoxious Skype session, or the person who is typing like they have fingers made of lead, or the person who has chosen to subsist on a diet of foods that require voluminous chewing. No, I mean the person who is in the corner or in front of the seats, stretching and maybe even engaging in some easy yoga poses. You may get some stares, but chances are you will never see these people again, and they may be so jet lagged that they think you aren’t real anyways. Most places you travel in the world, unless you are really going into small villages or backcountry, have access to pharmacies, grocery stores, and other locations that sell necessities. If you forget shampoo or a warm coat or a charger, don’t sweat it! Chances are, it can be purchased at or near the airport if not at your final destination. Just make sure to have some cash or a card and you are golden. Eat. Before and maybe even during the plane ride. Non-domestic airlines, I have found, tend to have healthier and better-tasting fare, but don’t count on it. As someone with special dietary needs, I always make sure to have snacks on hand just in case. Travel is stressful, but it is also exciting and productive! I am still in shock that I flew literally halfway across the world and spent a week in a mega-city. Nine times out of ten, the trip is worth the anxiety it causes. And with each adventure I embark on, I have a better understanding of what to expect and how to prepare. To my fellow anxious explorers near and far, bon voyage!",2015
“Don’t Worry”,"The human brain is unmatched in complexity, but the complexity of mind — at least from the perspective of mind — is more of an open question. Possibly its complexity is related to the complexity of the brain and the operation of subjectivity is a highly technical matter only masterable by a mind with an extraordinary aptitude for abstraction and a keen subtlety of perception; or maybe this complexity is merely overlaid in the form of an entirely superfluous tessellation of the simple, elegant controls given us naturally. ******************* It’s possible that one probably more calm friend would say to a friend in distress, “don’t worry!” — but on reception of this good advice, the distressed friend might respond, “if only it were so easy…” and look wistfully into a corner. And sometimes a persistently helpful companion will rejoin that, “I’ll bet it’s not actually as difficult as you think,” which could just add anger to anxiety, but also occasionally spawns a new train of thought which, if not actually useful or productive in its contents, is a different train and probably an improvement over the last. It may be that the first new thought inspired, spoken aloud, perhaps, by an anxious man named ‘Jean,’ say — would resemble, “I can assure you it’s more difficult than you think.” And if the calm friend — whose name might be ‘Lydia,’ or any number of other options — is in actuality a little indifferent to the situation and lets her mind wander in patient boredom, she may respond, “How difficult is it?” This could provoke a less patient response from Jean like, “Well, to start with, if I were to ask myself not to worry, it would only draw my attention to the fact that I’m worrying, which is something that worries me. So, how do I go about it then? The verbal command approach is clearly incorrect since it’s a blatant embodiment of the basic principle of attention that if I say, ‘I will not think of a cat’ — I will assuredly think of a cat. I suppose I could encode the message in such a way that it doesn’t contain — on the surface — the unwanted topic; but I find it exceedingly unlikely that the mind, such a powerful machine of linguistic comprehension, could be tricked by such a meager disguise, like saying, ‘calm down’ instead. So, somehow I’d need to find a message for myself even semantically unrelated to worry, but which would nonetheless trick me into calming down. This certainly is possible, but it wouldn’t be a simple phrase; it would be a lengthy series of reassurances that I’d have to carefully craft not only the content of but my presentation of, so as to not give the impression that I were only reassuring for reassurance’s sake rather than because reassuring possibilities were actually probable.” Now at this point a number of things may happen, but one interesting possibility is that Jean, who is worried, would on reflection of his own discourse on the troubles of worrying, find himself worrying further, “Not only this, but it’s possible after each slip up in this tack that I’d become increasingly aware of the possible artificiality of my reassurances, until they become utterly ineffective and the one comparatively simple recourse made available to me is cut off and cauterized.” While at this point a calm listener like Lydia might feign sympathy and attention, Jean would likely be perceptibly concerned — appearing somewhat rigid and speaking a little more quickly. But he would probably be fine to continue, for example, in this fashion: “Now,” (you might notice him pause briefly to calm down here), “it should be obvious at this point, a source of necessary complication which I’ve avoided bringing up thus far in order to state my qualms with some degree of economy; the looming complication — the, to be frank, seductive, shape-shifting behemoth of looming complication — being the problem of identity. Who is it after all that I’m trying to appease? If I am a single, unified, willful agent, whose thrusts are those that I’m endlessly parrying? ‘Keep your enemies closer,’ of course, but this is too much for comfort. It might be tolerable if there were clearly some definite partition between what I think of as myself and this other, less clearly-intentioned self — that could be tolerable. But that’s not the case. My understanding of what is me and what is him is in constant flux, and every now and then, in an access of perspicacity, I see that there is no division at all; the proposition of unity becomes unquestionable. So then I’m forced to shift between a dread anticipation of an unknowable, unstoppable, malicious force just behind the curtain, and a deep sense of failure and weakness at being unable to control myself — and deeper fear, at the prospect of being unable to control myself. “I’d like to just leave things settled one way or the other: there is myself and I, or it’s all I — but the process of not just calming oneself, but learning how to calm oneself — for what’s the point in doing it just once? — is a process whose success depends entirely on having the correct understanding of what it is that’s being calmed. Maybe others more rigorously scientific in their thinking than myself could settle on one theory, collect more evidence, and then move on to the clear successor — but this is beyond my capacity and I’m instead subjected to a shifting of commitments to one of several partially overlapping theories of myself each arriving with their own special barbs, waiting for me to discover them in bare feet. This introduces confusion into the picture, so that if plain fright becomes too tolerable, the ground below me starts flip-flopping like Escher had drawn it himself just to fuck with my understanding of whether it’s going in or out.” Since Jean would likely have been speaking rapidly for the past few sentences, he might take a deep breath at this point and re-situate himself in a vague, unconscious hope that his internal discomfort would be resolved by a simple physical change. Hopefully he doesn’t, but Jean may at this point say, “Now, if you’re lucky, you peer no further.” And if Jean is set on this course and insists on continuing recklessly in this explanation of dubious utility to himself or his audience, he could possibly say, “But if you are unlucky, you return to the issue of control. You don’t want to look there, but since that’s the crux of the issue and the ground’s shaking beneath you and you don’t know what’s behind the curtain — you do look there. You start watching your internal dialogue since in a sense this is you — the ego, or the will — whatever. You start at the top; there the words are fully formed: you think them, they appear. But you notice there’s something a little strange about how they’re appearing: do I think them, and then they appear? Or are they actually appearing first? — and you’re watching exactly those words pop into your head as you think them! Then all of a sudden you look down where you’d never thought to look before and you see that your thoughts are actually floating up from this black source, which, decidedly — is not you!” Jean will almost certainly be in a panic at this point, heaving and trying to think quickly of how to calm himself, using futile methods that he learned better than to engage in on the first day of his analysis; and the intensity of his fright will probably spread not only to his relatively patient friend, Lydia, but to anyone contemplating his paranoid speech. Their attention at this point would involuntarily turn inward until their self were the only possible contents of consciousness — but it probably would not be the same self they’d expect, and their uncertainty might become palpable. Never mind the propriety of it — I must add that I wish it weren’t possible that Jean could continue to that point; it makes me uncertain myself and wonder things like, “why is there a limit if I start worrying about worrying? — I can worry about that too. There’s not really any reason it couldn’t set off an uncontrollable cascade of worrying that would terminate in psychosis.” I know that it’s ridiculous, don’t get me wrong, but once I have the first paranoid thought, it seems to bias the next thoughts to take the same flavor and I never know where it’s going to stop. Great — I’m starting to worry again about aspects of my ‘situation’ that I know are fine, that I only question through abject paranoia… But… Who am I? What is this place containing me? This is wrong; it isn’t supposed to be like this! I have to try to reassure myself that this is all silly, but — “that won’t work!” “Okay! Okay. I’m sorry.” I’m trembling. I feel certain that things will never improve, and one terrible thought after the next occurs to me. It’s getting worse. I’m beginning to suspect that each of of my prior thoughts was only a friendly defense to distract me from thinking about the control problem again. I see it like a blinding light shining through the fingers of a dark, closed fist; and the light, not meant for mortal eyes, doesn’t just blind but burns its beholders. I don’t want to look at it!My fingers are pressed over my eyes in earnest effort to respect the natural order of things, but they are pried away one at a time and my eyelids are forced open. I try to turn away but something stronger turns me back. There are no words now, only sensations. Then it occurs to me that the laws of thought are not something fixed, but entirely fluid: what I decide is the nature of mind in some sense becomes the nature of mind. The potential here for not only a deeply satisfying existence, but actual ecstasy, is extremely painful to consider: I’m certain that route is utterly inaccessible to me, and only because I’ve decided it’s so, and I’m utterly powerless to undecide it. Rather than cultivating bliss, I’ve consigned myself to permanently exploring what I now realize is the unbounded realm of human suffering. It’s okay — this is recoverable; I can correct my thinking! “No, you can’t.” His thoughts then whirl into a maelstrom of fear, panic, and sadness, screaming that something must be done, but every attempt he makes only pulls him in deeper. Occasionally an errant image of pleasures just outside his grasp stabs, and quickly retreats. He can’t take it anymore — everything just ******************* The human brain is unmatched in complexity, but the complexity of mind — at least from the perspective of mind — is more of an open question. Possibly its complexity is related to the complexity of the brain and the operation of subjectivity is a highly technical matter only masterable by a mind with an extraordinary aptitude for abstraction and a keen subtlety of perception; or maybe this complexity is merely overlaid in the form of an entirely superfluous tessellation of the simple, elegant controls given us naturally.",2015
Crawling Out of My Skin,"I think this might be what you call a “panic attack.” I’m no stranger to these feelings — I dealt with them throughout most of my preteen years, but you never get comfortable with having a panic attack. A comfortable panic attack — that’s practically an oxymoron— the reason I have anxiety is because of that constant, inner feeling of extreme uncomfortableness that rests at the bottom of my stomach, waiting to be released every now and then. When that discomfort decides to rear its ugly head, it pushes its way up through my abdomen, yanking on my intestines, forcing itself up, up, up through my esophagus, finally pushing itself out through my mouth and then — nothing. The discomfort squeaks its way out and into the ether, leaving me gagging and breathless for nothing, reducing me to just a shell, doubled over in a ball of tears with a dry, parched throat. Maybe if something solid or hell, liquid, even, came out with it I’d feel more satisfied. Being sick puts also triggers my anxiety and puts me on edge, but there’s always that relief of expelling evil from inside you. The nothingness that comes out is just a reminder that no matter how hard I try, I will never truly be free from my internalized awkwardness and lack of comfort I battle with every day. Why? Why does this happen? Is there any particular reason for these attacks and how they seemingly occur out of nowhere, randomly? There are a fuckton of reasons, actually. All I need is one feeling, often self-imposed and embedded in my brain, about how I’m worthless or an afterthought, that feeling then collides with repressed memories of past attacks and similar feelings, culminating in an awful marriage with the constant uncertainty about my future and any extra deep-seeded feelings of inadequacy and resentment. It can be thoughts about how I’m not wanted, or that I’m missing out on something, that poke their way into my skull over and over and over again no matter how many times I try to push them away — like an old friend from childhood whose rough, strong fingers would poke my back until I finally snapped at her, a memory I would replay over and over in my tiny, child mind until I exhausted myself from mental self-punishment for my harsh behavior. Other times it’s a news report dictating some kind of doomsday scenario that repeats itself over and over in my brain until I’m ready to pop. Or bad news about a loved one’s health. Or social media updates on sickly animals. Often times it’s heavily dictated by PMS — this last attack certainly was. Mixed emotions of anger, sadness and frustration running at an all-time high during “that time” (ugh) coupled with cramps that feel like hands grasping onto my ovaries, twisting them around and thrashing them against my stomach, like two bikers in a bar fight. Most often it’s a feeling of loneliness and an infinite sadness. But don’t let the flowery language mislead you: it’s not all soft grunge, ‘90s melancholia, pretty sad girls in babydoll dresses and flower crowns. It’s not a sepia-toned fantasy to write a poem about. It’s a real, genuine feeling of complete and utter emptiness. It’s an inability to connect with real, physical beings that surround and care for you. A gut instinct to push away anyone that may want to help, but a terrorizing fear of what may happen if they leave. It’s like sitting in a big, empty room where nothing feels like home, and the walls are moving in closer and closer and closer — like the Roy’s Castle level in Super Mario World, minus the Roy Orbison-lookalike turtle. But those aren’t really “reasons,” are they? They are causes. Self-inflicted mental breakdowns triggered by external circumstances that catch me offguard, knock me to my feet, pick me up again and propel me straight to the bathroom where I end up a red, swollen mess in front of my bathroom mirror, praying that I can get out of my own head and clean myself up in time so no one will see me and ask me what’s going on. Think having a panic attack is rough? Try attempting to come up with an escape plan and a believable excuse about “allergies acting up.” It’s an extra layer of anxiety icing on top of the panic attack cake. I guess I don’t know the exact reasons as to why my brain is hardwired to work against me whenever it processes information that doesn’t fit into my comfortable way of living. I’m not sure why my body and my mind decide to go into battle whenever they feel like it, like a battered husband and wife who get their kicks from picking fights with one another — it’s not fun for either and the makeup sex is never satisfying. All I’m left to do is… deal. I’m still in the bathroom. I’m still fighting myself. I try to focus on thoughts that will distract me from my brain’s attacks against my body and my well-being, and I begin a series of internal discussions. I think of funny stories from work. I think about an interesting article I read on The A.V. Club earlier that day. I wax poetic about ‘90s sitcoms. I remember images of non-sickly animals on social media. I play some solo rounds of FMK. I think about writing, remembering every detail so when this has all passed I can recount it in some way that might make sense to me or to anyone. I brush my hair, over and over and over. I act as my own spiritual advisor and guidance counselor and talk myself through my attack. Eventually, my breathing becomes a little more normal and consistent. Eventually, my face is slightly less red, splotchy and tear-stained. Eventually, I emerge from the bathroom. “What’s wrong?” I collapse in tears again, but this time it’s because I know someone is there. Someone does care. I’m not alone in this world with just my fucked up thoughts to guide me. But I’m a little mad at myself for letting it be seen. Silence. Other times I collapse alone in my bed, until my sadness exhausts me to slumber. I’m a little mad at myself for not just telling someone, anyone, what I’ve just been through. But I always wake up. There’s always another side, a cliched “light at the end of the tunnel.” The attacks will always end, even if the anxiety never goes away. I’ll always come out the winner, just by coming out of it.

"My Name is Carrie, and I Medicate My Son","My 10-year-old son has autism. And we give him anti-anxiety medicine every day. If someone had told me fifteen years ago — back when I was a smart, chic, kind of fit twenty-something newlywed — that my new husband Joe and I would one day give our child a tiny white pill every night, well, I might have laughed. I mean, people who medicate their children are lazy. Everyone knows that. They turn to pills and syrupy liquids because they don’t feel like trying anything else first. We live in a society that is dependent on pharmaceuticals, and parents who give their kids medicine are one more step in the pill-popping downfall of our culture. It is the easy way out. Well, I can tell you that it wasn’t easy. But it was a way out. Here is what I know about anxiety: it is interruption and interference. It is intrusion. It is an insidious, slithering snake. It is barking dogs and static on the radio and nighttime waking and middle-of-the-day wetting. It is fear. It is irrational. And it ruthlessly stalks my son. Jack’s anxiety first started in the spring of 2011, when he was six. It was like being hit with a ton of bricks — he was here one day and gone the next. One day, we had a mildly repetitive, somewhat obsessive little boy, and then he woke up the next morning and started talking to himself and mumbling about wanting to eat his friends and screaming that the wind chill factor was going to make him die. He kept saying babies were going to paint him blue. He was afraid to go to the bathroom. He was afraid to go outside. He was afraid of dogs and stop signs and things that were orange. He stopped sleeping and he never, ever smiled or laughed. Joe and I were completely blindsided. We had no idea that anxiety is autism’s sneaky sidekick; that the two travel in pairs like partners in crime. But then again, we thought Jack would outgrow his spectrum disorder diagnosis by kindergarten, so really, what do we know? We bought a weighted blanket because all the research said weighted blankets are great for reducing anxiety. It didn’t work. We re-painted the room he shares with his three brothers a deep, rich navy because we hoped it would calm him, and make him feel as though he was in a soothing cocoon during the night. It didn’t work. We tried the Wilbarger brushing technique. We bought a huge box of these white, soft brushes that fit in the palm of your hand, and a dozen times a day we would lightly stroke his limbs and his torso. He loved it. But it didn’t work. And after a few weeks his younger brother, Henry, started using the brushes to comb his hair. We did joint compression and massages, breathing techniques and a low-sugar diet. None of it worked. Still Jack was terrified of the wind chill and babies painting him blue. Still, he talked to himself and asked to eat his friends and lurked around the corners of the house like a stranger within our own family. Maybe the worst part was Jack couldn’t even explain what was happening. Over and over we begged him to tell us who he was talking to, why he was so afraid, how to make him feel better, but he could not ask for help. It was as though he was locked in his own psychological prison, without so much as a file in a cake to break out. I wept every day. After two months, the doctor gently suggested it was time to try medication, and so we did. And it worked. Slowly, Jack returned to us. Slowly, he smiled when he saw his favorite cartoon and stopped having accidents because he was afraid of the water in the toilet. He didn’t shriek and cover his ears when he saw a baby in a stroller. That was four years ago. And since then, we never once changed the prescription or the dosage, even though Jack is a good forty pounds heavier and at least a foot taller. Then last summer we decided to stop it altogether. But over the past two months, Joe and I have noticed some changes; some differences in Jack’s demeanor and his movements and his sleeping. You know when you’re wearing a shirt that doesn’t fit quite right? Maybe the sleeves are too short or the fabric is too scratchy or the collar is stiff. But you’ve already left for school or work or your meeting or the gym and it’s too late to go back and change, so you just stick it out for the day. And for the entire day, this shirt nags at you. You tug at the sleeves and pull at the collar. You can’t concentrate. You feel irritated and all you can think about is taking it off the second you get home. That’s exactly how Jack looks. He looks like his shirt doesn’t fit quite right. Only instead of a shirt, it’s his skin. And he can’t go home at the end of the day and take it off; he has to wear it for his whole life. He talks incessantly about getting stuck in a time machine. He’s afraid he’ll be transported back to colonial times and the time machine will break or he’ll forget how to work it and he’ll have to stay there without us. He won’t go outside because he’s afraid he will fall down in the snow and not be able to get up. And when we tell him he will be able to get up himself, and if he isn’t he can call us and we will help him, he insists we won’t be able to hear him. He can’t perform the simplest, everyday task — things he used to do easily, like brushing his teeth, pouring his own cereal, taking his homework out of his red backpack — without screeching about how he can’t do it, it’s too hard for him, he is scared. He fidgets and he twitches and he wrings his hands all day long. If he’s sitting, he bends over at the waist and rubs his palms down the length of his thighs. He doesn’t smile easily, but every so often he laughs maniacally at a joke no one in the room has told. He talks to himself. He is not sleeping. He is afraid. His prison is back. This time, there are no more rooms to paint. Jack can’t stop jumping and flapping long enough for us to use the brushes, and he complains the weighted blanket is too hot. When you live alongside autism, there are a lot of firsts — momentous milestones we never thought we’d reach. And every once in a while, I like to take them out and hold them up to the light like rare, precious jewels. His first word. His first sentence. His first real two-armed hug, and the first time he ate a piece of salmon. The first time he lost his smile. The first day he got it back. And then, about a week ago, the first time he asked me for help. “Please be next to me. In this bed. I can’t stop it for thinking about the time machines.” If I had my own time machine, I would travel back to my young newlywed self. I would loop my arm through hers and bend my head close. And I would ask her not to judge her future, because she has yet to walk in her own shoes. She has yet to meet a tender, precious, funny boy named Jack. She has yet to imagine the rich, dusty purple of a Saturday or Sunday morning’s brilliant yellow. She has not yet held the fate of a child’s joy in the palm of her hand like the most fragile, breathtaking butterfly. She has yet to hear the softest, saddest whisper in the silence of a navy blue room. “My brain. My brain. It is moving fast. It feels not right.” She has yet to try and melt his snow. We have refilled the prescription. And two nights ago, I shook the small amber vial and gave Jack his first tiny white pill. I watched him drink it down with a mouthful of water. And then I prayed. I prayed it would help to bring him home, just like it did the first time.

I’ll Trade You Some Spark For A Zoloft. Whaddya Say?,"“How is Jax’s anxiety medicine working?” I nodded over to my son. See for yourself. The prior sessions with Jax’s trauma counselor involved a lot of attempts to manage my son as he darted, verbally and physically, from topic to topic, corner to corner. He tried to climb onto the back of the overstuffed arm chair so he could touch the tallest branch of the artificial tree, he found hidden toys, tried to remove the batteries from the table clock, examined lamps and plugs and looked under the rug. He was constant motion. He is always constant motion. Today though, the chair wasn’t being used as a launch pad. Jax was curled up on the cushion, quiet and still, with his head on the pillowed arm rest. “He’s calm,” she said. “He’s calm,” I echoed. She waited for me to add more and I waited for her. She knew my issues with this. I fought meds. That’s not an easy fight in this day and age, and I stood strong against a lot of judgment and prescription offers and “Well, I can’t help you then” from doctors and therapists. I listened to about a hundred people say, “If he had a heart issue, would you turn down medication?” And a hundred times, I opted not to engage, and usually said something vague and friendly about research, side effects, and trying less invasive options first. And a hundred times, people looked at me like they were sorry for my son for having such an unreasonable mother. I scoured the internet, met with naturopaths, nutritionists and trauma counselors. And we made progress — some noticeable progress. What changed my mind was a day at summer camp. Jax’s aide was sick so I went with him. He was happy, he loved it, he had a great time. But he could not sit still for longer than 4 seconds. I know because I timed it, and I’m pretty sure the 4 seconds was just the downtime needed to calculate his next move. The amazing thing is that he heard the directions and was able to process the instructions. It was as if he had to be moving in order to focus. I watched him and imagined his potential if his little body could just settle. More than anything, I want to help my child. So I said okay, we’ll try the meds. The first prescription, an SSRI, increased his tics to a point where he could not speak. We switched to a second med, an ADHD stimulant, and the first day was like nothing I’ve ever seen. My son, on speed, could recall every detail of every lesson for the past year. It was awesome and eerie at the same time. The second day he cried for six hours straight and told me he wanted to go to sleep and not wake up. The third try brings us to his counselor’s office, where he laid down, quietly, in the big, cozy chair. Jax, looking a little distant, excused himself to go the restroom. The counselor spoke first. “The tension is gone. But so is his spark.” Exactly. I told her, “the meds have kicked in, and he’s been like this for about a week.” She paused and spoke carefully, without any judgment or bias. “How important is the spark?” It was a good question. A reasonable question. Even on the lowest dose, Jax was dull. He was like half-Jax, a shadow of my kid, a two-dimensional copy. But he was calm and more focused. He was easier to manage at school and at home. His frustration had decreased and his attention had increased. The medication did what it was supposed to do. So really, how important is my son’s spark? I spent a lot of time on this. I looked at every angle of this question, dissected it out loud with close friends and family, weighed every outcome. I want you to know that this is not a pollyanna, knee-jerk answer I am about to give you. His spark is everything. His spark grabbed my heart from a small online orphanage photo and refused to let it go. His spark walked me into my lavender and pink future baby girl’s room, and made me realize “well, duh, this is all wrong.” His spark kept him alive in pretty dire circumstances and pulled me across the world to bring him home. His spark makes him hilarious and sweet, it leads him to work outside the box where he’s at his best, it makes people laugh, gives him compassion and fuels his progress. His spark is everything. After four attempts at medication, we are back to nothing but a daily multi-vitamin. I am not saying we will never try it again and I’m not saying medication is evil or never a good solution. All I’m saying is, to date, the trade off has been too big for us. Becca Masterson is a mom, attorney and avid people watcher. She writes at SincerelyBecca.com.

"<em class=""markup--em markup--h3-em"">There Is So Much Time</em>","Astronauts experience three times the gravity of Earth upon liftoff. Under this increased pressure, fluid weighs more, and the heart has to pump faster to deliver blood to the brain. Even with training in increased gravity simulators, special flight suits, and seats that keep their bodies in the prone position, the crew risks fainting. Deep-sea divers, too, experience heavy pressure. As they descend below the waves, they stop at increments to allow their body to gradually adjust. Below certain depths, divers require special equipment and breathe gas formulations to avoid hyperoxia, a toxic and potentially deadly condition that occurs at higher atmospheric pressure, when there is too much oxygen absorbed into body tissues. The body is a system in precarious balance, and activities like diving and spaceflight can threaten that balance. Divers have to take precautions because the body doesn’t have much tolerance for pressure. Staying alive is more difficult underwater, and they train in order to prime their bodies for these harsh conditions. There are mechanisms in place: the special gas blends, the decompression stops, even decompression chambers that are used in emergencies when divers ascend too fast. The astronauts train, too. Simulators help their bodies acclimate to the g-forces of lift off, but even then, an astronaut’s heart must work harder to maintain the status quo. The body is working harder to stay alive. I’m sitting in a leather chair across from my therapist in his office. No windows, just a few dim lamps with warm, amber light. No LEDs here. He slouches across his chair, one leg bent over the other, the way teenage girls always sit when they’re in a basement gossiping. It doesn’t look comfortable. Anxiety is a bit of a mystery. It has something to do with neurotransmitters, and sometimes symptoms disappear or dissipate when patients take an SSRI (a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, for the uninitiated). I take sertraline. It works well enough. But I don’t want to rely on pharmaceuticals just to maintain a level head, and so I come to Dr. Miller to learn how to cope with anxiety. Patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder struggle with catastrophizing. Certain events or thoughts prompt irrational reactions, and spark a train of hypothetical questions answered by worst-case scenarios. Dr. Miller had me keep a log of these chains so that I could see how irrational my habits were. Once, I was supposed to meet a friend for coffee. We had made plans and I arrived at the café ten minutes early. She was late. At first, ten minutes. Then thirty. My mug was empty, so I left the shop and paced up and down the street in the brisk night air. I checked her Twitter. Nothing. I checked her Instagram. Nothing. I checked my text messages about twelve times a minute. Still nothing, not even the reassuring read receipt. I went home, and still no answer. I considered calling her friend, the one who didn’t particularly like me in the first place, to see if she had heard from my coffee date in the past hour or so. I checked all the news sources, certain that she must have been in a horrible car accident on the way. I tried to find a police scanner, because maybe the news would have ignored a deadly car crash. Those happen all the time, right? They don’t matter until they strike someone you know. On my couch, my legs bounced up and down and my heart raced and I tried to sit still and ignore the sweat on my forehead and my shaking fingers. My friend offered to pack a bowl to ease my escalating neuroticism. And then my phone lit up with a cheerful tone. “Hey, so sorry. I was on the phone with my grandfather.” Well then. She wasn’t dead in a fiery car crash. This sort of event, this irrational feeling of terror, has happened before. When my father is late coming home from the airport, I check the news to see if there have been any plane crashes. When I have a headache, I check WebMD for signs of a brain tumor. The stress of day to day living taxes my nervous system more than it should. An average event causes my mind to catastrophize and my heart to beat harder. For a person with anxiety, it’s hard work to deal with the status quo, and it’s hard work to stay alive. NASA astronauts have some of the most stringent qualifications of any career program. They’re required to have good blood pressure and vision that can be corrected to 20/20 acuity. They must fall within a certain height range, and have spent a thousand hours as piloting jet aircraft. They’re required both to be in top physical condition and to be scientists (in 1964, the program even required a doctoral degree). After fulfilling these basic requirements, astronauts train for upwards of two years before they are even considered for space flight. Before they fly (they’re required to fly fifteen hours per month in NASA’s fleet of jet aircraft), candidates undergo the military’s underwater survival training and become SCUBA certified. Turns out, the outer reaches of the atmosphere and the depths of the sea are pretty similar when it comes to harsh environments for humans. Catastrophe plagues space flight. After a series of high-profile explosions, including the death of a Virgin Galactic test pilot, an article in Bloomberg Businessweek noted that if airplanes crashed as often as shuttles did, there would be 272 wrecks per day in the United States alone. I don’t think my inclination to check on my father’s flight status would be unwarranted in that scenario. Diving, too, has dealt with its share of disaster. Divers who ascend too quickly endure the “bends,” when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream. Those afflicted can die if not transferred to a hyperbaric chamber as soon as possible. Even then, they can suffer long term brain damage. But both the astronauts and the divers undergo training and learn protocols and safety measures. They know how to react when a mission goes awry. Presumably, neither astronauts nor divers spend time catastrophizing while they leave the atmosphere or delve into the depths. It would be fatal to do so. Sessions with Dr. Miller are sort of like emotional training; boot camp for the anxious. After presenting him with my log of panic-inducing events, he explains the necessity to counter these initial reactions. I need to train my brain to avoid irrationality, he tells me, and prevent that debilitating doom. Instead of assuming my father’s aircraft is lying mangled in a field somewhere between Chicago and Minneapolis, I need to remember that 99.9998% of flights are incident-free. Instead of worrying that my friend is wrapped around the trunk of a tree, I need to relax and be patient and smoke some pot and see what’s on Netflix. I need to train myself to take the driver’s seat and stay rational, but it’s not easy. Soon, I’ll walk across a stage in a black gown and receive my diploma (at least, I hope I will — one of the triggers on my log was the concern that I had messed something up and wouldn’t graduate after all). College graduation is the last of the rites of passage that have come in rapid succession since adolescence: driver’s license, 18th birthday, high school graduation, 21st birthday, et cetera. I have a hunch that the store is called Forever 21 because a lot of people would like to hit pause after 21 and stay that age forever, or at the very least, take a little bit more time to figure out what happens next. Life is accelerating; life is pinning us to our seats and stacking the pressure on our chests. Like many of my peers, I don’t know what I’ll do after I walk across that stage. One of the biggest disappointments of my early adult life has been the realization that there is never enough time to accomplish everything. As we grow up, we inherit a lesson, one of the elements of the American Dream: if you just work hard enough, you can achieve anything. Or so they say. When I was younger, I always assumed that adults had it all down. They knew everything, and someday, if I worked hard enough, I could know everything too. If I wanted to start my own website, well, I could learn to code and build it. If I wanted to become an architect, I could work hard and apply for graduate school. If I wanted to get in shape, be an athlete, I could wake up every morning and go for a run, and start doing yoga. You get the picture. But then I was hit with a dose of disillusion. Truth is, no one has time for everything. No one can know everything there is to know. It’s not even possible to know most things. That’s why specialization exists, that’s why we pick majors and hire other people to do the things we don’t know how to do. Maybe that’s why writing appeals to me: I don’t get to be an architect or a software developer or an astronaut, I don’t really get to be an expert at anything. But I can write about it. David Foster Wallace’s writing is characterized as cerebral, erudite, truthful, haunting, unyielding. Or at least, that’s how I describe it. He had a thirst for knowledge, from theoretical mathematics to the nervous system of crustaceans, and then went further, to find out what all of this had to do with the meaning of life. He wrote to help his readers understand their existence so that they might come away from his prose having learned something new about the big question. A tall order. Of course, he endured a grueling battle with depression for two decades, and after writing one of the most epic novels of the century, he set out to do more. He wanted to know more, he wanted to understand why he existed and why he was conscious. He wanted to know the answer to the questions that humans have pondered for eternity: ‘what does my life mean?’ Before he could complete his second epic novel, one that was a semi- autobiographical piece that can’t be summarized in one essay, let alone one sentence, David Foster Wallace ended his own life. His wife found him hanging from the ceiling of his porch, his unfinished manuscript stacked nearby. The scale of the questions he was asking proved to be too much. The knowledge he wanted to have was too vast for one person. He gave in to the disillusion of existence; the delusion that somehow knowledge can save us. He fell victim to the mantra that betrays us all; the mantra that says that somehow, some way, it is possible to learn all there is to know. That it’s possible to discover an ultimate truth through learning and experience. Among soon-to-be graduates, there’s a collective sense of dread. Students are under pressure to get a job, and not just a job, but a career. In these few months around graduation, this period of transition, every decision has tangible gravity. Each one weighs upon the conscience like the pounds of water above the diver or the gravity of the Earth holding the astronaut in its grasp. The most fear-inducing bit is the sense of uncertainty. Everyone offers advice: here’s the right path to take, the correct way to do things, they say. This is how to craft the perfect résumé and how to behave in an interview to get that dream job. But, truth is, no one knows what will happen next. Now, every decision has a sense of finality. That there’s a fork in the road and the direction chosen is inalterable. In college, and especially in a liberal arts program, it’s easy to be seduced by the delusion of knowledge. It’s easy to imagine that you can do anything and learn anything and be anything. But then graduation comes along and you’re forced to choose. Ever since I was a child playing with LEGOs and wooden blocks, I’ve wanted to be an architect. I remember the awe I felt when I realized that every single building I had ever seen had been designed by someone. It started with toys and turned into an obsession; I read Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright and Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs and any bit of architectural theory I could get my hands on. And then I didn’t get into the program I wanted, and I gave up on my dream to become an architect. Now I’m a writer and I’m about to have an English degree and the idea of writing as a career is also seductive. Living in Park Slope, rubbing elbows with Jonathan Franzen at cocktail parties and being invited to speak at n+1 events and dropping acid at a cabin deep in the mountains. It seems both bohemian and glamorous. But the reality of writing isn’t glamorous. Nothing is ever as glamorous as the imagination. That’s the biggest travesty in the world. So I’m leaning towards the third best option. I’m looking at copywriting positions at advertising agencies and corporations and I reassure myself that I’ll write essays on the weekends, that the advertising job is just to secure an income and have health benefits and a snazzy business card and that I’m not selling my soul. There’s so much pressure to pick a path and start a career that the decision feels like the last one I’ll ever make. The decisions I make in my twenties will define the rest of my life. An entire lifetime, determined in under a year. If it weren’t for the sertraline, I would be huddled under a blanket, nauseous and shivering, heart pounding and struggling to stay alive. When an astronaut starts to feel faint under the increased gravity, or a diver struggles to process oxygen, the symptoms include increased heart rate and blood pressure, nausea, and narrowed vision. All of this happens just before the victim passes out: this is the body’s response to a lack of oxygen in the brain. The victim, of course, will fall flat on the ground, and the head and the heart will lie level, thus easing the strain on the cardiovascular system. That’s why astronauts seats are prone during liftoff. A panic attack is characterized by similar symptoms: racing heart, nausea, tunnel vision, and even fainting. Panic attacks are brought on by stress, by mental pressure, by existential dread. Once, I had a panic attack at a concert when a kid behind me passed out from heat exhaustion. It was at one of those massive outdoor festivals, and we were crammed in the front fifth of the swaying audience of, oh, thirty thousand people. Within minutes of that kid collapsing, I started to hyperventilate. I tried to focus on something in the middle distance, tried to crane my neck up to breath the cooler, unregurgitated air. My vision began to swim, the laser lights on the stage blurring into a psychedelic mesh, blackness creeping in from the edges and a red gauze draping over the center as the noises seemed more and more distant. The last thing I remember, before slumping over lifeless, was grabbing my friend’s shoulder and muttering something about “get me out of here.” All that, because of some kid a few rows back planted the thought in my mind that I was surely, without a doubt, going to die of a heat stroke. Other panic attacks haven’t been so dramatic. Once I felt homesick and terror struck. The recent ones have all been about my future. About what happens next. This is the first rite of passage I’ll undergo when I don’t know what the future holds. Marina Keegan was a writing student at Yale. She wrote the essay I wish I could write. It’s called “The Opposite of Loneliness” and she wrote it just before she graduated. She had a few more absolutes lined up: a job at the New Yorker and an apartment in Brooklyn waiting for her. She wrote: We’re so young. We’re so young. We’re twenty-two years old. We have so much time. There’s this sentiment I sometimes sense, creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party, or pack up our books when we give in and go out — that it is somehow too late. That others are somehow ahead. More accomplished, more specialized. More on the path to somehow saving the world, somehow creating or inventing or improving. She wrote with beauty and optimism; with the confidence that only a stellar Ivy League student could have. Her prose is simple and infectious. Marina died in a car crash a week after she graduated. Maybe she was wrong about time. It’s damn near impossible to see time with any sort of range, with any sort of scope, after reading Marina’s fate, or knowing how David Foster Wallace ended up. How can anyone think in terms of a lifetime, when brilliant lives are cut short so often, so unfairly? Even avoiding mortal awareness and death anxiety, as any twenty-two-year-old should, it’s hard to understand that a lifetime is a long time. I’ve been around for two decades and haven’t accomplished much, but not many people accomplish anything before they hit 30. That’s why Rimbaud is famous. The New York Times Magazine featured a story on people who are masters of their craft at an old age. Over age 80, to be specific. T. Boone Pickens, still actively running his multi-billion dollar investment firm at 86. Carmen Herrera, a painter who didn’t sell a canvas until she was 89, and is working hard at 99. Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who just finished designing Facebook’s headquarters and is busy at work on a new museum in France. Betty White, the actress known for her vigor, charming audiences at 92. These people did not accomplish everything in life in their twenties. They were entirely different people then. The world was a different place. They weren’t successful investment bankers or architects when they were 22, or even when they were 32. The crippling fear comes from the idea that if I don’t set out on the proper path soon, don’t get on my way to being an obscenely successful writer or whatever as soon as I graduate, I’ll never succeed. But these people are succeeding well past their youth, or even their adulthood. There’s no reason to catastrophize just yet. Truth is, I can go on to be an architect at 40 and publish a novel at 60. I can sail across an ocean or climb mountains. The first draft does not need to be perfect, because the magic lies in revision. The magic comes after decades of experience and reflection, and for now, I need to focus on staying in the driver’s seat. I need to avoid the cloud of anxiety and come to terms with myself and focus on the day to day effort of being alive, because there are so many days in a lifetime. Because I’m young, and there is so much time. We have so much time. If you like what you just read, please hit the ‘Recommend’ button below so that others might stumble upon this essay.

The claustrophobia of OCD,"The first thing I do in the morning is wonder how I will fail today. There are so many ways to fail, but the one that I usually pick, after filing through my mental rolodex, is that I won’t get enough done. “Enough” is a recurring theme in my daily failures. So many other people have done what I consider enough — more than enough — and even though I know I shouldn’t compare my insides to their outsides, I do it and I wait for the feelings of inadequacy to settle in. It doesn’t take long. The one thing I get right every morning is peanut butter toast and coffee. I’m optimistic while I eat the toast and drink the coffee, because the morning is the time of hope and I haven’t failed at anything yet in the day. Something has gone right, so maybe the next thing will go right, and the thing after that. But when you’re worried about enough, it doesn’t matter how many things go right. It only matters that one thing goes wrong, or goes undone, or not done perfectly, or not on time, or that you weren’t specific enough in your last email, and the hopeful house of cards you had built over morning coffee falls over and can’t be resurrected until the next day. All things need sleep for resurrection. So you give up on the day ahead, you read what other people have written and wonder why you’re not them, even though you’re trying. You try to give yourself a break, but that’s a language you’ve never spoken. You criticize your husband, and that’s not kind, but if he only knew how you criticized yourself he might understand. Sometimes going for a walk helps. Nature is nonjudgmental, and although nature is hard to come by in your part of San Francisco, you can walk for a couple miles and be at the top of Bernal Heights Hill, which is browning in the sun and the drought and features bright yellow sun cups, fuchsia shooting star, and purple needlegrass rustling in the breeze. The rock is radiolarian chert, pushed up from out of the Pacific ocean millions of years ago when the Pacific plate was converging with the North American plate, although now it just looks like a folded-over hilltop; nothing but some research would give you a clue to its age. The rock is mud red and crinkled, and I’m usually listening to a podcast when I walk by it, trying to catch my breath on the uphill portion of the climb, trying to remember that I left the house to leave my anxiety behind and wondering how it followed me here, past the sun cups and the needlegrass, past the McDonald’s on Mission Street and Philz Coffee on 24th, up the shoebox houses on Folsom, up the steep hill where I thought I’d get rid of any hangers-on. The terrible anxiety that tells you you’ll fail at whatever you try also tells you that there’s not much you can do, which is why a walk, or a hike, or any kind of exercise is such a helpful and immediate corrective. You’re not producing anything, per se, but you’re doing something good and your dog is getting some exercise and, for stretches of maybe three minutes in a row, you don’t remember to think about what you’re failing at. You don’t bite your nails or half-write email responses, you just listen to the voices in your headphones and look at the sky or the sidewalk and smile at the other people with dogs you pass. You’re glad to be outside, because your house is a little too much like your mind — claustrophobic, impatient, demanding. But you’ve got to go home. You can’t stay outside forever; first of all, you’ll get sunburned and second of all, you’ll get cold and finally, you’ll never get anything done. You want to give into the fear that says you’ll never get anything done, or at least anything worth doing, but you think of passing a flower or a community garden and you know you can write a hundred words, and then two hundred, and then maybe five hundred. You’re glad for what you can do, even though you’re terrified of what you won’t do. You write and you sleep and you wake up tomorrow afraid, check your phone first thing for a magic bullet that came to you in the night, but it never does. You have to make the magic on your own.

Feeding Fear,"How giving yourself permission to take a bigger bite of your own career can be the scariest, most rewarding thing you ever do I was thrilled to be part of a panel called “Taking A Bigger Bite out of Your Career” alongside Dana Cowin, Melissa Clark and Susan Ungaro at the Women Chefs and Restaurateurs Conference on April 19 in New York City. Moderator Leiti Hsu asked each of us to speak for 5–10 minutes on the topic of “Taking A Bigger Bite out of Your Career” and I decided to talk about fear. This isn’t necessarily the way I said everything, but it’s the way I wrote it. If you are in this room, you chose a really challenging, generous, scary thing to do for a living, and I admire the hell out of that. And that’s what I want to talk about, because this is ostensibly a safe space and I truly believe in the power of female solidarity. I wanted to take a minute and address fear, minus the shame that usually comes along with it. It might be because of the focus of this particular conference, or because I’ve been spending so much time in my own head writing a book about anxiety (It’s called Hi, Anxiety and it comes out on March 29, 2016), but I’ve been thinking a lot about fear and where it’s helped or hurt my career. A little bit of background: My undergrad degrees are in painting and sculpture, and my MFA is in metalsmithing. I moved to New York City at 23 because one of my professors said that if you really mean to be an artist, you owe it to yourself to try it for at least six months. (19 years later, I’m still here.) And when I moved here, I was broke and clueless in so many ways, and while it wasn’t so especially pleasant at the time (particularly the broke and hungry part), it was somehow freeing, because I had next to nothing to lose. So I tried a million things: Making terrible performance art about birds and nuns where I was inexplicably half-naked, working in artists’ studios mopping their floors and fabricating their sculptures, working in galleries, wrapping and shipping paintings, being an office manager for a therapist who really liked porn, being an office manager for a verbally abusive graphic designer, working retail during the holidays at that HMV across from Macy’s (people are really, really mean to cashiers at the holidays, like it’s our fault they have to go shopping). I learned many valuable survival skills and (barely) kept a roof over my head. But I wasn’t making my own visual art — which is why I’d moved there — because I was afraid of being rejected. And then something knocked me out of my paralysis. Seven young men surrounded me on the doorstep of the filthy, illegal loft in which I was living (and not making art) and demanded all my money. That was $7 — a buck apiece for their efforts — and I still remember so vividly that one young man hung behind and asked, “Miss, are you going to be OK?” No…and at the same time, oddly, yes. Better than I had been for a while, because I thought, “OK, screw fear.” It’s healthy to be afraid for your physical safety, but swaddling your soul for the same purpose eventually smothers you. So I started looking for jobs making art, and I got them, mostly at online magazines and city guides. And I was pretty good at them — or at least nobody yelled at me and told me I sucked, which is mostly what I feared would happen. And I was still running away from the other thing I wanted to be: A writer. That was for people who’d gotten English degrees and internships and worked on their college literary magazine (we had no such thing). Not me who scribbled in notebooks and wrote funny staff emails when she could. So I sneaked it in around the edges, taking jobs at places where I could be the art director (I allowed myself that because I’d gone to school for it.), and maaayyyyybe sneak in a music or restaurant review, but never actually call myself a writer. I waited for other people to do it, to give me permission. Waiting for an editor to take pity on me and notice that I was going to a show or really liked restaurants, because I was too scared to pitch them. And if they gave me a shot, I was so afraid of letting them down that I worked so, so, so, SO hard, to the exclusion of anything else, even romance or rest. Because if I stopped moving and tap dancing and sparkling and trying harder than anyone else, they’d realize they’d made a mistake. Sorry, kid, we were wrong about you. Back in your corner. And the work paid off. I screwed up my courage and made myself a business card that said “Kat Kinsman — Designer & Writer” and I called myself a “writer” on my taxes. I got a summer gig as the grilling editor at AOL. The food editor left in my first few weeks, and I got her job, and then the senior editor was laid off, so I took over her job, and I worked and worked and worked and worked to make up for the fact that I’d gotten it all by accident. And so they didn’t realize that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I guess I fooled them all. I got a job creating a food site for CNN, and I spent the first few years terrified that people would figure out that I wasn’t a journalist. That I was just writing this cute little food blog while they were doing the work that actually meant something. So I worked and worked and worked until I learned from them how to be a journalist, too. And I was still terrified. But the thing that happens when you’re terrified all the time is that it all just becomes white noise. You’re going to be terrified anyway. You shouldn’t be scared of your own passions, your own possibilities. You might as well fall face-first into the void. I learned that if you do that, and if you talk about it, people — especially other women — will reach out and catch you. Because they’re feeling it, too. I began writing stories about mental illness, depression, anxiety, not being a mother, turning 40, stigma around sexuality, and yeah — a lot of food stuff, too. I realized that even though I hadn’t gone to journalism school, I could tell stories in a whole new way at CNN, and bring a format and a voice and a human quality that maybe hadn’t been there before. I had something to offer them. These stories weren’t always easy to tell, especially the deeply personal ones. I was terrified each and every time that people would think less of me, think I was weak or crazy, figure out that I was a fraud and a fake. And every single time, I was paid back so much more than I’d given by people who came out of the woodwork to tell me, “My God. Thank you. I thought I was the only one.” I’m here to tell you you’re not the only one who’s afraid. Not the only woman. Not the only one in the food world. Not the only one in this room. Let’s talk about it.",2015

The online doctor sessions are HIPAA-compliant, secure, and completely confidential. “Our members spoke, and we listened,” says Ron Gutman, HealthTap Founder and CEO. “There is a huge demand from members to include psychiatry and psychology to our list of Concierge offerings. They want to be able to reach their mental health professionals from wherever they are, including from the comfort and privacy of their homes or even when traveling abroad.” HealthTap psychiatrists and psychologists are able to provide caring treatment for a range of mental health issues, including stress and anxiety, relationship challenges, depression, grief, obsessions and compulsions, trauma, addictions, eating disorders, and many more. “Nothing is more important to good doctors than making their patients’ lives better — making an immediate difference with a value that grows over the years. It is very rewarding to be part of an organization that amplifies my ability to make peoples’ lives better far beyond my local practice,” says Jeffrey Satinover, MD, PhD, an internationally recognized psychiatrist who practices in Wilton and Danbury, CT. “HealthTap medication visits are efficient and effective, and I can stay in touch with and help my patients even when I am out of town.” Consults with a psychologist start at $49 for a 30-minute session and $99 for a 60-minute session, while psychiatry consults range from $69 for a 30-minute session to $129 for a 60-minute session. “This is significantly less than traditional therapy sessions and are just as effective as live counseling,” says Geoffrey Rutledge, MD, PhD, and HealthTap’s Chief Medical Officer. “Every year, about 42 million Americans — that’s one in five — suffer from some form of mental illness, including depression and bipolar disorder, but less than half seek treatment due to embarrassment or difficulty finding a therapist or taking time off work. HealthTap Concierge makes it easy to find and convenient to see the right therapist and reduces the cost to receive regular ongoing care from our top psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. We are delighted to offer this service that will help more people receive the mental healthcare they need,” adds Rutledge. Studies have shown that online treatment is more effective, lasts longer, and is more cost-effective than conventional psychological therapy. The University of Zurich found that eight sessions of psychotherapy via the Internet worked better and had longer-lasting effects than eight conventional visits, while the U.S. Veteran’s Administration used “telemental health” to reduce psychiatric hospital admissions by almost 25 percent and days of hospitalization by more than 25 percent in 84 percent of all age groups.",2015
Healthy Tweaks for The Overwhelmed,"Originally published at stronginsideout.com. It’s a tough situation when you want to get healthy but your calendar has almost no white space. Stress is a serious thing that most of us Strongies deal with from time to time. Whether it manifests as anxiety, depression or scatter-brain, it affects us every day. If we’re practicing unhealthy habits while we’re stressed, we could be increasing the chaos in our lives. Eating addictive, processed foods could wonk-ify your blood sugar, making crashes and binges more common, which is a stressor all its own. Without exercise, your body has no outlet for that stress, which I’ve found to lead to weight gain, excess anger, frustration or lethargy. And if your mindset is veering toward the darkness, all this stress will seem worse than it has to be. If you’re struggling with any of those things, today’s post was written for you! I put together 5 of the simplest healthy tweaks I could think of to help you lead a healthier life without adding to your stress plate. Choose ONE at a time and try it out! When you’re ready, you can add on a little at a time, gradually making your life healthier and *hopefully* your head a little clearer. You don’t have to overhaul your whole diet at once. If you’re not sure where to begin to make your diet healthier, start by making one meal your focus for healthier eating. Doesn’t matter which meal; choose one, then make sure it follows these guidelines: 6. Drink water, black coffee or plain tea with your meal and nothing else. If you’re just focusing on one meal, this list will guide you through the process of making your diet healthier one meal at a time. Just concentrate on this one meal for now, my stressed-out friend! When you’re ready, use these guidelines to start tweaking other meals, too. If you’re super busy, getting a full workout in can be incredibly overwhelming to consider. When you’re stressed, putting together your moves, getting to a gym and getting both strength and cardio in is enough to make you put off a workout until that mystical “tomorrow.” With this tip, you can effectively consider today your tomorrow, Strongie! The ultimate full-body move, Turkish Get-Ups will get your heart rate up, strengthen your muscles and make you feel like a full-on bada** all at once. If you’re aiming to do just one move as a workout today, try 5 of these babies on each side. I can’t scream loudly enough through the interwebs the importance of focusing on your form. This move is tricky, and can be dangerous if not done correctly. Follow this Men’s Health video — the instructor does a great job at taking viewers through it step by step. Just don’t release the kettlebell the same way he does; take the weight in both hands and carefully bring it to your chest at the end, then roll your whole body over to the side to release it (otherwise you risk a rotator cuff injury). You also have the option to use a dumbbell or even a gallon-sized water bottle with a sturdy handle if you don’t have equipment. Stick with a weight that allows you to keep good form while also feeling challenged by your last rep. If you’re nursing a shoulder injury, skip this exercise. If you’re very inflexible or don’t have the body awareness to do this correctly on your own, get a trainer at the gym to watch you go through it once. Just grab one of the free trainers strolling the floor — speaking from experience, he/she would probably be happy to have something to do that doesn’t require handing out towels. :) This one’s pretty straight-forward. Most people aren’t drinking enough water. Trying to think about getting your intake up to 64+ oz when you’re way below it is a lot to wrap your head around! Instead, just drink one more glass of water every day, preferably first thing in the morning so you don’t forget! Try this for one to two weeks, then add one more glass every week or two until you get up to the recommended daily amount. We just covered breathing exercises in this post a couple weeks ago, so if you need some tips on how to do this, give ‘er a read! Deep breathing is great for us when we’re stressed out, whatever form that stress is taking in our bodies and minds (anxiety, depression, even resistance to new healthy habits). To calm yourself down when you experience high stress, sit in a quiet place (ideally alone) and take long, deep breaths through your nose for a minute. Close your eyes or don’t, but focus on your breath as it goes in and out of your nostrils. You should feel a little calmer by the end of the minute! When it comes to being more positive, gratitude is one of the most important habits to practice. By actively and consistently focusing on the good in your situation, your distract yourself from the struggle and also start training your brain to adopt optimism. Let’s take that practice up a notch and actually say what you’re grateful for out loud. Just once every day is all it takes to start feeling the benefits of gratitude expression. It doesn’t have to be stock-photo-arms-reaching-to-the-sky-huge-corny-smile-on-your-face expression. It can be simple like: “Thanks for always having my back,” to a good friend. “Thanks for all your patience since I started here — it really helps me want to work harder,” to your boss. Practice one, simple GOL (Gratitude Out Loud) once a day; I bet you’ll want to do more once you start. Which tweak will you focus on this week? Here’s to your health and a little peace in that mind of yours. Stay strong, Amy Amy Clover is a speaker, writer and mental health activist.

My Father’s Battle With Depression (And Our Battle As Caregivers),"My father was diagnosed with acute depression — chronic or clinical depression in medical terms — in February. It turned out that he had been suffering from the condition for at least a year before that. He never felt it. And there were no visible signs either. But it was lying in the subterranean, slowly yet surely eating into his life. Pre-Diagnosis It was in September (2014) when his physical health started deteriorating rapidly that he visited the doctor. He had lost ample weight without any kind of exercise; he was constantly fatigued and severely insomniac. The doctor, a general physician, checked for diabetes. Reports came out normal. In the next month he lost 5 kilos without any effort. His appetite had gone down significantly and he felt immense lethargy all day long. He began to shy away from tasks and nearly stopped going out of the house. He visited the doctor again. This time he was asked to check his haemoglobin levels, his Vitamin D and B12 levels, and a bunch of other metrics. Reports were normal yet again. A few weeks later he complained of a stomach and lower back ache. He faced digestion issues too. We observed for a couple of days before making a trip to the hospital. The doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist this time. Meanwhile, his sleep problems were persisting. He had become extremely cranky, irritable and anxious which was entirely uncharacteristic of him. The gastro-physician recommended a liver functioning test (LFT) and a USG as he suspected a case of fatty liver (my father is a teetotaler though). Both reports came out spotless. In the second visit, the gastroenterologist asked him to go for a colonoscopy (which didn’t happen eventually) because he couldn’t determine the ailment. He also recommended visiting a neurologist because my dad’s insomnia had spiraled out of control, and that can be really damaging for BP patients, which he has been for the last 24 years. We visited the neurologist next. Dad’s weight had come down further. The neurologist conducted an electromyogram (EMG) which is essentially a nerve-and-muscle study. He suspected a nerve issue that was causing the stress and insomnia. Reports were mostly normal though, barring some “tension” in his calf muscles. He was advised a change in daily habits from diet to activities before bedtime etc. He followed the doctor’s instructions diligently. In the first two weeks, his sleep improved slightly. But other things didn’t: He was still lethargic, still irritable and still anxious, and mostly displeased about everything around. He made a couple of more visits to the neurologist and returned discontent every single time. What bothered him most was the unchecked weight loss. In three months, he had lost 11 kilos. By this time (late-December) I had started Googling his symptoms. The results freaked me out. Unchecked weight loss coupled with fatigue and loss of appetite and stomach ache, and yet, medical tests not being able to detect anything — everything seemed to point at that ailment that shall not be named. I was horrified and helpless. Worse still, Dad mentioned it at the dinner table one night. We wondered: Why did the doctor ask for a colonoscopy? What was he suspecting? What would he say next? I was losing my head (and sleep) over this. A friend suggested taking him for a full-body checkup at a big hospital. But to get my increasingly reluctant father to agree to any more medical tests was a Herculean task. He would say no to everything, sometimes to even medicines. That would lead to unpleasant situations at home. In January, an old friend of his took him to their family doctor who tested him for prostate cancer. Reports came out normal yet again. We were relieved. But were we? Nothing had been detected for months. He had lost close to 13 kilos in four months. And had become frail, unhappy and intolerant. It was only Google that indicated that it could be a case of severe depression. But no one paid heed to that. Instead, I was given sermons on how “Google is not a doctor”. My mother believed that going out of town (read: going to the hometown) would cure all ills of the world. “Nothing has happened to him. He just needs a change of air,” she announced one day. Quite magically, she’d gotten my father to believe that too. And so they went. In early February, I saw them off at the airport with a heavy heart. Something didn’t feel right about the whole thing but I was sincerely hoping things would look up. After all, dad loved being in the midst of familiar faces. But things started worsening from day one itself and went completely out of hand in a week’s time. He called me one afternoon and insisted me to come down ASAP because he was feeling awful. And “scared” about his health. He was not being able to do anything, not even sit up on bed for more than 10 minutes. My mother reported that he was barely eating, not sleeping at all, and was constantly on the verge of a breakdown. I sensed a deep concern in her voice. I rushed home… all through the flight battling alarmist thoughts. It was the longest and coldest flight of my life. In the two weeks that I did not see him, he had grown even frailer and made for an utterly painful sight in his over-sized shirt. “I don’t have proper clothes now. Everything is so loose. I have lost so much weight,” he told me. I wanted to cry then but somehow mustered all courage to say, “We’ll go out shopping.” “I have no energy,” he said. “I can barely sit.” He went on to say that his concentration levels had dropped to zero and he was unable to either watch TV or read the newspaper or talk on the phone. The World Cup was on and yet, he felt no desire to watch matches. And this, for a man who is a die-hard cricket fan and wakes up at dawn to catch telecasts from Australia. In the week that followed, it got from worse to worst. He started getting panic attacks every day — sometimes mild, sometimes severe. We use the term ‘panic attack’ rather loosely in our daily lives. But a real panic attack looks much like a heart attack. It entails involuntary twitching of muscles either in the arms or legs or even full body in extreme cases, fast breathing, and a sense of passing out. It typically lasts 10–12 minutes and slows down on its own. There is absolutely nothing that caregivers can do to help the sufferer, except hold them tight, may be embrace them, and keep saying: ‘Nothing’s wrong. You will get through it.’ My father’s panic attacks were so severe that he would fall over backwards when he tried standing up even with support on either side. Diagnosis Suggestions kept pouring in from all corners. We were advised to visit a neuro-psychotherapist because this had started looking like a nervous disorder. It was in late February, after more than six months of going from pillar to post in the most premium (bullshit) hospitals of Bombay, diagnosis FINALLY happened. My father was suffering from depression and anxiety of the highest order. It had supposedly set in (without any outward expression though) post his retirement two years ago, and was apparently common among individuals who make a transition from “high-profile, high-engagement jobs that require a lot of multitasking” to a more homebound life. (Important to note: In his last two assignments spanning over six years, he had served as the CEO of a housing finance company and a financial services company. In the three decades before that, he had served in several leadership positions at the country’s largest insurance company. So yes, he did hold a high-profile, high-engagement, high-responsibility job for many years. But post-retirement, he chose to lead a “relaxed life” that spared him of the 9-to-7 drudgery and required him to attend only board meetings. This meant that his mental activity had declined significantly, his associations had come down, and he had more hours in his day than he could spend. A perfect recipe for disaster, especially for someone who’s not outgoing, has a very inactive social life and doesn’t have too many hobbies.) His depression lay in the subconscious, never quite affecting him enough for either him or people around him to gauge that something was amiss. When the doctor asked him if he felt hopeless, he said, “only now, in the last few months but never before.” There was family history too. His sister went through a mild bout of depression the year ago. And depression being a genetic condition, it was no surprise that my dad had got it too. Post-Diagnosis His treatment began in March at the Institute of Psychological Health (IPH) in Thane. We were compelled to visit a psychiatrist because his condition was so severe that he *had* to be put on anti-depressants immediately, and made fit for counseling and therapy. Depression at the end of the day is a chemical imbalance — a drop in serotonin levels in the brain — that really wreaks havoc in the central nervous system. It is as much a physiological condition — as all his symptoms demonstrated — as psychological. To treat it as a “your mind is playing games with you” is preposterous. But that’s what we do right? We use the word ‘depression’ so callously. Enough is now being spoken and written about how depression is different from sadness and how one should seek professional help if they can’t deal with it. But even then, we as people continue to be callous about it. It was one hell of a task to convince my father that depression could hit anyone at any point in life. It had hit him after retirement but it could hit people in the peak of their careers too. Case in point: Deepika Padukone who around that time was making headlines for coming out with her depression. Officials at IPH suggested that we make my father watch Deepika’s bare-it-all interview with Barkha Dutt. That would allow him to understand that he’s not alone in this hellhole. One in every 4 people in India is depressed. We rank very high in the list of most depressed countries in the world. It would also help him shed the stigma of having to visit a “mental health” institute every fortnight. The “mental health” bit plagued him to no end. That it could bother someone who’s city-bred, well-educated, well-travelled, well-aware, worldly wise and much in sync with today’s times surprised me. Plus, he had a supportive family to boot for… a family that understood his condition and was more than willing (and capable) to do the handholding required in such illnesses. But what made it worse were people’s ‘oh-how-can-it-happen-to-him-of-all-people’ reactions. Screw you and your ignorance! It can happen to ALL people. Such insensitive reactions from perfectly rational folks were disappointing for us, and debilitating for him. He not only hated to admit his condition but was constantly bothered by what others were saying about him. He would tell us every now and then, “What will I tell people when they ask me about my health? That I am under psychiatric treatment?!” ‘Psychiatrist’ is another very loosely used and entirely misunderstood term. A psychiatrist is not someone who gives electric shocks to screaming patients in dark rooms — an image constructed in our minds by years and years of Bollywood tripe. He’s not someone who tells the patient, “Aapko ab dawa ki nahi, dua ki zaroorat hai.” He’s not someone who has a chamber full of “mad people”. He’s not someone who pushes long injections in your body to stop your “madness”. Instead, he’s some kind of a behavioural scientist if I may call it that. But do we care to understand the nuances of mental health? Or even attempt to? No, we’re a doomed lot and we only care about dub-fucking-smash and snap-fucking-chat! The first day we visited the psychiatrist he asked my dad to pen his thoughts on a piece of paper. My dad promptly said, “I can’t. My head is all jumbled up. I can’t think clearly.” The doctor replied, “That you could explain your condition to me so clearly shows you can… write. It means you’re alert, and thinking.” Eventually he wrote a long note spanning two full sheets of paper. His handwriting hadn’t suffered; his language was impeccable; his thoughts were clear though he was repeating himself. When I read the note, I turned cold. It mentioned the words “half-dead”, and “death” in as many as five places. The summary of the note was this: He feels half-dead, is unable to lead a normal life, and wonders if death is the only cure for his condition. He constantly worries about his wife and daughter whose lives have been totally disrupted by him. The note reeked of self-pity and guilt for his family. I asked the doctor if we had reasons to be worried… so many mentions of death in one note! He assured me that it was common for patients suffering from clinical depression to think that way and it did not imply that my father was suicidal. But his note had affected my mother deeply. That night she broke down for the first time in all these months. And she’s not a woman to shed tears easily. She cried but she had to make sure that my father wasn’t watching or hearing. The doctor told us in no uncertain terms that we as caregivers have to put on the bravest face and wear a nothing-is-wrong-with-you conviction. Even the slightest display of concern or grief would mean the patient feeding off it and going further down in depression. It was tough, incredibly tough, especially when you spent all your waking (and sleeping) time with someone who was talking only about his fears, anxieties and feelings of worthlessness. It meant putting up a straight face in front of him and then locking yourself in the bathroom, turning on the taps, shower, and exhaust fan before weeping your guts out. All relatives and friends would tell me, “You have to be strong. You have to take care of both mom and dad. You can’t break down.” Yes. The superhuman that I am, I can’t break down. In the initial two weeks of medication, there wasn’t any significant improvement. Instead, the side effects — dry mouth, sudden appetite, fast breath, dizziness, low blood pressure — started showing up. That freaked him out even more. Perhaps he expected instant recovery. Not unnatural for any patient to do so. He would keep count of the number of times his breathing had gone fast. After every half an hour he would tell Mom or me that his was an “extreme case” and that it was “incurable”. He was ridden with guilt for putting us through this. He would go on and on about how I had taken a break from work to be at home to attend to him. While that was the most natural thing for me to do, it made him feel like baggage. But he couldn’t let us go. He would hate to be alone in a room. One afternoon he broke down. I cannot even begin to describe what it felt to see my father cry and see him as that wary, uncontrollable mess — my father who ran big organizations not so long ago, whose sharp wit and sense of humour lit up family gatherings, and who had lived on his own for the better part of his life in the most dreadful places in India. (Example: Bhagalpur in the mid-90s) Our job though was only to hear him out. And constantly be by his side, may be hold his hand (a very important gesture for patients suffering from anxiety) and tell him that depression is like any other physical ailment and that he would be fine in no time. Whenever he asked ‘what will I tell people’ I would ask him, “If you had typhoid or jaundice, would you think so much?” He would seem partly convinced. But next day he would repeat the same things. There was so much despair and darkness within him that it was impossible for any light to seep in. It was important though on our part to not overdo any instructions because his mind was ill-equipped to process sermons. He wasn’t fit for counseling yet. And not being able to do what others were telling him to would only lead to frustration. We had to measure every word we spoke to him. We stopped taking calls because if he heard us talking on the phone for longer than 5 minutes, he would start getting restless and anxious. He had become painfully conscious of what people were saying about him. He had switched off his own mobile too lest he had to answer the ‘what-happened-to-you’ brigade. After about six weeks of heavy medication, he showed some signs of recovery. “Very slow progress though,” said the doctor. The positives: he started going out for evening walks with me (he still lacked the confidence to venture out on his own), his appetite improved, he was reading the newspaper again, he began watching the IPL, and checking his mails and messages. The negatives: he was still anxious, concentration-less, and unable to do official work. He wasn’t talking much either. Not that he was a chatterbox at any time, but he spoke very little now. And smiled even lesser. He would often sit quietly in a corner with his head hung down. Was he thinking something? “No,” he would say. Then why was he sitting in that manner? “I don’t know,” would be the answer. If you asked him how he was, the answer would invariably be “not good”. But he was surely better than he was a month-and-a-half ago. The doctor by now deemed him fit for counseling. He said, “That’s what will really help him come out of this… lots and lots of counseling.” So, therapy and medication were to go on simultaneously. His counseling began in mid-April. After the first session in which some psychometric tests were conducted, the psychologist told us that there was still “sufficient depression” in him, and his was a “classic case” of depression and anxiety. What aggravated it was his introverted nature and his age that heralds some amount of worthlessness in most people, especially men. “Because women have housework and TV to get through,” he said. Gender stereotyping I thought, but kept mum lest I get into an argument with him making my father all the more anxious. He’s had three sessions thus far, and though he claims that the counselor is confusing, I can see Dad improving, albeit slowly. He’s certainly more active than he was two-and-a-half months ago, he’s doing yoga every day, he’s going grocery shopping on his own (after weeks of being accompanied by Mom or me), he’s buying fish (that’s a huge metric) from the market, he’s staying up to watch IPL, he’s expressing anger over Salman going scot-free and disappointment over Nepal’s earthquake, he’s gone and watched (and got bored of) Piku with us, he’s playing Sudoku — a mental activity advised by the therapist, he’s reading files and attending his board meetings, and most importantly, eating more and sleeping better. And now if you ask him how he is, he’ll say, “A bit better. But still not fine.” There’s still a long way to go, say doctors. He’s still frail (he had lost 15.5 kilos in 6 months) though the weight loss has been checked. He still gets fatigued within a few hours. He’s still anxious and impatient about little things like a pending mobile / credit card bill, and he’s still fairly heavily medicated. Right now all the positive hormones are being secreted with the help of anti-depressants. The biggest challenge lies ahead when he is put off them, and his body has to secrete those happy hormones on its own. That’s when a patient has withdrawal symptoms and always stands a chance of falling back into that depressive hellhole. We are told that clinical depression takes at least six months to a year to be fully weeded out of the system. It’s been only three months of medication and therapy for him. There’s indeed a long way to go. But what this experience has taught us is that depression is something most doctors in India don’t recognize and most people in our society don’t acknowledge until it reaches life-crippling proportions. That ought to change soon. And what gets sufferers and caregivers through the tough times is a strong support system of friends, family, doctors, counselors, and loads and loads of patience. Sometimes you just have to keep staring at the night sky before it’s finally dawn…",2015
"A Wedding, Two White Dresses, and Secret Spending","It started, like so many weddings do, with a white dress. Not the wedding dress, which would come later, but a little cotton sundress I found on a rainy San Francisco day. I was waiting for my fiancé to arrive from his nonprofit job so we could walk together to Williams Sonoma and start to register for kitchen utensils. I ducked into a high-end store to get out of the rain. “Just browsing,” I told the sales guy when he asked what I was looking for. It was one of those places with five sweaters per rack; the kind of place you know is insanely expensive just by looking at it. I was an editorial assistant for a major publishing house, which is another way of saying I made very little money. It was the perfect place to window shop while Zack was en route, except that I found the white dress, and I tried it on, and I bought it. I paid for the dress with a debit card — Bank of America — with my name on it. It was a Wednesday afternoon. The debit card was not attached to my personal bank account, the one that received a deposit of about $1,100 every two weeks. This one was connected to my wedding account. Our wedding account, of course, but since I was the one doing the bulk of the planning and since it was set up by my parents, I was the one with the debit card. The wedding account had $35,000, more money than I had ever had access to in my short professional life. I was 23 when we got engaged. Anxiety is a funny thing. It creeps up on you when anything in your life changes, even when that change is a good thing, even when you are marrying a man you love dearly and have been dating for five years. Going through severe anxiety is like this: You are a train conductor and someone has hijacked your train, but you are pretty sure you cannot do anything about it. Someone who does not have your best interest in mind has taken the wheel, and they are taking you too fast in the wrong direction, and you are too estranged from yourself to do anything about it. Some people take drugs to ease their frantic minds. Some people meditate or pray to get a calm spirit. Some ignore it until they burst open at the seams. I went shopping. The white dress cost $300. It wasn’t the first time I had purchased something to make myself feel better — I blew through my college graduation money in a couple weeks of shopping at upscale boutiques in Montecito; the kinds of places frequented by Oprah and Rob Lowe’s wife and my college best friend, whose mother regularly deposited money in her bank account. I bought tank tops, one pair of jeans, and a couple of blouses before I realized what was underneath my compulsive need to shop: I was terrified. Fresh out of college with no job on the horizon, broken up from my college boyfriend, sure that every other person I knew was in on some secret that I didn’t know. Slowly, I saw how my anxiety had been assuaged momentarily when I handed over my credit card; how I felt like I was doing something good for myself when I “invested in” $200 jeans. I started going to counseling. I read about shopping addictions, and was embarrassed, because it’s about the least cool addiction you can have, and then got even more embarrassed, because who ranks addictions according to which is coolest? I packed up my belongings, got rid of some clothes, got back together with the boyfriend, and drove north. I never learned the secret. When we got engaged, my parents gave us a sizable amount of money. The idea was that we could use it however we wanted — get married at the courthouse and save the rest; have a blowout wedding and nothing left over. I had unchecked access to the account — in hindsight, I should have scheduled regular check-ins with my fiancé — and no debts to pay for months. Florists, caterers, coordinators — they didn’t expect payment until the weekend of the wedding. I could spend without immediate consequences. You might wonder why on earth I did this. I wondered, too. If you do drugs or drink, your reward is an altered state of being. If you overeat, you’re full and have satiated an appetite. If you shop, you get, what? A sundress? That’s true, but the truth is that for me, there was, and still can be, a high when I hand my debit card over to the person behind the counter that, I would bet, rivals that of an alcoholic having a drink. Dopamine spikes, pleasure centers are activated, and for those few shining moments, I feel a sense of control. My anxiety — a condition I’ve dealt with for years and will until I die, I think — temporarily subsides, and my mindset improves. I’m sure that this dress, wrapped in its promise of newness, will be the thing to make me whole. If that sounds dramatic and insane, that’s because it is. It gets worse. I was at lunch not long ago with my dad, and he asked me when I had been most anxious in my life. We were at a restaurant on a mountain overlooking Asheville, North Carolina, and I looked down at the city and my stomach knotted, four years after the fact. “When I called you a few days before our wedding,” I told him. It was five days to the wedding and we were $9,000 short. Some of that was money we had agreed to spend together — tickets to Chicago for a shower; a security deposit on the house we were renting. But Zack hadn’t asked any questions about the budget and I hadn’t offered, and the checks were due in days, and I have never felt more panicked or more alone. I did what is probably the single worst thing I have ever done, borne out of anxiety and shame: I called my dad and told him I had been robbed. I lied, and covered that lie in other lies about a man who had taken an envelope of cash, and he left a meeting and came to find me in my car in a nearby parking lot, and it didn’t take long before the façade cracked. It was not me who broke it open. Zack and I paid my parents back over the course of three years; $300 at a time. During the first years of our marriage, Zack kept tight reins over our shared bank account, while I was alternately eaten up by shame and determined to do better. I went to counseling again, for a longer period of time; I decided to buy only five pieces of clothing one year and was mostly successful. I lived in dread of my own weakness. Anxiety and money are strange bedfellows. I am now, among other things, a freelance writer, a profession which isn’t exactly known for its staggering paychecks. My husband works in tech sales, a profession which is. We share our money, and I am doing so much better with my anxiety and with my spending, although when our anniversary approaches every year I feel a sting. I deserve to. Last year I went through my closet to get rid of old and superfluous clothing. I threw a pile on our bed: T-shirts, skirts, old blouses from my cubicle days. I put the white dress in the pile, thinking of how symbolic it was; how much sin it carried in its threads. I still liked it, but it seemed like I should get rid of it; cast it out like a scapegoat into the wilderness of the Salvation Army. But, at the last minute, I couldn’t do it. It felt like something too significant to get rid of: a symbol, a reminder, a harbinger. So I kept it, and when the weather is warm, which is rare in San Francisco, I put it on and remember, and then I go about my day, and I forget.

Confessions Of A Paranoid Trip Planner,"“That’s nice,” I say. “Come on, it’ll be fun.” “We have to fly halfway round the world to have some fun?” “It’s not halfway round the world and this has been a brutal winter. You know me — I need something to look forward to.” “Taxes are due soon.” “Turks and Caicos is 80 degrees and sunny 350 days a year.” “Sounds like melanoma.” “Tell me you don’t have cabin fever.” “I’d rather have cabin fever at sea level than at 35,000 feet.” “Come on, one flight, three hours. We’ll leave in the morning and we’ll be there for a lobster lunch.” “This winter? You kidding? I bet we spend at least one night in the airport and a day on the tarmac.” “If I make the plans, you’ll make the trip, right?” “That’s our agreement, dear, for better or worse.” “Good. I’ll get busy.” “One thing: what the hell is Turks and Caicos?” Every year, come hell or high snowbanks, I turn over two weeks of my life to my wife, and she invariably picks a distant place with art, animals, and an ocean. She likes to get away from people, far, far away. She’s a therapist. I understand. I have but two minor stipulations: 1) we take one, direct, non-stop, non-turbulent flight that departs JFK on a clear day, right on time, and has a feathery smooth landing; and 2) she never uses the word vacation. Me, I have never done anything in my life that warranted or deserved a vacation. A modest celebration perhaps, a few rum and Cokes, and then back to work. Work is my vacation from no work, no work being the hardest work of all, a lesson learned when working, and not working, at the U.S. post office. Travel is a different matter, challenging and fulfilling. Vacations? The only time I’ve ever heard myself say, “Boy, I need a vacation” was upon returning from a vacation. Wanderlust runs through my wife’s veins. From both sides. Her father was raised in Samoa and sailed around the world in tramp steamers. Her mother’s father sat next to Amelia Earhart on the maiden commercial transcontinental flight. The pilot was a friend, Charles Lindbergh. I’ve seen photographs of my wife’s brood on canals in Venice, on camels in Egypt, on beaches along the Indian Ocean. Currently hanging in our closet is a poncho made of llama wool that saved her life when she was very sick in the Andean Plateau above Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia. She was 24. My family, we thought driving to Chinatown on a Sunday afternoon was an exotic trek. If someone ordered Peking Duck, that was a walk on the moon. We didn’t ride horses and we didn’t climb mountains. We didn’t ski the Alps and we didn’t sail Newport. We waded into the warm waters of Atlantic City to clean off the sand before returning to the boarding house. And then we had to take showers any way, outside, before they let us back in. That’s the trouble with beaches, too sandy and too hot and too many jellyfish. I get rashes. So the notion of a vacation — lounging on a beach and then beaching yourself in a lounge — stimulates pique and vexation. “Where’s your passport?” asks my wife one cold night, over some hot kosher organic Amish free range chicken soup with a dash of omebashi. “Wherever you put it,” I say. “I have to let Rosie and Michael know if we’re going.” “I could make a more informed and perhaps binding decision if I had all the facts.” “Facts?” “How much it’ll cost, what are the dates, who’s going to watch Isabella, little things like that. I have a life too, you know.” “You mean you want me to do all the legwork and make all the arrangements and then you’ll decide if I’ve wasted all that time or not?” “It does sound highly inequitable when you put it like that.” “It is inequitable. Highly.” “I bring so many other things to this marriage.” “I’m listening.” “I cooked this dinner.” “And I’ll clean it up.” “I think there are more demands on a chef than a dishwasher.” “Yes, well, I had to listen to pain and suffering all day long.” “Sorry, I didn’t think I complained that much.” “I wasn’t talking about you. My patients.” My wife loves research and planning. She devours guidebooks, travelogues, memoirs and apposite novels; she studies the art history and anthropology of the target town; she learns the basics of another language just to spend two weeks in that other country; she enjoys swapping notes with friends and fellow travelers, comparing this hotel with that B&B, this restaurant to that Cuban parador, pitting Fodor’s against Frommers, Lonely Planet versus Trip Advisor. Inoculations? Covered. Travel insurance? Done. I think she gets as much pleasure from the homework as the journey, and the former tends to fill all those spaces in the day and the brain that men — here comes trouble — fill with box scores and fantasy sports and other fantasies that might involve the removal of certain uniforms. For my wife, mapping out a trip is foreplay. Me, I’m not a good planner. I have to make lists. And then I make lists of things to add to previous lists. I’m a multi-lister. And compulsive cross-checker. It takes a half day to complete an inventory of stuff I need to pack, and another half day to pick the right gear in which to stuff all that stuff. Then there’s the shopping list: cat food (no poultry), prescription refills (Xanax), reading material (Tenth of December), AAA batteries for devices (personal), mosquito repellant (sans DDT), new bathing suit (one size larger), Sensodyne toothpaste (travel size), AC converter (step down), and tennis balls. (You’d be surprised how many tennis courts stock strictly pre-owned balls.) The next list is sundry and random: alert the neighbors; cancel NY Times delivery; find a patient kitty-sitter; charge the chargers; hide key behind middle Buddha. There are notes to be written for folks staying in the house and/or stopping by for check-ups: where leaks may spring; how the remote works; where the rock salt is stored; how much detergent to use; what wines to open; when to feed Queen Isabella. Personal in nature, these are usually hand-written:Open the dining room door first thing in the AM. Izzy may or may not go out, depending on the depth of the snow and her melancholia. Do not lock her out of the house, she is very old. Open a fresh can of cat food even if her vittles look edible — she will not eat left overs. Refresh her water bowl. If she makes a lot of noise, as if in excruciating pain, pay no mind; the vet says she is at the advanced stage in life where cats like to verbalize. His word, verbalize. Hope you don’t have to meet him. His name and number are on the Emergency List that is hanging on the refrigerator. Thanks for everything. Along with the vet, the list of emergency number include doctor, dentist, brother, son, other son, electrician, plumber, neighbor, roofer, auto mechanic, locksmith, fire, police, pharmacy, garbage collector, sushi delivery, and suicide hotline. “I just made the reservations,” says my wife one frostbitten evening while wrapping Christmas presents. “On Turks or Caicos?” “On Providenciales.” “Wait. You changed the trip? What happened to Turks and Caicos?” “There is no place called Turks.” “Caicos?” “There is no place called Caicos.” “No, really,” I say, “Where are we going?” “Turks and Caicos are two groups of islands in the Larger Antilles. Providenciales is one of the Caicos.” “Is it Spanish or Italian?” “Turks and Caicos is British.” “Are British.” “Really? A grammar lesson? Now?” “I thought the Queen set her people free years ago.” “The Queen considered it, but decided Turks and Caicos was too corrupt.” “Corrupt?” “It’s an off-shore financial haven.” “Like the Cayman Islands?” “Yes, but that’s all besides the point. Turks and Caicos has the third largest coral reef in the world and we have reservations in an adorable little French place with a dive shop right next door and a casino down the road that doesn’t require a sport jacket, and we’re going after Valentine’s Day when the prices are relaxed.” “Okay, okay. I’m glad something will be relaxed.” Me, I hate flying. Makes no sense. Reading George Saunders, so humane and earthbound, at 36,000 feet surrounded by a couple hundred strangers sitting on 7,000 gallons of flammable fossil fuel as I stare at a cup of hot black coffee perched on a plastic tray just above my crotch, well, none of that computes. Hell, computers are easier to comprehend than a 700,000-pound behemoth flying at 500 mph. Did I say flying? Flying! That’s when my mind starts chanting om and my body screams ohmygod and I lodge a 5 mg Xanax between my lower gum and cheek and pray the molecules seep into my blood stream while I still have blood streaming. When aloft, my seat belt is never unbuckled, my Sunday school prayers are on a humming loop, and every bump, dip, turn, sunburst, sudden sound or flight attendant’s facial expression less serene than that of a Bhutanese monk scares the daylights out of me, and I end up at the end of the bar at the Mile High Anxiety Club. Make it a double, please. This all started back in 1992, when an ordinary flight from New York to Miami was interrupted by a brief announcement: “We are going to make an emergency landing in Wilmington, North Carolina. Buckle up, please. Flight attendants, take your seats.” And we commenced our descent. Abruptly. At 90 degrees. Through father skies. Toward mother earth. We must have been directly above Wilmington, North Carolina because we went straight down. Straight. Down. The faces of the people around me were resculpted by G-force 4, their eyes popping like eggs cracking for hatchlings, their mouths locked in chasmal smiles, and their cheeks flapping like hummingbird wings in slow motion on a PBS special. No one said a word. You could hear incantations. The sensation was frightening, as close as anyone ever wants to get to actually… you know. The “emergency landing” saved the guy with the heart attack but it damaged my hard drive: cache has an elephant’s memory. My Post-Travel Stress Disorder has since given birth to a secondary PTSD, Pre-Travel Stress Disorder. Days before a flight, I lie in bed and feel the jumbo jet lifting-off. I sit in a chair and feel the plane going down. Anxiety swarms. Doom looms. Every activity is cloaked with imprecation. Especially when someone will say, offhandedly, “Have a safe trip, dude.” What? A safe trip? You mean there is inherent danger ahead? Terrorists hijack planes. Russians shoot them down. Malaysians lose them. Germans crash them into mountains. Americans skid them off LaGuardia runway Number 13. Runway #13? You kidding me? Why not just book Flight 666 on Judas Airline departing at the stroke of midnight on April Fool’s? “We have a problem,” says my wife one morning when the official snowfall has reached 36 inches. “Global warming?” “I just talked to Rosie. If we stay at the hotel I booked…” “Adorable Frenchie place with tennis courts…” “…then we’ll never see Rosie and Michael.” “Why not?” “They’re staying on Parrot Cay.” “What’s Parrot Cay?” “Another island.” “So?” “A private island.” “Oh, they’re in a James Bond movie.” “Take a look at this brochure.” “Holy shit. Ian Fleming couldn’t afford this place.” “Michael’s a banker. For all we know, this is one big tax write-off.” “Can he write us off?” “Listen to this: ‘Parrot Cay is exclusive because it has no cars, no street lights, no stores, no casinos, no fast food, nothing to attract tourists.’” “Great. Except we are tourists.” “There’s one resort on Parrot Cay, and everyone stays there.” “So it’s like a Disney theme park.” “It has some private homes, too. Oprah lives there and Bruce Willis and Keith Richards.” “’Parrot Cay — no street lights but all the smack you can get your hands on.’” “Donna Karan lives there as well. She designed the resort.” “DKNY and Disney. Just like that unreleased Dylan album, Bland on Bland.” “That’s not fair. It’s supposed to be beautiful.” “Then why can’t we stay on Providenciales and take a boat over?” “Boats are not allowed to dock at Parrot Cay.” “Who stops them, Jack Sparrow?” “It’s the law.” “I thought Turks and Caicos was lawless.” “I said corrupt. Corruption is different.” “So, Michael can embezzle millions, but he can’t row the boat ashore?” “Should I cancel the trip?” The landing is as smooth as fine aged rum. It is 80 degrees and sunny. As advertised. You can hear Bob Marley promise “Everything’s Gonna Be Alright” from atop the portable airstairs. In the shack that doubles as an airport terminal, there are three receiving lines: Belongers, Residents, Tourists. Belongers is the official designation for natives, which means descendants of survivors of a slave ship that veered off course and landed here in 1767. Belongers vote, hold office, and own property without a special permit. Belongers don’t like being called Belongers. “We belong to no one,” they will tell you straight away. “We may live under the American dollar and the British crown — the worst of both worlds — but we belong to no one.” Shuttling down the main drag, you are happy to see plenty of lobster joints and no Starbucks, no McDonalds, no Chipotles. You are less happy to see guards and gates and security cameras. The income inequality gap is so dilated that you can be sure the Belongers listen to “Get Up, Stand Up” when out of earshot of tourists. Me, I’m a rank tourist. And the first waves of a Caribbean identity crisis are washing over me. Am I supporting these folks or exploiting them? Am I rubbing salt or salve in their economic wounds? Do they welcome me or hate me or not see me at all? What am I doing here? How can I blithely scuba dive when the coral reef is suffering and the fish are disappearing and the whole damn world is sucking air? Will I feel uninterrupted guilt for two weeks solid, or just between rum and Cokes? Are we having fun yet? My wife, she is thrilled. Aroused. Not many hours ago, she was slushing through the worst winter on record and now she is skimming along the bluest waters in the Caribbean. Me, I like the ocean okay, all azure and transparent, but my wife, she’s part fish. And I’m pretty sure that part is her buttocks, which can remain high and dry even as she freestyles for a solid hour before deciding to dive 20 or 30 or 50 feet like a frisky porpoise, her absence causing me to lose my breath before she loses hers. Presently, I am inhaling deeply and marveling at the magic of modern transport. In addition to the single, direct, non-stop, non-turbulent flight, we had a nice walk to the car, a drive to the airport, a bus ride from long term parking to the escalators, a train ride to the moving walkways at Terminal 5, where we boarded the airbus that landed in time to catch the mini-van that took us to the boat that will deliver us to a Kawasaki Mule that will pass the houses of Bruce Willis and Oprah Winfrey and right when we enter the resort, the Belonger at the front desk will say, “Welcome to Turks and Caicos. We hope you have a wonderful vacation.” Collage illustrations by Eugenia Loli The Autograph Collection is part of the Marriott International portfolio.",2015
I’m Graduating High School and I Want to Be a Journalist but Everyone Says I’m Nuts!,"The Concessionist gives advice like… once a month maybe? Whatever. I’m busy. Trouble? Write today. Hello, For a long while now, I’ve thought I wanted to major in journalism. It’s been something I could see as a passion, or a career. But lately, when I’ve been in bed late at night, I worry. I graduate high school in a week, and although I’ve already had an internship at a newspaper, mostly all of the editors and reporters took me aside to voice what they saw as a way to save me from boarding a sinking ship. “Don’t major in this,” they told me. “Please go to law school.” Now, I know that a newspaper is probably the easiest place to find a jaded journalist, and a depressed and underpaid one at that, but if these people are telling me the truth then what do I have to look forward to? I’m a naive high school kid, and I know nothing about the world yet. This is an undeniable fact. I can feel the strange, strange way that this pulls me in while all the while I know it’s not a smart career choice. The job market is down, and the whole industry is over saturated. On one side, I see myself taking a risk and succeeding — perhaps not wildly, but at least comfortably. On the other side of my mind, however, I see a dissatisfied store clerk, fuming at my 2015 self for not taking accounting by the hand and running with it. This is my dilemma. I do not want to be sixty years old and looking back, thinking of what might have been had I been brave enough to take a chance. I also, however, do not want to be an embittered old woman, her accolades nothing more than her college publications. The industry is changing, and I’m afraid. Sincerely, [redacted] Hello young person, Here are just a few things I think you need to know. 1. You do not need to know what your college major is going to be now. Or maybe ever. You truly don’t! You’re going to college! You should be excited about going to college and be busy planning an experience for yourself. Do you want to be doing outdoors things? Do you want to be deep in a library? Do you want to be taking big lectures, or studying with smaller groups? Do you want to be painting and taking lots of drugs and arguing? What does your dream college look like to you? Let’s worry about that now. And also focus on GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL and starting a whole new life! You’re up all night fretting when you should be celebrating. 2. If you hate your college, you can leave it for another one. Colleges are all very different and they are not one size fits all! But even if you hate your college, you can also start your life over at the same college. Most colleges are big enough that they contain multiple existences. If it’s dreadful, or you make a bunch of mistakes in your first year, switch it up: apply for overseas programs, switch majors, change your focus, change where you live, change your diet, change your name even. My point is: you can mix up your path at any time. That’s also true in the real world. And if you really hate it, or find something better to do, drop out! You can live without college, though it’s rough, lemme tell ya. 3. You don’t have to be a journalist first, or for forever. Many people go through their entire lives without a passion to do something in particular for a living. Isn’t that funny to think about? But it’s true — they may like certain things or be good at a set of skills for instance, but they don’t have a drive to like “be a litigator” or “write romance novels” or whatever. But you do have a passion. If you want to work on the college paper, great! If you want to intern in the summers or look for fellowships in journalism, awesome. You should! But also you’ll learn a lot about your interests in the next four years — and they might surprise you. I don’t in general have a lot of regrets, because regrets are for losers, but I do wish that I’d accumulated a more sophisticated sense of privilege early on. I would have learned so much more about the world! Some young people are taught that the world is there for the taking. It is our job to teach that to every young person, not just the ones who went to private schools and private colleges. Entry level jobs in sales, business, real estate and even some levels of finance have little barrier to entry, it turns out, even though this is where the 1% hide all their children. The fields are only packed with muttonheads and pearl-clutchers from Trinity-Pawling and Loomis Chaffee because they are told how to get there. The rest of us just need to be informed. The point being, you can take a thousand paths to performing journalism, and being literate in the ways of the world is actually a much better path than being literate in journalism. Journalism is easy to learn. The world is much harder. For instance, have you ever read journalists writing about the media business itself? For the most part, they have literally no idea what they’re talking about. They don’t know how marketing or circulation or advertising sales work; they aren’t familiar with the technology of their own publications; they certainly don’t understand the financing and ownership of their own publications. When their publications or publications they admire fold or are sold or are “sold,” they tend to print the story they are told rather than the story that is obviously true. This happens even at the highest levels; you can see media reporters at the New York Times relaying concepts or ideas or narratives that they don’t actually understand or possibly, if they took a breath, even believe. Should this happen to you? Say no! And start now! Major in art. Major in finance. Major in chemistry! Major in engineering science! Major in accounting! Major in Russian! Major in statistics! Major in African-American studies! Literally any of those will serve you better in the world — and in journalism — than the undergraduate study of journalism. By the time you graduate college in four years, we will already be on the other side of the current insanity in the industry and into a new flurry of insanity. The Great Consolidation will mostly have occurred. Henry Blodget will have triumphantly returned to Wall Street to ring the opening bell; Vox Holding Industries LLC will have long IPO’d; BuzzFeed Sony Paramount will still be hiring journalists out on the east coast to cover their own films. Disney’s FusionLand will be hiring catering specialists. Maybe Barry Diller’s New York Post and Times and News will be beefing up. Will this web page even exist in four years to be mocked? Probably not. Perhaps it’ll be archived on Awl.Vice.Kinja.com somewhere, or it’ll be deep in the old archives of FaceMedium. It doesn’t matter. All things turn to dust. But not you, not yet! Whatever weird landscape you have to face then will be just as surreal as this one. You actually can’t worry about it now; it’s literally unimaginable. Ha ha, you’ll have so much to worry about in four years! But for now, follow your dreams, try not to tweet too much, and go learn something that no one else knows. The Concessionist is an adult human in New York City who is somewhat worn down and willing to make a good number of sacrifices for a peaceful life. Is it decision fatigue? Or just ennui? That’s probably a question for a psychiatrist. Anything else, ask me. I agree to keep your identity between us unless like an emergency exists.

Just a Lucky So & So,"Throughout my life, I’ve suffered from anxiety. Most of the time, it just lingers in the background. Sometimes, I get little pangs, & then it fades into the shadows. Occasionally, it spirals out of control, sending me down a rabbit hole. It can be completely crippling. Wednesday was one of those days. Nothing could get me out of the funk. After a long & draining day, I could think of only one thing left to do: call mom. We talked & talked. Eventually I told her I was feeling better, even though I wasn’t (all that much). But I forced out the words, “You know what? I’m lucky. I have to remember that. Everything’s fine. I’m lucky.” When I was born, my grandfather set out to build me a jazz collection. He died suddenly & tragically of a heart attack just a few months after my birth, & was only able to give me one record. It was called Just a Lucky So And So, by Jay McShann. After I said those words to my mom, “I’m lucky,” she reminded me of his gift. & after getting off the phone, she sent me the record on iTunes. I downloaded it & looked through the songs, deciding to play the title track first. As those first notes played, the anxiety began to disappear. Clean. Pure. Smooth. Honest. Relaxing. & then five minutes in, the lyrics: As I walk down the streetSeems everyone I meetGives me a friendly helloYes I guess I’m just a lucky so and so The birds in every treeAre all so neighborlyThey sing wherever I goYes I guess I’m just a lucky so and so If you should ask the amountThat’s in my bank accountI’d have to confess, oh yes that I’m slippin’But that don’t worry me, oh confidentiallyI’ve got a dream, yeah that’s a-pippin’ And when the day is throughEach night I hurry toA home where love I knowYes I guess I’m just a lucky so and so Yes I guess I’m just a, just a lucky so and so Sometimes it takes a bit of perspective to snap out it. I never knew my grandfather, but I hear he was an amazing man. A hard-worker, a caring dad & husband, a comic, a charmer, the life of the party, & a mean jazz pianist. This was the record he gave to me before he passed, one of the only things on earth (apart from blood) connecting me to him. And he wanted me to hear that song. I don’t believe in heaven, but I do believe in spirituality & connection. & the connection I felt to him playing that song for the first time, & every time I‘ve played that song since (I’d put it at around 50 in 40 hours), & every time I will play it for the rest of time — that’s more powerful & real than anything I’ve ever been anxious about. I guess, if I were to close it out, I’d just say that in those moments when you’re feeling down or when the world seems to be closing in around you, just take a deep breath & remember how lucky you are. Note: Today is May 5, 2016. I wrote this article almost one year ago, but it was unlisted for some reason. These days, I’m feeling a lot better & I feel like I’ve been able to take more control over my life. But figured it was worth releasing this baby into the wild.",2015
Probiotics over Prozac: The Ketogenic Diet for Your Best Brain,"Many of the newest learnings in health are related to the significance of the microbiome. From personal experience, I regularly feel what I can only describe as the health of my brain. Chemicals, transmitter-stuff, certain states. Which drives me into these subjects searching for ifs, and if-so-what, is going on. Because there is always a reason for why we feel the way we do. (These topics are also of significant personal importance to me in how they relate to anxiety, which is something I’ve had to handle my entire life. More on that in point 5, below.) Otherwise, this is all just more of the same: learn, live better, prosper. Shall we? 1. We are our microbiomes. I’ve said it; you know it, but a few refreshers JIC: 2. Our microbiomes are best supported by probiotics, live food and excellent digestion via which to absorb the goodness. 3. Our microbiomes are responsible for not only our physical wellbeing, but also our psychological health. Here we go. You have neurons both in your brain and your gut — including neurons that produce neurotransmitters like serotonin. In fact, the greatest concentration of serotonin, which is involved in mood control, depression and aggression, is found in your intestines, not your brain. “Mounting research indicates that problems in your gut can directly impact your mental health, leading to issues like anxiety and depression. “The gut-brain connection is well-recognized as a basic tenet of physiology and medicine, so this isn’t all that surprising, even though it’s often overlooked. “There’s also a wealth of evidence showing intestinal involvement in a variety of neurological diseases.” — Are Probiotics the new Prozac? [Mercola] And, note this point “The fact that this study showed any improvement at all is remarkable, considering they used commercial yogurt preparations that are notoriously unhealthy.” Now, consider what you can do with legit probiotics. (Legit = 1 billion CFU/serving for example. It’s pretty difficult to measure the amount of probiotics in packaged foods but a really rough estimate would put a high-quality Greek yogurt at about 1M per gram, from what I understand.) 4. Therefore, our brains (physically and psychologically) depend on the health of our bellies. “The trillions of bacteria living in a person’s gut can communicate directly with the brain via the Vagus Nerve that connects them. Bacteria can also communicate with the brain via the enteric nervous system, the nervous system of the digestive track. Believe it or not, there are actually more neurons wrapped around the gut than there are in the spinal cord. “We are starting to find out that gut bugs can communicate with the brain, scientists say, by modulating the immune system or by actually producing neurotransmitters. Mark Lyte, a researcher at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center who studies the effect that microbes can have on the endocrine systems (the body system of the endocrine glands and the hormones they produce)says, “I’m actually seeing new neurochemicals that have not been described before being produced by certain bacteria. These bacteria are, in effect, mind-altering microorganisms.” “Through this communication from the gut to the brain, the gut bugs can affect behavior and mood. Maybe those folks who coined the expression “gut feeling” were actually on to something! Recent research supports the theory that disturbances in the gut microbiome, or the combination of microbes living in a particular person’s gut, can play a role in some psychopathology such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and even autism. 5. Personal experience has proven this to be the case. I have a particular interest in this because I’ve dealt with anxiety my entire life. At age four, when my parents divorced, I started getting stomachaches. Or, that’s how I felt. Meaning I was anxious, uneasy, felt afraid (had separation anxiety, simply) that “felt” like a stomach ache — and which would often make me actually sick (throw up) but at times like: being dropped off at school or left with a babysitter; sleepovers at friends’ houses; camps — god I hated camps. Thankfully, medication wasn’t an option because I simply “had a stomach ache” — like, maybe I took some Pepto-Bismol here and there. I learned two ways to cure the situation: 1. Find a corner and go to sleep, which I did in every acceptable instance, or 2. Forget about it, which was outside of my control. That being part of the point. Meaning, if I was distracted by something pleasant — a story that made me laugh or a friend engrossing me in idk a game of cat’s cradle — the “stomach ache” would go away. Meaning, it wasn’t (only) physical. It was psychological. With such severity that it could become physical and make me physically ill, but obviously the two are one. This is a much longer story, that involves 20 more years of learnings about anxiety, +/- a visit to the emergency room, eventual medication, no-medication, therapy, lots of books and ultimately, understanding. 6. Specific eating styles, and some lack-of-eating styles, are best for your brain. We know why we don’t eat meat (and if not, watch Forks Over Knives). And, why we don’t eat processed foods. We understand raw and alive. No-sugar should be a given. Which leaves us with that odd grain-free angle. In researching my current eating style, and brain health, I stumbled onto the research subjects that connect ALL of this: “The Neuropharmacology of the Ketogenic Diet” “A diet that is high in fat (60–70% of calories), is almost by definition low in carbs, and this means that when eating a high fat diet, it’s likely that one is at least partially and some of the time in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is when the body switches over from burning glucose (the kind of sugar our body uses as fuel) to burning an alternate fuel called ketones, which are made from the breakdown of fatty acids in the liver when glycogen (how the body stores glucose) levels are depleted. “Basically, the body starts burning fat for energy when we don’t consume very much sugar or foods that readily break down into sugar — carbohydrates. While glucose is metabolically preferred by the body (meaning that if glucose is present, the liver produces only small, baseline amounts of ketones), it is interesting to note that ketones are a principal source of energy during early postnatal development, when our brains are growing and developing at the most rapid pace of our lives. “Ketosis is an entirely normal and healthy state for the body to be in — in fact, most people will be in some amount of ketosis every single morning after ‘fasting’ while they sleep (you can often smell the acetone — a ketone — in your pee when you wake up), which is a sign of metabolic health.” 7. I am not on a ketogenic diet, but my diet is ketogenic. Eating this way makes me feel amazing. Absolutely excellent. Strong, clear-headed, calm, (very) high-energy. “Humming” is how I often describe it. (It’s also supportive of my aggressive exercise routines, and compatible with intermittent fasting / bulletproof coffee (which in turn support each other) and all of the aforementioned “eat” or “don’t-eat”s. So, it’s good. And, it turns out it’s good for your brain too. 8. The ketogenic diet is exceptionally neurologically beneficial. One area in which the ketogenic diet is completely uncontroversial is as a relatively effective non-pharmaceutical treatment for a set of common neurological disorders. Another way the ketogenic diet improves brain function is through several kinds of antioxidant benefits. Oxidative stress can cause harm all throughout the body, and the brain is no different — oxidative damage has been implicated in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases as well as simple brain aging. “The last mechanism through which a ketogenic diet may confer cognitive benefit is through the increase ofγ-aminobutyric acid(GABA) levels in the brain. GABA is the brain’s major inhibitory neurotransmitter. It has been known since the time of Hippocrates that fasting is an effective treatment for seizures, and the ketogenic diet was designed to mimic the fasting state. “The diet is associated with a wide range of neurochemical changes, some of which may contribute to its therapeutic actions and others that are epiphenomenal. “During consumption of the ketogenic diet, marked alterations in brain energy metabolism occur, with ketone bodies partly replacing glucose as fuel. “There is evidence that it causes effects on intermediary metabolism that influence the dynamics of the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems in brain. “Running brain on ketones considerably impacts amino acid metabolism, or more specifically neurotransmitters. Ketogenic diets [are] neuroprotective and improve cognitive function, improve behavior in epileptic children, and [are] even efficacious in bipolar disorder. Many of these effects could be attributable to alterations in glutamate and gaba signaling. Excitotoxicity. Brain fog.” Originally published at rachellerobinett.com on May 12, 2015.",2015
Smart Girl Mara Wilson Discusses Mental Illness,"“I wish somebody had told me that it’s OK to be anxious,” says Wilson in the video. “That you don’t have to fight it. That, in fact, fighting it is the thing that makes it worse.” And in addition to discussing her experience, she also demonstrates a breathing exercise that she uses to help her relax. She also stresses an important message: “You’re not the only one who has this. Other people can and have fought these battles before. So the important thing to remember is that you are not alone and you are OK.” Mara is right: mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of and, in fact, it’s surprisingly common. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 46.3% of 13–18 year olds have a diagnosable mental illness. But it’s not something that those affected have to suffer with. As Mara put it, “It’s OK to be depressed… You don’t have to be depressed. You don’t have to suffer with it. You can get help, you can reach out.” Have you ever used an exercise to help you relax? Are there tricks or techniques that you can think of that might be helpful when you’re feeling down? I like to make a gratitude list when my sad feelings start to get intense. Tell us some of your helpful solutions in the comments below!",2015
How Mindfulness Apps Energized My Morning Routine,"For those not in the know, “mindfulness” is one of the oldest forms of meditation and is rooted in the idea of being consciously aware of being “present” — both in yourself and in the world around you. It isn’t about ignoring your thoughts, but about acknowledging and accepting them (non-judgmentally), while focusing on what you are doing in that moment. That can all sound very groovy and post-modern, but it’s actually a fairly profound change to how most of us approach our average emotional state, which (I’ll speak personally here) often veers from rampant introspection to frenzied existential flight. While the idea of being more present in our daily lives sounds like something Megan Draper might have given a spin on the verge of the 1970s, a mindfulness practice is very 2015, and I’m glad it is. I came to mindfulness — and meditation — rather late in life. I am, by nature, someone who suffers from what New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik has characterized as “free-floating anxiety.” This basically means that I live my life in a more or less constant state of diffuse anxiety, such that no sooner does one worry leave — remembering to pay for my daughter’s flute lessons once the next pay check arrives…sorting out summer plans with my husband — the next one enters in — are the snails killing the small garden I just planted?…should I try for a promotion at work?…at what point in the English Spring do I store away the winter coats for good?. I have a really hard time switching all of that off. Needless to say, I am also the “designated worrier” in my family, to employ Judith Shulevitz’s term of art to describe women who take it upon themselves to do the lion’s share of the worrying within and on behalf of the family. And then a fellow “diffuse anxiety” friend popped into my email a couple of months ago with a potential solution to all this endless worry. Seemingly out of nowhere, she wrote to me and said, “I’ve got one word for you: Headspace. I spend 20 minutes on it every morning and it’s changed my life.” Headspace is one of the more popular mindfulness apps. When my friend shared her wisdom, it was as if I was Benjamin in the film The Graduate and she’d uttered the 21st century equivalent of “Plastics.” I was skeptical at first. As long-time fan of talk therapy, I wasn’t sure that something which focused so much on breathing would really be a very good fit with my overly analytic mind. And let’s face it, the idea of sitting still for any period of time is anathema to someone who is on the go every day from about 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. But over the past year or so, I’d grown increasingly curious about mindfulness. I’d read all of the studies suggesting its putative benefits for the workplace, where mindfulness is used to reduce stress. I’d also heard that even elementary students can learn to self-regulate their emotions and improve their academic focus by building mindfulness into the curriculum from an early age. The growing evidence around the psychological benefits that stem from practicing mindfulness, including reducing depression more effectively than medication and enhancing empathy intrigued me. I suppose I could have signed up for a course and learned to practice mindfulness with others, much like I do yoga. But I decided that doing it on an app would be infinitely better for me. For starters, I lead a highly peripatetic life right now. I live in South London, work in West London and have two kids who attend schools in North and East London. So I really need a version of self-help that doesn’t require me to be anywhere at a fixed time, but instead can mold to my schedule. I also really like the DIY nature of mindfulness apps. Sure, there’s a guy or a lady on the other end of the app guiding you through each exercise, but there’s something about sitting down and choosing to turn on the app that feels like I’m making a conscious choice to improve my life on my own terms. And finally, I’ll be honest, I’m a naturally curious person and I like trying new things, whether it’s coloring books as therapy or meditation. I’ve been at mindfulness for about a month now and so far, so good. I usually find my quiet space around 6:15 a.m. right after I empty the dishwasher and right before I do my stretches. (Have I mentioned that I’m getting old?) My husband has been very supportive. My 11-year-old daughter is also in favor of anything that makes me less “stressy,” as she calls it. Only my very adolescent 14-year-old son seems skeptical. He happened upon me one morning mid-app and did a massive eye roll. But I’m not concerned. Someday he won’t be 14 anymore…he’ll be 44. And at that point, three decades from now, I’m fairly certain he’ll get it. A helpful review of the Headspace app and others can be found here.

How A Compulsive Worrier In The Midwest Does Money,"Hello! You contacted me with lots of details about anxiety. Can you describe what role, generally speaking, anxiety plays in terms of how you do money? I think it has made me handle my finances in totally opposite ways. For instance, I like to have a lot of money in savings so that I feel secure, so I do tend to be very cheap. But at the same time, I don’t have much of a plan. I don’t have or try to stick to a budget, even though every so often I check on Mint. Since I know that I always have a lot of money around, I just spend whatever I need to. I guess I’m saying my spending is very laissez-faire. Every so often I freak out about money if I “feel” like I’ve spent too much. I’m also very hands-off about my retirement accounts. I’ve set up my Roth IRA & 401k so that the contributions come out of my accounts automatically and I never look at my statements. Do you think avoiding the facts feeds the anxiety? It’s very possible. In a way, since I have such a large financial cushion, I’ve never bothered to really try a budget. I’ll do something half-assed for a while, but then quickly give up. Then I ignore my finances for a couple weeks and then freak out if the bank totals aren’t what I thought they should be. Budgeting seems like a ton of work to me, and I’m not generally inclined to do it out of actual necessity. My husband helps keep things in perspective a lot too, and I think he would be really hard to get on board with an actual budget too. Does he feel anxiety around money too? I busted out laughing here. We are complete opposites about money. He likes to spend it, and I like to save it. At one point we talked about him having a compulsive spending habit, but we never looked into it more than that; we didn’t get it diagnosed or anything like that. We have a lot of fights about money because of that, but I also think it helps keep us balanced. He makes sure I don’t go too far off the saving deep end, and I make sure we have enough money to pay all the bills and do fun stuff we want to do, whenever we want. That sounds like a pretty workable system. Do you make roughly equal amounts of money? Yes, we do. I think this year I will surpass him by a bit because I asked for and got a pretty substantial raise, and he lost some income. He’s a teacher and a coach but just lost the coaching jobs for next year. And how does he feel about your anxiety? Does he tolerate it, or see it as a positive — because, as you say, it helps counteract his instinct to spend — or does it make him crazy? Oh my gosh, it makes him crazy. He looks at our accounts and sees all this money lying around for no reason. I see that we aren’t yet hitting my arbitrary goals. When I have my occasional super-meltdowns over not saving enough, he’s the one who talks me down. We’ve been together for almost 15 years, so he can make fun of me a little for it too. He points out that I’m being crazy, and then talks me through our finances to show me why we’ll be ok. Let’s talk about those arbitrary goals! What are they and where do they come from? So when I wrote you I noted we have almost $18,000 in our joint savings/checking accounts (for the record, we do everything through our joint accounts). I checked the amounts last night, and now its closer to $16,500 because a lot of big expenses come out at the first of the month: mortgage, car payment, and health insurance, mostly. At some point I randomly decided that $20,000 is the magic number: if we could hit that I would calm down about our finances. But realistically we both know that’s probably not true. I will never calm down about money! :) It can be kind of freeing to realize that, can’t it? Or is it not freeing? I guess it depends what you want the money for: something specific that you can’t afford yet, or something more nebulous like “peace of mind.” Right! That’s where we’ve been working the most lately. We have to talk about money all the time because of my anxiety and our conflicting habits. I found out that it really helps my husband if we are saving for a specific goal, like a big vacation. He’s less likely to want to overspend his “fun” budget. Then I have to work on actually being ok with letting that money go when we take the trip. I try to keep in mind that my life is a work in progress and that since I realize I can be crazy about money, I can also work on not letting that take over. Are you working on this with help, or by yourself? I ask this as a person who has had anxiety problems since I was a kid and who has tried all sorts of things — from diet modification and exercise to massage therapy to traditional therapy — to get to a better emotional place about my excessive worrying. Haha, oh that’s good to know I’m not the only crazy worrier out there! It might be important to note I don’t worry about money exclusively either. It’s kind of a general characteristic for me. I pretty much work on managing my worrying by myself or with my husband. Our money discussions are primarily between us as well; we have used a financial advisor at our credit union, but he mostly just helped us set up the retirement accounts we have. We haven’t really discussed other financial goals with other people. What are your other financial goals? I knew you’d ask that next, and I don’t really have any! I guess I have one major one, but it seems kind of nebulous sometimes: I want to be able to retire early. Since my husband’s a teacher, and he started teaching right after college, he’ll be able to retire around 55 with amazing benefits, assuming nothing with the retirement plan goes completely haywire in the intervening decades. I would like to be able to retire then as well, so we are trying to throw a lot of money at retirement. Again, it’s hard for me to balance that with needing a lot of cushion in savings/checking. Technically the retirement money is available if needed, but it seems like it could also disappear at the worst time if something like the Great Recession happens again. I wish we had hooked you up to some sort of device that measured your heart-rate during this interview so that you could report when your pulse spikes. Are you feeling more anxious right now than when we began talking, or less? If I asked you to open up your online banking window and actually come face-to-face with the numbers, would that freak you out or calm you down? They say worrying has a lot to do with how out of control a person feels. So during the interview, I’ve gone back and forth, honestly. I was nervous at the beginning and talking about retirement, but when I talk about how my husband and I work on it together I feel really good about it. I guess that’s a good sign for our relationship! ;) Do you think a lot about how your parents did money when you were growing up and do you think that has had an impact on your relationship to saving and spending now? I can say, without a doubt, YES. I am so similar to my mother it can be terrifying. I honestly think she’s where I get a lot of my habits and emotions towards money. Don’t get me wrong, my parents (and my in-laws for that matter) are all super supportive and would help us out in a heart beat if anything came up. My husband and I both came from similar, suburban, middle-class privileged backgrounds. My mom is a saver and worrier as well. She also needs a very large financial cushion. My father likes to spend. They’re divorced and I heard a lot of incriminating information on each of their spending habits, or lack thereof, during that. Ah yes, well, divorce can wreak havoc on finances. But your mom was a worrier even before your parents split up? Yes, I think she was. We rarely went out to eat but I have vague memories of being a child and picking up on unspoken signals to only order the cheapest thing on the menu when we went out. Also, I think it goes back even farther than just my mom. Her father is incredibly frugal as well. I don’t know about the worrying part, but I know they both keep a lot of money in savings and try to live cheaply to keep it there. It’s interesting how that stuff can be passed down — how much we learn by example. The Great Depression is still having ripple effects, several generations later. Speaking of eating out, since it’s #FoodMonth, how do you do money when it comes to groceries and meals? Well, you found my guilty pleasure! I consider myself a wanna-be foodie, so food is one of the things I’m willing to spend on, sometimes ridiculously so. Our city has a lot of small locavore restaurants and I love to go out and try them. I am a sucker for a restaurant-specific cocktail too, and those are not cheap! I try to balance it by going to happy hours a lot (learned that from my mom too!). That way I can experience as many restaurants as possible. I’m pretty frugal when it comes to groceries, though. I shop the circulars weekly and try to base my meal plans for the week around what’s on sale. I love one of our grocery stores that calculates how much you saved when you use your loyalty card because I’m a nerd. I do try to eat at home a lot, since it’s cheaper and often a lot healthier. Do you use food as an emotional metric, then, for other purchases? Like, “Would this $16 thing make me as happy as spending $16 on dinner would?” And do you and your husband both prioritize dining well, or does he appreciate it less than you do? Ah the perennial Billfold debate: experiences vs. things. ;) Meals are kind of experiences AND things, aren’t they? Though the “thing” part is ephemeral. I suppose for me they’re mainly experiences since it’s here and then it’s gone, literally. Also you absolutely have to eat something, so in a way I justify it to myself. My husband also likes going out to eat, but he also wants to buy a lot of stuff, so we do have fights about that sometimes too. You should show him this cartoon from the Money issue of the New York Times Magazine. On the other hand, if he can afford the amazing new thing and it’s not putting you in debt, and it brings him joy … *shruggie* That’s about how I feel about “pelf.” But yeah that’s about sums up his argument too. And I can see that side of it. It’s just hard to get out of your own head sometimes and accept that he has a different way of looking at things, and it’s not inherently wrong, it’s just different. MARRIAGE, amirite? So much damn compromise and empathy. Any last thoughts or advice for Billfold readers? I’ve been thinking about that question since we decided to chat last week! I don’t know that I’m a great person to get advice from, since I’m extremely privileged to be so monetarily secure and yet to still worry about it all the time. However, I guess I could give some tips on how I try to not spend money: I try very hard to not watch TV or to shop, actually. I find when I’m exposed to a lot of ads or the lives on shows (however unrealistic) I tend to want to buy more stuff or at least spend more money to make my life more like those I saw. Or, try to keep in mind that we’re all works in progress, and even if a decision you made looks terrible in hindsight, try to be kind to yourself because you made the best choice you could at the time, with the information you had. I’m still working on that one! Aren’t we all. Do you envision a time in your life when you do mellow out a bit about money? Once you are happily retired, or can you picture any circumstances in which it could happen before then? I definitely hope it will happen someday. Some of my other character flaws seem to be mellowing with age so I hope as I get more perspective and life experience I’ll be more reasonable about money. Also, I hope that I’ll continue to get raises and having more money in the bank might help too. ;) As long as I also avoid the dreaded lifestyle creep! Here’s hoping! Good luck! Thanks!",2015
Here’s What Anxiety Feels Like When You Have No Idea What Anxiety Is,"…Unfortunately, we’re talking about 8-year-old Alicia in this instance, who didn’t drink coffee (yet) or have even the slightest flippin’ clue about anxiety. It’s really hard to understand what anxiety is and how it relates to what it feels physically within you when you’re told to “just calm down and everything will get better.” Spoiler alert: it doesn’t always get better, especially if you don’t know what you’re dealing with on an emotional and mental level. Nor does it really assuage anything in the long run. According to the fancy paper of record The New York Times, anxiety is now more common than depression amongst college students. Which means that anxiety and stress level increases are happening to people at younger and younger ages. But when that’s not considered a regular occurrence by-and-large, people might not believe you, or might dismiss it as an over-abundance of keen kid energy …but sometimes it’s not. And sometimes it’s even worse when you try to re-categorize your anxiety spirals in your head. For example mine became quite the party trick when I tried to turn them into self-aware comedy outbursts to make people feel more comfortable about them when they happened. Oddly enough, though, it didn’t help the matter. When you’re young, anxiety is like a smoke monster: it lurks behind you, this intangible thing that makes your heart beat and your head go akimbo. It makes you wonder, nervously, “Why am I like this? What’s making me feel this way? How do I make it stop?” Ignoring these feelings often makes it worse, too. Pretending it’s nothing only makes the looming dread grow stronger, the monster’s unseen presence hoarding all your rational thought. And when you don’t know what it means but you see how these weird feelings inside of you are bouncing around externally, it’s easy to say, “Well shoot, this is totally my fault and I’m doing something wrong. I’m the worst, and also maybe an emotional monster-person.” Listen to me when I say this: you’re not wrong. And you’re not alone. When you name anxiety for what it is, you’re able to understand it, and feel less controlled by it and more in control of it. Stress is like the weirdest twinge of electrical energy within us, and sometimes it’s hard to know what’ll stress you out, cause you anxiety, or send you into a spiral of self-hatred and feeling hopeless. When anxiety is left buried and ignored, its talons only latch on stronger. (It’s like Golum and his precious.) It becomes a battle against your mind — “I know I shouldn’t feel this way! And yet I totally do!” — and your heart that can make you feel, frankly, more than a little cranky. It’s not a good look! Especially when you consider yourself a fairly logical Smart Girl who’s self-aware and in control of their emotions. But hey, even the smartest among us need help understanding what we’re feeling or how to deal (pro-tip: breathing helps). No one in my family has ever been diagnosed with anxiety. They’ve never understood my energy levels or ways of handling things, and it was always an alienating divide for me as a kid (even sometimes as an adult). It wasn’t until a doctor told me last year that I had PTSD that I realized the thing I jokingly called “an endearing personality quirk” was actually a something I could work towards remedying to make my life better. The shame I’d felt for so long wasn’t something I needed to mentally flagellate myself for, it was a part of how my body learned to cope with stress and trauma growing up — and there’s nothing wrong with that. It was just my body doin’ what it does: survive and thrive in spite of any and everything. So next time you feel those rumblings — that tidal wave of dread and grief and worry — just try and find a way to relax. Reach out to your friends, talk to a counselor or a teacher or a therapist. Find resources that work for you. Because you’re not alone and you can and will overcome this and it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you because of it. A body’s going to do what a body’s going to do, you just have to trust and work with it in order to see yourself through. Have you ever dealt with anxiety or depression? How did it feel when you were a kid? Let us hear your anecdotes in the comments, Smarties.

Reaching the Opposite of Anxiety,"Through high school and my first year of college, I worked at a summer camp in the mountains of Idaho. Before working there, I spent eight summers attending as a camper. Being a part of that camp, at the time, was deeply attached to my identity. During my second year in college, I received a phone call from the camp’s director. He told me they didn’t have a place for me and wouldn’t be hiring me back for my fifth summer. They had told me something completely different in person the week before. I was furious. I didn’t realize at the time that I was having an anxiety attack — I just remember feeling livid and tight. Too angry to think properly, I laid down and had trouble breathing. It was the first time in my life that I had an expectation for the future and it didn’t go as planned. Which, for me, is the root of my anxiety. I’m a planner. I plan. The planning doesn’t cause my anxiety, just my expectations. I attributed the tightness to my anger, but in hindsight, it was something more. Laying in bed, I let my anger go, but the tightness remained. I couldn’t sleep. I had to do something, anything to make it go away. So I planned a 7,000-mile road trip to take that summer. I never planned on following through — I just wanted the plan to exist. I wanted to do something to make myself feel better. That’s the first time I remember self-medicating my anxiety. My vices, whatever they may be at the time, all serve my anxiety. That’s a terrifying realization to make, and only one I’ve made within the last few weeks. All the things I do for fun and enjoyment can slip very easily into becoming a balm for my anxiety. Even that doesn’t ring true. I serve my anxiety; I just use my vices as the means to the end. A good friend of mine told me many months ago, during an extended bout of anxiousness, “Anxiety is the opposite of mindfulness.” What we’ve gone on to talk about regularly since then is that anxiety doesn’t come from an external source. It’s within me. It’s my decision. I’ve never actually dealt with my anxiety; I’ve only pushed it back down. I’ve hidden it. Drank it. Fucked it. Smoked it. But I never let myself feel it. While I’ve only had three full anxiety attacks, I’ve lived with an underlying current of anxiety for almost the past decade. I don’t have an anxiety disorder. At least, that’s what two medical professionals have told me over the years and I believe them. I’m just anxious. I’m scared of being vulnerable with myself, my feelings, and other people. It was held at bay through high school by learning to cook — so well that I didn’t realize I was anxious until recently. My best friend at the time and I would make elaborate dinners and eat until we burst. We don’t speak now, but I still use cooking as a coping mechanism. When I lost my summer job and my anxiety bubbled to the surface for the first time, planning that road trip was the first thing I did. I ended up taking that trip, and it lasted 10,004 miles. I left my anxiety somewhere on the road in Utah and didn’t look back for three months. After that, I medicated with cigars. A friend I met on my road trip introduced me to cigars. He told me an anecdote that I took to heart. “Every problem can be solved over the course of a good cigar. If you fuck it up and can’t solve it over the first, just have another.” Then came alcohol. That was short-lived, with one binge weekend. I decided I’d rather be anxious than an alcoholic, so I controlled my drinking instead of my anxiety. In the months that followed, I eventually found something to hold it down while still using alcohol — learning to craft cocktails. My anxiety didn’t leave me then, but it became more manageable. Shortly after that, I moved to Portland, and my anxiety stayed on the beach where I left it. For a while, at least. But, as always, it came back. The second time I had a full-blown anxiety attack, I was working support at Big Cartel. The weekend shift was especially brutal for me one week, and I fell behind. Instead of asking for help and tackling the problem as a team, I tried handling it on my own and failed miserably. A week or two later, it compounded until I was laying on the floor of my apartment in Portland, breathing through my nose in an attempt to calm myself down. I called my boss and mentor as soon as I could sit up. I could feel the heightened, anxious energy bouncing through me — it felt like it was going to explode out my eyes and my fingertips, taking everything that makes me me with it. I asked him if he knew of any meditation techniques for anxiety since I knew he actively practiced. “Not for during the attack. Meditation is for helping to prevent them, not stop them.” He sent me a few links and we talked until my nerves boiled down to normal. Eventually I worked through that spell with the team. I still remember the group call we had where I told them, “I’m dealing with terrible anxiety and it’s a real motherfucker.” While I parted ways with Big Cartel later that year, I remember that moment fondly. It was the first time I talked about my anxiety with people; the first time I was vulnerable about my anxiety. This last year was especially hard for my friends, family, and myself. I didn’t notice at the time, but I was keeping down the anxiousness with my 365-day project. It worked wonderfully — not because I was self-medicating with photography, but because I was taking time daily to walk, relax, think, and do something for myself. I took time to be aware, to be in the moment, to process. On January 1st, I shifted away from daily photography, and back came the rush of anxiety. I realized it quickly and worked on fixing it. My answer was casual marijuana use and an active practice of mindfulness meditations. I did a 10-minute meditation every day and a 30-minute meditation weekly. The worst part about my being anxious, besides not being available to the better parts of life, is that I double-down on ego. I fall into the trap every time. Since talking about it with people helped once, I figure I’ll just discuss it with myself. I’ll work it out, and then I’ll be fine. I can do this on my own. It’s depressing that I know that’s false, but I believe it anyway. It’s easier to struggle alone than be vulnerable with people. Being vulnerable is terrifying. I’m not original in my use of ego — I know the answers so I don’t have to be anxious — but that doesn’t make it any less frustrating. Pretending to have the answers has stopped me multiple times from actively talking about it. If I talk about my anxiety, I’m admitting I don’t have the answers, and vulnerability, not unlike anxiety, is a real motherfucker. The opposite of anxiety isn’t not being anxious. It’s understanding my feelings and allowing them to be just that — feelings. Anxiety is not a rational fear. It’s a manufactured possibility because I let it be one. Being afraid of vulnerability isn’t a rational fear either. That doesn’t make it any less scary. Earlier this year, my self-medication stopped working. The scales tipped from daily meditation to occasional meditation and from occasional marijuana to daily marijuana. I still haven’t been able to figure out what caused the shift or the anxiety — but a month after the switch, I had my third anxiety attack. I’m getting married in eight days, and the weeks leading up to it have been stressful. By the time my anxiety builds to a level that can cause an anxiety attack, it’s actually been around for a long time. I’ve just been hiding behind whatever vice or hobby I’m enjoying at the time. Two weeks ago, I felt it. I started to have an anxiety attack, but instead I went on a hike. I took time to be aware, to be in the moment, to process. I sat by a waterfall and let myself feel every feeling. I let it arise and let it pass. I saw it as its own contained thought — my consciousness stared at it while it floated up and down. I was vulnerable with myself. Once it was gone, I made photographs. I slept in the sun. I wrote about the experience. Then I sent it to a printer. Now I’m being vulnerable with you. I created Available in Response, my latest photo zine, to have an honest conversation with myself about my anxiety. This essay and the zine are the byproduct of that honesty. I hope you enjoy it.",2015
Anxiety and Never-Not,"I have never not been a worrier. I can’t remember a time when the unappeasable spectre of What If wasn’t buried somewhere deep in my brain. It’s been there since before I can remember; certainly before I had any real names for it. Before I had words like anxiety or apprehension or intrusive thoughts, it was there, shivering and electric. I say never not instead of always, because the former implies the possibility of an absence. As a kid, I was obsessed with the binary of good/bad. There were good kids, like Heather, who smiled and ate everything on her plate and did whatever she told and never seemed to feel squinched up and mean inside. Then there were kids like Jay, who used art time exclusively to draw pictures of penises urinating some kind of black tar-like substance. It seemed pretty clear to me early on which side of the line I was on: I struggled to behave and do what was expected of me, and also I thought Jay’s dick pics were hilarious. I didn’t want to be a bad kid, but it seemed like I didn’t have a choice; it was a sort of malignancy that grew and grew in me, no matter what I did. I tried not to talk too much or interrupt or fidget, but my efforts lasted an hour or two at most. And meanwhile Heather smiled serenely, secure in the knowledge that she would never feel the impulse to scrawl a pair of hairy testicles across a pink sheet of construction paper. I wish I could say I accepted my badness with glee, but I didn’t. Instead, I thought about how all of my teachers must hate me. Sometimes it was all I could think about, although that didn’t stop me from doing bad things. I stopped sleeping the summer I turned seven, because I was sure that I would die in my sleep. I became obsessed with the idea that I might stop breathing and, if I wasn’t awake, wouldn’t be able to think myself into taking a breath again. How was I supposed to trust my fluttering, fragile body to take care of itself through the long, black hours of sleep? I remember the nights stretching out lonely and miserable in front of me and wishing so hard that I could just be unconscious. I didn’t want to play. I didn’t want to read. I didn’t even want to watch TV. I just wanted to not think about dying every time I closed my eyes. I thought up funny ways to try to alleviate my anxiety — like holding my breath until I passed out (which didn’t work), or sleeping in the hallway so that if I did stop breathing one of my parents could find me and quickly resuscitate me (this just meant that I got tripped over a lot). Nothing worked. And then one day the fear went away as easily as it had come. I used to love the high that worrying gave me — the hours before a test or a recital when I would ride the wave of glittering panic, my fingers and toes tingling with anticipating. Then I would feel the heavy needle of my anxiety shift into its groove as I sat down at my desk or stepped out onto the stage, and with my adrenaline-flushed cheeks I would outshine everyone else. Worrying made me a superbly good performer. Afterwards I would crash, hard. There was never a moment of triumph, no feeling of success — only a weepy, high-strung post-performance haze. When I was older, I started making up rituals — they were for “good luck” I said, although what I really meant was that if I didn’t do them I would have bad luck. One of them involved spelling out a series of words in sign language; I would do this either behind my back or next to my thigh whenever I thought about it, which was often. Another had something to do with running from the fridge to the dining room table and back again before the fridge door closed — if I was able to do this even just once while setting the table, then none of the things I worried about would happen. I fully gave myself over to magical thinking, because even thought I knew logically that doing these things wouldn’t change my luck, I couldn’t stop the What If machine in my head. I still can’t stop it — it’s whirring and buzzing in my head as I type this, speeding up my clunking thoughts just as I should be settling down for the night. I wish I could tell you that there’s an end to anxiety. I wish I could say that I took a pill or discovered the healing power of long walks or learned transcendental meditation, but none of that would be true. Every day this awful beast scoops me up in its huge maw and shakes me until my bones clink together. Some days I can outrun him for longer than others, but there’s never a time when he doesn’t catch me. I am still an excellent performer, and I still crash and cry afterwards. I jitter and skitter through my days, gritting my teeth through the intrusive thoughts until I can drug myself to sleep at night. By now, this is the only way I know how to manage things; it’s a system of sorts. although it doesn’t offer much relief. I can’t say what my life would look like without anxiety, but I know that even with it, I’ve managed to create something good. That might sound absurdly hopeful, but I can’t help it. The only way to live with it is to be absurd about it, even in the face of all the known facts. So I pace and cry and don’t sleep and drag myself to therapy and take my pills and believe so hard in never-not instead of always. The idea that this jolting misery could be here forever is unbearable, so I stick with never not when I can. I have never not lived like this. But I could someday. Maybe.

9 Things Having Anxiety Attacks Has Taught Me,"If you’ve never had an anxiety attack, think about what you fear the most in the world and how you would feel in direct confrontation with that. Imagine the physical symptoms that might show up — a wave of nausea. A strong impulse to run away. Maybe some pangs of pain or dizziness. Maybe worse. Now imagine these feelings and symptoms washing over you randomly, say, while you’re in an important meeting. There’s nothing to fear. Just the thought that everyone around you would question your sanity if you bolted for the door. I’ve had anxiety attacks (interchangeably referred to as panic attacks) on and off since 2011, and it has been quite a ride. I could write a whole other piece about how to manage anxiety symptoms (I did while I was studying abroad), but this ain’t that. Instead, I’ve been thinking more broadly about what having anxiety attacks has taught me…and it’s not all bad:",2015
It’s Only Fear,"Fear’s a necessity. It’s a natural instinct that’s kept us alive for the hundred of thousands of years we’ve been around — the urge to sprint in terror from shadows in the grass once meant the difference between making it home to your hut or being dismembered by giant wolves. In the millennia since, we’ve gotten smarter. A lot smarter. So smart, in fact, we killed off all the aforementioned giant wolves; despite the depressing array of perils that still accompany walking around in the 21st century, roving packs generally aren’t among them. Those fearful habits, however, have kept us around this long, and aren’t about to go anywhere. That’s why you’re still vaguely terrified of strangers (they’ve been eyeing your goat), loud noises (mammoths have nasty tempers), and your boss (the chieftain just ran out of goats to sacrifice). Objectively, it’s pretty ridiculous how many things we subconsciously think will kill us, and we’ve gotten really, really good at rationalizing those thoughts. We translate them from those primal urges into something that makes more sense in our modern, wolf-less context. Those rationalizations are crippling you. They say you should stay in for the fifth Friday night in a row, because your friends are really just being nice and tolerating you and drinks are expensive and the people aren’t that attractive and human connection was overrated anyway, when honestly you’re afraid of rejection and intimacy. They tell you you can’t ask for that new project because you’ll piss off your peers and you’re actually not at all qualified and your terrifying boss will think you’re an arrogant dick and then she’ll fire you and you’ll have to spend the next month scrounging for Bloomin’ Onion shards behind the Outback by the freeway, when you’re really afraid of the opportunity because you can’t tell what might lie ahead and unknowns are scary. Generally they tell you that you shouldn’t do (x) because (y) will happen and then everyone will know about it and hate you. But guess what? It’s bullshit. Weird, subconscious, evolutionarily well-intentioned bullshit. Shake it off. You’re okay. There’re no wolves in the basement, and no one’s going to murder you for your goat. You’re living in a world surrounded by 7 billion other people who devote just as much time to thinking about how you screw up as you do to them; you can start by caring just a little less what anyone else thinks. You’re afraid, and it’s okay to be afraid. But you’ve gotta acknowledge you’re afraid, accept it, and realize that you’re not gonna die so you should really just go ahead and do it. You’re gonna be just fine. Do something stupid. Talk to a stranger at a bar. Is it gonna be stiff and awkward? Of course it is. And it doesn’t matter. You’re never gonna see them again and unless things really got weird, they’re gonna forget you by the time they get home. Those friends you went with? They like you! We’re all great at avoiding people we don’t like and they’re sure as hell not avoiding you. Keep breathing. Just ask for that chance. It’s not gonna be there forever and the worst you’ll hear is ‘no,’ which typically isn’t a death sentence. In the long run, regret and the ‘what-ifs’ you’ll weave for months or years afterwards will wreck you worse than a done-and-over-with rejection. And who knows! You might even get it. I still have to talk myself down from mental ledges a lot of days. More often than I’d like to admit I have to remind myself that I’m fine, the world’s fine, and I’m actually pretty good at what I do right now — as long as I keep busting my butt at it, I’m only gonna get better. Like Stefan Sagmiester’s fantastic piece, ‘having guts always works out for me.’ I’m okay. You’re okay.",2015
Postpartum Anxiety Made Me Afraid of Everything,"What if she’s not OK? What if she’s not OK? What if something hurts her? These are the thoughts that spun uninterrupted through my mind and out of my mouth for the first few days after we brought our baby home from the hospital. For the three days we spent in the hospital after her birth, I thought I had escaped any postpartum emotional disturbance. If anything, my emotions skewed toward beaming bliss. She was a precious little doll who slept constantly. I stayed up all night just to look at her and revel in the disbelief that this could be my new life. In the previous months, I had tried to prepare for my ancient depression to resurface as postpartum depression. I discussed it with my psychiatrist, and assumed being aware would be an adequate defense. What I didn’t know was how a lack of sleep and feeling unprepared for parenthood would trigger debilitating anxiety. On our second day at home, my husband found me crying in the bedroom while the baby slept in the bassinet. “Crying” is hardly the right word, I felt like I was wailing. I wasn’t sad, but terrified. He said, “You need to call Dr. Q (my therapist).” When she called back later that afternoon, I went upstairs to a remote spot where I could be as raw as I felt. The first few minutes of the call were made up by my sobs and apologies for not being able to get myself under control. When I could finally tell the doctor that I didn’t know if the baby was eating enough, I was afraid she would get hurt or sick, afraid I couldn’t protect her well enough, I was thrown into sobs again. Across this thick, old house, I could hear her crying, and I felt helpless. Except that she wasn’t crying. She was sleeping, and my brain was matrixing ambient noise into tiny baby cries like clouds into circus animals. The doctor told me to stop everything and sleep for at least three hours while my husband looked after the baby, then let him do the same. In the first few months of her life, the baby’s cries were to be expected. The doctor labeled her witching hour as “colic,” but I never thought it was really that severe. What I didn’t expect was my own witching hour that had me twisted in a knot almost every evening — crying, angry, or just overwhelmed. My brain was a simpering, beaten puppy, flinching at even the most gentle flutter, launching an all-out raging defense against minor problems. I was devastated that my husband could fall asleep easily while the baby and I were desperately awake and panicking. I was on a knife’s edge throughout a visit from the in-laws because I felt so uncertain and inadequate in my role as mother. I briefly despised our cats because I imagined all the danger they could pose to a newborn. In the thick of it, I tried to get a handle on the anxiety by exerting more and more control over our daily routine. I timed and noted feedings, naps, and diapers. I repeated the feeding/laundry/dishes/diaper/nap cycle all day long until my husband came home and I collapsed. I found myself with a pernicious habit of counting dishes as I loaded and unloaded, counting laundry as I folded, creating rules for putting things away. These small household things were “under control,” giving me a little relief from anxiety but creating new pressures to keep up with the control systems. When there were no more dirty clothes or dishes to wash, I had space to fill. Space is where thinking and worrying sneak in. Postpartum anxiety goes beyond normal worrying into highly irrational territory. I couldn’t accept that my baby was safe if she wasn’t directly in my line of sight. That meant that I hardly let my guard down for weeks, anxiety simmering just under the boiling point. Postpartum Progress, a national support and advocacy organization for women with pregnancy-related mood disorders, lists ways anxiety can manifest in early motherhood. I don’t know if most new moms are free of this intense anxiety or if they are just not talking about it. I thought, “This is just what it feels like to have a new baby because I’m tired and hormonal.” But it didn’t seem like other new moms around me were having the same experience. In this episode of The Longest Shortest Time, mom Melinda describes her experience with anxiety. I listened to that podcast — many, many months after my anxiety had calmed down — and for the first time heard a story that sounded like mine. Now I sometimes remember things that sent me over the edge in that raw time, and I don’t know why it was such a big deal. Why did I have a full-blown tantrum when my husband forgot to bring home Diet Coke? Because I felt trapped, and Diet Coke was the small comfort I had looked forward to all day. I wasn’t yet comfortable running out to the store with the baby. I didn’t yet realize I could put her in the stroller and walk to the corner and we would both feel so much better. My biggest roadblock to getting better was not knowing there was anything wrong, not having the energy to think rationally, not wanting to seem weird by mentioning it to other moms. And when other moms told me things would be OK, I didn’t need to worry, I just thought they couldn’t empathize with me because they had forgotten how tenuous these times are. It was around the 6-month mark when I started to feel normal again. I was exercising everyday, pushing myself to be more social, the hormones had dissipated. I’m never anxiety-free, but when my “base” setting is on low, I don’t get ruffled so easily. I am painting the darker parts of this period here, but it’s a complicated scene. My agitation coexisted with elation, pride, excitement, adoration. The three of us had small sweet moments that were genuinely joyful. And we had those moments with our family and friends in celebrating our new little person. I am now actively trying to sugarcoat my memories of those first few months so I can recall them sweetly years from now. When I look through pictures from a year and a half ago, I see how she was peaceful and healthy, always with my hand somewhere in the frame, holding things together for her. Just now, she toddled over to me and said “Hi, Mama,” then crawled up on the couch and draped herself across me. I still can’t believe she was ever so tiny and inside me.

Teach Your Children Well,"Children, Stress, and Overachievement Two articles inspired today’s essay. The first was this column, exhorting parents not to doom their children to a “desperate, joyless life” of overachievement: From infancy to employment, this is a life-denying, love-denying mindset, informed not by joy or contentment, but by an ambition that is both desperate and pointless, for it cannot compensate for what it displaces: childhood, family life, the joys of summer, meaningful and productive work, a sense of arrival, living in the moment. As the parent of a toddler, I think about this issue a lot. At 31, I am not particularly content with the way my professional life has turned out. At the same time, my personal life — my family, my friends, my child — bring me incredible joy. But these things that bring me joy did not require perfect GPAs, top SAT scores, Princeton, or NYU Law.* And as I raise a child, this is important for me to keep in mind. The relentless drive of the upper-middle-class to pad their children’s resumes and push them into the best preschool, the best school, the best college, the best whatever — what is it all for? I have built up a strong resume in the last three decades, but none of the things on the resume are the things that bring me happiness in my life. This brings me to the second piece of reading for today: “‘Don’t Be Like Me’: A Parent’s Plea.” This hit home for me, because I have often had this thought myself. My son is currently 20 months old. He has very few cares in this world, and he approaches the world with an giddy and infectious excitement. But I already see the things (real or imagined) that worry me. He is already an introvert, preferring to play by himself overplaying with other children. He is scared of new things. He didn’t walk until he was 15 months old, in part because he was clearly nervous at the prospect of being so far from the ground. And when I look at his joyful face, I know that of all the things I want for him, I want him not to be weighed down by the anxiety that weighs me down. I want for my genetics not to be his destiny. And I want him to be happy. And if that doesn’t require padding his resume so that he gets into Princeton, so be it. But as a perfectionist and a parent in a perfectionist society, this will be an incredibly hard tightrope for me to walk. * Actually, it technically did require Princeton, as that is where I met my wife.",2015
Defensive Pessimism and the Case for Uncertainty,"No, being unemployed was not by design. I signed a contract for work with another company and resigned from my job. And that didn’t work out. After I got over the initial shock of having everything I thought I wanted (and had in my pocket) taken away from me, I began the arduous task of a job hunt without the luxury of having income from still being employed. It is really, like starting and running a startup, you know your burn rate and you know the runway you have before you need to jump at the next opportunity to avoid closing your doors. And it is especially hard for me because I am someone who depends heavily on routine and stability. I make plans, and when plans fall through, it leaves me feeling bereft and oddly like as if I had my childhood blanket thrown away. It is no one’s fault, this weakness of mine, the world is and never will be a place of permanent stability. Change is the only constant, I tell myself, it’ll be okay. One of my goals in 2013 was to look for the good no matter how bad circumstances appear to be, and I have been practising that thought process since then. There are things in our lives that may appeal as trials at first, but very often, I find that these things that shake up my beliefs of the world at large allow me to find out new things about myself and new directions to take. Having a bit of uncertainty in life is a good thing, it allows you to reevaluate the direction you steered your life in and whether or not it is something you want to continue with for the next five to ten years. I find that shaking things up a bit removes one from the comfort zone and it becomes a lot easier to try new things and “pivot”, as we like to say in startup world. I used to be a very insecure person, always worrying about the next job, the next semester, the next person I am going to meet. I get this paralysing anxiety attacks that seemingly come out from nowhere, and I usually try to escape by reading, watching long TV series and playing iOS games that allow me to forget the real world for stretches of time at one go. This time, though, I allowed myself to truly experiene the emotions I go through when I am in this period of uncertainty. I started reading books and articles about the status of uncertainty and the best ways to cope with them. Out of all the methods I have evaluated, the one that I felt was most useful was the theory of defensive pessimism. It is a very straightforward mental process. You take the one thing that you are the most anxious about, and you list the worst possible outcomes, and then you think of possible solutions for those outcomes and list (again) the next steps to follow if the worst possible outcomes came to pass and you had to continue with life. I find that this reduces my anxiety on a large scale, if not completely. The results of my defensive pessimism usually tells me that those solutions may require some huge changes in my thinking and my way of life. They may require me to rethink some of my medium-term goals and new ways of achieving them. The important takeaway from this, though, is that things are rarely as bad or impossible as it seems. There is always a way out, we just need to harden our wills and see things from perspectives we never truly allowed ourselves to see from before. Being the impatient person I am, my greatest annoyance at the moment is that I cannot skip ahead through the uncertainty into a week from now when I will know what my options are. The period of waiting, is possibly more agonising than any mental torture in the history of humankind (I exaggerate a lot, please forgive me.). I just can’t wait for this to be over so that I can start planning and moving forward with my life. This state of being in limbo may be uncomfortable, but it is very often in ths state of mind that I learn about what I truly want and where I want my life to go. Embrace uncertainty. It is worth it (always in hindsight).",2015
"<strong class=""markup--strong markup--h3-strong"">9 simple Tips for Anxious People to Start Meditating</strong>","It’s been two months since I’ve been meditating every single day. This wonderful state of mind encouraged me to spread the meditation techniques to all the people arround me. As I always struggle with my anxiety and suttle changes of mental state since I was a child, I never thought meditation could help me the way it has. As an academical-intelectual-scientist-with-no-religion, I always looked at meditation a little bit skeptical and thought of it as dellusions people would do to confuse themselves and run away of their problems. The intensity of being a person who loves drinking, smoking and hard parties made me think that the zen atmosphere would make me lose this feeling of well-being that I loved so much. However, last year some friends encouraged me and I decided to give it a try. After the first week, the results were very impressive, and it caught my attention by breaking this solid armor I had within me. I never thought I could have a peaceful moment with myself, or while facing a stressful situation. My mind worked by itself, and it really hurted me. I am a begginer in the meditation practice, so I thought it would be motivating for people to know that the zazen practice does not require a deep knowledge or a fully-deep-concentration to be started. It just requires your own desire. In order to achieve the positive results meditation can provide us, anxious people, you have to deactivate — even if it is just for a couple of minutes — your skeptical swift. Allow your mind and spirit to go along this experience. If even after you tried for a week, you realize that this didn’t change absolutely anything in your routine, self-esteem and perception, then you’re allowed to give up. But just after these previous steps. 2. Don’t face meditation as pain-killers. When you sit in your meditation posture, don’t expect it to solve or relief all your problems and struggles. It has not analgesic properties, it is rather a way of separating yourself from the avalanche of feelings and thoughts that consume us on a daily basis. A beloved friend and zen student used to say to me: “You are not your mind, it is just a part of you”. I think this sentence really helps ourselves to mantain control and understand our existence in a lighter perspective. 3. Start slowly and steadily Even if your mind set allows you to just stay a minute or two meditading, let it go. The most important things about meditation are the routine and discipline. After setting yourself a routine — I strongly suggest that you start it first thing in the morning — then you can work yourself out to increase your meditation time. But at this time, focus on estabilishing a disciplined routine. 4. Don’t be hard on yourself Ok, ok. It is surely not easy for us to sit and do nothing for a minute. We are always connected or forcing ourselves to keep thinking about our worries, bills to pay, rlationships, work problems, wars, facebook, whatsapp messages. So, take it easy if you miss a day or two. Practice the self-compassion will help you during this process. 5. Don’t try to “think about nothing” ou “just don’t think” These are classical mistakes people make when thinking about meditation. The techniques used in the zazen (commom budhist word to refer to the meditation process) are focused to free your mind, body and self-control from your deepest emotional and sharpest thoughts. There are thoughts that could be very harmful to your self-esteem, your productivity and your relationship with people that surround you. Meditation improves your abilities to deal with these thoughts and making them disappear is not the goal here. The skill of handling it with your own thoughts and mind are the goal we are searching for when we meditate. 6. Don’t panic It’s not easy for us, post-modern creatures, to stop our daily activities to just sit and pay attention on our breath, body and put ourselves in the position of observer-wolves. It is difficult, and requires energy. Don’t stress yourself if it is hard to concentrate or even if your legs hurt. The pain on the legs is mentioned by Zen Masters frequently. If the psysichal sensations are being a problem, try using a chair. 7. Results come along within the process, not as goals As Shunryiu Suzuki affirms on his extraordinary book “Zen Mind, Begginer’s Mind”, the meditation practice must be itself a part of your everyday life, a part of you, and not the goal itself. If we think about having a peaceful mind and being a total-zen person as results, this might stress ourselves, intefering in our development. The results are not so clear. Your will feel the changes in little moments of your routine, not as extraordinary epiphanies. It is not a magical revelation or a substancial move in your life. It’s simply a better way of dealing with our thoughts and perceptions. 8. Don’t try to change your behavior. You don’t have to stop eating meat or quit smoking to let the zen way of life take part in your routine. It’s true that, once engaged in zazen practice, you will face some momentum and the willing to change everything. But the practice comes before the changes. What zazen provides is a more clear state of mind, in which you are able to accept your wills and fondest identity inside yourself. 9. Let technology help you. Nowadays basically there are apps for everything. Meditaton apps provide guided meditation, a count of days and hours you meditate and also a huge variety of packages, that can be used to improve your health, perfomance, self-esteem and others. By indication of a friend, I am currently using Headspace, the first 10 days are free, and then you have a to pay a US$12 fee, but it is really worthy. This Independent’s article brings another nice choices for you. So, Good Luck and I hope you really take part on this practice!",2015
WorryBox,"Take a moment to look around. Maybe you’re on the bus, maybe you’re at your desk, maybe you’re waiting in line, it doesn’t matter — just look up and take in everything around you. It all seems perfectly normal, right? Just the world going on as usual? Great. Everything’s okay. But are things too okay right now? Do you ever look around, when everything’s completely normal, and wonder: Isn’t there something I could be nervous about? Yes, friend. Yes there is. How does WorryBox work? Every day you’ll receive a new box, and inside the box is an anxiety. Perhaps you’ve always wondered what having an anxiety disorder feels like. Maybe you just want to supplement the worries that you already have. Maybe your parents subscribed you before you were even born. With WorryBox, you’ll get a new apprehension, fear, doubt or inescapable feeling of dread every single day. Whether it’s a strange sound coming from your refrigerator, a work obligation on the horizon, or an uncharacteristic “hi…” text from your significant other, our supply of incessant, nagging thoughts is nearly inexhaustible. Get ready to be worried about everything. How does the subscription work? Every day you will receive a small, ornately-decorated box from a man in a raven-black overcoat. You will want to ask the man what his name is, but the words will escape you. He’s somehow indistinct, like a smudged screen. He seems able to appear anywhere, at any time, and he always disappears in a way that lets you know he’ll be back tomorrow. Shipping is included in the subscription. What’s in the box? Opening the box will release an anxiety — maybe one you’ve experienced before, maybe one that’s completely new to you — that you will immediately feel all the way to your core. The anxiety could be large or small, life-threatening of completely inane; either way, we guarantee you will experience a deep, uncompromising feeling of dread. In many cases, it will be all you can think about! Does everybody get the same anxieties? Not at all; your anxieties are completely tailored to you. For example, you may be incredibly extroverted, and the idea of worrying about a work presentation or a birthday party is completely anathema. That’s fine! For you, we may offer a deep-seated fear that people only enjoy your company when they can get something out of you, and this feeling will recur whenever you’re not in a crowd. If you’re already nervous about crowds, you may get that same fear — or, you may start to worry that there’s something wrong with you for not liking crowds, and this will compound the original fear, giving you double, triple, or even quadruple the feelings of panic. Or, you may just cut somebody off in traffic, and you’ll spend the rest of the day wondering if they’re going to follow you home, or figuring out how to apologize to them if you ever meet again. Anything, no matter how seemingly insignificant or unimportant, can start to feel like it’s the end of the world. What if the anxiety I receive doesn’t make any sense? We pride ourselves on finding innovative, unconventional ways to make you worry. In fact, we can guarantee that some of the anxieties you receive won’t make any sense at all. You’ve left your apartment hundreds of times without leaving the oven on, but what if this time you did? The barista at your coffee shop always smiles and says have a nice day, but today she doesn’t. Is it because you did something wrong? She’s her own person, who has had to deal with a million little moments to get to where she is, and is probably wrapped up in all of her own worries, hopes, and distractions — but is it possible it’s because she hates you now? Anxieties don’t have to make any sense, they just have to be convincing enough to burrow into your mind for minutes, hours, or days at a time. Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? We’re not looking at you like anything. That’s all in your head. How do I cancel my subscription? There is no way to cancel your subscription. Even if you make it clear that you don’t want to continue compiling anxieties, there’s no way to make them go away completely. You can move, you can shut your eyes, you can not open the door — they will always find you. We suggest finding a way to deal with your anxieties, rather than trying to cancel them! Have you considered your friends’ advice to “just ignore them?” What if I just don’t open the box? Ha, sure! G0 ahead and try that.",2015
On being alone with my Fear.,"Running. Blocking. Denying. Edging my way around the scarce brink, putting my hands out and stepping lightly around it, to treat it as it were a massive sleeping hydra-beast: stoic for the moment, growls and expulsions subdued — for the moment — yet powerful and sickeningly dreadful, even at rest. Be muted, be methodical. But most of all, be careful — lest my slumbering fear arise, and bring me to ruin. When I was younger, such uncomplicated things as being alone in a dark room were formidable exercises in terror. Any business in the late night emptiness of my parents’ house happened quickly, quietly, and with an ever building tension that climaxed as I would finish getting my cup of water or grabbing my book and tear a reverse path to my room with, on retrospect, an impressive combination of silence and breakneck speed. Indeed, each spooky venture repeated a distinct pattern frankly embarrassing in its simplicity: first, the debate of whether whatever minor midnight mission I was to partake in was worth leaving the inexplicably high-grade armor of my ratty bedspread — a debate that, in effect, only served to delay the inevitable choice to hit the big red button, go to DEFCON 1, and do it. Then, the furtive trek out to the hallway, menacing in its quiet normalcy. The pep talk as I approached the doorway to the kitchen to go for the sink, whose arched top almost appeared as a scrutinizing frown cast down on me from above my head. Repeatedly measuring rush distances and judging viewing angles, to determine the maximum possible terror I could feel if the wisp of a gaunt demon child appeared, and glared at me through black pits of eyes from the least illuminated corner across the room. Finally, as I’d reach up to the dish cabinet, open it with a betraying creak, and bear with a grimace the unavoidable clink of the cup against the other dishes on its way down from the shelf, the ring of the stillness slowly surrounding me would grow louder and more pressing. The stillness hated me for making such interjecting noises. It was outraged I intruded on its late night brooding while the people are away. As I turned on the faucet, I’d wait for it to manifest its anger, catch me over the relative din of the rushing water, and exact its horrifyingly unknowable — yet certainly malicious — aims against me. I could feel it gathering. It was waiting for me to complete my task — waiting for me to think I’ve made it — before it strikes. I would have to get back to my room. NOW. I could almost hear the chattering of dark things coming to claw at my back as I would scurry back to my hole. If the previous were to be described in a far-fetched biography of Daniel, I feel it could be reasonably executed as follows: As a boy, he used to scare as he went to get water in the middle of the night. I find myself slightly disgusted by the grandiosity over such a menial journey, such a bland and feeble ordeal. But, for all that it was, it was never a bland experience. Not for me. The fear was always real to me. The darkness. The angry, powerful, ruthless unknown. And, as I grew older, it didn’t just happen as everyone else was sleeping. No, this terrible, paralyzing darkness has followed me far from my parents’ night-drenched kitchen. And, as my mind matured, its menace grew. When I think it has left, it has only put on a new face. It knows me. It knows where my weak spots are. It knows I am weak. It knows it doesn’t have to do anything to me. It never had to. The beast need never wake, just slumber and bask in its majesty of despair, and let me grow weary as I mind it. It let me progress, but not grow. As a young boy I was as a Cub Scout, but not for long. I let it die. I was afraid of letting that become something more, or letting the day come when it finally, somehow, became too much. As an older boy, I stayed away from sports, and groups. I was convinced I wouldn’t belong. Maybe for a while, but not for long. As a teenager, I tied a leash around my emotions and expressions. I was afraid of that day when the darkness would tire of my hubris, and through its unknowable, malicious means, reveal simultaneously to the world and to myself some new way that I was in fact not enough, or not ready, or just, somehow, not. It allowed me to survive as I threw away accomplishments and occasions, persisting but never advancing. It sustained me only so we might continue our crooked symbiosis. As a man, the darkness had come to settle down. Drape itself on my shoulder ambivalently, as I shifted under its weight and attempted to tend to my daily life. It knows I can’t shoo it away. So, I’ve tried to ignore it. Pretend it’s not there. Surround myself with other things so it’s less apparent, and place trinkets atop its grisly head to make it prettier, before it lazily knocks them off. I’d say I was thinking of joining a martial arts class, but then never quite managed to go. I promised to look into the school choir, but got… distracted. I became a regular member of a gaming club, but time and friction discouraged me. I tried talking to that cute neighbor girl, and that other one, and that other, but was foiled by my nerves and insecurity. I’ve abused video games and the intermittent substance. I’ve sunk my time into escapism and vicariousness through the fetid cornucopia of the internet. I’ve ignored work, family and friends to instead take long walks and listen to music. I’ve pretended what I had done was what I wanted to have done, and half-heartedly washed my hands of it. I’ve tried to dull myself, hide the darkness in a haze so that even though I still knew it was there, at the least I had muffled its taunting. I’ve wandered away from my life so I could also leave the darkness behind… knowing it’d be sitting there, waiting with dogged patience for my return. But that’s all it really wanted. The darkness, the fear never had to do anything, because it knew I would do it myself. All this time, jumping at stillness, hiding from commitments, abandoning ventures, I’ve led myself groaning and whimpering down my own path of destruction. And the worst part has always been hearing the fear laugh and scoff with an acerbically ironic lack of actual noise, as I repeat my tragic pattern, time after time, stuck in a loop of infinite retreat. The pattern may take a new form along with the fear, but it rewinds and replays ever onward. Over time, I’ve found some successes. Some ways of living. In the metaphysical dungeon, where the hydra-fear-beast lays, I’ve found spots, niches in the wall around the chamber in which I can cram around the stinking hulk of it, and manage to find some sustenance. Perhaps read a book and feel some relative comfort for a time. Perhaps find a window to view the world beyond. But I could never fully trick myself into thinking that’s fully living, instead of accommodating the fear — my sinister symbiote. My parasite. After all the worrying, all the light treading, shuffling and compromising, self-delusion, dulling, one truth presses through the murk: the fear really doesn’t do anything. I mean, it’s scary right? Ugly bastard. And it always has that feeling about it, like it’s going to bite my arm off if I make a false move. It suggests, even at peace, like war is only a hairsbreadth away. But, there have been times when I’ve made a false move. Where I tripped over its tail. Where I, almost accidentally, left my fear behind and indulged in an obnoxious dance, or improvised a song about knights, or threw an extra joke in at a presentation. Quick things, happening less as a result of facing my fear, and more a result of momentarily forgetting that it’s sitting right there on my shoulder as I go on in front of everyone, drooling and growling directly in front of me in my cold dungeon as I sing out through my fleeting lack of apprehension in a decidedly not careful way. And while an impatient snort echoing through the dungeon would snap me into a renewed cower quickly enough, making me immediately forget those times and drop once again in thrall to the beast… I had lost no arms. I remained as I was. The beast protested, but did not move. It didn’t do anything. While I had stopped my dance short and ducked out of the crowd, brought the knight song to an abrupt cliff-hanger conclusion, hastened on to the next decidedly serious bullet point in my presentation itinerary… I felt good, not bad. I realize, in the darkness and the cramped space, I never really got a good look at that codependent-hydra-fear-beast. Indeed, that beast was and is more formidable than anything I can imagine, because I don’t know what it looks like. In the kitchen at night, it wasn’t really the vision of a gaunt demon child that scared me. It wasn’t the possibility of a burglar running up and brandishing a knife in my face either. It was… that I didn’t know what it was. An ever-towering shadow of unbounded possibility, terrifying because it represented something free of rules and constraints. Free to be unfair, to be cruel. To be impossible. Something that scoffed at sensibility and convention, trampled on logic and precedent. Something that confounded reason. Because of that, it could be worse than any demon child or crazed lunatic. It was those lurking unresolvable doubts, those marginal possibilities of tragedy, doom, improbable yet catastrophic failure. Tiny slivers of likelihood bulging out and expanding in my view to the point where they reign over and curtail the realm of my actions, simply by not being impossible. By not being proven that they really, practically, won’t occur. By not being proven that even if they do, I might be able to handle them. And I realize, I can’t give words to these supposed possibilities of doom and tragedy, because the possibilities don’t exist. Not really. They are the ever-towering shadow, cast by the beastly unknown, and nothing more. So, I must turn toward the beast. Walk up to it, not hide from it. Not peer at it through a split hand. Not walk around it to avoid waking it and somehow incurring unknowable, theoretical wrath from it being challenged, accepted, acknowledged. Forgiven. I need to look at it. Scrutinize it. Tread carelessly upon it. Learn its shape, its affect. If it stirs and lifts its head, let it stare back at me, as I stare. Ponder its stare, and read it for intention and weakness, despite the intimidation. Let the cold gaze chill me, and the stink of its breath bring me to nausea. Let the immediacy of its apparent wrath and cruel disdain wash over me. Let it be me, and the fear. Clear and crisp through the gloom in which it lives. Let nothing else stand between, or cloud the view. Let me not run away, or turn aghast. Be alone with it. Finally see it, feel it, perceive it, as I realize I was always meant to. Because then, even if it remains large, unsettling, and quick to anger… at least I know how big its claws are, how slowly it adjusts itself, how fleshy its underbelly is. Even if I can’t understand the fear, even if I can’t ever fully fathom the unknown, I can accept it for what it is. And acknowledge what it isn’t. Looking at the beast, I don’t know if I can defeat it. It is large. It is strong. But, I think, I can face it. Prove to it I have gravitas of my own. If I reach my hand out it may actually snip at me, get one of my fingers for my trouble. But I’ll live. Maybe, if I believe I can, I can join that salsa group. Maybe, I can try exploring my artistic side. Let myself be judged. See if I can lead others, instead of following fear. I can look boldly for my worth, and believe, ever so boldly, that it is there. But most of all, I can see what it feels like to move oneself, to trust oneself, to simply be oneself. Clear the parasite of fear that fills my mind to make room for better things. To fill my mind with what can be, instead of obsessing over what mustn’t. Maybe, if I believe I can, I can look that beast in the eye, hold its gaze, and then turn — calmly — away. I don’t know. It is still a massive, overwhelming thing, that beast of the unknown. But the more I see of it, the less I leave to the imagination. The less the darkness fills the gaps with ghostly obstacles. The less the shadow of unbounded possibility towers. Maybe one day, it’ll grow to respect me, as I’ve come to respect it. I hold on to the dream that, one day, I’ll step up and touch it. Then, maybe grab it. Take that uncertainty, that range of improbable possibilities by the ear and swing up on to it. Ignore its bucking protests. Take the stray wound in stride. Ride it out of the cold dungeon, down the hills of whimsy and confidence beyond, soaring out into the wide world of experience and magical consequence, borne magnificently on the raw power of my enemy, turned ally. It could happen. I do believe it could. I think it’s a distinct possibility.",2015
My Brain Off Meds,"Having vivid dreams that linger with you for the rest of the day. Themes of lost, abandonment, betrayal, sadness… all while desperately trying to keep everything together. Awake in extreme exhaustion. Look at the time. Did I just sleep for 12 hours straight? Why am I still so tired? Maybe I’m just catching up on all the sleep I’ve been missing. Let’s stay in bed a little bit more. I don’t want to get up. (I will have a 2 hour nap later.) I have so many things to do today, but I don’t want to do any of them. I feel too tired to do any of them. The thought of the pile of dirty dishes bothers me, but I can’t pick myself up to just go do them. Maybe playing a game will energize me. Except, I don’t even want to play this game. That’s weird… I usually love doing this. I want to do something, but it isn’t this. Crosswords, maybe? Damnit now I’m just fustrated that I can’t get any words. You’re so pathetic. No wait, that’s bad. Inner voice, please don’t be so cruel to yourself. Damnit, I’m failing at being happy. The first thought of any event today goes straight to negativity. Why am I such a negative person? I hate that I’m a negative person. Oh, here I go again. I’m being negative about being negative. Bad thoughts, please go away. You’re visiting more than usual today and it’s getting really hard to think of a positive thought for every visit. This is exhausting. What’s the point of talking to anyone? I doubt they care about me as much as I care about them. But I just want to connect with someone. Talking to them just doesn’t seem to satisfy that craving or be able to get rid of how lonely I feel. “What’s wrong?” He asked.“Nothing.”“No really, what’s wrong?”“I don’t know.”“Come on, tell me.”“I really don’t know. I guess it’s because I haven’t been taking my meds.”“Okay. Start taking them again.” Thank God I’m with someone that actually understands this. I hate that I don’t know what’s wrong other than a general feeling of I can’t make it through this day. I just need to get back to taking my meds. Though this probably means I’m going to be on meds for the rest of my life. That’s lovely. I’m never going to escape this illness. It’s so much harder to breathe. Oh, I know this feeling — an acute anxiety attack. Just what I need right now. I feel all over the place, like my life isn’t right. Nothing is right. Everything is all over the place and I can’t find my peace. I look disgusting. I’m so fat. So unattractive. Maybe I should start working out. But I’m so tired. I just really need to eat better. But I feel like crap. Some ice cream and pop will be nice right now. Anything with sugar really. I’m fat anyways, nothing I can do about it. What’s the point of going to work? I’m no good at my job anyways. My manager probably hates me and is judging my lack of skills and constant need to get days off. I probably won’t even pass my 3 month probation period. I hate that I disappoint people. Of course I would. Typical screw up. Oh lovely brain, now just play this reel of my failed past relationships — a highlight if all the horrible moments and feelings that came with it. Thanks brain, nice movie choice. I wasted another day. I can’t wait to go to sleep, except, I know the second I lie down on that bed, I won’t be able to sleep. I work opening tomorrow… this is going to be fun. Despite all this, I know tomorrow will be a better day. I have a solution and hope for recovery, even if that means it is in a form of pills. I just got to keep going.",2015
Your Fears are Bullsh*t,"Three months ago, I ate a small portion of Gong Bao Fish from a local Szechuan restaurant while sitting at my desk. After finishing my meal, I hastily snatched a fortune cookie from the table. I cracked open the lemon-flavored, cardboard cookie and pulled out the fortune, which read, “Remember three months from this date. Good things are in store for you.” This isn’t a post about dogma or belief or superstition. The fortune was mass printed by a company that, I assume, couldn’t care less about me. But out of a scientific sense of curiosity, I marked 3 months from that date in my calendar. Those 3 months came and went. And in those 3 months, 2 major events happened in my life. One event was outside my control and the other wasn’t. I was given the opportunity to stop working for other people. The opportunity didn’t present itself as a glorious, definable moment in which I gave my two weeks notice and switched to full-time contract work. Instead, the opportunity presented itself as a 2-month severance package. After the initial shock of losing my job, I began to recognize that what had happened was actually the best thing that could have happened. I had been given 2 months pay and the time needed to figure out how to make enough money on my own. So instead of beginning a rabid search for a new job, I spent time thinking about what I wanted from the months to come. I now have the opportunity to work when I like, for clients I like. I can write whenever I want, drink whenever I want, hike when I want, and generally do as I like, when I please. Which, if I’m being honest, is all I’ve ever really wanted to do. 2. Investing in a dream. Already terrified about my incredibly uncertain future, I then stepped so far out my comfort zone, I can’t even see it anymore. I bought a plane ticket to Iceland, which will kick off a 5-week trip to Central Europe. I’ll be in Berlin for a few days or a week and then I don’t know where I’ll be. I haven’t thought that far ahead. It’ll most likely have something to do with living in the German countryside, writing, and taking jaunts to Vienna, Prague, and the Austrian Alps as funds allow. There are a few reasons why I haven’t taken this leap until now. Money was, in my head, the biggest obstacle. In hindsight, there were several times I could have shifted my financial priorities and made it work. But even if I had found the money, I know I would have cited other “anchors”: jobs, pets, boyfriends, et cetera. I always had a reason why it wasn’t the right time. But it’s never the right time and there’s never enough money. So why not today? I’m terrified, but like all good things I’ve done in my life, it just feels right. What matters? If you want to do something, just do it. Take small steps everyday that position you to eventually take the leap. There’s really nothing more to it. Money means very little. I wish I had realized that ten years ago. When my student loans went into repayment (about $56,000), I was absolutely terrified. But I took a breath; I consolidated and got on a payment plan that I could handle. Weeks went by and I was still alive, I wasn’t living under a bridge, and I was OKAY. The next step was to leave my job, but I still needed a push. I needed someone to say, “I’m sorry, we just don’t have enough work.” Find the right people who will say to you, “Yes, you can do this.” I know if I hadn’t found those people, I wouldn’t be writing this and I wouldn’t be planning my first overseas trip. I would still be letting all my bullshit fears convince me to do the exact opposite of what I wanted to be doing. I spent years thinking I had to be a certain person. I spent years telling myself why I couldn’t travel and why I couldn’t write full-time. I was wrong. I was so, very, very wrong. I’m the most scared I’ve ever been about my future, which is saying a lot, because it’s always been my greatest source of anxiety. But in addition to being the most terrified I’ve ever been, I’m also the happiest. So, remember three months from this date. Good things are in store for you.",2015
this just in: guns ???? ? ?????????,"I like to think I’m not afraid of much. I have been fairly adventurous in my short time as an adult. I’ve jumped out of planes and hiked mountains and floated rivers I didn’t know existed and taken trips alone, hundreds of miles away. I’ve left everyone I know, I’ve moved out of my hometown, I’ve made new friends, I’ve fallen in love, I’ve nearly finished two degrees. I’ve gotten piercings and tattoos, and I love the thrill of doing things I’m not sure about. I feel fulfilled, like I’m living the life I want to be living, and doing things that make me feel alive. But let me tell you a thing, reader. My boyfriend brought me with him to a gun store on Saturday, and I had a full-fledged, very real panic attack. And I learned something new about myself. I am afraid of guns. Nay — I am bone-deep, shaken to the core, in my very foundation, terrified of guns. People get killed by things I’ve done and things I do every day all the time. From the inherently dangerous — my parachute could have failed and I would have plummeted to my death out of that plane — to the everyday: a knife slips in the kitchen, my car brakes fail, I run a red light, I discover a severe allergy. People fall in the Grand Canyon. They slip and break their legs on a hike and can’t get to help. They get bit by something venomous in an unfamiliar river. They forget to secure their food while camping and get attacked by a bear. They trip going down the stairs and break their necks. Accidents happen all the time, right? But none of these things are specifically designed with harm to others in mind, and guns are. Guns are tools designed to threaten, harm, and kill. I have never been interested in firearms. Prior to Saturday morning, they lived only in books and on screens and in the hands of police officers. Apart from my dad’s hunting…rifle? shotgun?*— which I had only seen twice before in my entire life — a gun was an entirely fictional thing, inhabiting a world separate from the one in which I lived. Tools for characters in other lives. I don’t know the mechanics of them, I don’t know the differences between calibers of bullets, I don’t know anything about what is legal, I don’t know the process for buying a gun, I don’t know anything. I’ve basically been going about my life as if guns did not exist in the real world, and it’s served me just fine. Prior to Saturday morning, I had never held a gun in my life. Despite my boyfriend’s opinions and arguments, I believe owing a gun inherently invites more danger and violence into one’s life. In my initial bout of fevered Wikipedia research, and in the ensuing weeks, I read that people who own guns are 2–3 times likelier to die from gun-related incidents than the rest of the population. That links to an article — here’s another good one, and a few of the studies they cite. One study even found that people who use any other weapon besides a firearm for defense are less likely to be harmed. I have read these all, and more, from both sides of the issue. My opinion has also been informed partially by Michael Moore’s infamous documentary, Bowling for Columbine, and, obviously, a lifetime of conditioning against them. Don’t touch them, stay away from them. That’s dangerous. I do not believe in the constant need for “personal protection.” I do not feel safer with guns around. I feel less safe. It’s not that I think that people who own guns are all trigger-happy idiots in confederate flag boxers, or anything. Plenty of average, rational people are also gun owners. I know quite a few people who go shooting as a sport. I do think there should be a bit more of a process for buying one — which, I know, will not stop black market sales or crime, I’m already more likely to be threatened by an illegally-acquired gun than a legal one, get off my back— because as it stands it’s easier for me to buy a gun than it is to get a credit card.** Hear me out, though. I do not want a gun in my car. I really do not want a gun in my house. To me, a lifestyle in which a handgun looks like a solution is a lifestyle diametrically opposed to the world and lifestyle I have experienced. Let me rephrase: I have never wanted or needed a gun to feel more secure. This is not how my boyfriend thinks. He sees a world where guns are another part of life. Where you are inevitably going to face a situation with one, and you might as well be able to “meet force with force” and “get out alive.” Where you should have the same toolkit and skills as your enemy. Where there might just be an “enemy” everywhere. And he wants me to conquer this fear. I disagree with him on this. I don’t think that I am ever going to be in a situation that warrants gun use. If I were, even if I had the proper training and experience, I don’t think I would ever actually USE the gun…assuming I can overcome my phobia in the first place. And, don’t get me wrong: I don’t want to be this afraid. When we walked into the gun store on Saturday, my brain shut down. I couldn’t make eye contact with my boyfriend, or with calm, helpful, professional Michelle, who talked us through the Glock 42 and the array of revolvers she thought were best suited to answer my boyfriend’s questions. After I picked up each of these and answered a few of his questions about which feels better in my hand, which trigger was most comfortable to pull, whether or not I liked the laser feature on that Ruger, we thanked the woman and he got me out of there very fast. The entire time, my voice shook and I mostly remember focusing very hard on Breathing, Not Crying. We were probably in there for fifteen minutes, tops, but three days later it still feels like a lifetime. We sat on the steps outside the shop and I got lost in a panic attack. Whatever pieces I’d been grasping to hold together while we were inside had completely shattered. I honestly don’t remember being that scared ever before in my life. I sat there and cried for a good long while. He held me and talked me through it, and we got soft serve afterwards, and then spent the afternoon playing Super Mario Bros with his younger siblings. Sometimes the simple things really do help. We’ve been having a lot of conversations about our views and opinions for the last month or so, but going to the store with him finally made it real. I’ve been trying to process the situation ever since, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m more afraid of the guns themselves than of the potential of being in a situation where I’d ever possibly need one. I’m not scared of what the world is going to throw at me, but I am scared of handguns. This is the only time I have completely lost my cool in a stressful situation and been unable to collect myself.*** The fear kind of feels like it came out of nowhere; perhaps it did, but perhaps I’ve just never had to confront it before. If this is how some of you genuinely feel about spiders, I’ve got your back. I get it now. My boyfriend is going to buy a gun for himself at the end of this month. Not necessarily because he finds it essential, or for “home protection,” or anything, but because he wants one. I think that’s valid, even if it does scare me. Even if the last one he had literally blew up in his hand. Neither of us can set ultimatums in each other’s lives. He cavalierly talks about being a federal firearms dealer after he retires. If he is going to keep guns around, and it looks like he is, I want to be able to interact with them coolly and safely. It might take me some time, but I am going to get there. I will learn with him and take a safety course (or two, or three). If it seems right after all that, I’ll go through the concealed carry process with him, like he wants. Whatever it takes to clear the white noise out of my brain and stop the hot sting of these unnecessary tears. Our conversation will continue. I still believe guns make people less safe. I still do not see the need for them in our cushy, padded, everyday suburbia. I still absolutely do not want to own one for myself. But, y’know. Know your enemy. Use your fears as tools to grow. I’m going to end this with my favorite quote. I continually find it applies to every situation in which I’ve found myself unsure. -Robert A. Heinlein I’m very, very unsure. UPDATE 8/3: footnotes: * and I realize as I type that I don’t even know if it’s a rifle, or what that really even means? Sorry, Dad. I’m sure you told me at one point.** I keep getting denied for currently having no credit. You have to have credit to get credit, which is annoying me to no end. I’m just trying to be fiscally responsible, here, America. I have a Suze Orman book on my tablet and everything.*** Have I partially lost my cool before? Sure. Ask my mom about my first experience in an MRI machine. With regular life stuff, though, mostly I keep things under control.",2015
A life on the edge: My journey with anxiety,"I’ve been thinking about writing this for a while, but have been debating for months if I should, and how much I want to share. And thinking, of course, of what’s the point, what is the message I want to convey and why am I writing it. As of this first paragraph, I’m still not set in the what and the why. Hopefully by the closing lines I’ll have decided. I have been dealing with anxiety for almost twenty years. The official diagnosis I have is Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Essentially this involves having a disproportionate level of anxiety and worry about just about everything. Work, social situations, relationships, health. This definition fits for me. I’ve worried, disproportionately, about all these things. Over and over again. A diagnosis is helpful for understanding what is happening to you, and figuring out a treatment plan, but it doesn’t illustrate the impact anxiety can have on someone. In terms of daily life, anxiety is something that has been with me constantly, and consumes a lot of my energy. As much as I don’t like to think about it in these terms, it is something that has shaped my behaviour, my outlook, my choices and even my health. Anxiety causes me to think and over think, everyday, about almost everything. A lot of times, this turns into worry, which often is unfounded. I worry about all sorts of things, most of which have no basis in reality. The worry gets out of control. It comes in waves, sometimes when I’m in a period of acute stress it gets really bad, other times it’s way more manageable. The worry is excessive, and it is absolutely crippling. I’m currently on medication which helps turn the volume way down on this, and I’m thankful it’s been effective. Despite the medication, one of my most frequent rituals to deal with these thoughts and worries still pops up. It involves trying to break down the issue I’m experiencing anxiety about into a logical, rational and linear thought process. I think about the situation and its potential outcomes (starting with the worst case usually). I do this over and over and over again. It’s embarrassing how much I have to repeat this. I think it’s my way of trying to make the anxiety make sense to my logical mind. The problem is anxiety is emotional, and often doesn’t make a whole lot of logical sense. This ritual has spread over the years from just me in my head or out loud when I’m alone, to involving my partner. I make him talk over these things with me. I ask for his reassurance. Repeatedly. I know his answer and response won’t change, but I make him go over it with me again and again. I feel so bad about this, I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for him. I know he just wants to help and make me feel better, and I’m so thankful for him being there to support me, but I have a lot of guilt about my anxiety affecting him and our relationship. Thankfully medication has turned the volume down on this a lot too, but it does still happen when things do get a bit too much for me to deal with on my own. In the past, I’ve made decisions to accommodate my anxiety. I’ve declined social situations because I didn’t want to risk having an ‘episode’ of anxiety with friends, and end up embarrassed. I used to pick elective courses in school that I thought wouldn’t have presentations, which used to cause me so much stress. I have had constant worry about being late, which has made me very punctual, even to this day. And I can only imagine how less than confident my anxiety has made me appear in the past to others. These things have improved over the years, thanks to medication, therapy, self-reflection and just growing up. Then there’s the panic attacks. Panic at the disco. And campfire. Panic attacks are fucking terrible. They’ve been the absolute worst experiences of my life. Generally, for me, they start with a feeling of being on edge. I feel like this a lot, so it’s not necessarily unusual, but it quickly escalates. Like in seconds. All of a sudden I feel heavy. My attention is drawn to my breathing, and how it’s getting harder and harder to catch a breath. I just can’t get enough air into my lungs. This creates even more panic making everything worse, quickly. I’ll start to sweat, and feel overheated. Blood rushes away from my head, making me dizzy. My sense of space alters, and I feel like the walls are caving in on me. I think everyone is looking at me and that I, and my panic, have become the centre of attention. I have an overwhelming feeling that I need to get out of where I am. I need to go outside, and get away from other people. There’s an impending sense of doom. It’s awful. I don’t even know how long they last, because my sense of time is so skewed. The worst is probably a matter of minutes, but it feels like an eternity. Even after the initial panic dies down, the residual effects last for hours. I usually don’t fully recover until the next day. I have actually thought I was dying. Not metaphorically, but actually in the last couple minutes of my life. I don’t remember the first panic attack. It happened around 2002. There are two that stick out from this time. One was when I was away at college. The night started out fine, at a friends place for drinks. Then we went to a local dive bar. By dive bar I mean a place a group of queer college kids probably weren’t welcome, especially back in 2002. As soon as I walked in I felt off. I couldn’t even go to the bar to get a drink, I just had a rush of fear. The symptoms started, and I had to literally run out. I don’t remember the run home, but I do remember crashing onto my bed and crying. I don’t even know what set it off, perhaps the environment, or maybe there wasn’t a reason. Anxiety isn’t a rational or logical thing. The second instance from that time was in my hometown. I was at a local hippie music camping event on the outskirts of town. For those of you who know me, hippie’s aren’t my thing, but when in Rome, or in this case, Muskoka. It was probably 2 in the morning, there were guitars and campfires, and joints. I smoked a bit of pot, but not what I thought was an excessive amount. Within a few minutes I got that on edge feeling. I thought I was just a bit too high, but it got worse. I felt my heart pounding. I remember mentioning it to someone and they were just telling me to ‘chill’, that it will pass. But it didn’t. I had to get out of there. I left the camp, to walk down the road along the river in absolute pitch black darkness. It was crazy, but I had to not be there. It was probably about a 10km walk, maybe a bit less, but it felt like it took hours. I made it back to my parents house, and crawled into my bed. I was exhausted, and embarrassed. I also started to realize pot probably isn’t the best thing to be doing when you have anxiety. The next few years I don’t remember any specific panic attacks. I had started medication (more on that later) so I think my anxiety was controlled enough to minimize the panic. But eventually they started happening again. In 2008, I had what was my worst panic attack. Looking back, I had been dealing with a lot at the time. I was in constant fear of losing my job due to continuous restructuring that was happening. I was emotionally not in a great place, and probably a bit depressed. On top of that my cat had been really sick. I was sitting with her in the bedroom trying to get her to eat, which she hadn’t in days. Finally she ate a few kibbles, which made me feel so relieved. It was a small thing, but it made me so happy in the moment. A few minutes later I started to have trouble breathing. I actually didn’t think it was a panic attack in the moment, I really didn’t know what was happening, but I started to hyperventilate. I called my partner who was on his way home, and told him to hurry. When he got there I made him take me to the hospital. I was terrified. I still hadn’t realized this was a panic attack, I just couldn’t breathe. I was trying to communicate to the triage nurse how I was moments from passing out, but she just told me to wait in the waiting room. I thought, how do people not die waiting to be seen? It seemed crazy, I needed to be seen right away, I couldn’t catch a breath. In fairness, I was actually seen pretty quickly, but when you think you are only a few minutes away from death it’s excruciating. They took blood, x-rayed my lungs, did an ECG on my heart. The doctor concluded I was one of his healthiest patients that day. It was likely a panic attack. Holy shit. I’d had a panic attack that was so bad that I didn’t even recognize it as a panic attack because it was so much worse than any I’d had previously. After this, I went back on medication, which I had been on and off of at that point, at a stronger dosage than before. I never wanted to experience that again. The final bad year My last big bout of continuous and totally uncontrolled anxiety happened in 2011. I had been off of medication for about a year, and had been relatively stable. Things were going well. I was getting married, my dream Scandinavian wedding in fact. I was at a new job that I really liked, I seemed to be having a busier than usual social life, making new friends and we were excited about moving into a new home (although still a few years off). An incident happened in the spring of that year that I started to worry about. I am actually not going to share what what it was, but I will say my worry grew, and it was irrational. The worry actually began to control my life. I had to use my repeating ritual several times a day, for months. It was to the point I just felt nauseous when I was out, almost all the time. I would feel like I was going to puke whenever I ate in a social setting, so I started to just meet friends after dinner instead of joining them. I remember being at bars having a few drinks, feeling ok, then all of a sudden I need to leave, go outside to calm down. Not full scale panic attacks, but enough anxiety-driven discomfort to affect my daily activities. The wedding happened, and it was perfect. I was so happy. But this anxiety was following me the whole trip. I tried my hardest to dial down this with my partner, so he wouldn’t get upset on such a happy occasion. But of course, I needed his reassurance and he knew I was still going through this. I remember the tail end of our trip we went to Denmark and Iceland. This was effectively our honeymoon. On the flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen, which thankfully was only an hour long, I was so panicked I had to keep getting up to the bathroom. I thought I was going to puke, and every time I thought I was ok and went back to my seat I started to panic again. When we landed we must have waited for over an hour before I felt like I could make it in the cab ride to the hotel. My partner just patiently waited for me to say I was ready. In Reykjavik, we went for nice pasta dinner, but of course I started to get anxiety before the meal came that I wouldn’t be able to eat it. And it happened. After a few minutes, I needed to leave. Grabbing the food to go, we walked around a bit and settled on a bench on a hill. Probably a very romantic spot, but I felt awful, like I was ruining the trip. He was so supportive, but I knew it must have been so hard for him, and I feel bad about that to this day. It was on that bench that I decided once we returned to Canada I’d go to the doctor and get back on meds. The Genesis So where does my anxiety come from? I’ve of course spent lots of time reflecting on the roots of my anxiety in an effort to not only understand it, but to try to figure out how I can best deal with it. Let’s start with my parents. They both have, to varying levels, anxiety. Mental health issues are common in my family history. They each came from abusive childhoods, one physically and one filled with mental abuse and alcoholism, and this created what I can see now was lifelong fear. They lived like there was always something wrong, the unexpected bad thing was just around the corner, something bad was just a moment away. I get that their experiences growing up must have been terrible, and they did everything they knew how to try to deal with it, and create a safe environment for me to grow up in. But when both your parents are constantly on edge, it’s hard not to have it rub off on you. Then there was the fact that I was different growing up. I was a bit of an introvert, I didn’t play sports, I didn’t really fit in and had trouble feeling comfortable around other students. This got more intense when I was a gay teenager. I remember being on the main street of my town with a friend and this guy from my school, Mike, pushed me hard into a phone booth telling me what a “fucking faggot” I was. I was constantly called similar names by another winner named Rick. That went on for years, and there were others. A couple things about that. Obviously I was terrified in the moment being shoved into the phone booth. I didn’t know what else he was going to do, and I was pretty shaken after it. But I think the worst part was that it happened in front of a friend. I was so embarrassed. I wasn’t “out”, and of course everyone would have known or suspected, but I didn’t want attention called to being gay. Incidence like these created a sense of fear around social settings, and being around certain types of people. I remember feeling what I now know as anxiety when being in situations where these people would be, and even on a daily basis at school. This carried through for many years, until I was done college. Through therapy that I’ve attended in recent years, I also have identified another factor, which may be a bit of a stretch but it does feel like it fits. Because of my childhood and my parents constantly waiting for the next disaster, I think I developed a discomfort when everything was going ok. It’s like my anxiety starts to act up when there’s nothing for it to legitimately worry about. It creates worry round an irrational fear or situation that doesn’t exist. Who knows if that’s true, but it does feel right. My parents maintain there is a genetic factor. That this is the way we’re ‘wired’. Maybe. It’s probably a combination of all of the above, and additional factors I haven’t even thought of yet. Effective pill popping So how have I managed it? As I mentioned I’ve been on and off medication to treat my anxiety for years. The most common medication involves daily use of an anti-depressant from the Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) class of drugs. From what I understand they don’t fully know how this addresses anxiety, other than anxiety has something to do with serotonin levels in the brain. The drugs work. I have friends that frown on use of pharmaceutical drugs, others think its all placebo and part of a big pharma conspiracy. But the drugs work. Within a week I feel better. After a few months, I stop having panic attacks, things seem calmer. There is no placebo effect. The drugs are altering serotonin levels in my brain, and it’s reducing my anxiety. And I am so thankful that they exist as a powerful tool to help me manage my anxiety. Drugs are not without their faults. I’ve been on 4 different SSRIs over the past 13 years, 3 of which ultimately had unacceptable side effects for me. This is part of the reason why I went off them for long periods. I would get to the point of feeling better, and decide I didn’t want to deal with the side effects anymore so I’d stop taking them. Like clockwork, a few months later my anxiety would start to creep back. First slowly, and then eventually get back to affecting my daily activities again. The most recent drug I’ve been on since my 2011 experience. It’s actually fairly side effect free, and I’ve found a dosage that seems to be effective. It’s honestly such a relief to have had my anxiety controlled for the past four years. I also started therapy in 2011, which helped me unpack some of the causes of my anxiety, work out some of my irrational fears, and develop non-pharmacological techniques to deal with and reduce anxiety. It helped. I went for therapy for about two years, on a weekly basis, most of which was focused around my anxiety. Current State I am in a much better place lately than I have been since I can remember. The medication works, I have started to understand some of the root causes, and I am able, for the most part, to live a normal daily life. I still have periods of anxiety, especially when stress builds up in my life. I still have my repeating routine, but even my partner has said I’m doing this so much less than a few years ago. The thing I need to remember is that while things are good now, that can change. Anxiety is something I’m always going to have, and I’m going to always have to work to keep it under control. It can come back at any point, and I’ve learned that it can spiral out of control really really fast. The What and the why Back to what’s the point of all this? I want to say that I’m helping combat stigma by sharing my story, and I guess there’s some of that in why I wanted to write this. But as I have spent my entire Saturday composing this, I actually think this has been more therapeutic for me than any other reason. Reflecting on my own experiences, reminding me of what things used to be like and being so appreciative for where I’m at now is actually a powerful exercise. And of course reminding myself that things can go back to how they used to be at anytime, and that I haven’t finished dealing with anxiety by any measure. I guess this piece of writing really was more for me than for you. So thank you for helping me, and if you got something out of this too then that’s all gravy.",2015
Curing My Classroom Jitters,"And as usual, I freaked out the entire ride to school. Will they understand the point of the program? Will they learn anything from me? Am I a good enough teacher? Will I get fired? Lose funding? What if I’m the absolute worst teacher ever and have nothing to offer? You’d think after almost twenty years of teaching, these thoughts would fade — but nope. Like so many others, I’ve battled anxiety for as long as I can remember. It’s worst for me in social situations. And what is more socially interactive than a teacher in front of her class? The hardest part is the night before teaching a class for the first time. I worry, shuffle papers as I prepare my materials for the next day, set my alarm, check it, double check. I almost didn’t make it to class that day at Polivalente. Halfway there, my hands went totally numb, and I started panicking so badly I thought I was getting a migraine. If I get a migraine, that’s it, I told myself. I have to cancel. It would not be the first time I had thoughts of skipping class. “What’s causing this?” asked my husband, my teaching partner for this particular course. I had no answer. It’s not always that bad. Most times, I muscle through. Or the anxiety melts into a background hum. The cold prick hurts at first, but as I shift my focus to class discussion or my students’ excitement as they realize they have something of import to say, I relax and begin to enjoy it. What makes me so anxious? Standing in front of a class is an act of utter ambiguity. You must follow the rules while offering something new and exciting. You can prepare all you want, but you will never be ready for every question. You can never meet every contingency. And you will rarely receive adequate support for your troubles. I hear my concerns echoed in the halls and classrooms of many fellow teachers. Victoria Barrett, who teaches composition at Ball State University finds herself navigating a minefield of administrative overwhelm and disrespectful students. “Over time, I’ve had enough experiences with students behaving inappropriately that I experience a general level of anxiety every time I walk into a classroom,” she said. “This leaves me constantly unsure of how to do my job, how to behave in the classroom, how to respond to students. I’m a veteran at this — I’ve just finished my fourteenth year, if you count grad school — but I still see these disparities and second-guess myself pretty constantly.” Lauren Patrus, a teacher near Atlanta, Georgia, struggled with anxiety stemming from what she calls the high-stakes environment of the middle school where she taught. “They were not supportive,” she recalled. “Not at all gracious. The administration would randomly pop into our rooms and typically have negative feedback for the kids and/or the teacher, which simply made me feel like we were always being watched.” Even when a school administration has the best of intentions, they are often pressured by state standards, national standards, and parents to perform in tests and other measures. They, too, are overwhelmed and often lacking the resources needed to serve the staff. When your livelihood hinges on performance, how do you cultivate the kind of energy needed to go beyond the very basics of teaching? How can one face classroom pressure, respond to questions, impart information and try to educate students with a pounding heart, sweaty hands, and short of breath? In one sense, it’s no wonder so many teachers burn out, take a break, or find something else to do. II consider myself lucky. Teaching has never my sole source of income. I fell into it by accident when one of my graduate school professors offered me a chance to teach poetry workshops at a local middle school. While horrified at the idea of group of people watching me talk, the comfort of knowing I’d be working under the eye of an experienced classroom teacher made it feel doable. On the first day of class, I walked into the tumultuous noise and rumble of thirty-five preteens stuffed in a room made for twenty. They were shouting, laughing, even dancing — and I felt invisible. Their teacher urged me forward, like some nervous birdling at the edge of a nest. I cleared my throat, knowing full well my soft voice would never pierce the upper levels of their din. One girl in front noticed my efforts “Everyone, everyone!” she shouted. “Shut the hell up. Teacher wants to start.” It surprised me how easily they accepted me in that role, and the noise tapered slightly. Just then, my throat tightened. A prickly heat spread across my neck, down my arms, into my hands. My breath quickened. Oh, how I wanted to run, but to where? “Breathe. Breathe,” I ordered myself. I had to keep moving forward. Breathe. I reminded myself of the curriculum I prepared. I had lessons to teach, handouts to share, and poetry to read. “Trust yourself. You can do it. It’ll be ok,” I told myself. This has since become my mantra. “Be prepared. Trust yourself.” Finally, through the fear, I managed to squeak out a weak, “Let’s get started.” Magically, they heard me. I cleared my throat again and louder. “All you poets raise your hands in the air!” I shouted as loud as I could, my arm lifted to join theirs. Two hours later, I left the building completely exhausted but exhilarated. In spite of my fears, I guided a group of students — described to me by their principal as “not capable of too much” — through Langston Hughes, Rumi and Shakespeare. It was impossible to remain anxious as I felt their excitement and pride in the poetry they wrote and shared with me. Since then, I have continued to gravitate to short-term teaching jobs. They don’t pay much, but they afford me a flexibility to pick and choose how I teach. I’ve taught writing, photography, technology, and literature. My classes take place in theaters, juvenile detention centers, public libraries, and sometimes on the streets. It’s always changing, always an adventure. I’m currently teaching a videography course in northwest Argentina, for students in neighborhoods hit hard by poverty, crime, and drug abuse. And just like clockwork, my anxiety has resurfaced. It’s not the neighborhood that concerns me, but rather learning how to teach in a second language. My Spanish is good: I can buy food, find a place to live, and even discuss philosophy. But teaching requires a level of openness I’d never before experienced. Sometimes, I simply don’t have the words I need, and I’m left literally speechless. I notice students looking at each other. They shuffle in their seats and check their phones — while I contemplate, once again, making a break for the door. One day, it hit me. Why not ask my students what to say when I get stuck on a word? They’re the Spanish experts in the room, and they probably know more English than they realize. It could be a moment for us to learn from each other. Somehow, in one moment of anxiety, I happened on a method I’ve used ever since. It requires leaving myself vulnerable, but such vulnerability goes a long way in helping me teach through anxiety. When you believe teaching is a one-way venture, the entire responsibility falls on teacher. When I teach in that rigid style, my students will test me, push my boundaries, bend my rules. But the minute I let down my guard and allow the relationship to be reciprocal, we begin to navigate the boundaries of the classroom together. In a weird way, my anxiety has forced me to become vulnerable in front of students, which in turn has made me a better teacher. When I close the door and look out to those faces, eyes raptly at attention, a wave of warm calm washes over me and I begin to speak.",2015
Can meditating help me overcome anxiety?,"First, you might examine the language that describes your goal. Instead of “overcoming anxiety,” consider changing it to “deal more skillfully with anxiety.” This is important, because if you believe you’ll completely overcome something by meditating, you’ll be frustrated at the first sign of anxious thoughts, emotions, and sensations. You will most likely judge yourself for not being successful (“I was trying to get rid of my anxiety, and here it is again. I’m a failure!”). And, you will probably lack the motivation to continue your meditation practice. In short, the view of overcoming or “getting rid of” leads to quick setbacks, which cause you to stop your practice before you have a chance of realizing benefits. Second, what does the word “goal” mean to you? Are you rejecting your present circumstances, driving towards a future vision of yourself, and pinning your happiness on whether or not you achieve that vision? If you’re wishing your circumstances are different than they are, this will likely give rise to more anxiety and make your condition worse. Instead, accept things as they are. As an old teacher was fond of saying, “It is what it is.” I know, it’s easy to dismiss a sentiment like this — especially when you’re dealing with anxiety or other struggles. But, fully embracing “it is what it is” can lead to immediate relief if you understand it as more than an empty platitude posted on social media. The present moment is the product of billions of years of causes and conditions that brought it into being — most of which you have no control over or any insight in to. No amount of lamentation or mental drama will change it; to the contrary, those only lead to self-created suffering. The only thing you can do, right here and now, is make mindful decisions and take skillful actions, which become part of causes and conditions that give rise to the next present moment. Begin by strengthening awareness of what’s happening in your mind. See what your anxiety is composed of — is there doubt? Fear? Worry? What are the physical sensations? Rapid breathing? A racing heart? Tension in your neck and back? Notice what’s there, but don’t try to fight it — simply let it be as it is. And then, move your attention away from it. This may be uncomfortable at first — we tend to feel we are “giving in” if we aren’t fighting. But, that’s not the case. Those thoughts, emotions, and sensations are there whether you fight them or not. If you do fight them, however, you are indulging them: you are giving them fuel to persist. This fuel turns the wheel of your suffering, giving rise to more thoughts, emotions, and sensations. And, before you know it, you’re being dragged into a “pit of despair” where your anxiety, fears, depression, and other struggles completely take over. When you let everything be as it is, however, you’ll discover things usually aren’t the problem your mind makes them out to be. And, your mind does create problems — it takes everything you experience (a sight, sound, smell, taste, sensation, thought), labels it, assigns a feeling of pleasant or unpleasant to it, and weaves it all into stories that constantly play in your head. This process conditions your behavior, and you habitually act with desire for things that deliver pleasant feelings and aversion towards things that deliver unpleasant feelings. As a result, your life is characterized by a constant state of dissatisfaction that keeps you chasing after “this” and running away from “that.” Even worse, all of this happens on autopilot — you, like the rest of us, are usually just dragged along for the ride. But, awareness shines a light on this process, and helps take you off autopilot. You can see the feelings, the thoughts, the emotions, the stories. They are part of an unfolding process, not an isolated event that looms before you, threatening your well-being. All of this mental activity is contingent on the causes and conditions that gave rise to it. And, all of it is temporary: it comes into being (arises), exists for a time, and ceases (passes)…provided you don’t allow your attention to get caught up in it. Provided you don’t indulge it, and give it fuel to persist. How do you do this? When you meditate, focus your attention on an anchor (usually your breath or a mantra). When those thoughts and emotions arise and you notice your attention is caught up in them, simply return it to your anchor. Notice and return, over and over and over. You are developing the skill of observing what arises and passes without getting caught up in it. And, as you develop this skill, you can begin transferring it to your “non-meditating” time. When you aren’t meditating (when you are going about your daily activities), focus your attention on the present moment and task at hand. When those thoughts and emotions arise and you notice your attention is caught up in them, simply return it to the present moment and task at hand. This is how meditation and mindfulness work. You aren’t overcoming anything, you’re changing your relationship with it. You are training your attention to no longer be held hostage by mental activity. And, you’re strengthening awareness of your compulsive mind, and the aforementioned process it goes through — the process that conditions your behavior, and ultimately dictates “who you are” and “what you do”. With practice, and the direct experience that comes from practice, you can begin chipping away at your habitual actions and reactions, and start bringing an end to the struggles your mind creates. Frequently Asked Questions: How do I just “let things be”? “Your thoughts about the situation cause you to suffer more than the situation itself” — what does that even mean? How do I get proper instruction in meditation and mindfulness? “Your inner narrative” — our 15-day meditation challenge — answers all these questions (click here to read about it).

The Long Drive — The True Story About Being a CEO,"When I started my first company, I couldn’t wait to give out my business card. It had a glossy white finish. It had rounded corners. Most importantly, it had “Zack Parker, CEO” printed on the bottom right. I was anxious to update my Gmail signature with my new title and add my new job description to my LinkedIn profile. I was young, naive and armed with a Vistaprint box full of 1,000 business cards. Fast forward a few years — I’m dealing with hiring/firing decisions, handling an audit from the IRS and hearing “no” from potential customers and investors over and over again. Those glossy white business cards no longer brought me the same fuzzy feelings that they once had. Being a CEO can be one of the most rewarding positions in the world when things are going well. You’re on top of the world, surfing a tsunami of swagger. However, when things don’t go as planned, your uncertainty quickly morphs into anxiety. The job of a CEO is about managing self-doubt, internalizing pressure and driving for countless hours thinking about your company. Alone. As I drive across the lower level of the Bay Bridge heading towards Southern California, I’m reciting my pitch to the various investors and potential customers I’m about to meet. As CEO, I’m perpetually in “pitch mode,” answering a barrage of questions about why our product needs to exist and who it’s for. I’m like a boxer defending himself against an array of punches. During these pitches, I mask the utter chaos inside of our startup in fear of being exposed as a rookie. If I let my guard down, then I’m unprotected and I’ll get knocked out. I’m always selling. Always pitching. As I head east on I-580, I call my mom and tell her a pitch that makes her believe my company will make me stable and secure. I call my teammates and tell them a pitch about when the company “takes off,” we’ll all be on a beautiful island somewhere drinking rum out of coconuts. I merge onto I-5 South oozing with optimism and I run through my pitch to investors about how our company goes from a five-person team to a $100 million business. Each pitch is delivered with complete conviction. My guard is up. In Southern California, I’m pitching from sunup to sundown. It’s like being on a job interview for days on end. Before each pitch, I remind myself that this could be the one. But sometimes I just want it all to stop. Cold turkey. I want to be real and tell everybody how terrible the last few weeks have been and how I’m doubting if there’s even a need for our product in the market. However, I never share this with anybody in fear that I might be venting to the wrong person (my next potential investor, customer, hire, etc.). So rather than admit this truth to anybody, I decide to internalize it and let the pressure build. The pressure gains momentum right in the dead center of my chest beneath my sternum. It has the type of momentum I want my company to have. On my lonely 8-hour drive back home on the I-5, I think about why I’m coming back from Southern California empty handed. I fill up my gas tank at Arco and get In-N-Out Burger in Santa Clarita and look around at all of the happy people eating their Double-Doubles. I tell myself that their contentment from the cheeseburgers will be short-lived because they too are battling with their own internal struggles and doubts. I bet their guard is up about something. As I slurp my milkshake down, I think about how creative and driven I’ve been with my business development, but the doors just don’t seem to be opening. Back on the road, the smell of cow manure singes my nose hairs and I think about all of those empty promises and unsigned contracts. Every CEO knows these dark days. If you don’t hear about them, that’s because they too are in “pitch mode.” I drive straight on the I-5 for hours and listen to podcasts about successful CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, Sir Richard Branson and Elon Musk. They make it seem so easy. So glamorous. They’re like ducks on a pond that look calm on the surface, but underneath the water I’m sure they’re paddling like hell. They all share the story of their “breakthrough moment.” I pass the Altamont windmills on I-580 and I tell myself that my moment is coming. Days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months, until my confidence lays limp in the gutter. The same place those business cards will end up. Will I be a CEO again? Of course. The entrepreneurial game runs in my blood. I’m addicted to it. That pressure that drives me insane is the same pressure that propels me forward. When I find the next idea and the right team, then there’s no denying that I’ll jump right back in. I can’t wait to tell my mom that “the band is gonna make it.” I can’t wait to tell my teammates that “success is right around the corner.” I’ll be chugging my own Kool-Aid. I’ll be in pitch mode nonstop until those dark days turn into dark months. After months of preparation, I’ll once again pull off of the I-5 and approach my next pitch and look down at those three little letters on my business card and smile. I’ll pass that glossy white card with the rounded corners into the hands of my potential customer. All of my fears and doubts will have succumbed. Then, I’ll put my guard up and remind myself, this could be the one.

Embracing Fear After Grad School,"In 2009 I made my first appointment with a therapist. It took me several attempts. Picking up the phone, putting it back down. Discussing my options with a stranger on the employee assistance program hotline. Scanning the overwhelming list of providers, worried that I wouldn’t find a woman of color — someone who I hoped would “get” me without flaring up the already unmanageable anxiety I was experiencing. Since then I’ve learned a lot about my anxiety, including triggers and techniques for managing it. But this doesn’t always protect me. Over the past few years my anxiety has manifested itself less and less as panic attacks and more as chronic tension headaches. Ultimately, underneath it all is my fear of failure. Failure in that I’d disappoint my parents with my career choices and personal finance mistakes in my early 20s… Or that, as one of only three black women in my class, I’d become a stereotype with my poor academic performance, lose my scholarship and have to drop out of business school … Or, most recently, that I’d be fired from a fancy titled job that I wake up having to remind myself why I was even hired for and anxious to prove that reason to others. For a long time my partner had a list of affirmations beside the bed, one of which was a source of comfort for me through my own stress and anxiety during business school. It read: “The worst thing you feared never happened.” One of the tools I’d learned in therapy to manage my anxiety was to list all of the things I was afraid would happen, which would calm me down since the list was full of outcomes that could be resolved or were simply irrational. Her quote on the wall served as a far more succinct reminder that I *am* okay and will continue to be okay. And that’s what I keep telling myself. As I wrap up my first 90 days in a job that has demanded more of me than I’ve ever experienced, I know that I can handle anything that comes my way. That my resilience has already brought me through other challenges and has prepared me for what lays ahead. And most importantly, that the worst things I’ve feared have never happened. … Like this post? Subscribe for email updates from my blog: nikitatmitchell.com/subscribe.

How To Pull The Plug On Performance Anxiety,"By Hazel Gale, Cognitive Hypnotherapist & Performance Coach.More at hazelgale.co.uk, or Facebook, Twitter & G+. You should sign up to my mailing list here (I don’t send stuff often, but when I do it’s good) I’m no stranger to nerves. I competed in boxing and kickboxing for just under a decade. During that time I developed countless “coping strategies” to get past my pre-fight anxiety. I had easy ways to calm myself down in the days leading up to a bout. But when the time to perform arrived — when every fibre of my being was trying to find a way to get out of fighting — I found that acceptance was key. I accepted the intense arousal of my system as a necessity, and allowed myself into a state of almost otherworldly focus. At times it was like all but my opponent had been deleted. As if we were fighting under a thick, cold fog which muted the crowd and obscured all other information. And this worked… for boxing. When we feel threatened, certain cognitive functions shut down completely. The body readies itself to fight or flee. Blood rushes to the extremities and the part of our brain which can think in a more evolved and logical way simply switches off. After all, who needs to stop and draw up an Excel spreadsheet when being chased down by an angry mob? So although that fear fuelled focus seemed sensible in the boxing ring, such a heightened state doesn’t help if critical analysis or charming communication is required. My boxing self on the stage at a public speaking event would have been disastrous. Last week, after a year of learning to play in my cosy sitting room, I braved an open mic session with my guitar for the first time. As the performance drew closer, that familiar old feeling of anxiety started to ramp up. This time though, rather than letting the fog descend, I seized the opportunity to practice some basic mental strategies. What I chose was possibly the simplest visualisation technique in my repertoire. It took me no more than twenty seconds and the result was a wonderful (and actually quite startling) release. It was as if someone had pulled the plug on my anxiety and let it drain away onto the sticky bar floor beneath my feet. I’d like to show you how it’s done. First of all, you need to understand something about the elementary reasoning behind human thinking. Trevor Silvester, the creator of Cognitive Hypnotherapy, teaches us about “the algorithms of the mind”. This theory asserts that any thought can be broken down and understood as one of three basal calculations. These can be expressed in the form of simple equations: Equivalence: A = B, where the mind decides “this equals that” (i) Difference: A ≠ B, where the mind decides “this is different to that” Cause & effect: C > E, where the mind decides “this causes that” The technique that allowed me to relax and access my motor skills last week is called Spinning. It’s an NLP process which uses equivalence, visualisation and self-talk to enable a person to quickly change the way they are feeling. To get started, when I began feeling nervous in that dingy Peckham pub I conducted the following inner dialogue. These questions are designed to elicit a visual representation of something that is felt: Q: “If I could point to the position in my body where I feel the anxiety, where would I point?”A: “My chest” Q: “If that feeling had a shape, what shape would it be?”A: “A rectangle” Q: “If it had a colour, what colour would it be?”A: “Green” Q: “And if it was rotating, which way would it be turning?”A: “Counterclockwise” [See the note (ii) for a point about use of language here] I began imagining this spinning green rectangle somewhere just in front of my face (mainly because it’s easier that way). With this I had all that I needed to start taking control. I should note that I did all this with my eyes open. No breathing techniques or sleepy meditative states are required to visualise in this way. To anyone else it would have looked as though I was just zoning out for a moment. So, my mind had settled on the equivalence that my anxiety = this particular spinning shape (A = B). The shape, colour and direction that I chose are arbitrary. It could just have easily been a yellow sphere (and may well have been on a different day). The important factor is that my mind had than decided that this equation is true. Once the mind has settled on an equivalence, it strives to maintain that belief. This is how we develop phobias like “spiders = dangerous”. It’s how we form our personal tastes like “doughnuts = yummy”. And it also plays a part in our sense of identity: “I = charismatic/friendly/mean/sexy/logical…”. The unconscious mind decides where our attention is drawn at any moment. It will actually warp our perception of reality in order that it fits with what we consider true. This is how someone with body dysmorphia manages to maintain the belief that they are fat when to the rest of the world they look like skin and bones. We function based on what we know, and what we know is only ever what we have decided to be true in the past. The body dysmorphic’s mind has settled on the equivalence “I = fat/ugly”. Even though a more positive belief might sound enticing, the unconscious mind would still prefer to stick with the negative one purely because it’s known. Something familiar yet negative is safer than anything unfamiliar. Although far less serious, my rectangle = nerves equivalence is also (now) a known truth, so my mind wants to keep it that way. This is what gives us the chance to change things. The maths is simple. When you change one side of an equation, the same change must be applied to the other side in order for it to remain logically correct (or true). A = B. = . And so there’s enormous potential to be taken from our stubborn adherence to existing beliefs. If I can change something about the shape which equals my anxiety, my mind will do its best to make a comparable change to the anxiety. First, I wanted to test that the equivalence was set. I asked myself: “If that rectangle was spinning faster, would that make the feeling better or worse?” As I imagined the shape spinning more quickly, I noticed an increased surge of butterflies in my stomach. Great! This meant I had control. So next I visualised the movement slowing to the point of stillness, and then began to spin it the other way. I did this because if that shape turning counterclockwise equaled anxiety, then logically that shape turning the opposite direction should have equaled the opposite of anxiety (iii). And it did. This was the point when the magic happened; my shoulders dropped, my forehead relaxed and with a sigh of relief I let the anxiety go (or much of it, anyway). I chose to change the direction and speed because they are commonly effective variables. In NLP, these are called “submodality drivers”, you can learn more about them here). In theory, I could have altered any number of properties to achieve a shift; the size, the shape, the colour… Any change to the shape must mean a change to the feeling. All that’s left to do is to work out which changes mean the most positive difference. For years I have witnessed clients’ gleeful surprise over the efficacy of this simple technique. But for one reason or another I hadn’t ever managed to make it click for myself before now. Presumably, the fight nerves I had tried to dampen were just too severe. This was probably because I had allowed so much of my identity to get mixed up with it all (more on how I dealt with that here). It was quite wonderful to experience, firsthand, the power of the simple stuff I teach others. Almost — but not quite — as wonderful as the feeling of getting on a stage and playing a musical instrument for the first time.

The Most Toxic Relationship of All,"In one of the most psychologically recognized toxic relationships, one partner craves intimacy while the other becomes uncomfortable when things get close. As I’ve mentioned many times on this site, I used to be an Anxious Attachment type. Or as society would label me — needy. As a result, I tended to attract Avoidants because my intense expression of emotional intimacy supplemented their own suppression of emotional intimacy. Studies on intimacy buttons reveal that when our need for intimacy is met and reciprocated by our partner, our happiness increases. On the flip side of the intimacy coin, incompatible intimacy lowers both our happiness and satisfaction with the relationship. Our love buttons are unconscious biological and emotional luggage that have been filled by our past experiences. These past experiences form our emotional blueprint of how relationships are ‘suppose to work,’ and how we believe we should behave within those relationships. In my relationship prior to my health incident, I’ve never felt such an amazing high when my Avoidant partner finally came closer to me. But then I felt more unwanted than trash when she withdrew. I had never felt so pathetic and insecure in my life. I craved her love. She’d give me a kiss, only to turn around and bolt the other direction, by shaming me, by calling me crazy or ignoring me altogether. Our unconscious desires for closeness and intimacy in the relationship not only affected our intimacy, but impacted all of our conversations. Psychology calls this the Anxious-Avoidant Trap , or as I like to call it, Lost in the Sea of Love. I felt so alone, I might as well have been stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean I want you to meet Anxious Alex and Avoidant Alli. Anxious Alex met Avoidant Alli using Okcupid, a popular dating website. After the first few dates, they were happy with each other. Puppy love had taken over, and they adored each other. As the months passed, Anxious Alex wanted to spend more and more time with Avoidant Alli. He would come over after work and drop everything just to spend time with her. Like most anxious people, Alex was a boyfriend chameleon. Since Avoidant Alli had become a vegetarian, Alex hopped on the bandwagon too, even though he loved meat. The true motivation, unknown to Alex, is that his low value of himself and intimacy style causes him to accept new identities that his girlfriends already had. He does this partially because he perceives himself as low value and unworthy of love, and finds her lifestyle/value as more compelling than his own.But the other reason is his fear of being unloved. As a result he adopts this new value system as an emotional strategy in order to increase intimacy among his partner and him. His real motivation is fear, not love. As anxious Alex finds ways to get emotionally close, Avoidant Alli initially loves the attention. Eventually, both Alex and Alli become extremely close. I can tell you this feels amazing. It’s a natural high without the drugs. But over time, this closeness begins to feel suffocating to Avoidant Alli. She begins craving space and distance. As a result, she deactivates her intimacy button by withdrawing and behaving in ways that puts space between them. Anxious Alex recognizes this. He sees this distance as a threat to the relationship, and activates his intimacy button as a response. He wants to keep the intimacy high going. Anxious Alex’s mind becomes a targeted missile with Avoidant Alli as the target. Because of his response, Anxious Alex’s anxiety causes him to panic, to feel insecure — like the world is ending. This is all an illusion, of course, but Alex’s biological and emotional luggage is creating such intense emotions that logic doesn’t exist. This flood of emotion motivates Alex to behave in ways to get both Alli and him back up to that amazing intimacy high. So Alex starts texting her more frequently. He even shows up at her place unexpected. Alex’s dire need to resolve this emotional conflict causes him to use batshit crazy behavior. 4 text messages in an hour. Anxious Alex feels like his relationship with Avoidant Alli is fragile, so he begins to behave in ways to constantly prove to himself that she still loves him. Sadly, the emotional frustration from Alex’s crazy behavior and Avoidant Alli’s dire need for space causes Alli to react in hostile ways. She may shame Alex for acting crazy. She may tell him that she isn’t going to talk, text or see him for 3–4 days. This eats Anxious Alex alive. All he needed was for Avoidant Alli to get close to him, but the more intense the withdrawal, the more intense Anxious Alex’s thoughts are about making up for “his” mistake. This conflict causes Alex’s intimacy button to hit overdrive and focus on all the amazing aspects of the relationship — oh, the memories! He becomes flooded with regret for the relationship’s recent fight. So he attempts to work things out. Meanwhile, Avoidant Alli’s deactivated intimacy button causes her to focus on all of the bad things in the relationship. His crazy behavior. The amount of time he spends with her. His constant texting. Due to Alex’s narrowed perception on rekindling the relationship, Alex is willing to compromise his needs to keep the partnership working. Since Alli is contemplating ending the intimate relationship, she wants compensation for entering back into it. Alex still fails to address the initial conflict — his need for intimacy — and actually finds himself in a worse position than he was before the fight. He works hard to return to the initial, unsatisfactory status quo of the relationship and he tries to compromise more of his needs in hopes to make things work. Being Lost in the Sea of Love washes any hope of a better life down the drain. Over the years, Alex and Alli continue this vicious cycle until inevitability, Alli has enough and dumps him. With every clash of intimacy styles, the anxious person loses more ground. It’s frustrating and unfulfilling. This toxic relationship has no checks and balances. The Anxious Alex feels the need to fix the relationship and compromises to the desires of the Avoidant. These types of toxic relationships feel very one-sided from the anxious person’s perspective. The problem is the anxious person seeks closeness to their partner when something appears threatening, such as a relationship fight or jealousy, while the avoidant seeks separation and seeks distance. Intimacy differences are difficult to harmonize. This is why I suggest finding ya secure person to date. A fair amount of people assume that since Anxious Alex and Avoidant Ally really do love each other, then they’d find a way to work things out. As in the case of Alex and Alli, it is often times impossible to meet each other’s needs. In the typical trap, the anxious partner surrenders and accepts the rules imposed by the avoidant. Let’s say Anxious Alex and Avoidant Alli ended up getting married, despite their unstable relationship. Things may get worse because intimacy differences impact more than just the relationship. It’s much more than one person wanting to cuddle and another needing space. It’s reflected in opposed desires, assumptions and attitudes. This may range from the way you sleep with someone in your bed to how you raise children. Each new change in life (making money, becoming ill, having kids, or getting married) will manifest the differences and expand the gap between the partners even more. This conflict is never resolved, because the solution creates too much intimacy. While the Anxious individual will seek to work out the relationship problems, the Avoidant will unconsciously want to avoid it. This may lead the Avoidant to become more hostile or distant. Since the underlying issue is never addressed, the problem expands like a space balloon and causes a lot of unhappiness. When I was in this toxic relationship, I was completely blinded by love. I couldn’t see how bad it was. This is why I wanted to take some time to provide you some telltale signs of being Lost in the Sea of Love; I want you to have happy relationships, and intimacy is a core foundation of a happy life. 1) Can’t Leave Syndrome. You have this nightmarish feeling that the relationship is not right for you, but every time you think of leaving, the toxic emotional connection to the other person prevents you from doing so. 2) Roller-coaster effect. The relationship is never calm. At times, the Avoidant becomes available to the Anxious partner, allowing the Anxious partner’s intimacy button to relax and feel normal. This allows both partners to get close. As a result of getting closer, the Avoidant becomes uncomfortable, withdraws, and the Anxious is forced to drink a cocktail of negative emotions that lead to bat-shit crazy behavior. The Avoident’s drawing away has lowered the anxious person’s self-esteem and heightened their insecurity. Even if things do get resolved, both partners will be dissatisfied with the relationship. 3) Emotional Seesaw. Avoidants often inflate their self-esteem and sense of independence in relation to the extent of their partner’s incapability of being alone. This is why Avoidants don’t normally date each other — they never feel strong and independent in relation to someone who shares the same intimacy button as they do. 4) Stabely unstable. Although the relationship may last through the highs and lows, a sense of uncertainty always persists. Since neither partners find a degree of intimacy either is comfortable with, a sense of chronic dissatisfaction will lurk in the relationship. 5) Meaningless Fights. These types of relationships breed fights about things that shouldn’t be fought about at all. Typically these insignificant fights are not about the minor problems, but rather the amount of intimacy between the partners. 6) Your Partner is the Enemy. The Anxious partner will feel like they are getting treated worse and worse -because they are — once they become close to the avoidant.

Underneath it all,"The first house I lived in was a small bungalow on Madison Avenue in Pasadena. It was old enough that there was space for an icebox. We had a neighbor called Nan, an older woman whose wind chimes played gentle music when the Santa Anas came, and wild parrots watched over us from their perch on the oak and sycamore trees that lined the street. It was in that house that I learned to eat, a habit that remains with me to this day. I was carried from place to place in my parent’s loving arms. My dad, I am told, came home from work on his lunch break many days just to look at me, at what they had created. My mom rocked me to sleep late at night. This is not what I remember; we moved out of that house when I was one. This is what I have heard over the intervening twenty-nine years; these and other stories about what life was like in that bungalow in Pasadena where my dad was finishing grad school and my mom was working as a nurse. I am comforted by memories that aren’t even mine. The thing about anxiety is that it only afflicts you — or, on better days, accompanies you — when you are conscious of it. I think fondly of my days as an infant — how weird, because I cannot remember them — because those are some of the only days in my life when I was not anxious. I hadn’t started biting my nails or worrying about my career path or incessantly checking my bank account balance. I hardly had nails, and those that I did were cut for me! Earning money was beyond my capacity! Someone else took care of all of that for me. I am aware of how awful, indulgent, entitled, and strange it is to be jealous of your baby self. I would like to honestly say that I never think about wanting to be a child again, or feeling safer with my parents than on my own, because I am a married thirty year-old woman. But in some ways, I am still as pathetic and scared now as I ever have been. Anxiety is outsized fear combined with a sense of powerlessness, and the easiest, quickest fix for anxiety is comfort. I’ve written a lot about the idea of home. What makes a place home, and why? How has our cultural understanding of home changed over years and decades and centuries? I want to understand the answers to these questions, and in doing so, I want to feel more at home in my adult self. I want to be proactive and honest, self-assured and content. Contentment is, I think, at the root of all of this. In my parents’ old house — this one in Northern California — they had a soft beige couch that faced the backyard. It was called the napping couch, and though I rarely ever fell asleep on it, when I was my most anxious I would lay on that couch and feel the sun stream through the glass doors and feel a bit less overwhelmed. I didn’t want to leave, because I was convinced that my contentment was tied to being in that place, and that as soon as I left, I would be stepping back into anxiety. To settle can have two different connotations — to rest into something comfortable, or to cede your higher expectations for something less lofty. To me, I’m afraid that both are the same. When I make comfort my aim, I give up some of what I know I’m capable of. But what is the difference between comfort and contentment? I’m not sure I want to risk enough to find out. The house we live in now is smaller than that first house. It’s two stories up above San Francisco, with one bedroom and a view. There are no wild parrots, although a pair of turtle doves has been coming to visit us lately. I bite my nails every day and get angry with myself for not stopping. I fear never being good enough. I fear never being content.",2015
Porque eu queria ser Kamyla Matias,"“Lembro sim, amigo. “Ela fez um vídeo, esses dias. Ela dançando numa rua escura de uma cidade que eu não sei qual é. “Sim, amigo. Legal. Ela tá no Rio. Né lá não? “Não, amigo. Cê não tá entendendo. Ela fez um vídeo dançando com uns balões nessa rua e parece de madrugada. Dançando aquela música do Beirut que tocava numa minissérie da globo, como que é o nome? “Elephant Gun. “Ela dança a música de um jeito tão leve e você olha pro rosto dela e ela tá com um sorriso incrível. E lá, dançando mesmo. Na rua. De madrugada. Com balões. “Entendi… Ela trabalha com o que mesmo? “Acho que com teatro. Capitu! “O que? “Capitu o nome da novela que tinha a música. Era o dia da formatura do amigo. Eu sempre tinha que apressar o passo da minha mente pra acompanhar a dele que corria em rotações rápidas demais. Dificilmente entendia tudo que ele queria dizer, mas fingia perfeitamente bem. Fomos a uma pizzaria com toda sua família. Ele ameaçou que tiraria a camisa se alguém cantasse parabéns para ele. E ameaçou de novo. E uma terceira vez. Cantaram parabéns. Ele tirou a camisa. Do lado da avó. Mas quem surtou fui eu. “Amigo não amigo não amigo não”. Cheguei em casa e não consegui fazer muita coisa. Amigo tinha esse jeito de mexer com a minha cabeça de uma maneira muito esquisita e me colocar no limiar da racionalidade. O ato de tirar a camisa tinha a ver com a ressignificação do momento. Com respirar, não enlouquecer e tentar conviver com os protocolos sociais, ou apesar deles. Fiquei processando a situação enquanto pesquisava todas as variações possíveis até encontrar a kamyla em questão e seu vídeo, no facebook. www.facebook.com Há uma linha muito suave entre as coisas que queremos ser e as coisas que damos conta de ser. O vídeo é simples e não tem nada de mais, como eu já esperava, mas mexeu comigo em um lugar muito lá dentro. Na minha constante busca pela felicidade que nada mais é do que uma incapacidade de ser feliz. Na minha caretice. Eu sou careta demais. Passei a noite em seu facebook, vivendo sua vida. E naquele momento eu não queria ser outra pessoa senão a menina que dança com balões. Mas eu sou eu. Lucía está em Paraty. Não mandou nenhum postal porque hoje em dia as pessoas não mandam mais postais. Mas seguidamente vemos os desenhos que tem feito de todas as fachadas modestas e paisagens paradisíacas em tons de azul e verde. Parece feliz. Deve estar feliz. Veio da Argentina para Natal para vender cadernos que ela própria costurava. E de Natal decidiu ir pro Rio. Pra Paraty. Está trabalhando num albergue, eu acho. Não sei se ainda está. Dia desses embarcou num barco pra Angra dos Reis. Angra, já pensou? Pouco pragmática, Lucía jogava o pó de café usado no ralo da pia, o que hoje nos deixou com a maldita herança de um encanamento esclerosado. Desentupidor na mão, olho pra água acumulada na pia e lembro de Lucía. Mas Lucía está aqui: “Amiga ela entrou num barco e foi pra Angra. “Foi. “Amiga, sei não. “O que amigo? “Inveja. “De Angra? “Não. Não é de Angra. Nem de Paraty. É maior que isso. É o desprendimento. A leveza. O ritmo. É se permitir passar dias inteiros no processo de uma ilustração enquanto eu só consigo me demorar o mínimo possível. Eu queria ser assim. Mas, de novo: Eu sou eu. Sou a pessoa paranóica que fica tentando impedir o amigo de tirar a camisa no dia de formatura em frente à toda sua família. Eu tenho correntes que eu escolhi ter. Carrego o peso de escolhas que eu sei que são minhas. Uma estante ridiculamente abarrotada de livros e um coração cheio de âncoras que não me permite ir pra lugar nenhum. O mesmo impulso que me puxa pra fora é o que me joga pra dentro de novo e vai alimentando minha ansiedade em movimento perpétuo enquanto eu entro em parafuso. Eu sei que se eu quisesse ir, eu provavelmente poderia. Mas não. Esse não sou eu. Tudo me dói muito e eu prefiro conhecer, abraçar e expressar essa dor do que fingir que ela não está ali. Ainda não sei se isso é saudável ou não, só sei que está ajudando (eu acho). Tenho feito meus desenhos e tentado levar um dia de cada vez. Um dia de cada vez. Enquanto não posso pagar terapia, vou me valendo da minha companhia, traço e tintas para tentar me entender melhor. Hoje seria o dia de postar o centésimo desenho do Oi, Aure. Mas eu achei por bem fazer que esse desenho fosse algo menos gráfico. Esse texto é um desenho de quem eu sou. E não quero ser Kamyla Matias, ou Lucía Ruiz. Quero ser eu. E encontrar qual é a minha. Um dia eu chego lá. Por enquanto, aprendi a respirar fundo. Ajuda bastante.",2015
The Dude with Depression,"I’m not entirely sure why I’m writing this now. Maybe I’ve finally gotten to a point where I’m comfortable enough with myself that it doesn’t bother me as much as it used too. Maybe I’ve just been having a rough couple of days and am looking for some release. Anyway, here goes. Hi, my name is Will Hinchman, and I’ve got Depression. “Hi, My name is Will Hinchman, and I’ve got Depression” Well, that’s the short version of it. The actual diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder co-morbid with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. That’s right, not one, but two mental illnesses for the price of one. This seems like an overwhelming diagnosis, until you learn that it’s actually one of the most common mental illnesses world wide. I don’t know when it all started really. I didn’t have a bad childhood or anything. My teen years were the hormonal struggle that everyone goes through. But in my early twenties, I started noticing there were changes to the way I thought. Small at first. I found myself more and more dwelling on small things that should be shrugged off. I found it harder and harder to concentrate on things, especially work. I started to find myself sleeping less, and the sleep I did get was really poor. I started looking for answers when my boss pulled me aside one day to tell me that I was “fucking up” and that maybe I should go see a doctor about my sleep problems. So that’s what I did, and I went to a sleep clinic and had several sleep studies done to no avail. However, that same doctor who ran the sleep clinic also ran an “attention deficit” clinic. To him the answer seemed obvious, I had ADHD, of course! Cue Adderall prescriptions and the most productive work months of my life. I felt awful all the time, but I could focus and the lack of sleep was offset by the amphetamine salts I was shoveling into my head, but it was the solution, right? No, of course it wasn’t. The doctor was living “when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”. He was treating my symptoms and his “occupational therapist” I had to see to keep the scripts coming didn’t do much more than ask me if I felt any side effects and then would send me on my way. And once my body adjusted to the medication, I was back to square one. So, stopped taking the meds. I stopped seeing that doctor. Everything went back to the way it was before I started, except now, I was having thoughts of suicide. So I did the only thing I could think of. I self medicated. Whatever I could get my hands on. Mostly alcohol and tobacco. Sometimes heavier stuff. Anything to keep me from being alone with my thoughts. Sleep was evasive. I tried making life changes. I moved places. I left a job I felt was killing me and started somewhere new. Tried dating. Tried working out. Hobbies, Hobbies, Hobbies. Make new Friends. Travel 140 mph on a 40 year old motorcycle. Need to feel something. Anything. Just don’t stop. I was walking to grab lunch with some co-workers. We had stopped at an ATM because we weren’t sure if the place took cards, and as I waited for everyone to finish up, I felt my stomach drop, like I had just crested the hill of a roller coaster. Except I wasn’t. I was standing on flat earth, next to a parking structure. I was flooded with adrenaline. Reality phased in and out. I was able to keep it together enough to follow along to get some food, make it back to the office, throw the food in the trash and go home early, “sick”. When I got home, I cried. This was the first of many panic attacks in the following weeks. They became like a daily ritual. I could feel them coming on. My legs would tingle first, and then the back of my neck, then BAM! I would phase out of reality. I could work remotely at my job, and so I stopped leaving the house. I stopped showering. I still wasn’t sleeping. I went cold turkey on everything. No Alcohol. No Coffee. No Spicy Foods. Nothing. They didn’t stop. I finally found myself at a cross roads. I could go and try to get help or end my life. The morning after making the decision that I wasn’t quite ready to die, I did the only thing I could think of. I called my doctor. He and his staff were incredibly understanding. He stayed late that day to see me. He prescribed some stuff to help with the attacks, and referred me to a psychiatrist for longer term care. The psychiatrist gave me some meds, and then recommended I see a therapist. I see a very nice therapist. It’s a multi-tiered attack on my brain involving several professionals. I couldn’t have asked for more. And sure, things aren’t 100% fixed yet. I’ve backslid a bit recently, but now I know how to identify when that’s happening, and how to cope with it. I have a support team that’s ready to get down and dirty when I need them. One of the reasons that I’m writing this, is that there is an inherent shame involved with mental illness. Up until now, excluding people I pay for help, there are only about 8 people that knew. None of them are my family, because I didn’t want them to change the way they thought about me. I don’t want to bother them with my brain problems. The truth is, that’s a bad way to think of it. The reality is that it’s just a thing I have to deal with. You wouldn’t change the way you thought about a person, if they came up to and said, “Ugh, I got these seasonal allergies man. Bumming me out.” would you? To be honest, I don’t really know. This isn’t a story with closure. I’m going to continue to try and be the best I can be. I’m going to keep fighting. I just hope that maybe this will encourage others to speak up and not be afraid of might happen if they say who they really, or what they’re really going through.

How I Successfully Meditated for 60 Days With a Podcast,"I am going through an intensely tough period of my life right now. I am also using this time to deeply understand what triggers my anxiety and if there are ways to dull the response to stimuli , if not completely eliminate a response. In this quest, I spent insane amounts of time by myself but have been unable to establish a meditative or a contemplative practice without some extra help. I tried several guided meditations on Youtube, but none of them seemed to have an element of consistency or gradual progression. The painful search for the right video thumbing through Youtube’s vast repo was adding to my anxiety, having quite the opposite effect on me. Quite accidentally, I stumbled upon Mary Meckley’s “The Daily Meditation” podcast on iTunes. Its been over 60 days that I’ve been consistently meditating with the podcast and it has wonderfully eased me into a daily practice. She also has a website Sip and Om where the brave amongst us can also sign up for a 100 day meditation quest. Come to think of it, I could be just less than 40 days away from achieving this myself. But for now,I’ll try to not put the cart before the horse. Here are a few things that have helped me build this practice, and why I think Mary’s guided meditation is working: 2. The meditations have helped me ‘habit stack.’ I was inspired by Cathyrn Lavery’s Why Creating a Meaningful Morning Routine Will Make You More Successful to try it myself. I put on the podcast first thing in the morning as I make tea. I’ve been making tea first thing each morning since high school, so it was easy for me to “pair” meditation with something I do quite subconsciously. By the time the podcast reaches the time when you actually need to settle down for the meditation, my hot cuppa is ready in front of me. It also leaves me with something to look forward to, after the meditation. 3. I didn’t realise the power of affirmations until I started meditating with Mary. Affirmations kept me focused during the meditation. I have now started to use some of these affirmations before a stressful interview and it is helping me overcome fear and anxiety. Today’s meditation was focused on the below affirmation. 4. Breathing techniques : Now I have been practising yoga for over ten years and I believe in the power of pranayama or mindful breathing techniques. The podcast sets aside a day a week for practicing a new breathing technique during the meditation. It’s just easy. 5. First things first : I desperately fight the urge to do anything else around the house or on my phone before I start the podcast. I play it on the laptop so that I am less inclined to wander off as I would with the phone. This way, I am forced to sit in my meditation spot with the laptop in front of me. 6. Forgiveness : I forgive myself if I am unable to meditate in the morning. I don’t beat myself up about it and get anxious over meditation! I simply do it before bedtime, being careful not to play it on the phone. All in all, I am so grateful to Mary for getting an over-anxious person to slow down and build a consistent practice over time. I hope to be able to join her 100 day meditation quest someday soon.",2015
Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"When I was first diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (by a neurologist in the middle of a migraine appointment), I thought, “Great! Search terms! Let’s get cozy, Google.” But I was wrong to assume simple screen time was going to help me find my path with my anxiety disorder. I found little online that informed me in any real way. For one thing, the word “worry” was used again and again. At the time, worry wasn’t what I did or how I identified. Thinking and overthinking, yes. Worry, no. A few months after my July diagnosis, in Sept 2015, the tennis player Mardy Fish wrote a great essay that captures the experience of anxiety in vivid detail. At one point he sums it up: “I was, objectively, doing great. And looking back, I wish I had been able to tell myself that. But doing great wasn’t something that my frame of mind back then had time to process. All I could focus on was doing better. It was a double-edged sword.” By the time I read Fish’s piece, he was confirming something I already knew. I’d talked to many people to piece together what GAD meant, found a book that helped a lot, and started to figure out my own particular form of anxiety for myself. The goal of this short FAQ is to help people like me when they’re just beginning their journey. You may be realizing you have anxiety. Maybe you’ve been told that that you’re exhibiting some of the symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If you are Googling the hell out of your keyboard right now and not finding answers to your questions, welcome, fellow mind traveller. Q. What is Generalized Anxiety Disorder, exactly? A. You’ve probably been researching this topic, so I’m not going to give you the same bland answer you’ve already seen about how it’s a psychological disorder characterized by excess “worry” particularly about work, finances, and relationships. I will say that some of the people I know with GAD didn’t know they had it for a long time. They didn’t characterize themselves as “worriers.” Books and doctors tell you that GAD means you worry about worry, but if you don’t even consider it worry, that doesn’t help. And if you are so habituated to pushing away the worry as a coping mechanism, then again, talking in those terms just leads to more trouble. For me, GAD meant that I was overthinking nearly everything in my life, scrupulously trying to figure it all out. If a problem came up, I’d write it down and begin my crazed attack in every direction. It also meant I had a ton of crippling shoulder and neck pain. I’d be nauseated frequently, especially on buses. I’d get dizzy occasionally, almost to the point of fainting. It was the physical symptoms that led my neurologist to know I had GAD. Q. Can a person have GAD and not know it? A. Absolutely. It’s common for people who have GAD to see many doctors before they get properly diagnosed. Gastroenterologist, chiropractor, neurologist, acupuncturist, and gynecologist offices are some of the common stops along the path to diagnosis. Q. Is it hereditary? A. I don’t know if this is everyone’s question, but it was one of mine. I wanted to understand where GAD was coming from. Yes, there is a genetic component. As is often the case, that’s only one part of the equation. You may have genetic roots and predisposition to anxiety disorders, but they are also triggered by environmental factors. The death of a loved one, divorce, the sudden loss of a job or your house, or a big change in circumstance can bring on episodic fare-up of GAD. Q: If it flares up, does that mean it’s dormant at other times? A: My understanding (I’m a patient, not a doctor!), is that you’re predisposed to GAD, but with proper treatment, you can bring your symptoms into check. But since you are predisposed to this condition, when things happen to you, you will be more likely to have bigger anxiety responses than other people. I almost think of it as a GAD sine wave, and the equation is your life, and what’s happening in it. Q. How messed up are you, exactly? Please be specific. A. Very recent example: We have had a few ants in the bathroom lately. They appeared to be coming through the window. “We should probably replace the window,” was my immediate thought, and suggestion to my husband, even though we can’t afford it. I don’t see 5–10 ants. I see the inevitable 100–200 ants that I imagine will invade and eventually carry off our house. It’s very hard for me to deal with the here and now when I am catastrophizing. (That’s a cognitive distortion. Learning to recognize cognitive distortions is one important element of cognitive behavioral therapy, the best method for treating GAD.) A friend put it well: “I realized that I did everything in a rush. Even simple things like brushing my teeth or making coffee. And 80 percent of what I do on a typical day does not require hurrying and rushing. That creates a lot of stress and worry throughout the day.” I know exactly what he means. I sometimes have the feeling that if I don’t get whatever small household task done at any given moment, the world might end. GADs are not known for their patience. The worst era of my anxiety disorder was the time before I knew I had it. I knew something was wrong, but not what. I desperately wanted to figure it out. I’d go down every known avenue trying to get an answer. My diagnosis was one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. I am very thankful for it. Q. If I have GAD, how do I make it go away? Does it last forever? A. Here’s my thinking on it. The ideal situation is that I’m able to ride the wave. Maybe even get to the point where I can hang in the lull for a long time with little anxiety. When stressful things happen, I expect that my particular gremlin will poke his head out of the wave’s crest. Knowing what to do with him and that I’ve survived his visits before helps a lot. Meditation. Medication. A moderate amount of reading and learning (in other words, don’t overdo it). Communication. Q. Can anyone develop it? What’s the line between having it and just being a regular stressed out American? A. Right now, I am seeing the world through anxiety-tinted lenses, so I tend to see anxiety in a lot of people around me. Ultimately, though, the difference between regular anxiety, stress, and GAD comes down to degree. Most people aren’t fainting or getting up in the middle of the night. Most don’t need neck rubs every day. And most aren’t negatively predicting the outcomes of regular social interactions in a way that adds extra stress to daily life. One of my friends, who learned through my experience that he has GAD too, said, “I tend to project into the future as I experience almost everything. And I’m often planning how to deal with some negative turn of events that might happen in the future, but most likely never will. So I’m worrying in the present about something that will never happen in the future.” If that sounds familiar, you might want to read more about Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Q. Is this what has been wrong with me? A. I can’t tell you that, but I can tell you that if anything that I’ve said has rung true, a great place to start is the book The Worry Cure. Don’t think about the title too much and don’t think about the word “worry.” Just investigate your physical symptoms through the lens of your thoughts, and see if what this book has to say relates to you. If not, then you don’t have GAD. Q. Will I ever feel better? A. I believe that you will feel better if you have GAD. This is a hard won statement coming from me. I am a skeptic and not one to placate you, reader. But I think that simply the fact of you reading this means that you are going to feel better. Q. How do you know? A. Times are changing. People are talking openly about depression, anxiety, and other forms of mental suffering in a way that they never did when I was in my 20s. I’m so glad to see it on behalf of my 5-year-old daughter. The more people speak openly about the spectrum of mental conditions, the more they can be helped earlier on. I wouldn’t have dreamed of writing something this personal just one year ago. I now feel as though my anxiety needs to be an integrated part of me in order to be managed in a healthy way. I hope that others will feel that way too. Q: What should I do if I’m a friend or family member of a Gaddie? A: I feel for you. It’s not easy to deal with an anxious person, especially at the high pitch levels that people with GAD specialize in. It’s hard to avoid the role of friend-therapist. You might find yourself talking your friend down and trying to give them a more realistic view of their surroundings. The goal is to help them build those muscles for themselves without exhausting yourself. Bottom line: get the oxygen mask on yourself first. On the other hand, it can also be confusing because GAD often presents as perfectionism, or invulnerability. How do you help someone who doesn’t seem to need help? Take in the information you have and tune in to your instincts. Is the person talking super fast? Are they in a lot of physical pain? Do they seem complainy? If so, they may need to learn to tune in to how they are responding to the world around them. As a friend, you can help by gently encouraging them to go easy on themselves and stay grounded in the moment. Send them a link to this piece. Do it with love. I created The Beautiful Voyager after realizing I wasn’t alone from the response to this piece. A social network for overthinkers, the site includes a Lighthouse Map with hundreds of messages from other people who experience stress, anxiety, and overthinking.

Anxiety Abroad: Learning to Cope While Travelling Solo,"by Lexie Hinde, Journalism student at Ryerson University It was easier than I was anticipating. Pulling up in the dim parking garage and watching my dad lift my jam-packed backpack out of the trunk, I felt the familiar twinge of anxiety bubble up in my stomach. It was a feeling that I had been shoving down all day, refusing to give in to my nervous mind that had been screaming doubts at me for the last week. My mother put her arm around me as we walked into the building that would be my final stop before the world opened up to me: Departures. Toronto Pearson International Airport: a catalyst for adventure, and a place that had given me so much excitement in the past. But today, its broad white walls and large open spaces felt cold and clinical. Every number counting down to my gate felt menacing and heavy. Every step I took was one step closer to adventure and freedom, and to everything I had spent months of happy anticipation planning; but it never really felt real until that moment. Even then, I half-expected to climb back in the car with my parents on their way back home. But that wasn’t the case. Instead, I braved the security lines with my belongings and made my way to the nearest comfort-food shop: Tim Horton’s. Settled in to a plush chair at the gate with my chamomile tea in one hand and a (heavily glazed) chocolate Timbit in the other, I contemplated the next two-and-a-half weeks of my life. Those weeks would be spent in four different European countries. Solo travel was a first for me and I was nervous. The problem with my nervousness, though, is that it can quickly turn into panic. As someone who has anxiety, the prospect of travelling on my own on a different continent is something that could be completely terrifying. But, as someone who has always had a bad case of wanderlust, this was not an opportunity I would ever dream of turning down. And after those few weeks were over, I learned a lot about myself, and how to manage my anxiety while alone in a foreign country. Baggage carousels suck. Packing light is the only way to avoid the long waits and monotonous groan of that metal conveyor belt. If you can stuff all your things in a carry-on sized backpack or suitcase, you can avoid navigating confusing airports more than you have to. Always having my backpack with me was helpful in avoiding those long waits — and guess what? You don’t have to worry about the airline losing your stuff. I spent weeks before my trip packing and re-packing my backpack, and it really paid off. Not only did I realize how little I really needed to bring with me, but once the time came to pack up at the end of every hostel stay, it was a breeze putting all my things away. Once you know how everything should fit, the easier it is to be confident you aren’t leaving anything important behind. Sometimes — oftentimes — living with anxiety can be overwhelming. Even the smallest things can cause stress to coil itself around your muscles and try to exhaust you with doubt and worry. It can be hard to stop it from happening, but taking a step back and just breathing can sometimes keep it at bay for just a little while. This is one of the most important things I learned during my travels: don’t overdo it. It’s so easy to get caught up in the hype of a certain place once you’re in a hostel listening to everyone else’s plans for the day. But just remember what you came to see. For me, getting away meant relaxing and enjoying myself. The beautiful thing about solo travel is that you don’t have to answer to anyone but yourself. You don’t have to compromise, nor do you have to give up any freedom. So don’t. For every city I went to, I only had one or two things that I really wanted to see. The rest of the time I spent just exploring where I was. When you’re not trying to jam too many sites into a tight schedule, you get to really take the city in without all the hustle and bustle of long-lined tourist traps. Don’t feel bad about skipping that museum that you have to get up at the crack of dawn to wait in line for if you’re not really interested. There’s a whole lot less stress suffocating you when you’re not worrying about closing times and losing your spot in line when you really need to use the bathroom. There is something so freeing and relaxing in wandering without a destination in mind. So grab your camera and get lost. Walk until your stomach growls and then stop for some local cuisine. When your schedule is open, so is your mind. I am the queen of excuses. That, I’ve discovered, has been a byproduct of my anxiety. Every time I feel brave and want to try something new, the doubt bubbles up and I come up with silly reasons to convince myself that I can’t do it. It’s too much work; I’ll probably fail; what if I have a panic attack? — the list goes on… When I was in Amsterdam, early on in my trip, I had only one site in mind that I had actually planned to see: the Keukenhof Tulip Gardens. I only had one full day in the Netherlands, and that’s how I was looking forward to spending it. But when that day came, it was miserable. Dark, threatening-looking clouds had rolled in, drenching my excitement with rain. I ended up wasting the entire morning sitting in a café having that familiar inner battle with myself; the one where I try to talk myself out of going because the day isn’t perfect and sunny. How I didn’t want to walk around in the rain, and that I may as well just pack it in for the day. But then it occurred to me: if I don’t go today (the only opportunity I had) would I regret it later? The answer was yes. Unequivocally, yes. I didn’t know when the next opportunity to travel there would ever come. So I left that café, bought an umbrella, and didn’t look back. By the time I reached Keukenhof in South Holland, the rain had cleared and the sun was out. It was at that point that I realized some chances need to be taken, and for the rest of my travels I never once considered passing up on doing something because it may not be easy. And you know what? By the time I returned home to Toronto, I didn’t have any regrets. By nature, I am an extremely cautious person. As a rule, I don’t walk anywhere by myself after dark, I avoid questionable situations, and stay away from abandoned alleyways. Being a 23-year-old female, these are all things I’ve gotten used to doing. Call it excessive, but I’ve always lived by the mantra “better safe than sorry.” So, naturally this is something I assumed would carry over to my travels as well. I was visiting countries that I had never been to before, so I figured the stranger danger would be amplified. I was wrong. Standing on a street corner in Amsterdam sporting a confused look and a frayed map that may as well have been in braille, my frustrations bubbled up to the surface. I was lost. That was when a man on a bike stopped and asked me if I needed directions. Later on, a girl on the subway talked me through the stops, making jokes and asking me where I’m from. That’s when it really sunk in: most people just want to help you, not hurt you. The kindness I was shown in Amsterdam continued throughout all the countries I visited. Every single person I asked for help went above and beyond to make sure I knew where I was going and how to get there. And it was because of this kindness that I was able to experience the best night of my travels. Heidelberg, Germany many not be big, but it is truly one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever had the pleasure of exploring. It was there at the hostel I was staying in that I met a guy from Switzerland working at the reception desk. We spent some time talking, and he offered to take me up to Heidelberg Castle when his shift was over later that night. Normally, it would have been a “thanks but no thanks” situation, but instead I pushed my anxiety aside long enough to let my gut have a say in the decision-making process, and my gut was saying that I could trust him. He took me to the castle where we could see the entire city lit up below, like we were giants gazing at millions of fireflies at our feet. We stood on the old bridge over the Neckar River, explored the long cobbled streets and visited local cafes until after midnight. At no point did I ever feel scared or nervous. Heidelberg may be beautiful during the day, but the way it’s lit up at night gives it a magical feel. That’s something I would have never known if I had been too afraid to really live. Fear can be a potent thing, but sometimes you have to listen to your gut. Anxiety has the power to make you miss out on something great if you let it. So don’t. Travelling on your own can get lonely sometimes, especially if you don’t have anything to distract you with. Staying in hostels is great for making new friends and having fun, but not so great when it comes to privacy. So it was for my last destination that I decided to treat myself to that privacy by booking a place through Airbnb. While I cherished not having to lock up my belongings every time I left, it was the first time that I really felt isolated and alone. So it was there, sitting on my temporary bed on a cool Paris evening, that my anxiety crept back in. I felt the familiar sick feeling building up in my stomach and the cold sweat forming on my body. For the first time during my trip, I had a panic attack. As if having a panic attack wasn’t bad enough, the fact that I had to catch an early train to Normandy the next morning made it worse. I was afraid, as I always am, that it wouldn’t get better by then (the mid-panic-attack brain isn’t the most rational). So, grateful that I had sprung for a travel-pack, I got out my cell phone and dialed home. I wasn’t homesick (in fact I very much didn’t want to leave Europe any time soon), I just needed some reassurance. Sometimes you just need to talk to someone familiar to calm you down. It’s ok to admit that you need help; it doesn’t make you weak or pathetic to talk to your parents or text a friend. By the time I hung up that phone I felt strong again. Solo travel can be an incredibly liberating experience. The idea of it certainly felt daunting at first, but being my own guide was the most fulfilling adventure I have ever accomplished. I’ve learned that you can’t let living with anxiety stop you from really living. Once you’re brave enough to take that first step, the rest will fall into place. Sure, my travels weren’t perfect, but they felt pretty damn close and I wouldn’t trade that for anything.",2015
Three Months After My Episode.,"NSFW, Discrestion advised.Three months and a day has passed since I downed a bottle of pain killers with a couple of beers. I dont “remember the day like it was yesterday”. It was actually rather hazy.I remember walking into my parents house after the last fight with my then boyfriend. We had been fighting for a week about how he didnt know what he wanted, so then when he wanted a break, he changed his mind when I decided to talk to other guys. That month, I was also getting over the fact that my best friend and cousin were both suing me for hydroplaning and flipping my car with them in it (regardless of the fact that I wasnt at fault, completely sober and offered them both whatever financial or emotional support they needed). On top of that, I was dropped from the Art History class I was taking because of all the classes I missed. And on top of that, the family pet that I had been responsible for for the last 15 years had passed away.Ive been battling with depression since I started middle school. I suppose the stress of going to an art school, handling a divorce in the family, and keeping up with all my internships and extra curriculars just got to me. I was clinically diagnosed just last year when I went in to a psychiatric hospital to get medication. I should add that the impetus for this decision was that my ex had threatened to break up with me if I didnt get help. I was always irritable and had panic attacks all the time.The day that I tried to kill myself, I actually felt very calm. I wasnt angry or mopey. I merely.. Did. Not. Care. I was catatonic. I was too emotionally exhausted to cry or vent to friends. I didnt feel the need to put my energy into any of my passions- dance, praying to Christ, studies.. Even sleeping felt like it would take too much energy. I felt like I had been carrying a literal weight around for weeks. I wouldnt even know who to vent to if I wanted to- I was raised to believe that complaining was for the weak, letting out anger or frusteration wasnt socially acceptable, and the need for attention just meant that I was being greedy and obnoxious. The most efficient option was outting myself. I would no longer be a burden to family or friends, not like they would care- I doubt anyone would even notice that I was gone. I remembered reading a news article about a woman whos body wasnt found after three months- no one had come to check on her in that entire time. I remembered years of counseling- my therapists always told me to breathe whenever I was in stressful situations, to scream into a pillow, to log down my feelings. All that seemed so stupid now.My brother found me about to start on my second bottle of painkillers. I wanted to down anything and everything that would off me quickly and painlessly, without the noise of cutting myself or crashing my car into a wall. I didnt want anyone to make a fuss out of me. I didnt want anyone to have to clean up after me. I didnt want any attention on me, which is ironic because there are still a handful of people to this day who swear that I just did it for the that reason. I had called one of my friends from school and she tried to call poison control on me. I wouldnt give her my address but she asked to speak to my mother. My mom and stepfather took me to the closest 247 urgent care. I remember being checked in and the doctor looked at me like I was so stupid. “She did this because of a boy?” She looked at me the way an aunt looks at an annoying five year old. I knew that she was just a healthcare professional trying to help me- everyone there was- so I tried to give them the least trouble possible. I remember that throughout the entire process, although everyone was kind to me, one of the nurses had to remove all the furniture from my room. My mother asked him why and he responded, “We have to- whenever someone has what she has.” I ‘have’ depression. I liked that. It made my heart smile. I wasnt ‘is crazy’ or ‘did try to kill herself’. He respectfully regarded my mental illness.After that night, I was sent to Saint Judes for voluntary hospitalization where I would be away from social media and family and friends so that I could look back on what I did and why. It was very boring and all I really thought about was how much schoolwork and hours I needed to make up. I just slept beside that though. When I got out, everything was the same. I went back home and watched Supernatural, ate my favorite foods, and didnt mope. I didnt cry my eyes out or catch up with friends. It was just another day of trying to get better. I looked into yoga, and enrolled into a local studio that gave me a monthly student discount. I researched isochronic beats and guided meditations that would influence me for a better and happier attitude. I looked up social activist sites and tried to get involved in everything that would positively impact me. I joined about half a dozen depression support groups as well as becoming an online therapist on 7cupsoftea.com. I started logging in my schedule and what I felt about each day on 3minutejournal.com. My stepfather helped me with my medication regime, and I took 20 MG more a day. I talked to a few people about what happened, but basically didnt want to have to explain myself to 200 people who barely new me.Im still working on myself and its a daily battle but I can feel myself getting stronger.“If you want to be happy, be” -Tolstoy",2015
4 Steps To Get Rid Of Anxiety,"For most of my life, I’ve suffered from varying degrees of anxiety. I’ve often wondered to myself, “Where does it all come from? Is it genetic? Is it gender-related? Is it because my grandfather was a Jewish psychiatrist?” These questions lead to more questions, which question themselves, and pretty soon the whole cycle becomes uncontrollable. This is what I’ve found to be the essence of anxiety: circularity. You have a thought that triggers the anxiety. That thought turns to 5 thoughts, and each of those 5 thoughts turns to 5 other thoughts, and before you know it, you feel absolutely paralyzed. It can be rather terrifying. Most people have had the experience. That’s a somewhat severe example. Sometimes your thoughts stop but they keep swimming around in circles. Your questions keep trying to chase one another down. The mental energy you could be spending on acknowledging the present becomes depleted. That’s the thing a lot of us don’t realize. Why are so many modern people so tired all of the time? It’s because anxiety is ridiculously grueling. It’s hard work. The chronically anxious expend the mental energy of multiple days of rigorous academic testing, or jury duty, or arguing. In the same way that we can’t sprint for 8 hours and expect our body to just recover immediately, we can’t let ourselves get anxious without taking some time to reflect. We injure our minds this way. I have experimented enough with anxiety-relieving techniques to have learned a few things. I’m still young, so there’s a long way to go, but I imagine there’s a certain anxiety that comes with youth that diminishes with age: wondering about the future, feeling overwhelmed by one’s options and the subsequent negation of other options that comes from the constant choosing, the constant major decision making. Regardless, though — anxiety is anxiety. We can use certain methods to deal with it. Here’s mine: Acknowledge it. This sounds obvious, right? Of course we should acknowledge anxiety in order to get rid of it. But it’s not always that simple. Stress creeps behind you and sometimes strikes when you least expect it. You’re left feeling like you’ve been sucker punched. The reason why meditation aids anxiety relief is it gives us more mindfulness. Mindfulness allows us to recognize when we’re stepping into murky waters. Try to practice activities that cultivate mindfulness rather than distracting yourself with food, entertainment, sex, drugs. Make peace with it. Sometimes I recognize my anxiety and immediately become more anxious. “Oh shit, I’m anxious again, I hate this, I wish this would stop.” That sort of internal dialogue only causes more anxiety. Resisting anxiety is like trying to extinguish a fireplace by blowing on it; you’ll only feed it further. Instead of resisting, make peace with it. Of course, this is easier said than done. How can we make peace with something that’s torturing us? Breathe. Sit back, lay down, find a bathroom stall — whatever you need to do to get yourself alone and comfortable — close your eyes, and breathe. This is meditation. You don’t need to do it on a special cushion or in a yoga studio. And you shouldn’t do it just to alleviate anxiety. Instead, breathe for the sake of breathing. That energy that we use up when we’re feeling anxious often prevents us from breathing properly. When you recognize your anxiety, pay attention to your breathing. You’ll find it’s probably stifled or erratic. Meditation teaches us to return to the breath. Breathe in, acknowledging your anxiety. Breathe out, imagining the negative energy exiting through your lungs, then your nasal passages, and finally nostrils. Envision your anxiety as a red energy. Mine resides in my stomach. I breathe into it rather than away from it, carrying it up and out. Don’t be scared. This is a simple process, but it works wonders for anxiety. I find the reason to be precisely what I talked about earlier. Anxiety snowballs. If we can catch it while it’s still minor and breathe through it, focusing on our bodily processes and finding an anchor with our breathing, we can nip it in the bud. The key is practicing this so that we become comfortable with it. It’s a place to start, and if you do it regularly, it will help.",2015
Left Scrambling for More: Confessions of A Workaholic Mom,"And suddenly, none of it matters anymore. Years of reaching. Striving. Aching. Success was always one all-nighter away. Grades. Awards.

You’re halfway to a divorce. You’re one sick day away from a nervous breakdown. Always “running late.” Always “one more minute.” Always working. They say workaholism is an addiction like a drug. Checking off the to-do list, submitting memos, billing hours. The feeling that you got it done. A coolness rushes through your blood, and for a moment, you’re okay. You did it. You’ve got this. The high invigorates. Until you run out of your stash and you’re left scrambling for more. More work, less sleep. Push it to the edge to get it done. No margin. No peace. No life. “When is that assignment due? You better start it before — oh wait, you have those other deadlines as well. You’re screwed, you won’t finish them all in time, even if you don’t sleep all week.” Your back tenses and you start feeling sweat drip down your neck. You hear a beating, a pounding, and realize your heart is drumming a war song. “It won’t get done in time. There’s no way you can do it. You’ll fail.” Clouds take over and you’re suddenly in a sauna. Where’s the air? Why can’t I breathe? You try to take a deep breath in but out comes a sob. Your mind is in slow motion while the world races past you. You slowly realize you’re crying. You don’t even know your son’s in your arms until his hand hits your face. He’s staring up at you in fear. Watching you fall apart. You drop him and run out of the room. Down the hall. Face down in the bed. You don’t know when it started or what you’re saying but you hear it, the screaming, the yelling. You let it all out, into the pillow, into the black hole where all your angst goes, only to come back uninvited much too soon. Eventually, it quiets. The sobs turn to tears, the tears run dry. What are you left with? Salty cheeks. A hoarse throat. Your husband brings your son over to comfort you. To make you smile. To make sure you’re breathing. This isn’t worth it. This job isn’t worth your dignity. This job isn’t worth your sanity. This job isn’t bringing you joy. Or life. Or freedom, even financially. You need to escape. You need a lifeline. But the morning comes, and you’re off again. Checking off to-do lists. Submitting memos. Billing away the last shreds of your mental and physical health. “I’m sorry, I had to work late.” “I’m sorry, I have to stay up again.” “I’m sorry, I have work to do.” You do have work to do. But it’s not the kind that pleases your bosses or earns you a raise. It’s the kind of soul work that takes blood and tears and energy but that leads to purpose and fulfillment and, ultimately, freedom. You need to work at finding a place where you can thrive, not just survive. Because you’re barely doing that. You crave fulfillment, you long after purpose, you thirst for creativity. Where are you meant to be in this world…? It’s time to find out.",2015
You Are Not Alone: Dealing with PTSD,"Last week, I observed a post in a feminist group I am a part of that really hurt and offended me and triggered my PTSD. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I had been triggered by, as I was fine one moment, then shaking and crying uncontrollably the next. After pinpointing what had caused my trigger, I took an hour to calm down and let the trigger work it’s self out. I then returned to the content that had triggered my PTSD and left a comment letting the OP know that her post had upset me and triggered me and what I thought she could do to make it so no one else would be triggered by it. It was a post dealing with motherhood and supporting choices about motherhood… And, in reading it, the OP complimented and congratulated those who are moms and those who choose not to be moms, leaving out two critical groups of people who are (really) overlooked when talking about motherhood: Women who are struggling to start a family and women who are mothers who have children who have died. I have the unfortunate pleasure of being part of the second group, which I call “The Moms of Dead Kids Club.” In March 2014, ten days after her birth, our beautiful daughter Madeline, succumbed to complications from myeloproliferative leukemia and died in my arms. I have not been the same since. I have struggled with my PTSD for 18 months now and it’s not getting much better. (You can read more about Maddie here.) Recently, I decided I needed to stop most other things I was doing and focus on getting better. For the sake of my marriage, for the sake of my family and for my own sake, as only I can tackle my own demons and let the sunlight back into my life. Part of that has been agreeing to start a new kind of therapy. Part of that is writing daily about my life. Part of that is letting people know what triggers my PTSD and asking them to help me get better by considering how specific content might hurt me. Overall, I think that the original poster really handled the situation well, she started with an apology and talked to me about her personal experience to help me understand that in no way did she mean to hurt, offend or trigger me. That she had experienced challenges with motherhood and she empathized greatly with what I was going through. That she didn’t think that she could reasonably include all the different types of motherhood situations in a Facebook post, but that she would try to be aware of what I had told her about my experience reading her content when posting in the future. She did a GREAT job of having a respectful dialog with someone who was hurting because of something she said/did — even though she never intended any hurt to anyone. I actually thought it was a constructive, polite exchange and we each learned something really important about the other person. It was the kind of mutually respectful exchange that happens so rarely on Internet forums. It actually gave me a bit of hope about humanity. Then. Well. Ugh. Another person jumped onto the thread said to me (basically,) “Why are you offended? That’s stupid. Get over it.” (Paraphrased, of course for length.) Reading this response to my heartfelt, vulnerable post made me just break down completely into a mess of anxiety and tears. It put a huge pause in my day and caused me physical issues (nausea, dizziness, shaking hands) in my real life. It wasn’t okay at all. I reached out to a good friend (who is also one of the group admins) to get her opinion. She looked at it and deleted the post entirely, because following the first negative comment, a bunch more women jumped onto the thread to criticize me and take swings at me. To quote her, she and the other admins felt that I should “Never even see those comments, you simply do not need that pain.” She then posted a great post to the group saying that we wanted the group to be a safe space and that it’s okay to be offended, but it’s not okay to be offended that someone else is offended. I really appreciate her expediency in taking care of the situation. I cannot emphasize enough the fact that the only reason I have been any semblance of okay is because the people who love me have stood behind me, propped me up and not allowed people to take ad hominem swings at me for the last 18 months. But, as I thought about it more and more, I began to think it might be helpful to people (in general) if someone with PTSD or another stimuli influenced disorder addressed what triggering actually is and why it’s pretty heartless to be told “get over it” when you’re trying to tell someone what is happening with you. This is my reaction/response to a situation which involved me. My intent is not to shame anyone or call anyone out. It is educational. And, I hope that it helps you understand better how to interact with someone who is suffering from PTSD. I originally posted it on Facebook. I have edited and modified it for my blog (which I have pretty much neglected for the last 12 months and am going to be trying to make better use of going into this therapy.) Please keep in mind: Any hurtful or argumentative comments will be deleted out of pocket without response and the commenter will be blocked from future interaction with me. This is self-protective. I hope those reading this understand. Having to tell someone I have been triggered — in any circumstance — is incredibly uncomfortable and humbling for me. I have always thought of myself as a strong woman, one who isn’t afraid to say difficult things that need saying, one who is not emotionally affected by stupid, insensitive shit I read online. I think of myself as someone who is invested in pursuing equality and who stands up and says “this is wrong” when she sees someone else shoving someone down. A new friend recently described me as a “loud broad who isn’t afraid to throw down truth, call out bullshit and use swear words when contextually needed.” I really like that idea of myself, so much. The tough, strong, no shit taking woman who gets stuff done and says stuff that needs saying. But, that’s not true anymore. Since the loss of my daughter, since my diagnosis of PTSD I am physically and emotionally hurt by things I read on the Internet — sometimes without any control over the experience. What is particularly frustrating is this: Because I have such an intimate relationship with my bed, have extreme anxiety about social situations, rarely let people in to see how I am really doing (with exception of my husband, mother, best friend and other key family members) — the Internet has over the last 18 months become my lifeline. It is (sadly) for the moment, my social life. And, it’s completely unnerving to think that the only way that I have to safely interact with people right now, is also a place where thoughtless people can take undeserved swipes at me. But, really, that might be a topic for another blog post, on a different day. People who end up with a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder end up with that diagnosis because they experienced something so awful, so traumatic, so life changing (in a bad way) that their physical brain actually changes. After this change, the person with PTSD becomes sensitive to external stimuli that then triggers a physical or emotional reaction. It’s a fight or flight situation, the trigger is perceived by the brain as a threat to the person’s well being on a very subconscious level. People who experience PTSD are as varied in the cause as any other kind of mental health disorder, but generally it is said that PTSD is caused by sudden, traumatic loss; exposure to violence (such as war); sexual assault/rape/molestation; or, unidentified childhood trauma. As people try to work to heal themselves from PTSD, awareness of their stimuli triggers can happen and they can try to avoid situations where potential triggers may occur. Myself, I am about to be involved in “cognitive stimuli therapy,” where I will be exposed to triggers by a doctor in a controlled environment to help take away the power of the triggers. This is hard, difficult work — the concept of having to do this work actually has triggered a reaction in me. That is called circular insanity, IMHO. So, after reading the above information, you might be wondering what are triggers of PTSD and what exactly happens when one is triggered? The answer is as fluid and unsatisfying as any answer about a mental health issue can be: Triggers can be anything and everything. They can be sights, smells, sounds, the way something feels (physically), or ideas — even. And, what happens when one is triggered is different for each person who has PTSD. Being triggered can cause a severe, sudden depression; suicidal ideations; an anxiety attack; flashbacks; nausea/vomiting; excessive sweating; an acute stress reaction (which -for me- feels like my heart is racing and I cannot breath); insomnia; fatigue; irritability; guilt; unexplained crying; hallucinations (auditory/visual); palsy. To be frank, it’s not at all fun. And, if I could control it, I would naturally do so. For me, triggers usually cause irritability/agitation, insomnia, flashback, nightmares, hallucinations (auditory) and anxiety attacks that have physical symptoms like nausea, headache, ears ringing, pounding heart, palsy in my right hand and uncontrollable crying. I do not want to belabor the point and if you want to know more about PTSD, you should read this excellent post about emotional and psychological trauma that was published by Help Guide: http://www.helpguide.org/…/emotional-and-psychological-trau… And, this WebMD article about PTSD Triggers: http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/ptsd-triggers The most important thing I should impart about the majority of PTSD patients is this: The ability to control triggers and to control the reaction to triggers is veritably non-existent. These are not situations where one says to one’s self, “Oh look, something that might trigger me, I’ll just avoid it and decide not to react.” That’s not how it happens. You can be going about your day, normally, and be triggered and not know what it was that triggered you. Or, you can be triggered and not know you’ve been triggered for several hours, days or weeks as the symptoms build up and climax. (I always use this scene from The West Wing episode, Noel — where Josh’s PTSD is triggered by trumpets playing Christmas carols, and it climaxes many weeks later with him putting his hand through a window to help explain delayed triggers. Trigger warning: You may cry if you watch this, I always do. In fact, I can’t watch it all the way through b/c it triggers me. Which sucks b/c I cussing love The West Wing.) Being triggered is exceptionally unpredictable, especially in severe cases. And, most of the time, you have to work backwards after the trigger and symptoms have subsided to figure out what triggered you in the first place. Let me give you a recent example of a time I was triggered and didn’t know it: I was driving through downtown Chicago last week with my husband and a friend we’d picked up from the train station. All the sudden, my ears started ringing, my hands on the steering wheel started to sweat, I started hyperventilating and tears started running down my face. Both my husband and my friend were like “Kate, what’s wrong, what happened, pull over!” But I pretty much couldn’t do that and had to keep driving (Chicago traffic = yuck.) Afterwards, in trying to work backwards to figure out what caused the trigger, I concluded that I had inadvertently driven us on a route that took us by the hospital where our daughter died. In addition, in navigating around the hospital, I drove a route that my Mom and Dad used to get back and forth between our apartment and the hospital, as they stayed at our place with my dog and we stayed in the hospital sleep rooms available to parents with children in ICU or NICU. Most importantly, however, we stopped at the same stoplight at the entrance to Lake Shore Drive we were at the night Maddie died. 30 minutes after she died, my Dad drove us home from the hospital because I was adamant that I did not want to stay at the hospital any longer. Paul was in the backseat trying to call our family in the UK to let them know that Maddie had not made it. It was at this stoplight that a crack in the numbness I was feeling happened and I started howling like a wounded animal. (Just writing this caused me to trigger myself. That is how pervasive and uncontrollable PTSD triggers can be.) If that story doesn’t resonate with you, think back to the stereotype of a wounded warrior with combat related PTSD. The reason that is a trope is because it is actually a reality. I think that people have become resistant to the idea of being triggered because it is thrown around willy-nilly by people who are uber PC and easily offended. This is a real shame. People with PTSD or other stimuli related cognitive disorders wish like hell people would stop doing that. Because triggering is a serious thing, it’s a medical condition and it’s not something to be casual about. That is PTSD. The reason I am sharing this is because I want to educate and evangelize for people with PTSD and other mental illness. It should go without saying that mental illness are real medical disorders. And, that if someone tries to tell you how your words, actions or attitude has triggered them, telling them that they need to “get over it” is cruel and not at all okay in terms of acceptable human behavior. Think of it this way: You would not tell someone with a physical illness or a disability to “just get over it,” would you? It is also important to know that comparing your experience (or that of someone you know) with mental illness to someone else’s experience with mental illness is inappropriate and rude. Mental illness presents to different degrees and severity in everyone, experiences can be dramatically different, and, this is what makes mental illnesses such slippery, difficult disorders to effectively treat. Given all this information, now answer this question: Is it okay to say to someone who is trying to tell you that your words triggered their PTSD “You need to get over it” or, “My Mom had miscarriages, my Aunt lost a child — neither of them would find these words offensive” to someone in my position? Unless you’re a complete asshole, the answer is “No fucking way is that appropriate.” Clearly, their experiences are different than mine. While they may not be offended or triggered by something now, it is possible that they would have been when they were closer in time to the experience. And, just because you or someone you know doesn’t find something offensive, hurtful or trigger-y, that doesn’t mean that someone else will not be triggered by that thing. In closing, I hope I have educated some of you as to what PTSD is and how it affects me. And, that it is not okay to treat mental illness like it’s no big deal and at all possible to be “just gotten over.” Mental illness is as serious and real as physical illness or disability. And, it should be treated as such. And, the next time someone tells me to “just get over” my PTSD I may actually punch a wall or throw my computer through a window.",2015
The language of anxiety,"“No more sister talk!” Dad’s voice would boom into our bedroom just before we went to sleep. “I mean it! You two girls be quiet!” We would laugh and make scrabbly little noises to each other, me in the day bed and her on the trundle. Then the tickling came, then the nighttime story, then the tuck-in that left us like small-boned mummies. If you look at our text messages now, you might not be able to decipher what my sister and I are saying to each other. “Roo!” I write to her. “Dorf dorf dorf,” she responds. It’s shorthand and semaphore, developed and honed over decades of shared rooms and distance. Language exists to make external what we already know or believe. The language of anxiety is secret, spirited, persistent. Its measure is enough, as in being, doing, having, getting. It asks questions in a familiar tone. “You?” it asks. “No, right, not me!” I respond. “How could I have ever thought — me? That’s ridiculous. I am not enough.” I talk to myself when I hear anxiety. Maybe once every six times or so — that’s how far behind I am. I’d like to work on that. But one every six times or so that I feel anxious, I stop and say to myself: I have some affection for my anxiety. When it does not have me in a swirl, I think of it as a little pet, a black cat who has gotten stuck in my house and who I keep feeding milk, even though I am not sure that I wanted a pet. The cat’s language is gentle, pawing, and brings me back to the things that matter: Hospitality, service, compassion, kindness. The cat is my teacher. There is a secret language I have with myself, and no one tells me now not to listen to it before I go to bed. I go to bed with anger toward myself for leaving so much undone, for un-productivity, for my own fear. I go to bed with a voice that says, enough, as in: you are not, you have not done, you will never be. I know, I say before I close my eyes. The cars rumble by on the street outside our apartment, and my pillow is too thin. I know. The cars are still rumbling when I wake, and this morning the sky is patchy and there is a rainbow outside. The rainbow is a language, too. Hi black cat, I think. The morning is here. We are alive. For a minute, that is enough.",2015
Hoisting the Black Flag: An Internal Struggle,"“Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.” I love this quote for a million reasons. Its visceral, true, and completely fucking bad ass, just to name three. The line always resonated with me ever since I first heard it, and right now it speaks volumes about the state of mind I’m currently in. Allow me to explain. The following is an excerpt from a post I never finished about two weeks ago: “After all my years on this planet I learned one thing: Hell is not a place, but a state of mind; and in those years I’ve done many a stretch in that…place of mind, let’s call it. Everyone has a horror story or has had some miserable, shitty thing descend upon them like a rabid bear at least once in their lives, unless they’re lucky, but has anyone ever really been that lucky? In my case, I do it to myself more often than not, the bear is me, myself and I. My mind is my bane, my cross to bear. It’s gotten me through about just as much trouble as its caused me. Since as far back as I remember I’ve been an over analyzer, succumbed to the occasional panic attack, been crippled by anxiety to the point where my body shakes uncontrollably, and I’ve ridden the depression roller coaster more times than I care to admit. It’s during these times I tend lose myself and take a trip off the deep end in an attempt to distract my mind from whatever Hell it’s in. Bottom line: I do some stupid, self destructive shit. I hurt myself, I hurt those around me, every so often I do some damage that cant be undone. Even though I fight tooth and nail to not go down that path, rarely do I win when I’m overwhelmed. It takes a mini rock bottom to wake my ass up before I get my head screwed back on straight and start to be a human again. I’m only writing about this because today I’m on the precipice of one those such times; I’m starting the decent to rock bottom and picking up speed. Normally I’m a pretty happy-go-lucky guy, and if I’m not I’m damn good at faking it; I just don’t have the energy anymore, I feel like I’m in a hole and this is an attempt to write my way out of it and hopefully get some feedback from the community.” Well, after I put a period to that sentence I literally closed my laptop, and proceeded to find rock bottom, it came pretty quickly. The weekend that followed was so full of self medicating and reckless behavior I honestly think my life flashed before my eyes at least twice. It was thrilling, if I’m being honest, and completely fucking stupid, but that’s the only way that I found in life to cope effectively, it numbs every feeling I hate. I thrive on danger and stupidity, the rush of adrenaline that spikes the brain when you know something potentially terrible could happen, but you do it anyway. It’s more addictive than any drug, and coupled with any drug, it’s the ultimate escape from reality, but this isn’t an advertisement. In no way do I condone my actions, nor encourage them to others, this is my demon and I will wrestle it alone like I always have. That weekend I spent more money than I should have on things that I shouldn’t have, I went places I don’t like being, saw people I don’t like being around. I also saw a lot of good people I haven’t seen in a while as well and got some perspective on my situation, before reverting back to the insanity. The situation is never indicative of the “therapy”, its always the same no matter what, but since that weekend ended, and the fog had lifted, I took a long look in the mirror, at the bruises on my face, and asked my self what the fuck, Steve. I’m 28 and still acting like a child having a temper tantrum. So I snapped out of it, opened up my laptop and started writing. I wrote so goddamn much about so many things my fingers hurt. I had no direction, I was going off raw emotion and random thoughts that popped into my head. I even dragged my ass, laptop in hand, to some little obscure coffee house I always wanted to visit (I left my beret and skinny jeans home though, I didn’t go that hardcore) and drank enough coffee to kill a moose and wrote some more. But seriously, the writing helped, and I mean it reallllllly helped. Since then, I’ve kept the self-destruction to a minimum, I can’t drop it all together, just like any drug I crave that rush, especially when those pangs of anxiety, depression, and over thinking hit. But I’ve regained control of myself. I think of all the friends and family (quite a few, unfortunately) I’ve lost to the types of stupid, random shit I was doing, whether they made it a habit or a one time thing went wrong, and I don’t want to be part of that statistic. So here I sit, coming clean on the internet, like if I post it here I’m signing a contract with witnesses to stop fucking up, to stop taking things that are out of my control out on myself and on those who care for me. To act like a fucking adult, like a man. To not make excuses for my actions because I’m having a pity party, boo-fucking-hoo Steve, grow up. As I sit here, making the final adjustments to screw my head on straight, I pretty much resolved my situation and I’m looking forward to writing more and the future in general. I always loved writing and never did it enough, and now I’m seeing the potential to make some sort of living off it. I also made peace with a lot of things and am keeping a positive outlook on life as a whole. It’s not worth it to wallow, even though I’ll probably never get over the anxiety, depression, and over thinking, I also know that I won’t inadvertently kill myself in the process of trying to. Which brings us back to the quote. Mr. Mencken, my friend, I am going to raise that flag, make some changes, and do something. What they are and what that is is still to be seen, but I know it will have to do with writing. In closing I just want to say thank you all for bearing witness to this statement and coming along for the ride and I hope to make the ride a lot more exciting in the times to come (although not the excitement I’ve been hinting at in this piece). Also I apologize if the writing in here is a bit disjointed, it’s how I’m feeling at the moment and I just wanted to get it out there while it was fresh. I would love to hear any thoughts on this or any ways that you have dealt with any of these types of feelings and issues, and would love to answer any questions; I’m an open book, honestly. And I promise there will be many more wise-ass articles to come, so until then, it’s time to get out there and (metaphorically) slit some throats.

Sunrises,"I think it started when he died. Or at least that’s when I first noticed it. I spent weeks, toiling over how someone I used to be so very close with was just gone. Just like that. There’s no last words. There’s no final goodbye. It’s just over. We’d drifted apart for a couple of years by that time, but I was, and still am, deeply affected by his death. I remember finding out in class during my first quarter away from home. Try and hold it together. 15 minutes of class left. Quick. Wipe the tear. No one saw. As the professor finished her lecture, students shuffled out of the class. I exchanged cursory nods with friends leaving the lecture hall. They deliberated over what to do for the rest of the day. I can’t join. But I don’t want to be alone. I told my closest friends about what happened. But I guess there just really isn’t much to say about it beyond, “I’m really sorry.” Why doesn’t anybody get this? This is more than an “I’m really sorry” kind of moment. A date was set for the funeral. During the week. Classes weren’t difficult. I could get an Amtrak ticket and be well on my way. Skipping a class is no problem. This is important. I can think of several decisions I regret shortly after. But the feeling of regret never lingers. Except here. I didn’t go to the funeral. My life as a student was more important than taking one day off to go to a funeral. I can always go visit him on the weekend. That was the first time I rejected a significant life event for insignificant work. At that point, nothing was ever important enough. Even for the smallest bit of work. I’m working hard now so I don’t have to work so hard later. I’m only 22. But I don’t know when the work stops. Other people see it too. People often ask if I’m here, because it’s clear that in my mind, I’m still working. I can work on application essays when I get home… Wait, friends have noticed that I’ve been thinking about something else. You know what I miss? I miss sunrises, sunsets, and the days when I didn’t have a fucking checklist to tell me how good my day was. Exercise? Check. Homework? Check. Emails? Check. Ah. Good day. But I can feel it in my bones. Something isn’t right. I’m anxious because I feel like I should be working more. I’m anxious because I know I’m not as good a friend as I should be. I’m anxious because in all the things that I want to be, I’m not enough. Watching TV? You should be working. I still think about him a lot. I’ll hear him in a song that will come on the radio. I’ll remember him trying to sing that song and being a dork about it. And I can’t help but break down in public. I remember this song in his iPod. I always teased him about how he misspelled the name of the song. I feel like an event like this should be life changing. And I sure talk a lot about how it was. But I look at how my life has progressed and have to ask, has it? I feel so sad when I think about how I didn’t know much about the person he had become after we’d grown apart, but when do I ever invest in others? People here just aren’t good people. I think I’ve deluded myself into thinking it’s other people. As if I just can’t find genuine people like my best friends from high school (who are still the best people I could ever know). But it’s not hard to see that it’s me. I’m not mentally present; I’m not invested. Maybe I’m not trying hard enough. To be honest. I haven’t a damn clue why I’m writing this. I don’t even know what I’m writing. Maybe I’m tired of hearing people tell me about how they wish they had my work ethic, or people telling me how I always seem so busy. I’ve definitely stopped working so hard. But the anxiety is ruthlessly persistent. There’s a price to pay for everything; sometimes the cost is too high. Somedays I feel it’s fair trade, even in my favor. This is one of those days where I feel like I was robbed in the alley. I guess what I’m trying to say is, cherish people. Sometimes they’ll surprise you. Go get up early for once and watch the sun rise. I mean really watch it. Don’t take pictures or video of it. And most of all. Enjoy life sometimes. And I don’t mean enjoy your work as life, but really just take a moment to enjoy life. Maybe you’ll find something you missed. I think my biggest fear is waking up and realizing that I took everyone for granted. That I missed out on all these authentic relationships with genuine people because I was too busy chasing the next thing. It’s a process to stop the chase; but I’m starting now. Maybe you’ll join me. I hope to see you while I’m watching the sun rise.",2015
Millennials Got A Raw Deal With Social Media,"blog.digidave.org In the 1976 satirical movie ‘The Network’ there is a scene when the main character goes on a rant about how television is a charade. A kind of shadow cast on the wall of Plato’s cave. Take four minutes (or skip to the 2-minute mark if you really have no time). It’s a great rant. Then look yourself in the mirror and admit you’ve had these thoughts about television. “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.” — Andy Warhol Andy Warhol couldn’t have been more right about this. What he failed to include was the notion that everyone will THINK they are famous for much longer than 15-minutes. When a “real person” is cast on a reality show, we are not seeing the truth. We are seeing a performance. And while there is no “casting” online — much of what we see is a farce. It is directed. It is mediated and produced. Even moreso for those whose professions (digital gurus, social media editors, etc. etc) are inherently connected to the online world. Let’s add another element to this conversation. (Ideas on what generations deem as success is informed by a talk by Clint! Runge) Generation X found success in owning stuff. This is why Fight Club resonated so strongly. Millennials have defined success as owning social relationships. Let that sink in for a moment……. Success is about owning social relationships. In a conversation with my friend Andrew Haeg we came to the conclusion that Millennials have been born into a time where they must bear the brunt of social media anxiety. The emergence of mass production led to abundance. But eventually left us with psychological and environmental externalities. Millennials have lived through the age of mass production of social capital. We have experienced the abundance and commodification. And we aren’t sure exactly what it all amounts to. What does a Millennial Fight Club look like? What are the externalities? Why do I switch between talking about Millennials as one and sometimes as an observer? Read the section “On Generations” below. I have never felt truly Millennial or Gen X. blog.digidave.org And I should note with the headline “Millennials Got A Raw Deal” that doesn’t mean social media is bad in and of itself. It has benefits for society. Just like mass production does. The abundance is something we wouldn’t want to give up. And over time, perhaps a balance can be struck. The next generation doesn’t need to answer the question “who am I.” Their identity has already been created online by their parents. Their photos already posted. Their jokes already delivered. Success to the next generation will be in owning experiences. Everyone wants to know how to tap into “the kids.” It’s where the money supposedly is. One of the most important things to keep in mind. EVERY generation is rebelling. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. But if they are rebelling against their Gen X parents, their form of rebellion may look like social responsibility and maturity. What generation raises you has a BIG impact on how you turn out — on how you rebel. And every generation goes through life phases. Gen Xers were rebels without a cause when they were younger. Now they are in their prime earning years. When they are supposed to be the workers and managers of society. Meanwhile the Boomers are moving into the later stages of life, where their value to society is in being wise sages. All this is just to point out the framework by which I think about the play between generations. This is very inspired by Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. Want a skeptical look at the world — check out my newsletter below. this-week-in-wtf.ongoodbits.com *Before you respond keep in mind the caveat “not all” applies whenever talking about a generation. “NOT ALL” millennias or Gen Xers, etc have certain traits.

Talking About Mental Health,"Warning: I very much doubt that anything I’m about to say will be hugely thought-provoking. Many others have written more eloquently and movingly on this subject than I will be able to, but the fact that a small group of people might read this and find it helpful is enough of a reason to do it. Also, I am a deeply fascinating human being and everything I say should be of interest to anyone with a shred of self-respect. During my first year at university, I started experiencing the stirrings of what I now recognise as anxiety. I spent the majority of my days barricaded in my room, kept company by a flickering laptop screen and the growing pile of discarded beer cans that crowded the windows and blocked out all natural light. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “What is this chap complaining about? Beer is for cool guys. He was drinking beer, therefore he is a cool guy. I wish I could be more like him.” Some of you will be surprised to learn that an existence comprised solely of repeated teary viewings of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the tinny taste of warm lager is not at all fulfilling, no matter what Tumblr would have you believe. I found it increasingly difficult to do various things — go to class, use public transport, get out of bed, eat, sleep, concentrate, speak to other humans, etc. Whenever I attempted to do any of these things or even thought about them, my heart would leap into my throat and my stomach would start to churn. I cannot adequately articulate what a panic attack feels like, but it is one of the most intense sensations I have ever experienced in my (admittedly privileged) life. It affects everyone differently, but generally your breathing becomes ragged and laboured, sweat collects in places you didn’t even know existed, your hands begin to tremble, and your brain basically screams “FUCK THIS MATE” at you like an enraged infant. For a very long time, I didn’t feel able to talk to anyone about this. I felt like it was such an irrational thing to be feeling that people would simply think I was pathetic and offer no sympathy or help. I gradually retreated inwardly more and more, not wanting to bother anyone else with my problems. One night, I lay in bed with a seemingly infinite number of unpleasant thoughts pulsing through my brain. I felt completely unmoored, as if my mind was running away from me. I had no control over what I was thinking, so I decided to try and exert some of the limited control I still had over my body. It was a stormy night (because of course it was), and I walked out into the rain in my pyjamas. I convinced myself that it was a good idea to distract myself from my thoughts by subjecting my body to something extreme, so I lay down in the wet mud for about an hour until I was shivering and convulsing with cold. I walked back to my room, looked at my ruined Buzz Lightyear PJ bottoms, and thought: “I should probably do something about this”. Talking about my anxiety was an overwhelmingly positive experience. The simple act of externalising something which had so far only existed inside of me felt like unbuckling a belt that had been steadily tightening around my chest over the course of a year. I wasn’t magically cured, but being open about it made a huge difference to my life and allowed me to take the steps I needed to take in order to get better. I had thought that talking about my feelings would make me seem weak, but I then read other people’s accounts of their experiences with mental illness and realised that they were some of the most brave, strongest people I’d ever come across. The work of organisations like Anxiety UK and Anxiety United helped me come to terms with what I was going through, and gave me the courage to seek help. So, I suppose that’s why I’ve written this. I think that the way we talk (and indeed don’t talk) about mental health can be incredibly damaging to vulnerable people who we should be trying to help. Those who open up about their mental health are all too often written off as attention-seekers or ignored altogether, and this attitude makes suffering in silence seem like a more compelling option than speaking candidly about something that affects countless people on a daily basis. By being honest about my experiences, I hope that I can help emphasise that mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. You are not alone. There are so many people out there who are willing and eager to offer you a helping hand. This, in my own feeble way, is me offering mine. Also, I’m hoping that sympathy will provoke girls with cool haircuts to offer me romance.",2015
The Pitfall of Perfectionism — How I Escaped.,"How trying to be the best kept me from being any good at all and the self-centered practices that helped me improve. Within a few years of graduating college, I already felt like a failure. I hadn’t gone to an Ivy league school. I had stayed in my hometown in Montana. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and I felt too old to start all over. Around that time, Facebook took off. All of a sudden, there were a thousand new ways to see the external accomplishments of my peers: The kid that went to Harvard was playing shows at Carnegie hall. The shy girl from 4th grade was now a fighter pilot. The popular girl from grade school was on track to be in the Olympics. One day, while running in the woods, she was attacked by a bear — who she fought off by hitting it in the face with a rock until it left her alone. She ran 14 miles home, unharmed save for a couple of scratches. (This earned her an interview spot on the Today show in New York, where she looked gorgeous as always). Later, I found out she went on a date with the guy who dumped me. My peers were becoming successful, remarkable, and educated. They were even becoming bear fighters. When I compared myself to them, I felt overwhelming fear that I wasn’t doing or being enough. My fear turned into anxiety. Which turned into panic attacks. Which turned into isolation as I avoided social situations out of fear of being “found out” as not good enough. I looked at everyone else’s perfect and happy lives and I didn’t understand why I couldn’t have the same. Perfectionism had gotten the best of me, and I hit rock-bottom. I became afraid of attempting anything that had even the smallest risk of failure. I spent my days hiding in my apartment, afraid of everything that awaited me in the outside world. I’d spend hours searching the internet trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Why couldn’t I just be brave? Why did I always feel so broken? After months of misery, I felt like I’d fallen so far behind my peers — enough to where I would never, ever catch up — that I did the only rational thing I could think of (and probably the first rational thing I’d done in a while): quit. I quit following people who were doing amazing things. I quit checking my Facebook. I quit trying to compete with anyone but myself. And it changed my entire life. I always looked at people around me and thought, “They’re so much smarter, more successful, and good looking. I bet it feels great to be them.” But spending the weekend at the home of someone I looked up to changed that. He was (and still is) one of the most intelligent people in his field. He’s admired by everyone who knows him for his perfect looks, perfect business savvy, perfect family, and wealth. I was invited to stay at his house with a close mutual friend. Though I’d never met him myself, I followed everything he did, and was giddy to see what it was like to have the perfect life. It took less than 3 hours before the social niceties of new acquaintances wore off. Soon he was talking down to his kids and wife. He was stressed. He was sharing how miserable he felt. He thought someone else was doing better than him and he needed to do things differently to compete. He talked endlessly about it. Somehow his perfect family, job, body, home, and education didn’t quench his thirst for perfection. He still didn’t feel worthy. That’s when I had a realization. If all these remarkable accomplishments hadn’t made him happy or feel good enough, what did it say about all the other people who I looked at as having better lives than me? This guy who seemed to “have it all” was comparing and competing with others, just like me. After that weekend, I found myself with a new lens to look at life. Instead of looking at other people to set my benchmarks, I started sitting down with myself regularly and asking: What am I spending most of my time and energy on right now? Am I doing this because I want to, or because I’m trying to compete with or please someone else? Is what I’m doing making me feel worthy and valuable? If not, how can I stop doing it? Am I doing what I said I would do to reach my goals? If not, is my goal too big or perfectionistic? How can I make it more reasonable? Are my actions more in line with who I want to be today than they were yesterday? Notice these questions focus on my own happiness, and not someone else’s. They also focus less on how I feel and more on how I behave, because I’ve found feelings and beliefs follow behaviors, not the other way around. These questions helped me choose goals that brought me happiness (and stopped me from focusing on people who I thought were doing better than me). But more importantly, they also changed how I interacted with the people who were “doing worse than me”, which is how I learned the next thing about perfectionism. One day a friend told me: “Just because someone is wrong, doesn’t mean it’s my job to tell them so.” My first reaction was disbelief. “Of course it’s your job to tell them they’re wrong! If you don’t tell them, they’ll keep perpetuating the wrongness. Whatever they do that is bad will spread like a disease. If I tell them they’re wrong, I’m doing what’s right for everyone.” Even after leaving the conversation, the conversation wouldn’t leave me. So I sat down with a pen and paper and I tried to think of examples of when someone had “set me straight” or given me unwarranted feedback or advice. Most of the memories, I didn’t remember their feedback, only that it made me feel shitty and unworthy. So why did I spend so much time correcting or calling out other people? Giving them advice and my feedback when they hadn’t asked for it? At first, I thought it was because I wanted to “help” them. But really, I was correcting people to feel like I was better than them. I was trying to be seen as valuable and smart. I was seen as an asshole. What’s worse, is my worthiness depended on feeling like I had the the higher ground to critique everyone else. So every time I made a mistake (whether someone called it out or not) I lost all of my worthiness. The paper in front of me had revealed the vicious cycle I was on: I felt poorly about myself, so I would critique other people, or give them advice to feel better about myself (which, for the record, did not work in raising my self esteem). Then I’d feel like I needed to be perfect in order to maintain the hierarchy. Then, when I inevitably made a mistake, my worthiness crumbled and I became anxious and depressed. To break the cycle, I had to start with what I could control: not criticizing other people. When I stopped calling out other people’s mistakes and trying to force my advice on people, my hierarchy began to crumble. I stopped feeling better than people when I noticed they made a mistake. And I stopped feeling constantly horrible when someone caught my mistakes. As I began to like myself — flaws and all — I gained the confidence to start creating again. To start contributing my experience and talent to the world. But I was surprised to find that it wasn’t my perfectly curated work that ended up lowering my anxiety about being perfect. The act of sharing my thoughts, my work, or my skills with the world has always scared me. I always believed that if someone doesn’t like my work it means they don’t like me. Not being likable is a perfectionist’s greatest fear. So I often abandoned a skill before I mastered it, because I always fell short of perfect. The first 10% of a skill was fun. I’d show and tell everyone, because I knew that it didn’t matter if I sucked; after all, I had just started. But when I’d hit 11% — 80% of learning a skill, I’d suck and I’d know it, and I couldn’t do any better. I’d know what being good at the skill looked like, and I’d see what my work looked like, and I would feel ashamed that I wasn’t better. I didn’t want people to know that I wasn’t perfect, so I would just stop trying and start something new. If I started something else, I could once again regain that 10% of freedom to suck. So at 22 years old, I had essentially no skills. I could do a very tiny bit of everything. But I wasn’t even mediocre at any of it. The only way I’ve been able to progress, to build skills, to move forward and feel valuable is to embrace and show off the sucky stuff. If my perfectionist side had it’s way, no one would ever see any of the work I’ve done. So when I give my partner the first draft of an article I’m writing, I usually hate the piece and think it should never see the light of day. While there’s usually a lot of editing to do, he almost always points out something he likes. It’s also helped me learn how to separate critiques from my own self-worth. When someone sees my shitty work and still likes me, it exercises my ability to deal with my own mistakes and like myself despite them. It also helps me take feedback and learn how to incorporate other perspectives, rather than thinking that I always know what’s best. And it helps me get things out into the world, instead of waiting to share them until they’re perfect. If I wasn’t willing to be vulnerable enough to share my shitty work, I’d be on my deathbed still deleting and re-writing the first article I ever published. By focusing on my own goals and progress, sharing my shitty work with people I trust, and not criticizing other people, I’ve found myself happier, healthier, and less anxious. It took time and practice, and I’m still figuring it out. I’m not perfect at trying not to be perfect. But now when I ask myself questions like — “Are my actions in line with who I want to be today? Is what I’m creating valuable? Do I know that I’m worthy?” — the answer, I’m proud to say, is usually “Yes”. If you’re as riddled with perfection inspired anxiety as I was, you might feel like there’s no way out. But there is. You just have to take the first step. I’ve put together a free panic attack checklist to help to show you how. Did this post make you think, smile, or entertain you? Please consider clicking the small heart below to “recommend” this piece — I’d really appreciate it.",2015
Recent Alum Standing Up for Student Mental Health at MIT,"Two years ago, I graduated from one of the most famous universities in the world, MIT. My whole body was truly happy from deep within when I grabbed my diploma and walked off the stage. Not because I was getting a diploma from one of the most prestigious universities in the whole world. But, I was happy to be liberated so that I could work on recovering form the extreme depression, anxiety, and numbness that I was dealing with at MIT. It would not be an overstatement to say that my four years at MIT was traumatizing on my mind, body, and spirit. Not only was I left in debt from student loans to pay; I was also left with lots of mental health issues to repair. And what more? I hadn’t learned nearly as much as I could have if I had been happy and healthy at MIT. I couldn’t believe it! After I graduated, all I could remember from MIT was seeing my friends and peers rushing anxiously to class or to the next place they had to go to. We would pass each other in hallways, sometimes not even noticing one another. Then the next day, I would hear that one of my friends had gone mad in their room, screaming and losing their mind. Or my next-door neighbor, who hadn’t slept for 3 days straight, would talk to me about feeling like a failure. And this was someone who had won awards in the Math Olympiad. My peers and classmates were all really smart students who had been admitted to MIT. But, I would hear crying often from the other side of the wall in my dormitory room. I would hear those around me being overwhelmed and stressed. I would see friends who were constantly taking pills to stay sane. And at times, I would wake up to hear in the news that a student in the neighboring dorm had committed suicide, and no one had found out about it for more than a week; until their body had started to smell. Going to university was scary for me. I, myself, reached a point where I didn’t care to be alive anymore. It is one thing to be challenged and it is another to be defying our human needs constantly. I came to MIT to be challenged, because being challenged can help us grow as individuals. But, at MIT, I was often pressured to defy my human needs for long periods of time, which can cause students to break down as individuals; and I personally did witness this break down in my friends and myself. This is how it was at MIT for most students I knew. Those students who cared for their health and needs were often seen to be “weak” by their peers, while those who endured unhealthy lifestyles and habits for long periods of time were glorified as being “hardcore.” And so, I’m going to be honest. This is how I lived my life at MIT: o I didn’t get enough sleep and struggled to maintain a regular sleep schedule. o I would often skip my meals since I didn’t have enough time to eat. o I would always be rushing past my friends in the hallways, feeling terrible for not having time to chat with them for more than a few seconds. o I rarely had time to exercise, relax, and have fun with friends. o Most of my time was spent doing schoolwork, and I was still always behind in my classes. o I didn’t even end up getting high grades even though I spent so much time doing work. o I kept feeling like I didn’t care to be alive anymore. o I had turned so numb and lifeless that my friends, family, and boyfriend were constantly worried for me and hurt by my lack of responsiveness. o I couldn’t stop thinking, “Why do I have to do this to myself?” **And I knew so many others at MIT who were just like me** Do you want to know how I am certainly sure that I was really not alone? I have recorded more than 45 other MIT students and alumni who were brave to come on camera and talk about their own hardships at MIT and how they wish to see student life improve. We think that student voices and videos will humanize mental health issues and help students see that there are many others who share their stories. We all know too well that sleep and a balanced life are necessary ingredients to our health. And students need to stay healthy to perform at their best and get a good education. I am now collaborating with other MIT students and alumni to make a feature-length documentary from the recorded student stories to raise awareness and start a conversation about student mental health issues at MIT and other universities. We are now in the process of fundraising to pay for the expenses of making this documentary titled “Sleep is for the Strong.” Sleeping should not be regarded as for the “weak.” Getting enough sleep is very important for health and wellbeing (see here). Sleep-deprivation can contribute greatly to depression, anxiety, and other health problems in college students. So, we want to bring attention to the importance of sleeping as we talk about mental health! You can join our effort and help us finish this documentary by contributing to our Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign. You can also share our campaign with friends to help us spread the word. The fundraising campaign ends on December 23rd. Join us in this movement to stand up for student mental health! Let’s reduce mental health suffering and prevent student suicides!",2015
"On Anxiety, non-monogamy, radical self-reliance and gaslighting:","Or how to craft a crumbling relationship cocktail Blindly, I have been searching. Collecting little snippets of data, stories from loved ones; again and again taking the emotional temperature of my inner circle and broader community. I can only speak from my own, subjective data. Please be patient. Keep reading. Because if you have landed here, it is most likely because you, or someone you love, has experienced this. The first thing I must say it that I have Anxiety. It has taken me over a year, several harrowing panic attacks, and the stubborn love of friends to get to the place where I can say that. The words still feel sticky and strange in my mouth. I also intentionally capitalize “Anxiety”, because it is a word far too casually slung about in our culture, devaluing the real symptoms that people experience. This non-specific language is one of the most destructive things we collectively do to those of us who experience this. So. I have Anxiety. The second thing I will say is that I have explored a wide variety of relationship structures. The Why is irrelevant. The How is much more interesting. The How is what brings us to the dense library of books and tools that people outside monogamy have built into their Canon of Knowledge. The How is where I went searching when relationships with various people would fall apart. The How is what I turned to a year ago when my anxiety so thoroughly dominated me that I saw no end to the spiral. When the panic attacks happened daily and my heart physically hurt in my chest for weeks, as the adrenaline became a slave-driver to my heartbeat. When I wondered HOW in the world, could a person like me; so proactive in my communication, so goddamn researched in my relationship practices, with so many allies and supports, be falling apart? Somewhere in there, all of the “right” things that I was doing were so very, very wrong for me. I was a failure. And I’m not the only one. Since then, I have dissected this idea of “right” and “wrong” enough to see how driven I was by the hidden peer pressure to be Polyer-Than-Thou. And watched countless friends exploring these same peer-reviewed pedagogies of: Non-Violent Communication Good, Giving and Game Law of Two Feet The Four Agreements (and many more) that are as hopelessly frustrated as my own. And it crosses over with those who have Anxiety in far too many cases to be a coincidence. So for those of you who are unclear by what I mean when I say Anxiety: The emotional symptoms include persistent, unrealistic and exaggerated fears that can affect different parts of someone’s life. The physical symptoms often include quickened pulse, trembling or shaking, muscle tension and stomach problems. Social anxiety is more specific to when these are brought on by people, or groups of people. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072779/) A panic attack, more specifically, is the abrupt onset of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and includes at least four of the following symptoms: (http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/panic-disorder-agoraphobia/symptoms) Things that bring on anxiety for ME: So how does this relate to non-monogamy and the communication tools we have collectively adopted? Why should you care? Because much of the Relationship Anarchy model (often assume to be the “most poly”), and the ways many others practice non-monogamy to varying degrees is based on Radical Self-Reliance. Kitty Stryker addresses the implosive/violent side-effects of this quite brilliantly: medium.com Here primary thesis is around the birth and ramifications of poly libertarianism, as outlined below: Poly Libertarianism“No one is responsible for anyone else’s emotions or meeting anyone else’s needs. There is no more co-dependence. There is interdependence, on a voluntary basis. Each member is an autonomous, free individual, who can come or go as she or he pleases. Our love is earned, not expected.”-Sara Burrows In this model we are contending with: Let me be clear: none of these things are inherently wrong. What we have done with them however, is make this the basis of a peer-imposed mentality. At a time, these ideas were revelatory. We were removing ourselves from the grips of oppressive relationship narratives. We were evening the privilege playing field in our intimate partnerships by combating the historical dynamics of dependencies and obligation. We were empowering ourselves. And yet, these are now concepts imposed from others. Demanded by our lovers. They are again Oppressive. And this oppression gains more ground, as our writing on non-monogamy and the tools we use to navigate it assume an equal playing field of mental health. I am going to explain this using Spoon Theory.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) Imagine a mentally “healthy”, non-monogamous person chooses to practice poly libertarianism (as Stryker defines it). They have 12 spoons to start. Those spoons are not just for their relationships, but for balancing their entire life. Let’s give it some standard catagories: If this person is giving each of these aspects time and attentions, then they *might* have 4 spoons left for romantic connection. Four spoons to handle instability, rapid changes, self-reliance demands etc. Now imagine the person under these same circumstances has Anxiety. They are being asked to practice poly libertarianism. If they have exactly the same triggers as I do, or can swap one or two out for something else, they are being asked to devote SEVEN spoons to their relationships. Why? Because these triggers take effort to contend with every day. To play the olympic level of mental gymnastics it takes to identify, catalogue, soothe and communicate about each of these triggers. IF someone has even reached that Dewy Decimal level of understanding/ organizing their Anxiety. So 7 spoons are being used up. That leaves 5. But the business of life requires 8. So what happens? Either a relationship suffers or the rest of life does. And it compounds further. See, Anxiety is a fear-based, fear-motivated experience. Things out of balance trigger Anxiety. Not knowing if basic survival needs will be met triggers Anxiety. See how this cocktail is beginning to shape up? A human with Anxiety is attempting to navigate a poly-libertarian varietal of non-monogamy. They will want tools. Because these tools provide security. Because these tools help to reduce the number of “occupied” spoons needed to relate. They mitigate risk by offering road maps. We tell them to turn - for example- to Non-Violent Communication (by Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg) which many other theories have since been based on. These tools can be heart-opening, vulnerable, healing. But they also imply and expect a high level of mental stability from the practitioner. To be explicit: they require a person with a high number of available spoons. I’ll throw this article in, because I think everyone should read it: www.elephantjournal.com Now how does one with Anxiety communicate their emotions when their body has gone numb and they cannot FEEL ANYTHING? When they are running on 3 spoons out of 12, like the Enterprise on its last back-up engine? How does one communicate a need non-violently, coherently, when the words have dried up? Even those who do not identify as having Anxiety find that this level or articulation while being “flooded” (as John Gottman defines the effects of strong emotions/ chemical release in our bodies and brain stem) is near impossible. And then this uneven expectation for clarity and articulation — through the ableist tools our partners expect- will set off its own fear spiral….Because there is raw fear (perhaps caused by several of the 7 triggers/spoons listed above), layered with a fear of the fear, and then a fear of a panic attack, and then the fear of inflicting damage on others in the process- and then OH GOD THIS HURTS- and the pain is scary- and WILL THIS PAIN KILL ME… (it goes on and on). All I have to say is OH HELL NO. If I, with all my baggage around disconnecting from my emotions at critical times, who tends to completely stone-wall in intense situations just to be able to *process* and function (yes, these are my growing edges), have managed to identify an emotion, then found the words to COMMUNICATE that emotion, while facing the potential unsafety, rejection etc. it needs to be addressed RIGHT NOW. And it might have taken my last spoon to tell you. In this instance, the act of forcing a human compromised by an Anxiety response to articulate in a normative manner is oppressive and privileged and ableist. Because you have maybe never *struggled* to identify your emotions. Or muster the courage to voice them amidst turmoil. Or had them rise up to the same decibel as someone with Anxiety. Not everyone experiences the full range of emotional intensity. And there is no judgement when I say that. In that situation, if you are the one supporting someone with Anxiety while they attempt to express their emotions or label them, while functioning with insufficient spoons, the only answer that will draw them closer to you, that will build that bridge of trust, is “YES, that is what you are feeling.” (Actually a very NVC response at it’s core, but often twisted by those wanting to intellectualize the experience.) Because more so than with someone that has all the necessary spoons to handle emotions, someone with Anxiety is likely to internalize intellectual/verbally driven tactics as Gaslighting. The first thing to know about Gaslighting is that it does not have to be intentional to be experienced. And if you are not familiar with Gaslighting, please take a minute: everydayfeminism.com I will state at this point that Gaslighting is a particularly insidious abuse for someone with Anxiety. Why? Gaslighting is the emotional equivalent of punching someone while they’re down. If a human functioning on reduced spoons, flooded with fear and trauma chemicals is belittled, shamed, judged or manipulated in those moments, the damage done is an order of magnitude deeper than someone with normative mental function. As one who had been carefully cutting away the scar tissue from these wounds can attest, they set up patterns of intense self-doubt in the moments when confidence is most essential, often creating years of thought habits that must be deconstructed. Imagine here the psychological version of belittling a child in a wheelchair who grows up to hate themselves for the ways they are different and less functional in our ableist-rewarding society. Yes. That sounds like shit doesn’t it? ………………………………………………………………………………………. So how does one pull themselves up out of the abyss of Anxiety? And how is it in opposition to radical self-reliance and the highly-verbal solutions of NVC? It’s different for everyone. My methods are even different when I’m alone vs. with others. When someone is choosing to be present with my Anxiety, or when I have even dared to admit that I am feeling it, I need: Radical Self-Reliance does not make space for this kind of human interdependence. NVC does not articulate this kind of work, as it demands intellectual/ verbal understanding first. These paradigms are in opposition to the solutions for someone filled with Anxiety — perhaps with the spoons of a 4 year old having a tantrum, only more nuanced and less visible to the untrained eye. I call this need interdependence. Not co-dependence. For the ways that I must ask for help. For trust. Because my wellbeing really does depend on it. Because I make it my work to offer this kind of care and safety to others who ask. Because this is a year’s worth of dissecting myself enough to call out my triggers and how I wasn’t taking responsibility for them. Because I know that I CAN process these things alone, but my work is learning to heal with HELP from others. Is that scary as fuck? YES. And also, it is my sincerest hope that as we dismantle some of these ideas, the relationship landscape will become safer, more transparent to the biases and baggage we bring with us. I am not going to spell out EVERY possible connection between these ideas, because I am hoping that if you’ve read these other pieces along the way, you don’t need me to. The drink has already been mixed with the spoons I have available. I’ll repeat my question from earlier: Why should you care? About any of this, really? Because — as Brene Brown puts it — we are creatures wired for connection. That’s why anyone I know is exploring alternative relationship structures. Because they want to CONNECT. And that connection is not all sunshine and sex. And yes, we have to do our own work. But the next step is doing the bigger work. The work that cannot be done alone. One piece of that work is examining the internalized shame and stigma associated with Anxiety. And that is work built on compassion and safety. A piece on connection that elaborates: www.theawl.com So let’s step up. Let’s work on some new infusions in our cocktails and tools in our relationship arsenals. Vulnerability maybe? Worthiness? And maybe we can move away from this intense fear of needing each other. Because as much as we want to fight it, we do. Lastly, I’ll leave you with this:",2015
Retroactive Jealousy,"What is Retroactive Jealousy? Retroactive Jealousy is the relatively modern term given to a condition that is characterised by obsessive thoughts about a partner’s sexual past. It is a branch of generalized anxiety, where the symptoms manifest around habitual, obsessional behaviours that constantly trigger the anxious response. Many people often live with retroactive jealousy for years and feel psychologically crippled by the conflict between the intrusive thoughts and their overall rationality about their relationship. Intrusive thoughts are normal as it is part of the rationalisation process, however people with retroactive jealousy often obsess over these thoughts and confuse the body into thinking that the imaginative scenario is real. This is widely believed to be a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which can be hard to tackle alone. Many sufferers of retroactive jealousy feel inclined to explore intrusive, sexual thoughts about their partners with other people. These people could be from previous relationships, one-night-stands, adultery or simply figments of the imagination. The nature of the intrusive thoughts are irrational and people with retroactive jealousy are often stigmatised, due to how easily the condition links to blame and judgement of the other person. However, it is quite often the case that people with the condition do not choose to have the thoughts; they are often resigned to living with them. Retroactive jealousy is the result of a solidified thought habit, that subsequently triggers the symptoms of anxiety. It is because of these symptoms that the intrusive thoughts are enhanced and the physical feelings that follow these thoughts are intensified. It is common for people with the condition to over-think aspects of the condition in order to be ‘ok’ with it. This only serves to enhance its importance and results in the thoughts becoming part of the default thought routine. People are often ‘burdened’ with the condition for a long time due to the belief that irrational behaviours can overcome an irrational condition. The Symptoms of Retroactive Jealousy The symptoms of this condition can be categorised into two different groups — the psychological and the physical. Psychological symptoms: Physical symptoms: Where does Retroactive Jealousy come from? Retroactive jealousy occurs as a result of a combination of factors. Below is an extract taken from Retroactive Jealousy Finally, I’m Out summarizing where the condition comes from: Perhaps the main cause of the persistent thoughts and feelings is the underlying anxiety that accompanies the condition. Anxiety causes the nausea, restlessness, looping thoughts and obsessive behaviours. It also leaves us vulnerable to more intrusive thoughts. Anxiety leaves us with a stimulated nervous system, which then perpetuates our anxious response to unwanted thoughts. Basically, the average retroactive jealousy sufferer has a lot more adrenaline in their bloodstream than the average ‘normal’ person. The way we are raised contributes enormously to our beliefs and values. This inevitably throws a spanner in the works when trying to deal with an irrational problem in a somewhat rational manner. The way we are conditioned, even from birth, massively affects our outlook on life, love and relationships. We are affected by family, friends, school, work, the media, religion, etc. A person’s perspective is a vital part of challenging the condition. Even the most empathetic and intelligent of people, who perhaps regard themselves as open-minded, may sometimes have to shift their perspective of retroactive jealousy. Perspective can be changed with a little bit of work and a self-interest in wanting to better one’s self. Self-esteem is interwoven with retroactive jealousy and also ties in with self-perspective. This doesn’t just mean sexual insecurity, but also existential security and overall outlook on life outside of the relationship. Linked to social conditioning; research has shown that gender inequality significantly contributes to the feelings of retroactive jealousy. The problem is the overall status and perception of women globally. Gender inequality is still rife and this would inevitably been ingrained within us as part of growing up — despite what our views and beliefs are now at this current moment. As a society in the 21st century, we are surrounded by a massive assortment of media platforms and enormous data sources where sex is at the core. This includes the mass collection and availability of adult related sites across the web. Ultimately, sex sells. It also places an enormous importance on sex and inevitably holds the power to shape our perspective of sex as time goes by. This also ties into self-image, self-worth, esteem and so on. The origins of retroactive jealousy will be subjective to the individual. A deep analysis and counselling would be helpful to structure an approach to dealing with the condition. Siding with the rational mind during this condition can be hard to achieve, so intervention and help from a professional is highly recommended. Retroactive Jealousy Book by The Panic Room Retroactive Jealousy Finally, I’m Out is a self-help book for people who suffer from the condition. It is written by best-selling author and trained counsellor, Joshua Fletcher, who is also a previous sufferer of the condition and has successfully overcome it. Joshua wrote the book in order to help and educate others with retroactive jealousy, as well as offering counselling and advice for those suffering alone. He has condensed all you need to know into an easily accessible book. The book has helped hundreds of people around the world. You can buy the book by clicking the cover or by clicking here.",2015
How to get out of a rut,"I’m pretty lucky. I’ve accomplished most of my goals. I have a great marriage and a successful business that we grew out of nothing. I have good health and incredible friends and family. I’m fairly happy just living my daily life. I also have the mental health demons that many creative people face. We just listened to Felicia Day’s book (so good. the creative process! dealing with mental health! the internet! gamer gate! World of Warcraft! it’s a story that touches so close to my own). Wil Wheaton talked about his struggles recently. Mike Monteiro had something to say on the subject. Now, if you are in a deep cycle OCD spin, or your depression is eating chunks of your life, or your anxiety is whispering lies in your head there is help out there. I have a great therapist if you need a recommendation. When I haven’t slept in days it’s time for a little help from Lorazapam. A good combo of working through your shit and accepting a little pharma help is a journey, but well worth it. I’m lucky to be in a family that has started to openly talk about our mental health. We lost one of our rank a few years ago when he couldn’t take it any more. I wish the conversation had started sooner. It’s genetic for us. It’s hard to struggle with this stuff if you live a charmed life and a story-book ideal childhood. There is no reason for you to not be happy! Yeah, that’s how mental health bullshit works. It can be hard to keep tabs on. I like really dark, industrial music. I have always gravitated towards the morbid and macabre. This is one way I keep tabs on things though. My favorite industrial artist has a lot of songs about anxiety and not sleeping and the demons. One song in particular I use as a litmus test. The closer I identify with the song, the more I know it’s time to focus on getting out of the darkness. There are times where it can play in the background and I barely notice it. There are other times where I hone in on every word and it speaks The Truth to me. This article isn’t about those really dark times though. This article is about the blah, the meh, the hrumph times. Let’s say that it’s just a random Saturday and you don’t want to do anything. But you want to do something. But…goddamn. I’ve been stuck in this gray spot for what seems like an eternity. We are working towards a pretty big project/goal in our lives. It requires patience, there is a 50% chance it won’t happen, and a 50% chance that we’ll need to pack up everything we own in a matter of weeks. The unknown and the instability is killing me. We’ve been in limbo for months, which means that my normal creative outlets are all on hiatus. I don’t want to spend any money or make any plans or get into anything. This gives my brain lots of extra time to spend on obsessive compulsive thoughts. Great. Fucking terrific. It’s times likes these when I ask myself what I used to do with my time. The same way we all puzzle around how I lived alone, didn’t cook, and didn’t have the internet. How did I fill those days? More importantly, what did I eat? So, during those times when you need a template to pull yourself out of rut, here is my working version: I’m going to take my own advice. I’m going to find some cool things to laser for my sister-in-law’s advent calendar. I’m going to go cut down some trees and screw them to a board and make it festive as shit all up in here. I’m going to spatchcock a chicken and make Tom Kha Gai soup. I’m going to listen to a podcast and then I might clean out some of the stuff I’ve saved in Instapaper. Get to it. This is your life, even the gray moments.",2015
How I Learned to Manage my Lifelong Insomnia,"I suffered from terrible insomnia for most of my adult life. This topic came up again recently (thank you @rob_rix), so I decided I’d finally take the time to write a post about it in hopes that it may help someone. First and foremost, let me note that insomnia is often a symptom of depression and anxiety — and can be related to undiagnosed medical conditions like thyroid dysfunction — so it’s important to talk to a doctor and make sure any underlying conditions are being properly treated first. That being said, I suffered for decades trying to get help from more than one doctor and I always got the same condescending nonsense like “try drinking warm milk” and everything else that someone who has been researching this issue for years would've already tried. To be clear, this piece isn’t intended for people with occasional sleeplessness, for whom “have you tried taking melatonin?” is a reasonable suggestion and not the sort of question that makes you want to scream. This is for people like me who have suffered from serious insomnia for so long that they have become willing to make meaningful life changes to address it. This is what worked for me. Your mileage may vary. I think it’s important to know that over the past decade or so, I have significantly changed my life in order to manage both my anxiety and insomnia. I’ve made a lot of changes that will probably seem like too much work for most people. But for me, feeling calm, rested, and energetic most days — I have more energy than I did in my 20s and 30s, even though I’m in my 40s now — is worth the attendant sacrifices. I also made these changes gradually over the years, not all at once, which made things easier. Here are the strategies I employ today: I hope this helps someone. Good night and good luck.",2015
Don’t Stress the Test: 5 Tips for Managing Test Anxiety,"Most people get a little nervous before they take a test, but some people get really nervous. They get butterflies in their stomach, a headache, their heart races, they start to sweat, and sometimes feel like they are going to pass out or throw up — or both. Even if the symptoms of test anxiety are mild, many students report that the feeling itself is enough to cause their minds to go “blank” to the point that they freeze up and feel like don’t know the answers to the questions — even if the first question is “What is your name?” If you or someone you love suffers from test anxiety, it’s important to know that you aren’t alone. Very few people go into a test without feeling at least some bit of stress, and that feeling is actually a good thing! If we didn’t feel stress or worry at all, why would we study or prepare for the tests? Why would we try our hardest? The stress spurs us on to work hard before and during the test. The difficulty that people who struggle with test anxiety face is that they fear the actual process of taking the test and the test itself. Here are some tips to prepare for the test and to get you through the process: Taking tests is part of life, but with a little practice and preparation, you can ease your test stress and increase your confidence!",2015
Facebook’s Mental Health Problem,"That October I suffered my first bout of depression in over 10 years. Once I realised what was going (it took me a while), I swiftly pulled out of all work projects and withdrew to the care of very close friends and the quiet safety of my home. I tried to read books and failed; I tried to watch films and couldn’t focus for more than a few minutes at a time. My attention span, never a soldier, had shrivelled up. So I found myself clutching my phone and switching between the Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter apps for hours at a time. Not to post — I couldn’t think of anything — but to consume. Yet with every double-tap on the home button, with every pull-to-refresh motion, things got worse. Every receding wave left a despair more profound than the one before — yet every time I wanted nothing more than the comforting waters to return. Pull to refresh. It was a sensation like nothing I’d known before, like consuming a particularly vile drug: A quickening of the heartbeat, a wave of warmth and comfort, then a bleak, sickly, and tense emptiness, like the tide withdrawing from the shore and leaving nothing but loneliness in its damp wake. No matter how desperately I clutched at it, the water ran through my fingers, and every receding wave left a despair more profound than the one before— yet every time I wanted nothing more than the comforting waters to return. Pull to refresh. It was a nauseating vicious cycle, and I had to get out. There was no one there to help me because I wouldn’t have known how to explain it. All I had were brief instances when the fog lifted a little and I was able to see that something bad was going on. I waited for one of those instances, then mustered all available energy and made what seemed, at the time, one of the most important decisions of my life: I deleted the Facebook app. Then Instagram. Then Twitter. I turned off all notifications, of which there’d been many. Except for text messages and calls from close friends and family, my phone was now silent. The world was suddenly much smaller, much more manageable, much more intimate. It allowed me to get better. And a few weeks later, without much thinking about it, I was back on social media. The story might have ended there—had my depression not returned with a vengeance in the spring, plunging me right back into that horrible, horrible vicious cycle. Off the social apps went. But this time, maybe because I needed something to hold on to and pseudo-scientific inquiry felt like a good enough straw, I set out to understand what exactly was going on here. It quickly turned out that it wasn’t just me. The friends and acquaintances I spoke to who had been through episodes of depression all told similar stories: during depression, social media was off limits. Some had taken breaks. Others had deleted their accounts. One had been ordered by his therapist to get off Facebook. Nobody had given it much thought. Most considered it simply another of the many mysteries surrounding depression, this weird disease of which not very much is known except common symptoms and general statistics. Common symptoms: You’re very low on energy. You can’t concentrate. You can’t deal with people. You can’t deal with stress. You may suffer headaches, back pain, sleeping disorders, and wildly varying appetite. Most of the time, you are not so much sad but catatonic. You just don’t feel anything. Except like a loser. And you can’t escape it. As Sylvia Plath wrote: “[W]herever I sat — on the deck of a ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok — I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.” General statistics: The German Ministry for Education and Research states that the probability of experiencing major depression once in your life lies between 16 and 20 percent in Germany, where I live. The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health says that in 2012, an estimated 16 million adults in the US, or 6.9 percent of the adult population, had suffered at least one major depressive episode in the past year. The World Health Organisation estimates there are 350 million people suffering from depression globally, and that by 2020 it will be the second most widespread disease in the world. This is shoddy statistics, but: 350 million people is one quarter of Facebook’s global user base. There is no scientific research to back up my claim or explain this link between depression and social media use — or at least I haven’t been able to find any. There are plenty of studies into how social media may cause depression, but the evidence is thin: For every study claiming proof that social media is harmful, there’s another saying it isn’t. (One study from the University of Missouri from February 2015 basically tried to settle the debate by saying it all depends on how you use it. Stalk acquaintances and compare your life to theirs, and bang, here comes depression. Dotingly check on your friends and family, and you’ll be happy. Which begs the question: Have the researchers ever actually used Facebook?) “Oh yes, I see that a lot,” my psychiatrist said matter-of-factly when I asked her whether her other depressive patients were also unable to use social media. “One even dumped her phone recently.” Yet while there may be no research into the effect social media may have on an already existing depression, to specialists that effect appears so obvious that it isn’t even particularly noteworthy. “Oh yes, I see that a lot,” my psychiatrist at the Psychiatric University Clinic of Berlin’s Charité hospital said matter-of-factly when I asked her whether her other depressive patients were also unable to use social media. “One even dumped her phone recently.” That’s because social media and constant availability cause stress, she explained. “Also, when you’re suffering from depression, you don’t usually want to see other people’s amazing lives.” Seeking more explanations, I went all the way up the food chain to Professor Isabella Heuser, director of the Charité’s Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, who swiftly confirmed my psychiatrist’s assessment of the incompatibility of depression and social media. (While nearly all patients she’s seen stay off social media altogether, she did concede that some patients go on Facebook when they can’t sleep at night, although she says they generally don’t, or can’t, talk about their depression on the platform and don’t get anything positive out of the experience). I laid out to her what I’d found out through self-observation. “Well, it’s easy to explain that physiologically,” Professor Heuser said when she heard the last point. “Through your daily engagement with social media your brain has learned that when you log on in the morning, a pleasant feeling will follow. Escapism, a positive world. That’s dopamine, anticipation, and you can still experience that. However, the positive feeling that usually follows — your organism can’t mount that response anymore. That’s a classic symptom of depression. You can’t feel joy or connection to others anymore.” And because my brain knows what joy used to feel like, she explained, its absence, that emptiness, is experienced subconsciously as painful. The fact that I found it so hard to resist the lure of said dopamine release was also easy to explain, she said: “Will has to do with energy. And depression is characterised precisely by a lack of energy.” And as far as my attention span went, well, if it had been low before, depression may now simply have pushed it below a threshold that I considered tolerable. I took to my Facebook feed in search of material and the further I went back, the more jealous I felt at my own life as I had portrayed it. So far, so medically straightforward. But what about the sudden sense of inferiority? I told Professor Heuser of one particularly crass example: Shortly before my second break-down, an artist friend had asked me to participate in a video examining the way we portray ourselves and our accomplishments, both online and off. I was to read out a few of my own social media posts. I took to my Facebook feed in search of material and the further I went back, the more jealous I felt at my own life as I had portrayed it. There they were, my glowing posts from Istanbul, Tokyo, and New York City, my tales of adventures in the West Bank and the Baltic Sea, the stories I’d written and magazines I’d edited, my clever commentary on current affairs, all rounded off by likes and comments from people I’d met (or not) at some point in my life — irrevocable proof that I’d once been successful, popular, joyful, happy even. At roughly 12 months into the past I was so overcome by self-pity that I had to break the whole thing off. Professor Heuser thought for a moment. “That’s only indirectly related to social media,” she finally said. “People suffering from depression are incredibly creative at convincing themselves they are losers. But we live in a world that’s hyper-communicative — not really communicative, but narcissistic. Everybody is always ‘sharing’ something, only that it isn’t really sharing, it’s posting something to a wall in the hope that as many people as possible will come past and ‘like’ it. The purpose is to feed our narcissism. It is a many-voiced monologue, a cacophony. Everybody is posting something, but we aren’t talking to each other.” This isn’t novel criticism to be levelled at either social media or contemporary culture, and under any other circumstance, I would have waved it away as Luddite. However, now for the first time in over 10 years of social media use did I actually understand it, feel the truth of it in my guts—and I realised to what extent I had happily played along. I was reminded of that famous quote by Carl Gustav Jung, the founder of analytical psychology: “Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself.” To a healthy person, some phoney dialogue might appear tedious at worst. But to someone suffering from depression, the superficiality of social media may just be outrightly harmful. That’s an issue the media technologist and writer Deanna Zandt addressed in a talk she gave at Personal Democracy Forum in June 2015. Zandt presented the audience with a sample of photos from her social media feeds. In all of them she was all smiles; she was also, she revealed, at the time spiralling into the worst depressive period of her life. “The dissonance that was created for me by what was actually happening in my life versus what I thought I should be publicly sharing with my community made my condition that much worse.” “All of this is leading us down this dangerous path of alienation. And not just from each other, but from our own selves. We’re walking down a technological thrust into collective depressive dissonance.” Zandt blames digital culture’s focus on purity for blowing up the scale at which how we present ourselves in public differs from how we actually feel. “All of this is leading us down this dangerous path of alienation. And not just from each other, but from our own selves. We’re walking down a technological thrust into collective depressive dissonance.” Instead of building tools for “silly human mammals” who are “easily trained by positive reinforcement,” she argues, technologists should embrace the messiness of human life and put it into the core of the products they build. She doesn’t purport to know what this would look like, but her demand is clear: Digital culture should allow for that space between authenticity, connection, and vulnerability — in other words, intimacy. Deanna Zandt, I hear you. But I am no media technologist. My solution to the problem posed by the incompatibility of depression and social media didn’t aim to change anyone’s life but my own. Yet maybe it was no less radical: Ruthlessly dispose of all fake intimacy and superficial interactions and focus what little energy I had on real connection. Take my feeble attention span and put it into the equivalent of an incubator. Learn to consider myself a worthy human being without the positive reinforcement of Twitter favs. Which reminds me: Do people still call them favs? I have been mostly off social media for seven months now. I have also deleted all non-social apps that trigger dopamine release and lure with escapism, like shopping apps and games. When I want to escape, I read a novel, and when I can’t concentrate, I go for a walk. I often leave the house without my phone. I have sworn off multitasking to the extent that for a while, I’ve even stopped listening to music while I work. And it made me feel a lot better. Sometimes I wish I were strong enough to delete my account on Facebook, which I now regard as the most dangerous of all social networks. As it is, I’ll keep my URL blocker on, limiting my daily dispense of methadone to 10 minutes and appreciating that they’ve made a separate Messenger app. This wasn’t an easy article for me to write, and an even harder one to publish. I have become a much more private person in recent months and anyway, writing about depression does not fit with the professional version of myself I used to present online. But while I’m worried about exposure, I also believe depression should be something we talk about more openly—everything else just feels ridiculous at this point. Ultimately I, like many other people, will have to find a way to cope with social media, just like I’ve had to learn to cope with the ready availability of sugary foods: through awareness and self-control. I don’t expect Twitter or Facebook to help me, just like I don’t expect Kraft Foods to do so. But I’d like to at least be aware of the risk factors — be they a propensity for diabetes, or depression.",2015
My Experience with Depersonalization(dp) and Derealization(dr),"The two disorders usually occur together. The first time I experienced Depersonalization was at a restaurant. It was just like any other ordinary day, hanging out with friends, having a nice time. When we were talking, all the sudden my vision changed, everything looked two-dimensional. Not knowing what was happening I began to panic and rushed out of the restaurant and tried to get some fresh air, but this feeling of being unreal did not stop! I Headed back home in a hurry and took a nap. When I woke up, everything felt normal again. It was mandatory for me to Google what had happened. I found out what I had experienced was an anxiety attack. Few days passed, I had been stressing a lot about my exam results for a week or two before the anxiety attack. When I heard my results were out, the same feeling of “un-realness” was back and this time it would not stop and I experienced 15 minutes of hell which felt like an eternity, this time it was a panic attack. Its difficult to explain how scary feeling depersonalized is, the closest thing to depersonalization is a bad trip on marijuana that does not stop. Waking up to this feeling every morning is just the worst. Staying in my room made me feel better and safe, so I isolated myself. I would constantly give the silliest of excuses to anyone who wanted to meet me. By doing so I developed social anxiety. Asking me to leave my house was like asking me to go sky diving. I constantly turned to Google looking for help, in the process I would read comments such as “ Depersonalization lasts for 10–20 years” ,which just made my anxiety sky rocket. Staying in my room all the time, being paranoid about any small sensation, thinking it could be some disease and self diagnosing myself using Google. Being this way just made my anxiety worse. I woke up one day to see static in my vision. You guessed right, I thought I was turning blind. This static is something called visual snow, just another symptom of anxiety. I stayed in my room everyday, thinking it would just stop one day. I was wrong, it had been 2 months since I left my house, I was surely ready to stay at home for longer. The third month of dp/dr I received a call from my cousin brother and he was quite annoyed about the way I was behaving and gave me a butt kicking over the phone. Thats when I did feel I was being selfish as I was ignoring my parents, my friends and just keeping to myself. This was when I FINALLY decided to do something about it, rather than just sitting at home waiting for some miracle to happen. First step for me was to change my views on dp/dr. I kept referring to it as a “problem” or “disorder”. So, I started to visualize dp/dr as a different perspective of life, one which not everyone gets to experience. This phase was acceptance, accepting that this is something totally normal and the more you worry the longer it lasts. If you treat dp/dr as something positive, that’s when the anxiety reduces. Secondly, I quit having caffeine and alcohol (10 months since I last drank alcohol and 3 months since I had any caffeine). I resumed exercise, maintained a healthy diet. Exercise is what helped me through this, If you are experiencing dp/dr, I highly recommend you start maintaining a healthy life style. Third, this was the most difficult step for me, getting back to socializing or going to any other place apart from the gym. I couldn't sit in a restaurant for more than 10–15 mins. Always excused myself from the table to go out for a walk for 15 mins , contemplating whether I should go home or try giving it another shot. I always chose to go back home. It was difficult to go out and stay there, but I kept trying. It was really hard for my friends to understand why I was acting this way, but they were always supportive. So one fine day I told myself “No matter how bad the anxiety gets, you WILL NOT GO HOME”. That’s what happened, the anxiety did increase when I was at the restaurant, but I stayed. I stayed till all of us decided to leave. That just gave me a huge boost in confidence. Finally, DON’T GOOGLE ! I think Google is easily anxiety’s worst enemy. That moment when you have a slight twitch and you Google it and the results say multiple sclerosis. It’s not going to help reduce your stress in any way possible. Listen to music, sing even if you cant. Do anything other than thinking about dp/dr. 5 months have passed since dp/dr began. It was much better than what it used to be. But I still had mild visual snow and the “un-real” feeling. I went through my daily activities to check what I had been doing that might have been stressful. Clearly it was gaming and a bad sleep cycle, I would sleep at 4am and wake up at 1pm. Finish my work in the evening and start gaming again from 9pm to 4am. This was clearly bad for me, I cut down gaming to just an hour a day. Started reading more, going out more, anything that made me stay away from the computer, I did it. Today I can tell you that I am almost back to normal (90% recovered). Its been a struggle, but definitely better than not doing anything about it. If you have any questions. Please email me at vijai.adhithya@gmail.com. I will write another blog to answer frequently asked questions as it becomes slightly difficult to reply to everyone who message me on social media. :)",2015
16 Things you miss when you’re on a psych ward,"I checked myself back into the hospital last week. It was a last resort kind of thing, and I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal. I had self harmed though not badly (if there’s such a thing as wimpy self harm, I have done it) and after a med change and some consultation on my migraines, I’m doing much better. However, here are a few things you miss when you’re in a psych ward.",2015
Depression,"It is a scary thing to do — to put your story on the Internet. So many before me have done it, to my great admiration. I have been trying to write this for 8 months now. I once published a version of this anonymously. Ironic, that I would write a piece emphasising the importance of being open about mental health through sharing our stories to combat stigma, and share it without my name. This is me trying again. Just over a year ago when I was still at university, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety — one of the most common combinations. In hindsight, I’ve struggled with both throughout my life. The Internet is filled with similar stories, but I share this in the hope that it might help just one person and make good come from bad… because it was a similar (albeit much better written) article that made me realise I wasn’t broken, beyond help or, most importantly, alone. I went to a good university, and it was an amazing experience that I am so lucky to have had. Without it, I wouldn’t be who I am now. However, it also exposed weaknesses I never knew I had — something I’m sure is the case for many others. A year on, I’m not sure I totally understand what happened to me or why. I’m not sure I ever will. All I know is that right now, after everything, I feel so much stronger. And I want to make a difference. I don’t think it happened over night — but at some point I suddenly realised that everything had become impossible. I wasn’t doing any of the things a human does to basically survive (eat, for example), and I didn’t care about anything (or anyone) anymore. For an extended period of time I hadn’t felt any emotions at all, and spent a large amount of my time feeling as if I wasn’t in my own body but just spectating. I was simply existing — if you can even call it that. I would walk around, do what was needed or expected of me, then crawl back into my bed until my next obligation. Eventually, I stopped getting out of bed. After said period of feeling nothing, I then started to feel all of the emotions… sad ones. I liken depression to desperately trying to climb out of a well that keeps getting deeper, until eventually you can’t see any light at the top. I started to lose myself. When I did make it outside into the world, I occasionally got so overwhelmed by life that I would just break down, unable to move, regardless of where I was or what I was trying to do. My boyfriend at the time would often come and find me and take me home. Every time this happened, I grew more and more afraid of leaving my room. I drank so much alcohol in the evenings in an attempt to escape the reality of what I was feeling that I totally lost control. I alienated people around me and I put myself in danger. I turned up to my counselling appointments still drunk from the night before. I ‘indulged’ in self-harm, believing that it was what I needed and what I deserved. I made a couple of meagre attempts at suicide and sank even lower when I failed. If it weren’t for a few dedicated people, I probably wouldn’t be here — and sadly I didn’t make it easy for them, either. Not seeing friends and family was easier than seeing them and explaining that I hadn’t done anything for three days because I felt like a waste of space/oxygen/life who would be better off dead. Also, telling your friends that you tried to kill yourself the night before is fucking awkward. Although, I guess my point with this is that it shouldn’t be. Those who love you will want to help, and I have learned the hard way that it hurts them to deprive them of that opportunity. Other highlights include: Looking back, I sometimes struggle to accept that I went through it because it doesn’t feel real. I don’t recognise myself when I revisit the memories; I had lost all sense of reality, self, and perspective. I realise now that I was ill. I eventually reached out to my closest friend — she bundled me up, convinced me to stay at her house for a while, and took amazing care of me. Another friend took me to the doctor. I remember sitting in the doctor’s waiting room thinking I didn’t need to be there and that the trip was a waste of everyone’s time. It makes me smile thinking about it now. I was put on antidepressants and had to come clean with my friends (who had already guessed from my behaviour), family (awkward, though they couldn’t have been lovelier), tutors (even more awkward) and try to rebuild everything I had destroyed. Recovery was a slow, drawn out process but I think I’m there now. I pushed myself through final year exams and got a 2:1. I’m three months into a full time job that I love. I haven’t told them about this — I guess they’ll find out now. I still struggle every now and again, but less. The anxiety remains. I actively try to practice Self Care. Sometimes life gets a bit overwhelming, but I get the impression it does for most people. I have been bowled over by the number of people I have spoken to about depression who have also struggled with it, or have had someone close to them suffer. I was shocked to find out that close family members of mine have silently struggled with it, too. I was overcome by how many people held out their hand to me in solidarity and support when I was struggling. Every story I heard encouraged me to believe that what I was going through was real, that I was not alone, and that it would get better. However, I also realised first hand how much stigma (and ignorance) exists around mental health. I faced phrases such as: “pull yourself together”, “think of all the people in the world who have it much worse than you”, “people are dying”, and “just cheer up” (four examples from a multitude of problematic ‘advice’ that many people living with depression hear). I can’t speak for others in my position but regardless of intention, phrases like these made me feel worse. I would blame myself for feeling the way I felt, convince myself I was ‘just being silly’, and berate myself for being unable to be a ‘normal’ human being — the uphill climb towards recovery would become even steeper. I found these attitudes pretty difficult to cope with at the time, and have come to realise that ultimately these responses reflect a wider issue in society that needs to be addressed. A worryingly large proportion of people just don’t know what to say. Even worse, some people judge you for it. I want to do as much as I can to change things. Regrettably, I am guilty of having been ignorant about mental health issues in the past and can at least say that I have learned a lot from the whole experience, if nothing else. That doesn’t mean to say I now consider myself an expert on all things mental health related (far from it), but I do have a better understanding having had the experiences I have had, and am glad to have a much stronger interest in the subject (in all respects, not just in what I went through personally). I also like to think that it has made me a stronger and more compassionate person. Various books have also been extremely useful in aiding my recovery and in broadening my understanding of other mental health issues (in particular, I recommend Dr Tim Cantopher’s book, Depressive Illness: Curse of the Strong, and Ellen Forney’s wonderful cartoon book, Marbles). The largest takeaway I have from my own experience and from reading, is that depression is very much a physical illness arising from chemical imbalanaces in the brain (Dr Cantopher refers to it as a malfunction of the limbic system). Would you tell someone with a broken arm to “just get over it”? No — but the fact people say this to people with depression is stigma and/or a lack of understanding. My advice to those supporting people suffering from mental illness, should you want it, is: don’t ask them questions or make statements that you wouldn’t put to someone with a physical illness — e.g. “are you sure you’re not imagining it?”, “pull yourself together”, “it’s all in your head”, etc. Talking about these issues openly with friends and even acquaintances has broadened my horizons (and probably theirs) to a huge part of society that I didn’t know even existed before I unwittingly joined it — I like to call it society’s massive elephant [in the room]. Mental health issues are so often swept under the rug and dismissed as a “taboo” subject that we can’t talk about, yet mental illness is so common. I can’t help but wonder whether the more we talk about it, the less it can hurt us? It is encouraging to see mental health issues being addressed more by the media; Professor Green opened up about his personal experiences in the documentary Suicide and Me so as to spark conversations about men’s mental health, SANE’s Black Dog campaign is gaining traction, and celebrities such as Stephen Fry and The Rock are opening up about their own struggles to eradicate some of the stigma that exists. Nevertheless, from personal experience, I think there is still a long way to go. I believe that society’s massive elephant can be gradually shrunk through open and honest conversation about mental health, and I wouldn’t mind betting that a little (more?) education for children on mental health issues in schools wouldn’t go amiss, either. For all the education we were given in school about health and safety (how to not electrocute yourself 101, etc.), I can’t say I remember any lessons on mental health. When suicide is the leading cause of death for 20–34 year olds in the UK, that seems a bit ridiculous… but that’s just my own personal experience. Part of me finds it extremely hard to justify publishing this, for obvious reasons. My name will be attached to this until the end of the Internet, and I dread to think of the possible consequences (thank you, stigma). Nevertheless, I want others going through something similar to feel the same comfort I felt when I heard the stories of others so I’m going to ignore the worries about possible consequences and just do it. I know that there are other people out there who have suffered far more than I have. In so many ways I have been extremely lucky. I am sharing this in an attempt to do my part to shrink the massive elephant. I do not want pity, or sympathy, or judgement. I want you to talk about mental health — tell stories, ask questions, broaden your horizons. Needless to say that if any of my friends reading this want to talk to me, I’m all ears, always. Mental health issues can affect the lives of anyone and everyone, and in my view, the more we talk about mental health and learn about it, the better. “Calling Samaritans is now free of charge from a landline or mobile. Don’t suffer in silence. Our new number is 116 123.”",2015
Living with anxiety: Let’s talk about it,"It’s been about 3 years since I started working from home full-time. In those 3 years I’ve been able to do some amazing things that I never would have been able to do if I had a regular 9 to 5 job. I’ve been to 4 different countries (some of them more than once), I’ve never missed an important family get together, and my partner and I are closer than ever. While working from home has allowed me to reap some major benefits, it has also brought about some challenges. Going from a structured work day to working from home wasn’t too much of an adjustment for me, since I was already self-employed. The only thing that really changed for me was the environment I did my work in. At least for the first year or so. Fast forward to two years later… This was my third visit to the doctor in less than 6 months for issues with my neck and throat. I was referred to an ENT where they did a scope and an ultrasound. All came back clear, yet I still was having neck tightness, particularly in the front. Some days I could describe it as a lump in my throat, while others it was more in line with a stiff neck. Either way, these issues were spread out over the course of several months and even though I was told I was fine, I knew I didn’t feel fine. And the more I thought about it, the worse it got. In June I had a bad bout with sciatica and a strained IT band. Yeah, at the same time. It was horrible and I’m fairly certain death may have felt better. To make matters worse, this all happened at the same time I was going through a major job change. It was during this incredibly stressful and shitty period that I had my first (and only) full-blown anxiety attack. I woke up in the middle of the night with shooting pains in my leg from the sciatica ….again. After weeks of this, I did the only thing I knew I could do, I cried. As I hobbled out of the bedroom trying not to wake my partner, I started to become light headed. The bathroom was off to my left so I stepped in to steady myself on the sink. As I turned the light on and looked in the mirror, my vision started going dark. My heart started to flutter and my fingertips began to tingle. That’s the moment I really started to panic… I tried to yell for my partner but every word felt like a struggle. It was a conscious effort to try and get the words out, and even then I wasn’t sure they came out right, or at all. They must have. A few seconds later my partner appeared in the bathroom door and immediately helped steady me. My first and only anxiety attack was starting to subside as quick as it had started. In total, it was probably less than 45 seconds, but it felt like an eternity. From that point on, my worst fear became the fear of having another attack. I knew it was time to see my doctor again. At that next appointment, I explained to my doctor what had happened. I left that appointment with a low dose prescription for Ativan. Although I had an answer, in the back of my mind I was still convinced there was something wrong with me. As it turns out, health anxiety is a real thing. I worried for almost a year that there was something wrong with me. My neck and throat bothered me. If it wasn’t that, it was the flutering in my chest. There was always something. And those kinds of thoughts and feelings are incredibly hard to just turn off. The more I focused on them, the worse my anxiety became. It got to a point this past summer where I couldn’t leave the house without having Ativan in my pocket. I was terrified of having an attack in public. The most intriguing thing about all this was that even though I knew the Ativan worked and relieved my symptoms instantly, I still kept thinking there was something wrong with me. This was actually a two-part problem, at least for me. The first was that I wanted an instant solution. Ativan, for those who don’t know, belongs to a family of drugs called benzodiazepines, or benzos for short. All it does is slow down your central nervous system, which results in nothing more than a calming effect, especially in low doses. Whenever I would take an Ativan, any tension or stress I was feeling would diminish, at least until it wore off. When that happened, I’d get frustrated that I didn’t feel anxious, yet the neck tightness was back. After a month or two of ups and downs, I started to realize that maybe I wasn’t dealing with the actual problem. I needed a long-term solution, not a short-term one. The Ativan was short-term, nothing more. That’s when I started going to yoga. It didn’t take long for me to realize how incredibly hard it was for me to tune out external factors, for even an hour class. My mind always wandered to what project I had waiting for me at home, whether or not I remembered to do something, my health anxiety, or other mundane things that didn’t really matter. Not to mention my breathing technique was for shit. Seriously, I couldn’t even take a full breath. Isn’t that like a basic human need? WTF? I never realized how important the art of breathing was until my first few yoga classes. I remember the exact class where I was laying on my back and I took my first full, unrestricted breath in what felt like years. I can’t even put into words how proud I was of myself that day. Okay, maybe there was something to this mindfulness thing after all… From that point forward, it started becoming easier for me to relax in yoga and tune out external factors. It really did help. I also started getting massages more often and taking better care of myself mentally. I’ve lost about 50 pounds in the past year and a half. I think this is part of the reason I was so frustrated with the “health issues” I had been having. Physically, I’m the healthiest I’ve been in years. I exercise at least 3 times a week and I’m conscious of what I eat. It was the mental part that I was missing. Anyone who knows me personally can attest to the fact that I am always working on something. It’s no secret that I have a hard time turning work off. Hell, my mom even tried to institute a rule when all of us came over for dinner that we put our phones in a basket. (And we all know that was because of me.) Looking back, as irritating as I found that, she was absolutely right. I needed to learn to turn it off. It took struggling through my first few yoga sessions to show me how work absorbed I had become. Working from home contributes heavily to my anxiety disorder. Back when I had a physical office space, I had less of a hard time turning it off when I got home. Now that there was no divide, when was the right time? If I went to the gym during the day or had lunch with a friend, I felt like I needed to catch up in the evening. While it allowed many freedoms, it also became a prison of sorts. My mind was always pre-occupied with thoughts of work. But there was something else too… Working from home and being alone with your thoughts can make your mind do funny things. I must admit, I love nothing more than to hole up in my office and hammer out thousands of words. As good as that feels, there are also days that I struggle to stay on task, or that I have bad anxiety. Those days are the hard ones, and the ones that lead to vicious circles of health anxiety combined with regular anxiety. Days like these are the ones I know I have to get out of the house. Whether that’s going to the gym in the middle of the day, having coffee with a friend, or packing up my MacBook and getting some work done at the coffee shop, I need to be around other people. It was also time for a change of pace. So I made the decision to start The App Factor and I accepted a position with eTech Parts that allows me to get more involved in the technical side of mobile again. While most of my work with eTech can be done from home, I do get to travel quite often. This part gets me out from the front of a computer screen a few days each month and lets me interact with some great people, and I’m thankful for that. As humans, we have an innate *need* for human contact. I’m getting better at fulfilling this need, but it’s still a work in progress. As a writer, it’s very easy to close myself off and sit behind a screen. For the past several months I’ve made a conscious effort to put myself out there. I’ve been attending conferences and making more of an effort to network with more people in my industry, and spending more time doing non-work related things I enjoy. When I do these things, my anxiety subsides almost completely. It’s something I have to remind myself of on the bad days. Anxiety is something that isn’t talked about near enough. For the few that have shared your experiences, thank you. Some of your words have helped me through some really bad days, and let me know I’m not alone. I’m not sure anxiety will ever leave me, but as one of my favorite writers, Matt Gemmell, has assured me, I will be fine. While I may not believe those words every day, the amount of days I do believe them are starting to far outweigh the ones I don’t. And for today, that’s good enough for me.

"<strong class=""markup--strong markup--h3-strong"">5 Ways the Universe Helped my Anxiety</strong>","So…I’m an anxious person. Like, super anxious. So anxious that it took me 10 minutes to start this article because I wanted to do it “the right way.” And for some reason, the thing that’s helped me the most was reading up on quantum/theoretical/astrophysics. Maybe it’s cuz they open the mind to new possibilities. Maybe they put things in perspective. Maybe they’re so confusing to the peasant human that you literally can’t think about anything else while you read about them. Whatever reason it is, let’s start off light: We only got 8 minutes to save the world! When you look up at the sun (don’t look at the sun, you masochist), you’re technically looking into the past. Sunlight takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach earth. So if someone tells you to stop living in the past, just go, “NONE OF US CAN!” before they offer you a Snickers because “you get a little existential crisis-y when you’re hungry.” I was trying to escape my brainsanity by listening to a RadioLab podcast with Neil deGrasse Tyson (🙏). He talks about how if the sun disappeared, we wouldn’t know about it for 8 minutes and 20 seconds. But when asked if in that short time he’d want to know that the end was nigh? He said, “Pfft, no!” When you know about it, you know about it. but your angst about something about to happen to you bit you don’t know so youre gonna worry about the thing that might’ve happened to you that you don’t know…life is too short! - Neil deGrasse Tyson My anxiety does this fun thing where I think about the what ifs and various scenarios until they become fictional reality in my head. “What if I’m not doing a good enough job at work,” “What if I’m pregnant (even though I didn’t have sex)”, “What if this dude is talking to some other chick.” Soon, I’m so anxious that I literally can’t think about anything else. He may have been talking about a “the end is nigh” scenario, but what Neil deGrasse said put things into perspective. Worrying about a hypothetical doesn’t change it. It just freezes you. Scientific curiosity killed the cat…AND didn’t. Imagine this: There’s a cat in a box. Inside the box with the cat is radioactive material that, if emitting radiation? Will kill the cat. If not? The cat will be fine. So…is the cat alive or dead? Quantum physics in three sentences: Just like Neil deGrasse Tyson saying “don’t sweat what ya don’t know,” Schrödinger’s Cat is kind of awesome to apply to life’s unknowns. Instead of letting your psyche psych you out about ‘what if’s’, just assume whatever you’re worried about is both true and untrue until the universe decides. A.k.a the Debbie Downer of philosophy. Nihilism | noun | the belief that nothing matters and that your entire existence is meaningless and futile. “Nothing matters” seems like a philosophy that’s less calming and more worthy of staring at the ceiling all night because what’s even the point. But the whole “nothing matters” philosophy can actually be weirdly…comforting. Because if nothing really matters, it’s a lot easier to sit back and chill out about things that aren’t worthy of freaking out about. The key: a pinch of nihilism rather than a mouthful. Otherwise, cue staring at ceiling, “what’s the point,” etc. All it takes is getting away from it all…like, literally as far away as possible. If Nihilism is the goth kid, the Overview Effect is its equally deep cousin who smiles a lot more. Astronauts who have looked back at the blue marble floating in space have reported a shift in perspective ; a greater clarity, a realization that everything we are and know is fragile. This cognitive shift is called “The Overview Effect.” It must be strange looking back at Earth from space. Earth is the YOU ARE HERE of our existence, the only one we’ve got. And floating outside of it and looking back at the place where all our worries, joys, tears, troubles are must make all of our daily worries seem trivial and small. Whenever I would start worrying about little things that gripped me in a big way, I would just sit back and try to think about what those Astronauts must have felt, floating outside everything humans have ever known…plus wine never hurt. You’re a speck…feel better? Pale Blue Dot is basically The Overview Effect for us Earth-bound peasants before space tourism has made it to the mainstream life (sooon…) Carl Sagan was basically our Neil deGrasse Tyson before Neil deGrasse Tyson was Neil deGrasse Tyson. He wrote an incredible monologue that induces The Overview Effect just like Acid induces religious out-of-body experiences. Want to experience it? Look up at that picture. That bright little pinprick of light near the middle? That’s everything you’ve ever known. That’s earth. Astrophysicists like Neil deGrasse and Carl Sagan are terrifying. They give us theories that challenge those cozy promises of past-lives, heaven, religious solace, an all-powerful being that we’ve all comforted ourselves with. But at the same time, by making our universe so much bigger, and yeah, by humbling us by calling out our small existence, it doesn’t make life any less meaningful. It makes it something to be cherished and treasured for its brevity and unlikelihood. Life’s too short to worry about someone not snapping you back or not liking your selfie or not getting a job or getting laid off. We’re not here for a long time — if we only had 8 minutes and 20 seconds left, would you worry about it or fill it up and just live? I won’t try to sum up what the great Sagan said. Instead, read it for yourself, because it’s pretty dang amazing. xo “Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves…It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known. - Carl Sagan, “Pale Blue Dot” Also published on The Mary Sue! Yay!",2015
10 Years Ago.,"For 10 years I’ve struggled with shame and an untold secret that I kept buried within the deepest recesses of my mind. No one ever brings it up, myself included, but I think it needs to be told and out in the open. (Trigger warning; explicit depiction of mental illness and self-harming ahead). At 19 years old, fresh off of my first break up and a series of tragic events (a couple of deaths in the family and my father’s cancer diagnosis) I had a mental breakdown. Not sure if I’m using the terminology correctly, but this mental breakdown would last not a day, a week, or even a month. It would last at least a year, and its residual effects still ripple through my life to this day. This breakdown was not simply because of those recent bad events, a lot had been repressed and brewing within me that I was always able to ignore via the distraction of school, my family life, and my relationship. This was not your run of the mill crying spell (and I don’t mean to demean anyone by saying “run of the mill” because mental illness manifests in different ways, but this was more than your average sadness). This was an all consuming everyday struggle that I was so lost within I did not even recognize I was in it. I would wake up in a panic, obsessively calling and trying to contact my ex thinking he would be the one to fix me. He was the piece that had chipped off and left a crack that ended up fracturing everything, like a tiny ding on a windshield that spiderwebs out until the glass is beyond repair. Now clearly I am a human being and not a car, so this was a bit more complicated than just replacing what had been lost. I would lay in my tiny twin bed in my shitty college apartment and cry and cut myself. I wanted to cut myself deep enough to really hurt myself thinking that would end the sadness, but my naivety and also subconscious fear kept my wounds superficial. One night I texted all my friends goodbye and started the tub thinking I would bleed out like that ominous scene in “Rules of Attraction”. My friend, who lived downstairs, began furiously banging on my door, saying she was calling 911. But I didn’t care. I just wanted the pain to end. The police did come but by that time I had decided that tonight was not the night, and wrapped myself in a robe, my wrists bleeding but not in a way that threatened anything beyond a scar, and I laid in bed. The police questioned me from my bedside where I gave short answers and determined at that point, I was not a threat to myself. They left, and with them, my distraught parents (who had also shown up) tried to come up with a plan to help me. I did not want any help. I was in a hell so deep I didn’t think there was any help nor was I worth it. I would wake up, try to get stoned, not go to class and just write about my sadness and cry or think about suicide. I functioned, but not in the same way I had before. People turned away. My mental illness became inconvenient to my friends in college who didn’t want to worry about that, they were on their own path and thought I was an obstruction to their focus and happiness. I don’t even blame them for that. I lost many friends just because they didn’t know what to do for me anymore. I pushed people away because I didn’t want anyone. I wanted darkness and death because I thought that was the only thing that would stop the constant flurry of thoughts within my mind and constant dread of life in my heart. Depression manifests physically; my heart was almost always racing, and when it wasn’t there was such an empty sadness that echoed through me it would cause palpitations once again. I would do typical self destructive shit like drink excessively, smoke excessively, and worst of all, abuse my prescription anti anxiety medication just to numb out. I remember when my mom took me to see a therapist. Her practice was out of her house, and she had dreamcatchers on the wall and a lot of candles set up, I think she also had healing crystals but I may have made that up in my mind’s eye because everything else about her space was so “new-agey healer”. The therapist asked me what was wrong with me (not in those words, but basically told me to speak openly about my problems). I thought back to the night before. That evening I had gotten in my car, called my perplexed sister and told her I loved her and parked in a nearby church parking lot with a bottle of liquor and a razor. I had never been really religious but thought this might be my only way to a heaven if there was one (anything was better than the earthly life I had been in for the last year). I took a swig of cheap vodka and pressed the razor against a fresh scab on my left wrist. I have to go deeper this time for it to work I remember thinking to myself. I cut as deep as I could and the plum color of my blood was reassurance that I was doing the right thing. I saw headlights pull in behind me. Panicked, I grabbed a used napkin from my cupholder and pressed it against my wrist and started the car. Again this would have to wait. Wait for no distractions, when I could do it and go as peacefully as possible. I went home and went to sleep, forgetting I had the appointment with my mom the next day. After my mom’s text message reminder that morning, I got ready and wore a long sleeve shirt with a cuff bracelet to cover my wrist. Viscerally, all of these very new memories flooded my head as I processed what the therapist had asked me. I paused and said “I just want to die” not in an emo oh woe is me way, but stated it as an earnest request. Please let me die, it’s all I want. I used to silently pray someone would actually kill me, just sneak up on me and shoot or stab me, that way I wouldn’t even be blamed but I would have gotten what I wanted. I know, that is dark and a disgusting way to think, but as stated, I was mentally ill seemingly almost beyond repair. The therapist advised my mom that she would have to call 911 or take me to a hospital because of what I said, and my mom agreed. Weeping, my mom escorted me to the nearest hospital for evaluation. After waiting for at least an hour to see one of the doctors, I was evaluated by what seemed like a very young doctor, who gave me sedatives and told me to sign a paper basically voluntarily committing myself to a mental institution (it was college spring break so my timing was perfect). An ambulance came to transport me where in my sedated state I tried to assess the situation. I remember the guys in the ambulance making conversation with me and one genuinely hitting on me. Nothing like trying to get a date with a sedated mentally ill girl in her most vulnerable of moments. The ambulance brought me to an in-patient mental health facility in a neighboring town (you know, in case I tried to leave they didn’t want me to stay local), where I would stay for 5 days of half-ass treatment and evaluation. I stayed with people who struggled with mental illnesses that ran the gamut, and was instantly humbled after group time when I heard what the other young adults were dealing with. I don’t remember much of my stay, and believe for my sanity I have blocked it out, but I do remember there being an art room, a gym, and lunch time. My parents came to see me for a family session that went very astray after my mom presented my journal where I had written most of my suicidal ideations. I was immediately furious, I wanted out of there and my mom provided the center with the ammo it needed to keep me longer [give me proper care]. I was dosed every day two times a day and after 5 days was released to outpatient with a prescription for antidepressants and a dual diagnosis of anxiety and depression (with addiction tendencies, but really it was mostly pot so not sure if that counts). I continued to struggle for a long time. So many of my friends wanted nothing to do with a crazy person who had been to a mental institution. I was called insane and crazy by people I had been close with. I was dismissed as basically a sideshow lunatic. I wish I could reach out to those people now and explain what I had been going through. Explain that I was not in control of myself mentally, and that I’ve worked hard to get myself to a place where I am not self-hating and anxious. Mental illness does not have to be shameful. It shouldn’t be. What kept this story locked in my mind for so long was my fear of judgement or losing more friends. But if one person can read this and identify that it can work out after all, then this story was worth sharing. Mental health is important, it requires the same upkeep that your physical health does. I still struggle daily to maintain my mental health. I will have days where I get very upset, hate myself, and feel a giant weight on my chest, and have days where my heart beats faster and faster and I feel the doom of an anxiety attack. I would say 70% of the time I am mentally healthy, but that 30% drags me down so low when it creeps in. I have the tools to get myself out of my (for lack of a better term) “episodes”. I go for a run. I reach out to friends. I make plans that make me happy. I draw silly or happy cartoons and share them with people. I donate to a non-profit, read inspiring stories. I take a shower, clean myself up, make myself feel worth it. I have to make my mental health a priority, every single day. I have to make myself worth it. I still struggle but sometimes looking outside and seeing the sun and knowing that tomorrow I can try again is reassurance enough to keep going. So keep going.",2015
My Goal For 2016: Remember To Breathe,"Even if I check a major thing off of my epic to-do list, I move on to obsessing about the next thing. My therapist says I operate like this because it’s what I’ve always done and what I’ve always known. When something becomes ingrained in you, it’s hard to break the habit. This vicious cycle takes a toll on the body after a while. You’re more susceptible to viruses, and you have a harder time getting out of bed. In my twenties, I didn’t think anything was worth doing unless it involved some kind of emotional challenge or rebellion. Life is hard, right? So I stayed in broken relationships because I didn’t know how to take care of myself. In my twenties, I didn’t think anything was worth doing unless it involved some kind of emotional challenge or rebellion. I didn’t clean my bedroom as often as I should have because organized people were boring to me. They lived straight, narrow lives that I wasn’t interested in. And even though I’ve always loved office supplies and planners and the IDEA of a pristine desk, I’m more of a scribble-things-down -on-scrap-pieces-of-paper-and-promptly-lose-those-important-notes kind of girl. Earlier this year I lost my driver’s license. I found it months later, tucked inside a poetry book as a “temporary” bookmark. A decade ago, while flipping through a book I treasured as a child, I found a twenty dollar bill along with a note from the tooth fairy tucked inside. But however scatterbrained I can be, I’m learning to not stay in the red zone all the time. I’m craving the moments that allow me to turn down the volume inside of my head. Breath follows breath, and sometimes that’s all you need to focus on. The next moment of expansion. The next moment of release.

A New Project,"Hi friends. It’s been a while. My apologies. Part of my absence is due to the demands of school (being an English student kind of drains you of the desire to produce creative content sometimes). And part of it lies deeper within me. While attending counselling in my hometown, my facilitator mentioned that I may want to keep an eye on anxious tendencies I had. I brushed this off, citing her motherly nature as reason for her over-concern. It wasn’t until I started University and noticed how difficult social situations were that I began to take her seriously. Being away from home and the dynamics of certain relationships changing only exacerbated how I was feeling. I began to skip class and avoid certain interactions. I had trouble getting out of bed. I would have fits of uncontrollable crying and would sometimes hyperventilate. I began to see a psychologist around October, who I then asked to do an assessment of me. Just before exams, in December, she gave me a diagnosis: GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). Hearing the facts laid out in front of me took the breath out of my mouth: I packed my things immediately and jumped on a train home. I continued counselling for a while but didn’t find much relief. I would make appointments when my anxiety was making me crumble on the floor of the student centre, but would attend my appointments feeling (relatively) fine? I had my first panic attack this January. I blacked out and remember being pulled away on a stretcher and taken to the local hospital. I stopped counselling shortly after this. I finished the school year with fervor. I moved into a house with my best friends and landed a job with great hours and a great boss. I thought I had everything under control; I thought I had dug up the roots of what was going on. I counted down the days until the start of second year. I couldn’t wait to be back in a classroom, writing and arguing and absorbing the passion/knowledge of my peers and professors. The entire first week was picture perfect: holding my textbooks to my chest, bouncing my way into lecture halls and tutorial rooms. Short lived, but exciting. This was one of the only weeks that I attended every single class. I would miss one class and then be afraid to attend any of the ones that followed it. Everyone would look at me. Would know I slacked. Knew I was behind. Knew I didn’t have what it took to be here. And so I didn’t go. I was late to a tutorial by 2 minutes and put my hand on the door handle, when I heard my TA had begun. I backed away, and sat out in the hall for the rest of the class. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t go in there. So I sat and sank in my defeat. But I continued on, making jokes about how I didn’t go to class…again. It wasn’t until a personal relationship was severed that I really realized that I couldn’t do this on my own any longer. I couldn’t sleep or calm down. My heart raced constantly. I had anxiety attacks one after another, some that left me throwing up the little food I was able to stomach. I met with a doctor about two weeks later. I sat in her office and waited to be told about counselling options I could pursue again. She greeted me warmly and began to ask about my story. We talked of grief and trauma, family history and symptoms I had been experiencing. I swear I didn’t hear her the first time, or the tenth when she said “anxiety disorder with panic and major depression”. Whoa, what? I knew I was constantly on edge and picked at my skin and had uncontrollable fits of crying and breathlessness, but depression? I had always placed myself on the outside. As in, I would think about my mental health in a sense of “well, at least I only have one thing” (which is wrong and bad, I know). “I have friends that have a couple different things, I have no reason to complain.”. The logic? Flawed. But it dominated the way I thought about myself as someone with mental health concerns. And now it seemed, I had to completely overhaul how I thought about myself. I obviously realize now that there’s no game. There’s no measurement scale of “how fucked up you are”. You just are. And you do as you do. I’ve recently started taking a couple medications to hopefully alleviate some of my symptoms and allow me to function like a normal human. They’ve made me unable to sleep, eat or get out of bed some days. But coming up on 3 weeks on them and I’m beginning to adjust. It’s probably going to be a long road of adjusting doses and trying different combinations to get it just right. And so this is my journey. This is the beginning of the road. I think this is more so for me than anything, but I really like the idea of having other people in on it. We give so much lip service to removing the stigma from mental illness, but still continue in our ways. We don’t modify our language, our misconceptions or our behaviour to suggest that mental illness is a common thing — which it is. I present to you “This is What ______ Looks Like”: A chronicle of me taking on life as someone with several mental health concerns. It will function as a diary, log-type blog to track my daily happenings. They may not necessarily be at times where I’m having a meltdown. Hey, it might be the opposite! (We often say things like “oh, but they look so happy!” and this is kinda gross and invalidating, tbh.) I might be having a wonderful day and post about all the great things I’m feeling and how my anxiety is on the low that day. Or I might post on a day where I can’t centre myself no matter how hard I try and my face is red and stained and there are marks on my hands or legs. Or anything in between. I’ll accompany entries with a picture of me at that moment to serve as a reminder of the specific days I write. I will do my best to tag trigger warnings, but please don’t hesitate to shoot me a message if I forget. Also, I really like the idea of utilizing the online community as a part of this series. If you would like to do one of your own, speaking about your experiences with mental health issues or to document your day as someone with these struggles, please please contact me via Facebook or via email: devynshields@hotmail.com I know this has been a lot of blocks of text, but I wanted to be able to provide some background and what I aim to do. Again, this is more for me than anything, but I would love you to follow along as well. Regards, Dev",2015
Growing up with ANXIETY,"I realize that I have always had anxiety. Even as a child, I did things that many would view as irrational, and I will recount one example for you now. In the middle of fifth grade, my parents decided to move our family from one town in upstate New York to another one located about 30 minutes away. As a little boy with yet-to-be-understood anxiety, I was terrified — but this is not why I am telling you my story. My story begins once I arrived in my new town, in my new home. It was a nice home in a nice, extremely safe neighborhood. In addition, the elementary school was close enough that I could walk to and from school each day. Easy enough, right? Wrong. Soon after we arrived in this new town and settled into our new home, I developed a fear that our house would be robbed. And seeing how, due to my family’s schedules, I was the only one at home for a good half hour or so each weekday, I was the one to be robbed! I was the prey, the captive, the horrified audience. I was doomed. I soon became so scared that I would open the front door each day, place by backpack near the entryway, and slowly remove my homework. There, about two feet from the front door were the stairs leading up to the second floor. There, on the first step I would perch, precariously, with my homework. Each day, I would nervously work on my homework, toiling over math problems and scrawling sentences, always watchful of my surroundings, and always considering that I might need to escape from burglars quickly through the front door. Never mind that the all-too-real future burglars might enter through the front door; that thought never entered my anxious mind. My parents found this behavior peculiar, of course, and they did not really know what to make of it. They chalked it up to being in a new town, and I don’t recall them really talking to me about my emotions. They did try their best to understand what I was going through, but they never coached me through it — or normalized what I was feeling. To me, I could very possibly get robbed by bad guys — or even die! To them, it was a silly, albeit slightly concerning, adjustment to a new town and a new school. To them, they were just thankful that I was doing my homework so diligently, even if I was completing it in a very odd location a few feet from the front door. In my mind, my feelings were pervasive and very real. And they lasted for a good couple of months, before, slowly, over time, they dissipated and then disappeared as suddenly as they came. I started to feel safer in my new location — and in my own skin. Even to this day, as I am now a man a couple of years away from his third decade on this earth, I recall a comment my mom made a year or so ago: “Do you remember when you used to do your homework right by the door?” she said with a smile. I smiled as well, but mainly I cringed. I did remember that, but not the way she remembered it. Yet, when she asked me about it, I did not feel the need to go into the details about how irrationally frightened I had been. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I am able to appreciate my heightened level of anxiety — and both the benefits and the limitations it provides. What I wish would have happened when I was younger is this: I wish my parents would have met me in my moments of terror and validated my feelings. They did the best with what they knew at the time, I know this to be true. What you have to remember is that anxiety was viewed as a weakness decades ago — and it is still very much viewed as such today. However, I wish my parents would have acknowledged that what I was feeling was very real to me, that it would be alright. I say this like I am an expert on dealing with anxiety — which, in a way, I guess I kind of am — but my expertise has come at great cost to my own emotional well-being. Still, I am trying to use my expertise to benefit others, to help them understand that it will be alright. To show them the inherent good that anxiety has in their lives. I’ll leave you know with one example of this. I used to work in school-based mental health program, at the middle-school level. I fondly remember one small boy, who I had the privilege of knowing when he was in sixth and seventh grade. This boy was extremely anxious, and when I say anxious, I mean anxious. This boy seemed to be in a perpetual state of worry, and as I got to know him, I came to understand how his anxiety came about — and how that anxiety was actually an effort to make sense of a very unpredictable world. I had difficulty connecting with this boy during the first few months that I got to know him. Even though I still experience anxiety to this day, I couldn’t understand why he could be so anxious about seemingly innocuous situations. How could forgetting one’s homework lead to such unbelievable dread? How could being one minute late to class mean that he would experience a day filled with unfathomable embarrassment? At first, I was overly dismissive. I didn’t think anyone could be so anxious about what appeared to be such silly things. Then, at some point, I remembered myself as a fifth-grade boy perched on the steps of his new home. I remembered the terror that consumed me. This boy I was working with and that boy I had once been had experienced this paralyzing feeling of anxiety. Through my memories, and through feedback from my coworkers at the middle school, I began to connect with this boy more and more. I began to talk less and listen more. I began to just sit with him in his moments of fear. And you know what? He got better. He started to, with me as his witness, figure out his anxiety. He started to spend less and less time in our office and more time in class. He started to understand that it would be alright. Don’t get me wrong; he still had anxiety — just like I still have anxiety. But what we both learned from one another during the almost two years that we spent together was that having anxiety is okay; it’s how you deal with your anxiety that makes all of the difference. And when I left that school to take another job, this boy gave me a card to bid me farewell. On it, he wrote one surprisingly poetic sentence. He wrote, “You are and always will be a great man, Mr. Jordan.” I was stunned. This was so unlike this boy to write something like that. This boy with whom at first I felt like I had no connection, ultimately became one of the kids with whom I had the strongest bond. What he wrote was the timeless message of a naïve child and an old soul. He taught me something with his message on that card. He taught me that we, he and I, are two anxious guys, but we need to play the hand that we have been dealt. And play it we will, one anxious card at a time.",2015
