0,Is preexisting mental illness associated with lower patient satisfaction for older trauma patients? A cross-sectional descriptive study,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine if satisfaction with care differs among older trauma patients with and without preexisting mental illness (PMI +/PMI-). Methods:Data from two level I trauma centers were examined from 11/2016 through 12/2017. Trauma patients ≥ 55 years were included and satisfaction of those who had a diagnosis of mental illness prior to the trauma admission (PMI +) to those without a diagnosis (PMI-) ( n = 299; 62 PMI + and 237 PMI-) were compared. Enrolled patients completed the Family Satisfaction with Advanced Care Cancer Scale Patient Survey (FAMCARE-P13) prior to discharge. Associations between mental illness status and patient baseline characteristics, overall mean satisfaction, and mean satisfaction by question were compared. Generalized linear models adjusted for differences in patient satisfaction by mental illness status. Analyses were stratified by hospital to account for the interaction between hospital and mental illness status. Results: Compared to PMI- patients, PMI + patients were more likely to be younger, female, have multiple comorbidities, and to report lower overall satisfaction with care. Among PMI+ patients, the most common diagnoses were depression and anxiety. After adjustment, PMI + was associated with lower patient satisfaction at hospital 1; after examining individual questions lower satisfaction was associated with information provided on procedures and questions surrounding “Physical care.” Conversely, PMI + did not affect satisfaction at hospital 2 after adjustment. Conclusions: At hospital 1, room for improvement was identified in providing information about prognosis and procedures, symptom management, and continuity of care. Reexamining practices for older PMI+ trauma patients is warranted.

Background: To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Methods: Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53–36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27–32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants’ self-reported safety scores for HCW’s protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.

The correct name is Philippa. The name now appears correctly in this record.] Background: Over the past decade, smartphone use has become widespread amongst today’s children and young people (CYP) which parallels increases in poor mental health in this group. Simultaneously, media concern abounds about the existence of ‘smartphone addiction’ or problematic smartphone use. There has been much recent research concerning the prevalence of problematic smartphone use is in children and young people who use smartphones, and how this syndrome relates to mental health outcomes, but this has not been synthesized and critically evaluated. Aims: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of PSU and quantify the association with mental health harms. Methods: A search strategy using Medical Subject Headings was developed and adapted for eight databases between January 1, 1st 2011 to October 15th 2017. No language restriction was applied. Of 924 studies identified, 41 were included in this review, three of which were cohort studies and 38 were cross sectional studies. The mental health outcomes were self-reported: depression; anxiety; stress; poor sleep quality; and decreased educational attainment, which were synthesized according to an a priori protocol. Results: The studies included 41,871 CYP, and 55% were female. The median prevalence of PSU amongst CYP was 23.3% (14.0–31.2%). PSU was associated with an increased odds of depression (OR = 3.17;95%CI 2.30–4.37; I ² = 78%); increased anxiety (OR = 3.05 95%CI 2.64–3.53; I ² = 0%); higher perceived stress (OR = 1.86;95%CI 1.24–2.77; I ² = 65%); and poorer sleep quality (OR = 2.60; 95%CI; 1.39–4.85, I ² = 78%). Conclusions: PSU was reported in approximately one in every four CYP and accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health. PSU is an evolving public health concern that requires greater study to determine the boundary between helpful and harmful technology use. Policy guidance is needed to outline harm reduction strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",2490709965.0," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Erratum/Correction",2021
3,The lifetime prevalence and impact of generalized anxiety disorders in an epidemiologic Italian National Survey carried out by clinicians by means of semi-structured interviews,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most reported diagnoses in psychiatry, but there is some discrepancy between the cases identified in community studies and those identified in tertiary care. This study set out to evaluate whether the use of clinicians as interviewers may provide estimates in a community survey close to those observed in primary or specialized care. Methods: This is a community survey on a randomly selected sample of 2338 adult subjects. The Advanced Neuropsychiatric Tools and Assessment Schedule (ANTAS) was administered by clinicians, providing lifetime diagnosis based on the DSM-IV-TR. Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) was measured with the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Results: Overall, 55 (2.3%) subjects met the criteria for GAD, with greater prevalence in women (3.6%) than in men (0.9%): OR = 4.02; 95%CI: 1.96–8.26. Up to 40% of those with GAD had at least another diagnosis of mood, anxiety, or eating disorders. The mean score of SF-12 in people with GAD was 32.33 ± 6.8, with a higher attributable burden than in other conditions except for major depressive disorder. Conclusions: We found a relatively lower lifetime prevalence of GAD than in community surveys based on lay interviewers and a structured interview. The identified cases of GAD showed a strong impact on the quality of life regardless of co-morbidity and high risk in women, suggesting a profile similar to the one identified from studies in primary and specialized care.

4,Mental health planning at a very early stage of the COVID-19 crisis: A systematic review of online international strategies and recommendations,"Background: Mental health care systems have been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). Results: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). Conclusions: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.

5,Sleep disturbances in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Influence of depression symptoms and trait anxiety,"Background: Sleep disturbances have been reported in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients, with heterogeneous results. The aim of our study was to assess sleep function in OCD and to investigate the relationship between sleep and the severity of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Methods: Sleep quality was measured in 61 OCD patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Multiple linear regression was conducted to explore the association between sleep and psychopathological measures; a mediation analysis was also performed. Results: OCD patients showed poor sleep quality and more sleep disturbances compared to HCs. The severity of depression, trait anxiety and OC symptomatology were correlated with poor sleep quality. Multiple linear regression analyses controlling for potential confounders revealed that the severity of depression and trait anxiety were independently related to poor sleep quality in OCD. A mediation analysis showed that both the severity of trait anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between the severity of OC symptoms and poor sleep quality among patients with OCD. Conclusions: Our findings support the existence of sleep disturbances in OCD. Trait anxiety and depression play a key role in sleep quality among OCD patients.

6,Characteristics and outcomes of children with dissociative (conversion) disorders in western China: A retrospective study,"Background: Dissociative (conversion) disorder in children is a complex biopsychosocial disorder with high rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidities. We sought to identify the characteristics and outcomes of children with dissociative (conversion) disorders in western China. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 66 children admitted with dissociative (conversion) disorders from January 2017 to July 2019, and analyzed their clinical characteristics, socio-cultural environmental variables, and personality and psychiatric/psychological characteristics. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the variables associated with clinical efficacy. Results: Of these 66 patients, 38 (57.6%) were male and 28 (42.4%) were female, 46 (69.7%) had an antecedent stressor, 30 (45.5%) were left-behind adolescents, and 16 (24.2%) were from single-parent families. In addition, 30 patients (45.5%) were not close to their parents, 38 patients (59.4%) had an introverted personality, and 34 (53.1%) had unstable emotions. Thirteen families (19.7%) were uncooperative with the treatment. Patients who had cormorbid anxiety or depression exhibited significantly lower cognitive ability (P &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression found that better treatment outcomes were positively associated with having a close relationship with parents, parental cooperation with treatment, and having a father with a lower level of education (i.e., less than junior college or higher). Conclusions: The characteristics and outcomes of children with dissociative (conversion) disorders are related to socio-cultural environmental variables and psychiatric/psychological factors. Timely recognition and effective treatment of dissociative (conversion) disorders are important.

7,Adverse childhood experiences and maternal anxiety and depression: A meta-analysis,"Background: It has been proposed that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can put women at risk for mental illness in the pregnancy and postpartum periods. While some studies have found strong support for this proposition, others have found weak or no support. This study is a meta-analysis of the association between ACEs and maternal mental health to resolve between-study discrepancies, and to examine potential moderators of associations. Methods: Three electronic databases (i.e., MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) were searched up to November 2018 by a health sciences librarian. A hand search was conducted in January 2020 and relevant studies were added. Included studies reported on associations between ACEs and maternal depression and/or anxiety in the perinatal period (pregnancy to 1-year postpartum). Pregnancy and postpartum outcomes were examined separately for both depression and anxiety. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Moderator analyses were conducted using meta-regression. Study quality was evaluated using a 15-point scale. Results: The initial search yielded 4646 non-duplicate records and full text review occurred for 196 articles. A total of 15 studies (N = 7788) were included in the meta-analyses, of which 2 were also described narratively. Publication year ranged from 1998 to 2019. Mothers were approximately 28.93 years of age when they retrospectively reported on their ACEs. All studies had maternal self-report questionnaires for the mental health outcomes. Study quality ranged from 7 to 12. The pooled effect sizes between ACEs and prenatal (N = 12; r = .19; 95% CI = .13, .24) and postpartum (N = 7; r = .23; 95% CI = .06 to .39) depressive symptoms were significant. The pooled effect size between ACEs and prenatal anxiety was also significant (N = 5; r = .14; 95% CI = .07, .21). Moderator analyses indicated that timing of depressive and anxiety symptoms may be important for understanding associations. Conclusions: ACEs confer risk to maternal mental health, albeit effect sizes are small to moderate in magnitude. Trauma-informed approaches, as well as increased mental health support during and after pregnancy, may help to offset the relative risk of ACEs on maternal mental health.

8,"Suicidality among gender minorities in Karnataka, South India","Background: It is argued that Indian gender minorities displayed differential mental health problems and suicide attempts. Hence, the study was intended to understand the prevalence of anxiety, depression and suicidality among this group, specifically those living in a metropolitan city in South India. Methods: The data was generated from a cross-sectional study that employed a structured questionnaire to collect information about experiences of anxiety, depression and suicidal behavior among gender-diverse individuals in Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka state. The study used stratified simple random sampling of eligible individuals who were 18 years of age and older and who were enrolled in an HIV prevention program implemented for gender-diverse individuals run by the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust and the University of Manitoba at the time of the study (2012). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relative contribution of various factors that affect suicide ideation or actual attempts among the gender diverse participants. Results: Results showed that 62% whose main source of income was Basti (socially sanctioned practice of begging), 52% of Hijras, 56% who lived with their Gurus, 58% who were not happy with their physical appearance, 55% who consumed alcohol daily, and 63% who experienced high depression had ever thought of or attempted suicide in the month prior to the survey. However, multivariate analysis showed that respondents who were not happy with their physical appearance and thought of changing it had significantly higher odds (AOR = 2.861; CI 1.468,5.576; p = 0.002) of either having thoughts that it was better being dead or wished they died. Similarly, those who experienced high depression, their odds of either having had thoughts of or having attempted suicide increased by three times (AOR = 3.997; CI 1.976, 8.071; p &lt; 0.000). Conclusions: It is observed that a high percentage of gender minorities had attempted suicide or thought of suicide during the month preceding the data collection. The findings bring new insights on the proximate determinant of physical appearance on the suicidality of gender minorities assigned male at birth and appropriate to account for this while addressing the mental health issues.

9,Efficacy and acceptability of parent-only group cognitive behavioral intervention for treatment of anxiety disorder in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Anxiety disorder is the most prevalent mental disorder among children and adolescents, causing significant psychosocial problems and physical health conditions. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for anxiety disorder in children and adolescents. And parent-only CBT is an alternative treatment for childhood anxiety disorder, which includes psychologists and parents rather than children in the treatment. As a new type of CBT, parent-only CBT has some advantages. However, it remains unclear whether parent-only CBT interventions are effective for treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorder. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy (the mean change scores of the anxiety rating scale from baseline to post-treatment, standardized mean difference SMD) and acceptability (the proportion of patients in the treatment group who withdrew from treatment early for any reason, risk ratios RRs) of parent-only cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for children and adolescents with anxiety disorder. We searched electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, ProQuest, and PsycInfo from inception to June 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing parent-only CBT either with waitlist (WL), or CBT with parents in children and adolescents with anxiety disorder. Results: Finally, six RCTs with 407 participants were included in the meta-analyses. In terms of efficacy, pooled analyses indicated that parent-only CBT was significantly more effective than WL for reducing anxiety symptoms with SMD of − 0.72 (95% CI − 1.41 to − 0.03, p = 0.04), and more remission rate with RR of 4.33 (37.96% vs. 6.85, 95% CI 1.82 to 10.27, p = 0.0009) at post-treatment. And our analyses showed no evidence that parent-only CBT had significantly greater efficacy than CBT with parents with SMD of 0.21 (95% CI − 0.09 to 0.50, p = 0.17). Acceptability in the parent-only CBT group was not significantly different to the WL group with RR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.62, p = 0.77), and was significantly worse than in the CBT with parents group with RR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.57, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that parent-only CBT can be an alternative and acceptable intervention for treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorder.

10,Psychological reactions and insomnia in adults with mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disrupted millions of lives and commerce. We investigated psychological reactions and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak in adults with mental health disorders (MDs). Methods: A self-reported psychological and sleep online survey was conducted in China between February 5th to 19th, 2020. A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. Results: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 2.49 ~ 4.67), worsened anxiety (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.76), depression (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 ~ 2.93) and insomnia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.53 ~ 3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adverse psychological reactions and insomnia are more pronounced in adults with mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak, thus more attention need to be provided.

11,Psychological distress among Italians during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine,"Background: Quarantine as a preventive action to reduce people’s exposure to a contagious disease has substantial psychological impact. We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14 days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Results: In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18–50 years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with ≥3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a ≤2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14 days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (r s = + 0.83, p = &lt; 0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (r s = + 0.91, p = &lt; 0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25 km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15 km. Conclusions: Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine’s adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.

12,A cross-sectional study on the association of serum uric acid levels with depressive and anxiety symptoms in people with epilepsy,"Background: High serum uric acid (SUA) levels may provide protection against depression and anxiety through its defensive role in oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of the independent associations of lower SUA levels with depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with epilepsy (PWE). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 320 PWE aged ≥18 years old in Northeast China. The Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E; Chinese version) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7; Chinese version) were used as screening tools for depressive and anxiety symptoms for PWE. Serum uric acid levels were measured. The associations of SUA levels with depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed by using binary logistic regression models, with adjustment for the related risk factors ( P &lt; 0.05). Results: Lower SUA tertiles were significantly associated with higher C-NDDI-E and GAD-7 scores compared with the higher two tertiles ( p = 0.001, and p = 0.002). Patients with depressive symptoms exhibited significantly lower SUA levels compared to those without depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.001). SUA levels of patients with anxiety symptoms were significantly lower than those of patients without anxiety symptoms ( p &lt; 0.001). The first and second SUA tertiles were associated with depressive symptoms, with the third tertile group as the reference group, after adjusting for confounders (first tertile: OR = 4.694, 95% CI = 1.643~ 13.413, P = 0.004; second tertile: OR = 3.440, 95% CI = 1.278~9.256, P = 0.014). However, The first and second SUA tertiles were not associated with the risk of anxiety symptoms compared with the third tertile in the adjusted logistic regression model (First tertile: OR = 1.556, 95% CI = 0.699~3.464, P = 0.279; second tertile: OR = 1.265, 95% CI = 0.607~2.635, P = 0.530). Conclusion: We found that lower SUA levels were independently associated with depressive symptoms but not with anxiety symptoms among PWE. Further well-designed prospective cohort studies are required to determine the causality of the associations and to further clarify the mechanisms of SUA in depressive symptoms.

13,Psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in a large female sample of adults with and without eating disorders,"Background: Internationally, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is commonly used to assess the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms. However, psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the PHQ-9 have only been assessed in adolescents. We present normative data for women and an evaluation of the psychometric properties (internal consistency, convergent validity, and factor structure) of the Norwegian PHQ-9 among women with and without eating disorders (ED). Methods: In this case-control study, a total of 793 females aged 18–78 years (mean 30.39; SD 9.83) completed an online self-report assessment. Measures included the ED100K and Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) to assess ED psychopathology, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form (DERS-SF) to assess symptoms of anxiety and emotion regulation deficits. Participants were categorized into three groups, i.e., previous ED (19.7%, n = 148), current ED (36.3%, n = 272), and no history of ED (44.0%, n = 330), based on self-reported scores on the ED 100 K and the EDE-Q. Results: Mean PHQ-9 total score for those with a previous history of ED was 10.67 (SD 6.33), for those with a current ED 16.61 (SD 5.84), and for those with no lifetime history of ED 6.83 (SD 5.58). Excellent internal consistency was demonstrated by Cronbach’s alpha’s for individuals with a previous ED (.88), for individuals with a current ED (.86), and for individuals with no history of ED (.88). Acceptable convergent validity was indicated based on significant correlations between the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and DERS-SF. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed a mediocre fit for a one-factor structure of the PHQ-9, regardless of diagnostic status. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the PHQ-9 are acceptable across females with and without ED, and the PHQ-9 can be recommended for use in clinical ED settings and for people without mental disorders.

14,Mental disorder and PTSD in Syria during wartime: A nationwide crisis,"Background: Syria has experienced war since 2011, leaving over 80% under the poverty line and millions displaced. War and its retaliations have significantly impacted the mental health of Syrians. This study evaluates the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the severity of the mental distress caused by war and other factors such as low social support. This study also evaluates other variables and compares the findings with those of multiple studies on Syria and refugees. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that included people who lived in Syria in different governorates. Online surveys were distributed into multiple online groups and included the Kessler 10 (K10) scale which screens for anxiety and depression, the Screen for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (SPTSS) tool, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and questionnaires on demographic and war-related factors. Results: Our study included 1951 participants, of which, 527 (27.0%) were males and 1538 (78.8%) between the age of 19 and 25. Among participants, 44% had likely severe mental disorder, 27% had both likely severe mental disorder and full PTSD symptoms, 36.9% had full PTSD symptoms, and only 10.8% had neither positive PTSD symptoms nor mental disorder on the K10 scale. Around 23% had low overall support. Half of the responders were internally displaced, and 27.6% were forced to change places of living three times or more due to war. Around 86.6% of the responders believed that the war was the main reason for their mental distress. Those with high SPTSS and K10 scores were found to take more days off from work or school due to negative feelings and having somatic symptoms. Moreover, the number of times changing places of living due to war, educational level, and being distressed by war noise were the most prominent factors for more severe PTSD and mental distress. No differences in PTSD and mental disorder prevalence were noted in participants living in different governorates or among different types of jobs. A strong significant correlation (r = 0.623) was found between SPTSS and K10 scores. Conclusion: The conflict in Syria has left the population at great risk for mental distress which was higher compared to Syrian refugees elsewhere. Many measures with an emphasis on mental health are needed to help the people against a long-term avoidable suffering.

0,Influencing Factors of Psychological Well-Being of the Non-designated Hospital Staff in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: Recent studies report that hospital staff at the forefront of caring for COVID-19 patients experience increased psychological distress. To effectively manage the outbreak of COVID-19, China established COVID-19 designated and non-designated hospitals. To date, few studies have examined the impacts of COVID-19 on psychological health of staff working at non-designated hospitals. This study is to explore factors affecting psychological health of non-designated hospital staff in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected through an online questionnaire between February and March 2020. The questionnaire consists of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-20), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), sociodemographic characteristics, employment history, health status, and contact history of COVID-19. The questionnaire was distributed through hospital WeChat groups and work colleague referrals. A total of 470 non-designated hospital staff members completed the questionnaire. Multiple Linear Regression analysis was used to interpret the associations among social support, coping styles, sociodemographic factors, job roles, and psychological status. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Results: The non-designated hospital staff differed significantly in anxiety and depression subscores of the GHQ-20 by their job roles, levels of social support, and history of mental disorders. Staff with medical job roles, good self-reported health status, no previous mental disorders, adequate social support, and positive coping styles scored lower in GHQ-20 total score, which indicated healthier psychological status. Conclusions: The results indicate that history of mental health disorders, non-medical job roles, and inadequate social support are associated with greater psychological distress. Personalized support should be provided to those who are vulnerable and in need of social and psychological support.",2492282284.0, Journal Article,2021
1,"The Association Between Impaired Awareness and Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.","Objectives: Impaired awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a lack of awareness has been suggested to be a protective factor against experiencing affective symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy which are common in AD, there is conflicting evidence about the links between them. This systematic review examines the evidence for an association between impaired awareness and depressive, anxiety, and apathy symptoms in mild to moderate AD. Method: We searched four databases (OvidMedline, Embase, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles) using terms encompassing awareness, apathy, depression, anxiety, and mild-moderate AD. We included studies that assessed the relationship between awareness and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or apathy. We assessed included papers for quality and report results using a narrative approach, prioritizing high quality studies. Results: We identified 1,544 articles, and twenty-seven studies fulfilled inclusion criteria (high-quality = 15; moderate-quality = 12). Most high-quality studies reported that impaired awareness in early-stage AD is cross-sectionally linked with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms (correlation ranged from -0.3 to -0.7), but with more apathy. Conclusions: High-quality studies suggested that in people with early AD, impaired awareness is related to fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms and to more apathy. Future research should focus on elucidating causality among impaired awareness and these symptoms in AD.",2492279936.0, Systematic Review,2021
2,Alcohol- and Cigarette-Use Related Behaviors During Quarantine and Physical Distancing Amid COVID-19 in Indonesia.,"Background: In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Indonesia implemented large-scale social restrictions (pembatasan sosial berskala besar/PSBB) to combat the spread of COVID-19, which might influence addictive behaviors. The current study aimed to explore the fluctuation of substance use during the pandemic and association of physical distancing and related factors toward consumption of alcohol and cigarettes. Method: An online survey was conducted from April 28 to June 1, 2020. Data regarding sociodemographic information, physical distancing profile, alcohol and cigarette usages, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS), Symptom Checklist-90, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were collected. A total of 4,584 respondents from all 34 provinces in Indonesia completed the survey. Data were summarized descriptively and analyzed using chi-square, ANOVA, and multinomial regression on SPSS 23.0 for Windows. Results: This study found that during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia alcohol consumption was 9.50% and daily cigarette smoking was 20.3%. Around 44.5% and 47.6% of respondents reported stable alcohol consumption and cigarette consumption, respectively. The mean AUDIT score was 3.52 ± 4.66 and the mean CDS score was 24.73 ± 8.86. Physical distancing was not correlated to any substance use changes. Increased alcohol consumption was negatively correlated with being unmarried and positively correlated with a higher PSQI score. Decreased alcohol use positively correlated with living in PSBB-implementing provinces and higher AUDIT scores when compared to stable alcohol drinking. Increased cigarette smoking was positively correlated with being male, unmarried, and higher CDS scores. Reduced cigarette smoking was negatively correlated with living in provinces implementing PSBB, higher CDS scores, and phobic anxiety, hostility, and psychoticism subscales of SCL-90. Discussion and Conclusion: The prevalence of alcohol and cigarette consumption changes showed a similar trend with other available studies in other countries. This study established that substance use was mainly sustained with a smaller proportion of respondents amplifying their substance usages. The changes were correlated with PSBB policy but not the practice of physical distancing. Psychiatry and addiction services in Indonesia should be strengthened to cope with the increased burden of psychological distress. Future studies should conduct more comparisons to determine whether the overall rising intensity of consumption was maintained post-pandemic and delineate acute psychopathologies' effects on substance use.",2491943271.0, Journal Article,2021
3,"COVID-19 Pandemic: Demographic Predictors of Self-Isolation or Self-Quarantine and Impact of Isolation and Quarantine on Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression.","Introduction: With the sudden onset and global dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many nations including Canada attempted to reduce spread of the resultant COVID-19 syndrome with self-isolation and quarantine, while seeking a cure or vaccine for this disease. Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. Methods: The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. Results: 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-hoc analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.",2491072428.0, Journal Article,2021
4,"The Relationship Between the Implementation of Statutory Preventative Measures, Perceived Susceptibility of COVID-19, and Personality Traits in the Initial Stage of Corona-Related Lockdown: A German and Austrian Population Online Survey.","Background: Particularly during the early and middle stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a population's compliance with precautionary measures (e.g., hygiene rules, smart working, travel restrictions, and quarantine) is paramount in preventing the virus from spreading. Objective: The investigation and documentation of different socio-demographic and personality-specific factors in regards to preventative measures and consequent specific health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the Health Belief Model. Method: An online survey was conducted on N = 3,006 individuals living in Germany and Austria during the early stages of lockdown. The questionnaire consisted of a self-administered section, exploring the dimensions posited in the Health Belief Model: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perceived benefits of health-promoting measures, and engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Additionally, the following standardized scales were used to record personality determinants: the Stress Coping Style Questionnaire SVF 78 to evaluate coping and processing strategies in stressful circumstances, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to assess the emotional state induced by the coronavirus crisis, the UI-18 scale to diagnose the intolerance of uncertainty, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess anxiety. Results: In line with the Health Belief model, four groups were created based on perceived susceptibility and engagement in health-promoting behaviors, and consequently studied in relation to personality determinants. Those four groups differed significantly in regards to almost all personality dimensions (p ≤ 0.005). Group 1 (n = 450) shows a reduced engagement with protective measures and displays underestimation of the COVID-19-pandemic. Group 2 (n = 984) displays many positive personality variables and high compliance with protective measures. Group 3 (n = 468) perceives the subjective risk of disease as high, but high emotional discomfort and stress caused by the protective measures leads to the activation of a complex fear defense. Group 4 (n = 1,004) is highly anxious and therefore compliant. Conclusion: This typification has implications for establishing the appropriate support systems. This is particularly important to encourage compliance with preventive regulations within the groups, which showed poor abidance for several reasons. For Group 1, further education on the realistic threat and efficient protective measures is as central as the fostering of empathy for others; with its resource-conscious exemplary behavior Group 2 could be used as a positive social role model. Group 3 would benefit from promoting self-care, while Group 4 requires information on psychosocial assistance availability in order to mitigate the high stress to which the group members are subjected.",2489597192.0, Journal Article,2021
5,Predicting Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety Using Smartphone and Wearable Data.,"Background: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide but often remain undetected and untreated. Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods. Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24-68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study. Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = -0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression. Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.",2489596247.0, Journal Article,2021
6,Mental Health Consequences for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review to Draw Lessons for LMICs.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This scoping review provides a summary of current evidence on the mental health consequences of COVID on HCWs. Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching PubMed and Embase for articles relevant to mental health conditions among HCWs during COVID-19. Relevant articles were screened and extracted to summarize key outcomes and findings. Results: A total of fifty-one studies were included in this review. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological trauma, insomnia and sleep quality, workplace burnout and fatigue, and distress were the main outcomes reviewed. Most studies found a high number of symptoms endorsed for depression, anxiety, and other conditions. We found differences in symptoms by sex, age, and HCW role, with female, younger-aged, frontline workers, and non-physician workers being affected more than other subgroups. Conclusion: This review highlights the existing burden of mental health conditions reported by HCWs during COVID-19. It also demonstrates emerging disparities among affected HCW subgroups. This scoping review emphasizes the importance of generating high quality evidence and developing informed interventions for HCW mental health with a focus on LMICs.",2489595107.0, Journal Article,2021
0,A randomized controlled trial examining CBT for college students with ADHD,"Objective: College students with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for numerous educational and psychosocial difficulties. This study reports findings from a large, multisite randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a treatment for this population, known as ACCESS-Accessing Campus Connections and Empowering Student Success. Method: ACCESS is a cognitive–behavioral therapy program delivered via group treatment and individual mentoring across two semesters. A total of 250 students (18–30 years of age, 66% female, 6.8% Latino, 66.3% Caucasian) with rigorously defined ADHD and comorbidity status were recruited from two public universities and randomly assigned to receive ACCESS immediately or on a 1-year delayed basis. Treatment response was assessed on three occasions, addressing primary (i.e., ADHD, executive functioning, depression, anxiety) and secondary (i.e., clinical change mechanisms, service utilization) outcomes. Results: Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) revealed significantly greater improvements among immediate ACCESS participants in terms of ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, clinical change mechanisms, and use of disability accommodations, representing medium to large effects (Cohen's d, .39–1.21). Across these same outcomes, clinical significance analyses using reliable change indices (RCI; Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1992) revealed significantly higher percentages of ACCESS participants showing improvement. Although treatment-induced improvements in depression and anxiety were not evident from LGCM, RCI analyses indicated that immediate ACCESS participants were less likely to report a worsening in depression/anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Findings from this RCT provide strong evidence in support of the efficacy and feasibility of ACCESS as a treatment for young adults with ADHD attending college.",2485545082.0, Journal Article,2021
0,ERP evidence for emotional sensitivity in social anxiety,"Background: Emotional sensitivity involves the ability to recognize and interpret facial expressions. This is very important for interpersonal communication. Previous studies found differences in emotional sensitivity between high social anxiety (HSA) individuals and low social anxiety (LSA) individuals. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. The present study explored the effects of expression intensity and social anxiety on emotional sensitivity and their neural mechanisms. Methods: The HSA group (n = 20) and the LSA group (n = 20) were asked to recognize anger expressions with different intensities in an emotion recognition task. The hit rate, reaction time, early time window (P1, N170), and late time window (LPP) were recorded. Results: The results showed that individuals with HSA had a significantly higher hit rate and shorter reaction time than individuals with LSA (p &lt; 0.01). Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that, compared to the LSA group, the HSA group exhibited significantly enhanced N170 and LPP amplitude (p &lt; 0.01). However, the difference in P1 amplitude was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Limitations: The participants in this study were a subclinical social anxiety sample, and the effects of other mood disorders were not excluded, partially limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, compared to LSA individuals, HSA individuals are more sensitive to all presented faces. The ERP results indicated that HSA individuals’ high sensitivity to threatening expressions is related to stronger structural encoding and fine processing.

1,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction: There are only a few published empirical data on COVID‐19′s effects on the mental health. Material and Methods: During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ± 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38 ± 10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. Statistical Analysis: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. Conclusions: The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.

2,The structure of executive dysfunction in depression and anxiety,"Background: Although research has demonstrated that depression and anxiety are associated with problematic executive function (EF), results are often inconsistent and underspecified. Delineating specific EF impairments in depression and anxiety has the potential to provide a mechanistic account of symptom presentation and course in these highly co-occurring disorders. The present study evaluated associations between components of EF and symptom dimensions of depression (depressed mood) and anxiety (anxious apprehension, anxious arousal) using factor analyses and structural equation modeling. Methods: Undergraduates ( N = 1,123) completed self-report measures of EF in everyday life and of psychopathology. Based on a three-factor model (Miyake et al., 2000), item-level exploratory ( n = 561) and confirmatory ( n = 562) factor analyses were conducted on inhibition, shifting, and working memory scales chosen from the EF measure. Structural equation modeling tested the relationship of EF factors to dimensions of psychopathology using the total sample. Results: A three-factor model of EF best fit the data and was replicated via confirmatory factor analysis. Depressed mood and anxious arousal evidenced broad deficits across all EF domains, whereas anxious apprehension evidenced shifting disruptions. Limitations: Perceived EF may not index the same constructs as performance-based EF tests. Further, the present study was restricted to college students, warranting replication in other samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that depressed mood and anxious arousal are characterized by a general disruption in the ability to maintain task goals, whereas anxious apprehension is characterized by cognitive inflexibility. EF impairments are likely contributory factors in the maintenance of affective disorders.

3,Mental health and its correlates among children and adolescents during COVID-19 school closure: The importance of parent-child discussion,"Background: School closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak have affected 87% of the world's students physically, socially, and psychologically, yet rigorous investigation into their mental health during this period is still lacking. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13–23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. Results: The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations: Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. Conclusions: Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.

4,"""Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic"" by Catherine Lebel, Anna MacKinnon, Mercedes Bagshawe, Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen and Gerald Giesbrecht ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2020[Dec][1], Vol 277, 5-13). In the original article, there was an error in the syntax that caused systematically lowered scores for all individuals on the pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) and the interpersonal support evaluation list (ISEL). These scores have been updated in the tables and the text, and the corrections are present in this erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-75728-003). Background: Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.

5,"Modelling the contribution of the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress to generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the current study we sought to extend our understanding of vulnerability and protective factors (the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress) in predicting generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants ( n = 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R² = .75). The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2021
6,"The role of expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal in cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder: A study of self-report, subjective, and electrocortical measures","Background: Contemporary models of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) emphasize emotion dysregulation as a core impairment whose reduction may play a causal role in psychotherapy. The current study examined changes in use of emotion regulation strategies as possible mechanisms of change in CBT for SAD. Specifically, we examined changes in expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal during CBT and whether these changes predict treatment outcome. Methods: Patients ( n = 34; 13 females; Mean age = 28.36 (6.97)) were allocated to 16-20 sessions of CBT. An electrocortical measure of emotion regulation and a clinician-rated measure of SAD were administered monthly. Self-report measures of emotion regulation and social anxiety were administered weekly. Multilevel models were used to examine changes in emotion regulation during treatment and cross-lagged associations between emotion regulation and anxiety. Results: CBT led to decreased suppression frequency, increased reappraisal self-efficacy, and decreased unpleasantness for SAD-related pictures ( p s &lt; .05). At post-treatment, patients were equivalent to healthy controls in terms of suppression frequency and subjective reactivity to SAD-related stimuli. Gains were maintained at 3-months follow-up. Decreases in suppression frequency and electrocortical reactivity to SAD-related pictures predicted lower subsequent anxiety but not the other way around (ps &lt; .05). Lower anxiety predicted greater subsequent increases in reappraisal self-efficacy. Limitations: The lack of a control group precludes conclusions regarding mechanisms specificity. Conclusions: Decreased frequency of suppression is a potential mechanism of change in CBT for SAD.

7,Prospective associations between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: During adolescence, peer relationships take precedence and there is a normative increase in social anxiety. Although prospective studies have suggested peer functioning and social anxiety can influence each other, their findings have not been examined systematically. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to examine the bidirectional relationship between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescence. Methods: EMBASE, PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed were searched to identify relevant articles. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine the mean effect sizes of prospective associations between social anxiety and four dimensions of peer functioning. Moderator analysis was performed, with age, gender, time interval between baseline and follow-up assessment, and publication year as moderators. Results: Meta-analyses of 23 studies showed that friendship quality (r = -.11), peer rejection (r = -.06), and peer victimization (r =.23) were each associated with later social anxiety, but peer acceptance was not (r = -.11). Social anxiety at baseline was associated with prospective levels of friendship quality (r = -.11), peer rejection (r = .09), and peer victimization (r =.17), but not peer acceptance (r = -.14). Age moderated the association between friendship quality and prospective social anxiety. Other moderator effects were statistically non-significant. Limitations: Limitations include different classifications of peer functioning, the use of self-report measures, heterogeneity between studies, and underrepresentation of clinical samples. Conclusions: A significant bidirectional association was found with social anxiety across three dimensions of peer functioning. Psychological prevention and intervention targeting peer functioning and social anxiety are indicated.

8,Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder symptoms and suicidal ideation among college students: A structural equation modeling approach,"Objective: Suicidal ideation (SI) among college students is frequently reported. However, the mediating roles of depressive and anxiety symptoms between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and SI has yet to be explored among college students. Method: A cross-sectional survey of college freshmen in China was conducted between October 2018 and December 2018. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on basic sociodemographic characteristics, including SI, ADHD symptoms, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. A structural equation model (SEM) was then constructed. Results: A total of 904 college freshmen were included in the analysis. The prevalence of ADHD symptoms and lifetime SI were 11.9% (95% CI: 9.9%–14.2%) and 29.2% (95% CI: 26.3%–32.2%), respectively. The SEM revealed that there were no direct paths from inattention, executive dysfunction, and hyperactivity to SI. Under the mediating role of anxiety and depressive symptoms, executive dysfunction (β = 0.011, p &lt; 0.05) and hyperactivity (β = 0.015, p &lt; 0.05) had indirect relationships with the risk of SI, and the role of inattention was not identified. Depressive and anxiety symptoms had direct influences on increasing SI. There also were indirect effects from anxiety symptoms to SI, which were mediated by depressive symptoms (β = 0.023, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The current study indicated the indirect relationships between ADHD symptoms and SI among college freshmen. The findings could provide useful clues for clinical treatment and school-based prevention that aims to improve college students’ mental well-being.

9,Effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions on anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission: A systematic review,"Background: Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) even during periods of remission and impede treatment efficacy, prognosis and functional capacity. This highlights a pressing clinical need to identify novel effective anxiety treatments. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence within the field. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) targeting anxiety in remitted BD patients. Results: We identified 10 RCTs investigating the effects of psychological or pharmacological treatments on anxiety in remitted BD patients. Two studies of transdiagnostic personalised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) found a treatment-related reduction in anxiety. This evidence was preliminary given small sample size and use of self-report measures in a single-blind trial design, respectively. The remaining six psychological intervention trials provided more preliminary evidence due to several methodological challenges. The two pharmacological studies found anxiolytic effects of add-on olanzapine or methylene blue to lithium treatment, respectively. Nevertheless, this evidence should be interpreted with caution given high drop-out rates and substantial side-effects that may have impeded blinding. Limitations: We did not conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of modified CBT and add-on pharmacotherapy on residual anxiety in BD. Future trials should pre-screen participants for anxiety, define one clinician-rated anxiety measurement as a primary outcome, and employ intention-to-treat analysis to assess treatment effect. This will advance treatment development and enable personalised approaches to address residual anxiety in BD, which has great clinical relevance.

10,"Comparing discrimination among people with schizophrenia, affective and anxiety disorders. A multilevel study in five European countries","Background: Most research on mental illness stigma has involved people with psychosis; less information is available for people with affective and anxiety disorders. We aimed to compare experienced and anticipated discrimination among people with schizophrenia, and affective and anxiety disorders. Methods: People with schizophrenia (n = 773), affective (n = 1010) and anxiety disorders (n = 372) were recruited during psychiatric admission across 5 EU countries. The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) was used. Multivariate mixed effect logistic regression models with a random effect for hospital and country were performed to explore patient characteristics associated with experienced and anticipated discrimination. Results: With anxiety disorders, there were more reports of experiences of discrimination in social life (35%), intimate relationships (23.5%), and physical healthcare (19%); in schizophrenia, in relations with neighbours (23.6%) and mental health staff (21.7%); and in affective disorders, in parental role (22.8%). In multivariate analyses, anxiety was associated with increased likelihood of experiencing discrimination in police interactions (OR = 1.675; p = 0.038) and physical healthcare (OR = 1.816; p = 0.003), and reduced likelihood when starting a family (OR = 0.474; p = 0.01) as compared with schizophrenia. Affective (OR = 1.367; p = 0.004) and anxiety disorders (OR = 1.354; p = 0.034) were associated with increased likelihood of concealing a diagnosis compared with schizophrenia. Limitations: As patients with affective and anxiety disorders were recruited from hospital inpatient units, their experiences may not be representative of all people with these disorders. Conclusions: In a sample of people receiving inpatient treatment, experienced and anticipated discrimination are perceived, at least in some life domains, as more of a burden for people with affective and anxiety disorders than those with schizophrenia.

11,Personality difficulties and response to community-based psychological treatment for anxiety and depression,"Background: Previous research suggests that comorbid personality disorder may be associated with a less favourable treatment outcome for individuals with depression and anxiety disorder. However, little is known about whether personality difficulties are associated with treatment outcomes within Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services-the largest platform for treating depression and anxiety in England, UK. Secondary aims were to investigate i) whether individual personality difficulties are associated with treatment outcome and ii) whether findings are moderated by treatment type. Methods: The sample included 3,689 adults who accessed community-based psychological treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy, emotional skills training, or other psychological therapy) for depression and/or anxiety disorder. Associations between personality difficulties (assessed with the Standardised Assessment of Personality–Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS)) and treatment outcomes (recovery and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety symptom scores, assessed using questionnaire-based measures) were investigated using logistic/linear regression. Results: Personality difficulties were associated with a reduced likelihood of recovery (adjusted OR per unit increase on SAPAS: depression = 0.87, 95%CI 0.84, 0.91; anxiety = 0.86, 95%CI 0.82, 0.90) and reliable improvement (adjusted OR per unit increase on SAPAS: depression = 0.88, 95%CI 0.84, 0.92; anxiety = 0.85, 95%CI 0.82, 0.89). Those with three or more difficulties were over 30% less likely to recover/reliably improve. Limitations: Personality difficulties data were collected via self-report and were not available for all participants. Conclusion: Patients with personality difficulties have a less favourable response to psychological treatment for depression/anxiety disorder. If replicated, the findings highlight a major challenge to the way community-based psychological therapy services in England (IAPT services) are presently constituted.

12,Gender-specific effect of pregnancy-related anxiety on preschooler's emotional and behavioral development: A population-based cohort study,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety plays a major role in shaping offspring's neural development. However, its gender-specific effect on children's emotional and behavioral development is controversial and the knowledge of critical period is limited. This study aims to examine gender-specific effect of pregnancy-related anxiety on preschooler's emotional and behavioral development. Methods: This study was based on the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS). A total of 3443 mother-child pairs were included in final data analysis. Pregnancy-related anxiety was assessed by Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire respectively in the 1 st and 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were completed by parents to assess preschool emotional and behavioral development in boys and girls. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between pregnancy-related anxiety and preschoolers’ emotional and behavioral problems. Results: The overall prevalence of pregnancy-related anxiety was 31.6%. Compared with those whose mothers without pregnancy-related anxiety in either 1 st or 3 rd trimester, preschool boys born of mothers with pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1st trimester and in the 3rd trimester had an increased risk of conduct problems. Pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1 st , 3 rd trimester and in both trimesters all related with preschool boys’ hyperactivity and total difficult problems. Pregnancy-related anxiety in the 1st trimester and in both 1 st and 3 rd trimester increased the risk of preschool girls’ emotional problems and total difficult problems. Conclusion: Pregnancy-related anxiety may relate with preschool boys’ externalizing problems in early and late of pregnancy and increase the risk of internalizing problems in girls in early pregnancy. Limitations: There was no data on pregnancy-related anxiety in the second trimester.

0,The efficacy of mindfulness meditation apps in enhancing users’ well-being and mental health related outcomes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Mindfulness applications are popular tools for improving well-being, but their effectiveness is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed a mindfulness meditation app as the main intervention to improve users’ well-being and mental-health related outcomes. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, the Cochrane Library, Open Grey and ResearchGate through June, 2020. Effects were calculated as standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) between app-delivered mindfulness interventions and control conditions at post-test and pooled with a random-effects model. Results: From 2637 records, we selected 34 trials (N = 7566). Significant effect sizes were found at post-test for perceived stress (n = 15; g = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, .68], I ² = 68%), anxiety (n = 15; g = 0.28, 95% CI [0.16, .40], I ² = 35%), depression (n = 15; g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.24, .43], I ² = 0%), and psychological well-being (n = 5; g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.14, .45], I ² = 0%). No significant effects were found for distress at post-test (n = 6; g = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.02, .22], I ² = 11%) and general well-being (n = 5; g = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.29], I ² = 14%). Conclusion and limitations: Mindfulness apps seem promising in improving well-being and mental-health, though results should be interpreted carefully due to the small number of included studies, overall uncertain risk of bias and heterogeneity.

1,Mood disorders comorbidity in obese bariatric patients: The role of the emotional dysregulation,"Background: Obese patients seeking bariatric surgery are known to show high rates of mental disorders, mainly mood and eating disorders. The aim of the present study is to evaluate psychiatric comorbidities, affective temperamental dimensions, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity in a sample of obese bariatric patients, exploring the differences between obese patients with and without mood disorders (MD). Methods: A total of 69 obese patients were consecutively enrolled between March and November 2019 during the presurgical evaluation routinely performed before the bariatric intervention. Sociodemographic and clinical features were collected by psychiatrists during a single consultation. Affective temperaments, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity were also investigated through self-report questionnaires. Epidemiological and clinical variables were compared between patients with and without MD. Results: In our sample, almost 3 out of 4 patients presented a lifetime psychiatric disorder, mainly MD (n = 33, 48%), binge eating disorder (BED) (n = 34, 49%) and anxiety disorders (n = 30, 43%). Compared to N-MD patients, those with MD showed higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity with BED, bulimia and panic disorder. In addition, obese patients with MD showed more frequently cyclothymic, depressive and anxious temperaments, and higher mean scores on the psychometric questionnaires assessing emotional dysregulation and impulsivity compared to obese subjects without MD. Limitations: the small sample size, the retrospectively assessment of psychiatric disorders and the self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: A subgroup of obese patients, especially among those with MD, show high emotional dysregulation, affective lability and impulsiveness that could represent suitable substrates for the development of compulsive and addictive eating habits.

2,"Sex differences in prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of internet addiction among chinese college students","Background: Internet addiction (IA) is now very common. However, few studies have explored the sex differences in risk factors for IA, especially among Chinese college students. This study aimed to investigate the sex differences in prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of IA among Chinese college students. Methods: A total of 8098 college students from Hunan province were recruited using a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Each student filled out the survey online anonymously, which collected their information on their socio-demographics, internet addiction(Revised Chinese internet addiction scale; CIAS-R), ADHD (Wender Utah Rating Scale and World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v 1.1 Symptom Checklist), depression(Self-reporting Depression Scale; SDS), insomnia(Athens Insomnia Scale; AIS), anxiety(Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; SAS) and suicidal behaviors through WeChat. Results: Overall, the prevalence of IA in males and females was 7.21%(259/3592) and 8.17%(368/4506), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that suicidal ideation[odds ratio (OR),1.557;95% confidence interval (CI),1.083-2.240], suicide attempts (OR,2.081;95%CI:1.271-3.409), ADHD (OR,6.487;95%CI,4.697-8.959) and insomnia (OR,2.596;95%CI,1.910-3.529) were independent risk factors for male IA after controlling for confounding variables. Nationality (OR,1.507;95%CI,1.058-2.145), suicidal ideation(OR,2.012;95%CI,1.532-2.641), depression (OR,1.771;95%CI:1.071-2.930), ADHD (OR,4.497; 95%CI,3.285-6.158) and insomnia (OR,2.356;95%CI,1.813-3.061) were independent risk factors for female IA. Limitation: No causal relationships could be drawn due to the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: This study shows IA is common among both sexes. IA is significantly associated with ADHD, insomnia and suicidal behaviors in both male and female students, indicating the importance of screening IA and addressing ADHD, insomnia and suicidal behaviors to improve the mental health of college students and better prevent suicide in both sexes.

3,Psychometric properties of the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with DSM-5 Mixed subtype questionnaire in Chinese patients with mood disorders,"Background: With the modification of DSM-5 mixed features specifier, a brief scale to screen mixed features in patients with mood disorders is needed in clinical practice. This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with DSM-5 Mixed subtype (CUDOS-M-C) for the Chinese patients with mood disorders. Methods: Overall, 300 patients with major depressive episode were recruited. All participants were assessed using CUDOS-M-C, Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the optimal cut-off values of CUDOS-M-C score. The reliability and validity of CUDOS-M-C were examined using Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and principal component analysis (PCA). Results: The results of PCA indicated two-factor structure as the best solution for CUDOS-M-C, which explained 54.82% of cumulative variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.892 and the ICC was 0.853. The area under the ROC curve of the CUDOS-M-C for participants with mixed depression was 0.927 ( p &lt; 0.001) and the suitable cut-off value was 8, with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 79.9%. Limitations: Most of the patients were recruited from eastern China and further research with larger sample is warranted. And this study did not perform confirmatory factor analysis to identify the generalization of factor structure of CUDOS-M-C. Besides, the study performed the test-retest reliability of CUDOS-M-C and further analysis is needed to ascertain the patient's post-treatment changes. Conclusion: The CUDOS-M-C demonstrated to have satisfactory psychometric properties as a self-report scale, and could be applied to screen patients with mixed depression in clinical practice.

4,Suicide risk in people with post-traumatic stress disorder: A cohort study of 3.1 million people in Sweden,"Background: It is unclear whether post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] is associated with suicide risk in the general population, whether this differs by sex, or what the population impact of PTSD is for suicide. Methods: We constructed a nationwide cohort of all people living in Sweden, born 1973–1997, followed from their 14th birthday (or immigration, if later) until suicide, other death, emigration or 31 December 2016. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios [HR], and calculated the population impact of PTSD on suicide. We included sensitivity analyses to explore effects of outcome and exposure definitions, and to account for potential competing risks. Results: Of 3,177,706 participants, 22,361 (0•7%) were diagnosed with PTSD, and 6,319 (0•2%) died by suicide over 49•2 million person-years. Compared with women and men without PTSD, suicide rates were 6•74 (95%CI: 5•61–8•09) and 3•96 (95%CI: 3•12–5•03) times higher in those with PTSD, respectively, after sociodemographic adjustment. Suicide rates remained elevated in women (HR: 2•61; 95%CI: 2•16–3•14) and men (HR: 1•67; 95%CI: 1•31–2•12) after adjustment for previous psychiatric conditions; attenuation was driven by previous non-fatal suicide attempts. Findings were insensitive to definitions or competing risks. If causal, 1•6% (95%CI: 1•2–2•1) of general population suicides could be attributed to PTSD, and up to 53.7% (95%CI: 46.1–60.2) in people with PTSD. Limitations: Residual confounding remains possible due to depressive and anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care but unrecorded in these registers. Conclusions: Clinical guidelines for the management of people with PTSD should recognise increased suicide risks.

5,Acute effects of cannabis on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Little is known about the the acute effects of cannabis on symptoms of OCD in humans. Therefore, this study sought to: 1) examine whether symptoms of OCD are significantly reduced after inhaling cannabis, 2) examine predictors (gender, dose, cannabis constituents, time) of these symptom changes and 3) explore potential long-term consequences of repeatedly using cannabis to self-medicate for OCD symptoms, including changes in dose and baseline symptom severity over time. Method: Data were analyzed from the app Strainprint® which provides medical cannabis patients a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and strains of cannabis across time. Specifically, data were analyzed from 87 individuals self-identifying with OCD who tracked the severity of their intrusions, compulsions, and/or anxiety immediately before and after 1,810 cannabis use sessions spanning a period of 31 months. Results: Patients reported a 60% reduction in compulsions, a 49% reduction in intrusions, and a 52% reduction in anxiety from before to after inhaling cannabis. Higher concentrations of CBD and higher doses predicted larger reductions in compulsions. The number of cannabis use sessions across time predicted changes in intrusions, such that later cannabis use sessions were associated with smaller reductions in intrusions. Baseline symptom severity and dose remained fairly constant over time. Limitations: The sample was self-selected, self-identified as having OCD, and there was no placebo control group. Conclusions: Inhaled cannabis appears to have short-term beneficial effects on symptoms of OCD. However, tolerance to the effects on intrusions may develop over time.

6,Tackling heterogeneity: Individual variability of emotion decoding deficits in severe alcohol use disorder,"Background: Severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) is associated with social cognition deficits. Patients with SAUD are impaired for the recognition of emotional facial expressions, particularly at early stages of abstinence. These deficits damage interpersonal relations and increase relapse risk. However, uncertainties still abound on their variation across emotions and on the heterogeneity of emotional impairments across patients. We addressed these questions by exploring how the deficit varies according to emotions’ type/intensity and patients’ heterogeneity. Methods: Sixty-five recently detoxified patients with SAUD and 65 matched healthy controls performed the Facial Emotion Recognition Test, assessing the ability to identify six emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness) displayed by morphed faces with various intensities. Accuracy scores and detection thresholds were collected for each emotion. Beyond group comparisons, multiple single-case analyses determined the percentage of patients presenting decoding deficits for each emotion. Results: When current depression and anxiety symptoms were controlled for, patients did not present a general emotion decoding deficit, but were rather characterized by specific deficits for disgust/contempt in accuracy, and for disgust in detection threshold scores. Single-case analyses showed that only a third of patients presented a clinically significant emotional deficit. Conclusions: Patients with SAUD only present emotional decoding deficits for specific interpersonal emotions (disgust/contempt) when subclinical psychopathological states are controlled for, and show no general emotional impairment. This goes against the proposal of a generalized social cognition deficit in this population. This group effect moreover masks a massive heterogeneity across patients, which has implications at experimental and clinical levels.

7,Smoking and drinking among patients with mental disorders: Evidence from a nationally representative Japanese survey,"Background: No studies to date have addressed the association of mental disorder with smoking and drinking behaviors independent of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We therefore examined this association, stratified by age and sex, to determine the target population for behavioral modification in Japan. Methods: We analyzed data from participants aged 20-79 years without hospitalized or institutionalized status who participated in the nationwide Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions conducted in 2016. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for current smoking, heavy daily smoking (&gt; 20 cigarettes per day), at-risk drinking (&gt; 100 g alcohol per week), and heavy drinking (&gt; 350 g) were calculated with adjustment for potential confounders. After stratification by age (20-39, 40-64, and 65-79 years) and sex, prevalence and PRs were calculated using propensity scores. Results: From among 340,194 participants, 8275 (2.4%) had mental disorder. Presence of mental disorder was significantly associated with current smoking (PR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.12-1.23) and heavy daily smoking (PR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.21-1.50) and inversely associated with at-risk drinking (PR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.66-0.75). PRs for smoking behavior were higher in women than in men and in younger adults than in the other age groups. They were particularly high in younger women (PR = 1.67 for current smokers and PR = 2.17 for heavy daily smokers). Limitations: Our findings were obtained from a cross-sectional study. Conclusion: This is the first evidence that the association of mental disorder with smoking behavior is independent of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Our results indicate the need for tailored behavioral modification interventions for young people with mental disorders in Japan, particularly young women.

0,"Pandemic-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes among medical assistants during the SARS-CoV-2 (“Coronavirus”) pandemic in Germany: A cross-sectional Study","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe since December 2019 creating much uncertainty among medical staff. Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. Methods: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. Results: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one’s financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one’s financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08–1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22–1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01–1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55–2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07–1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07–1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18–2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71–5.98]). Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices.

1,Why the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor,"The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor. Current pathogenic event models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-threatening events. Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants ( N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 “exposure” (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria. The emotional impact of “worst” experienced/anticipated events best predicted PTSD-like symptoms. Taken together, our findings support emerging research that COVID-19 can be understood as a traumatic stressor event capable of eliciting PTSD-like responses and exacerbating other related mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning, etc.). Our findings add to existing literature supporting a pathogenic event memory model of traumatic stress.

2,"Anxiety and depression symptoms, the recovery from symptoms, and loneliness before and after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population: Findings from a Dutch population-based longitudinal study","Objectives: Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and loneliness in the general population. More specifically, the study focused on prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, the extent to which individuals with existing symptoms recovered or not, the prevalence of subtypes of loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness before and during this pandemic was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods: Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; N total = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI5). Results: Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). Conclusions: Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased.

0,Psychological impacts from COVID-19 among university students: Risk factors across seven states in the United States,"Background: University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes—such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic—the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students’ anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students Results: Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/ poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. Conclusion: Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students’ mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education.

Prisciandaro, Delisa G. Brown, Kathleen T. Brady and Bryan K. Tolliver ( Psychiatry Research , 2011[Aug][15], Vol 188[3], 361-365). The authors regret that although the text (i.e., Section 3.2, “Associations between co-occurring diagnoses and outcomes”) correctly noted that antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was not uniquely significantly associated with any outcomes, Table 3 (“Results from path models with co-occurring diagnoses predicting outcomes”) incorrectly displays stars (**) below “OCDS” and “MADRS,” indicating statistically significant associations between aspd and these outcomes. Please note that the betas listed in the table are all correct, it is simply the stars for the associations of aspd with “OCDS” and “MADRS” that are misplaced. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-16783-011). Despite the high prevalence and detrimental impact of alcoholism on bipolar patients, the diagnostic and treatment factors associated with better or worse clinical outcomes in alcohol-dependent patients with bipolar disorder are not well understood. The present study investigated the prospective impact of baseline psychiatric comorbidities and treatment regimens on clinical outcomes in bipolar alcoholics. Data were drawn from an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial of acamprosate for individuals (n =30) with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Depressive and manic symptoms, and alcohol craving and consumption were monitored longitudinally using standardized instruments. Path analysis was used to estimate the prospective associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. More than 50% of patients were diagnosed with at least one anxiety (76.7%) or drug dependence disorder (60.0%). Comorbid anxiety disorders were prospectively associated with increased depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.6 psychotropic medications at baseline. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prospectively associated with increased alcohol use; anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines were associated with increased alcohol craving. Antidepressants were associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, lithium was associated with decreased alcohol craving and depressive symptoms. The findings from the present study suggest areas for future research in this population.

0,Prevention of psychosis: moving on from the at-risk mental state to universal primary prevention,"The value of services for those with the ‘At Risk Mental State for Psychosis’ (ARMS) continues to be disputed. ARMS services have provided a valuable stimulus to academic research into the transition into psychosis. Furthermore, there is currently a welcome trend to transform such clinics into youth mental health services catering for the broader clientele of young people suffering from anxiety and depression, who already constitute the bulk of those seen at ARMS clinics. However, such services are never likely to make major inroads into preventing psychosis because they only reach a small proportion of those at risk. Evidence from medicine shows that avoiding exposure to factors which increase the risk of disease (e.g. poor nutrition, transmission of infection, tobacco smoking), produces greater public benefit than focussing efforts on individuals with, or about to develop, disease. We consider that the most productive approach for psychosis prevention is avoiding exposure to risk-increasing factors. The best-established risk factors for psychosis are obstetric events, childhood abuse, migration, city living, adverse life events and cannabis use. Some as city living, are likely proxies for an unknown causal factor(s) while preventing others such as childhood abuse is currently beyond our powers. The risk factor for psychosis which is most readily open to this approach is the use of cannabis. Therefore, as an initial step towards a strategy for universal primary prevention, we advocate public health campaigns to educate young people about the harms of regular use of high potency cannabis.",2490914331.0, Commentary,2021
1,"Coordination difficulties, IQ and psychopathology in children with high-risk copy number variants","Background The prevalence and impact of motor coordination difficulties in children with copy number variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND-CNVs) remains unknown. This study aims to advance understanding of motor coordination difficulties in children with ND-CNVs and establish relationships between intelligence quotient (IQ) and psychopathology. Methods 169 children with an ND-CNV (67% male, median age = 8.88 years, range 6.02–14.81) and 72 closest-in-age unaffected siblings (controls; 55% male, median age = 10.41 years, s.d. = 3.04, range 5.89–14.75) were assessed with the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, alongside psychiatric interviews and standardised assessments of IQ. Results The children with ND-CNVs had poorer coordination ability ( b = 28.98, p &lt; 0.001) and 91% of children with an ND-CNV screened positive for suspected developmental coordination disorder, compared to 19% of controls (OR = 42.53, p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in coordination ability between ND-CNV genotypes ( F = 1.47, p = 0.184). Poorer coordination in children with ND-CNV was associated with more attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( β = −0.18, p = 0.021) and autism spectrum disorder trait ( β = −0.46, p &lt; 0.001) symptoms, along with lower full-scale ( ß = 0.21, p = 0.011), performance ( β = −0.20, p = 0.015) and verbal IQ ( β = 0.17, p = 0.036). Mediation analysis indicated that coordination ability was a full mediator of anxiety symptoms (69% mediated, p = 0.012), and a partial mediator of ADHD (51%, p = 0.001) and autism spectrum disorder trait symptoms (66%, p &lt; 0.001) as well as full scale IQ (40%, p = 0.002), performance IQ (40%, p = 0.005) and verbal IQ (38%, p = 0.006) scores. Conclusions The findings indicate that poor motor coordination is highly prevalent and closely linked to risk of mental health disorder and lower intellectual function in children with ND-CNVs. Future research should explore whether early interventions for poor coordination ability could ameliorate neurodevelopmental risk.",2490913866.0, Journal Article,2021
2,The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns: a review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments,"Lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had profound effects on everyday life worldwide, but their effect on mental health remains unclear because available meta-analyses and reviews rely mostly on cross-sectional studies. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72 004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, s.e. = 0.05, 95% CI (0.06–0.24), p = 0.001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = −0.12, s.e. = 0.11, 95% CI (−0.33 to 0.09), p = 0.27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. The results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.",2490913856.0, Journal Article,2021
3,"Psychotic experiences, psychiatric comorbidity and mental health need in the general population: a cross-sectional and cohort study in Southeast London","Background Co-occurrence of common mental disorders (CMD) with psychotic experiences is well-known. There is little research on the public mental health relevance of concurrent psychotic experiences for service use, suicidality, and poor physical health. We aim to: (1) describe the distribution of psychotic experiences co-occurring with a range of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders [CMD, depressive episode, anxiety disorder, probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and personality dysfunction], and (2) examine associations of concurrent psychotic experiences with secondary mental healthcare use, psychological treatment use for CMD, lifetime suicide attempts, and poor self-rated health. Methods We linked a prospective cross-sectional community health survey with a mental healthcare provider database. For each non-psychotic psychiatric disorder, patients with concurrent psychotic experiences were compared to those without psychotic experiences on use of secondary mental healthcare, psychological treatment for CMD, suicide attempt, physical functioning, and a composite multimorbidity score, using logistic regression and Cox regressions. Results In all disorders except for anxiety disorder, concurrent psychotic experiences were accompanied by a greater odds of all outcomes (odds ratios) for a unit change in composite multimorbidity score ranged between 2.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49–3.27] and 3.46 (95% CI 1.52–7.85). Hazard ratios for secondary mental health service use for non-psychotic disorders with concurrent psychotic experiences, ranged from 0.53 (95% CI 0.15–1.86) for anxiety disorders with psychotic experiences to 4.99 (95% CI 1.22–20.44) among those with PTSD with psychotic experiences. Conclusions Co-occurring psychotic experiences indicate greater public mental health burden, suggesting psychotic experiences could be a marker for future preventive strategies improving public mental health.",2484224127.0, Journal Article,2021
4,Anxiety in asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Background: Growing evidence from observational studies indicates a high prevalence of anxiety in asthma. However, prevalence rates of coexisting anxiety symptoms and comorbid anxiety disorders vary widely across studies. We aimed to evaluate the associations between anxiety and asthma and provide more precise comorbidity estimates. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature from case-controlled studies and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled prevalence estimates and risks of anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in asthma individuals. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken following PRISMA guidelines for preferred reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rates. Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Multiple databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, and PsycARTICLES were searched for publications before 1 December 2019. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (ref: CRD42020176028). Results In total, 19 studies involving 106813 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in individuals with asthma was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22–0.43) and 0.24 (95% CI 0.13–0.41), respectively. The risks of coexisting anxiety symptoms and comorbid anxiety disorders were significantly higher in asthma patients than in non-asthma controls indicated by OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.42–2.52; Z = 4.37; p &lt; 0.001) and OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.70–2.56; Z = 6.97; p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders occur at increased frequency among patients with asthma. Conclusions Our findings highlight the need for appropriate assessments for these comorbid conditions, which may help to identify a subgroup of patients who might benefit from interventions designed to reduce anxiety and enhance the quality of life.",2484222381.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2021
