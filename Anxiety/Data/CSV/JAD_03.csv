The efficacy of mindfulness meditation apps in enhancing users’ well-being and mental health related outcomes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Mindfulness applications are popular tools for improving well-being, but their effectiveness is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed a mindfulness meditation app as the main intervention to improve users’ well-being and mental-health related outcomes. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, the Cochrane Library, Open Grey and ResearchGate through June, 2020. Effects were calculated as standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) between app-delivered mindfulness interventions and control conditions at post-test and pooled with a random-effects model. Results: From 2637 records, we selected 34 trials (N = 7566). Significant effect sizes were found at post-test for perceived stress (n = 15; g = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, .68], I ² = 68%), anxiety (n = 15; g = 0.28, 95% CI [0.16, .40], I ² = 35%), depression (n = 15; g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.24, .43], I ² = 0%), and psychological well-being (n = 5; g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.14, .45], I ² = 0%). No significant effects were found for distress at post-test (n = 6; g = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.02, .22], I ² = 11%) and general well-being (n = 5; g = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.29], I ² = 14%). Conclusion and limitations: Mindfulness apps seem promising in improving well-being and mental-health, though results should be interpreted carefully due to the small number of included studies, overall uncertain risk of bias and heterogeneity.

Mood disorders comorbidity in obese bariatric patients: The role of the emotional dysregulation,"Background: Obese patients seeking bariatric surgery are known to show high rates of mental disorders, mainly mood and eating disorders. The aim of the present study is to evaluate psychiatric comorbidities, affective temperamental dimensions, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity in a sample of obese bariatric patients, exploring the differences between obese patients with and without mood disorders (MD). Methods: A total of 69 obese patients were consecutively enrolled between March and November 2019 during the presurgical evaluation routinely performed before the bariatric intervention. Sociodemographic and clinical features were collected by psychiatrists during a single consultation. Affective temperaments, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity were also investigated through self-report questionnaires. Epidemiological and clinical variables were compared between patients with and without MD. Results: In our sample, almost 3 out of 4 patients presented a lifetime psychiatric disorder, mainly MD (n = 33, 48%), binge eating disorder (BED) (n = 34, 49%) and anxiety disorders (n = 30, 43%). Compared to N-MD patients, those with MD showed higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity with BED, bulimia and panic disorder. In addition, obese patients with MD showed more frequently cyclothymic, depressive and anxious temperaments, and higher mean scores on the psychometric questionnaires assessing emotional dysregulation and impulsivity compared to obese subjects without MD. Limitations: the small sample size, the retrospectively assessment of psychiatric disorders and the self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: A subgroup of obese patients, especially among those with MD, show high emotional dysregulation, affective lability and impulsiveness that could represent suitable substrates for the development of compulsive and addictive eating habits.

"Sex differences in prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of internet addiction among chinese college students","Background: Internet addiction (IA) is now very common. However, few studies have explored the sex differences in risk factors for IA, especially among Chinese college students. This study aimed to investigate the sex differences in prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of IA among Chinese college students. Methods: A total of 8098 college students from Hunan province were recruited using a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method. Each student filled out the survey online anonymously, which collected their information on their socio-demographics, internet addiction(Revised Chinese internet addiction scale; CIAS-R), ADHD (Wender Utah Rating Scale and World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v 1.1 Symptom Checklist), depression(Self-reporting Depression Scale; SDS), insomnia(Athens Insomnia Scale; AIS), anxiety(Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; SAS) and suicidal behaviors through WeChat. Results: Overall, the prevalence of IA in males and females was 7.21%(259/3592) and 8.17%(368/4506), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that suicidal ideation[odds ratio (OR),1.557;95% confidence interval (CI),1.083-2.240], suicide attempts (OR,2.081;95%CI:1.271-3.409), ADHD (OR,6.487;95%CI,4.697-8.959) and insomnia (OR,2.596;95%CI,1.910-3.529) were independent risk factors for male IA after controlling for confounding variables. Nationality (OR,1.507;95%CI,1.058-2.145), suicidal ideation(OR,2.012;95%CI,1.532-2.641), depression (OR,1.771;95%CI:1.071-2.930), ADHD (OR,4.497; 95%CI,3.285-6.158) and insomnia (OR,2.356;95%CI,1.813-3.061) were independent risk factors for female IA. Limitation: No causal relationships could be drawn due to the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: This study shows IA is common among both sexes. IA is significantly associated with ADHD, insomnia and suicidal behaviors in both male and female students, indicating the importance of screening IA and addressing ADHD, insomnia and suicidal behaviors to improve the mental health of college students and better prevent suicide in both sexes.

Psychometric properties of the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with DSM-5 Mixed subtype questionnaire in Chinese patients with mood disorders,"Background: With the modification of DSM-5 mixed features specifier, a brief scale to screen mixed features in patients with mood disorders is needed in clinical practice. This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with DSM-5 Mixed subtype (CUDOS-M-C) for the Chinese patients with mood disorders. Methods: Overall, 300 patients with major depressive episode were recruited. All participants were assessed using CUDOS-M-C, Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the optimal cut-off values of CUDOS-M-C score. The reliability and validity of CUDOS-M-C were examined using Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and principal component analysis (PCA). Results: The results of PCA indicated two-factor structure as the best solution for CUDOS-M-C, which explained 54.82% of cumulative variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.892 and the ICC was 0.853. The area under the ROC curve of the CUDOS-M-C for participants with mixed depression was 0.927 ( p &lt; 0.001) and the suitable cut-off value was 8, with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 79.9%. Limitations: Most of the patients were recruited from eastern China and further research with larger sample is warranted. And this study did not perform confirmatory factor analysis to identify the generalization of factor structure of CUDOS-M-C. Besides, the study performed the test-retest reliability of CUDOS-M-C and further analysis is needed to ascertain the patient's post-treatment changes. Conclusion: The CUDOS-M-C demonstrated to have satisfactory psychometric properties as a self-report scale, and could be applied to screen patients with mixed depression in clinical practice.

Suicide risk in people with post-traumatic stress disorder: A cohort study of 3.1 million people in Sweden,"Background: It is unclear whether post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] is associated with suicide risk in the general population, whether this differs by sex, or what the population impact of PTSD is for suicide. Methods: We constructed a nationwide cohort of all people living in Sweden, born 1973–1997, followed from their 14th birthday (or immigration, if later) until suicide, other death, emigration or 31 December 2016. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios [HR], and calculated the population impact of PTSD on suicide. We included sensitivity analyses to explore effects of outcome and exposure definitions, and to account for potential competing risks. Results: Of 3,177,706 participants, 22,361 (0•7%) were diagnosed with PTSD, and 6,319 (0•2%) died by suicide over 49•2 million person-years. Compared with women and men without PTSD, suicide rates were 6•74 (95%CI: 5•61–8•09) and 3•96 (95%CI: 3•12–5•03) times higher in those with PTSD, respectively, after sociodemographic adjustment. Suicide rates remained elevated in women (HR: 2•61; 95%CI: 2•16–3•14) and men (HR: 1•67; 95%CI: 1•31–2•12) after adjustment for previous psychiatric conditions; attenuation was driven by previous non-fatal suicide attempts. Findings were insensitive to definitions or competing risks. If causal, 1•6% (95%CI: 1•2–2•1) of general population suicides could be attributed to PTSD, and up to 53.7% (95%CI: 46.1–60.2) in people with PTSD. Limitations: Residual confounding remains possible due to depressive and anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care but unrecorded in these registers. Conclusions: Clinical guidelines for the management of people with PTSD should recognise increased suicide risks.

Acute effects of cannabis on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Little is known about the the acute effects of cannabis on symptoms of OCD in humans. Therefore, this study sought to: 1) examine whether symptoms of OCD are significantly reduced after inhaling cannabis, 2) examine predictors (gender, dose, cannabis constituents, time) of these symptom changes and 3) explore potential long-term consequences of repeatedly using cannabis to self-medicate for OCD symptoms, including changes in dose and baseline symptom severity over time. Method: Data were analyzed from the app Strainprint® which provides medical cannabis patients a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and strains of cannabis across time. Specifically, data were analyzed from 87 individuals self-identifying with OCD who tracked the severity of their intrusions, compulsions, and/or anxiety immediately before and after 1,810 cannabis use sessions spanning a period of 31 months. Results: Patients reported a 60% reduction in compulsions, a 49% reduction in intrusions, and a 52% reduction in anxiety from before to after inhaling cannabis. Higher concentrations of CBD and higher doses predicted larger reductions in compulsions. The number of cannabis use sessions across time predicted changes in intrusions, such that later cannabis use sessions were associated with smaller reductions in intrusions. Baseline symptom severity and dose remained fairly constant over time. Limitations: The sample was self-selected, self-identified as having OCD, and there was no placebo control group. Conclusions: Inhaled cannabis appears to have short-term beneficial effects on symptoms of OCD. However, tolerance to the effects on intrusions may develop over time.

Tackling heterogeneity: Individual variability of emotion decoding deficits in severe alcohol use disorder,"Background: Severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) is associated with social cognition deficits. Patients with SAUD are impaired for the recognition of emotional facial expressions, particularly at early stages of abstinence. These deficits damage interpersonal relations and increase relapse risk. However, uncertainties still abound on their variation across emotions and on the heterogeneity of emotional impairments across patients. We addressed these questions by exploring how the deficit varies according to emotions’ type/intensity and patients’ heterogeneity. Methods: Sixty-five recently detoxified patients with SAUD and 65 matched healthy controls performed the Facial Emotion Recognition Test, assessing the ability to identify six emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness) displayed by morphed faces with various intensities. Accuracy scores and detection thresholds were collected for each emotion. Beyond group comparisons, multiple single-case analyses determined the percentage of patients presenting decoding deficits for each emotion. Results: When current depression and anxiety symptoms were controlled for, patients did not present a general emotion decoding deficit, but were rather characterized by specific deficits for disgust/contempt in accuracy, and for disgust in detection threshold scores. Single-case analyses showed that only a third of patients presented a clinically significant emotional deficit. Conclusions: Patients with SAUD only present emotional decoding deficits for specific interpersonal emotions (disgust/contempt) when subclinical psychopathological states are controlled for, and show no general emotional impairment. This goes against the proposal of a generalized social cognition deficit in this population. This group effect moreover masks a massive heterogeneity across patients, which has implications at experimental and clinical levels.

Smoking and drinking among patients with mental disorders: Evidence from a nationally representative Japanese survey,"Background: No studies to date have addressed the association of mental disorder with smoking and drinking behaviors independent of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We therefore examined this association, stratified by age and sex, to determine the target population for behavioral modification in Japan. Methods: We analyzed data from participants aged 20-79 years without hospitalized or institutionalized status who participated in the nationwide Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions conducted in 2016. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for current smoking, heavy daily smoking (&gt; 20 cigarettes per day), at-risk drinking (&gt; 100 g alcohol per week), and heavy drinking (&gt; 350 g) were calculated with adjustment for potential confounders. After stratification by age (20-39, 40-64, and 65-79 years) and sex, prevalence and PRs were calculated using propensity scores. Results: From among 340,194 participants, 8275 (2.4%) had mental disorder. Presence of mental disorder was significantly associated with current smoking (PR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.12-1.23) and heavy daily smoking (PR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.21-1.50) and inversely associated with at-risk drinking (PR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.66-0.75). PRs for smoking behavior were higher in women than in men and in younger adults than in the other age groups. They were particularly high in younger women (PR = 1.67 for current smokers and PR = 2.17 for heavy daily smokers). Limitations: Our findings were obtained from a cross-sectional study. Conclusion: This is the first evidence that the association of mental disorder with smoking behavior is independent of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Our results indicate the need for tailored behavioral modification interventions for young people with mental disorders in Japan, particularly young women.

Predicting engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) over the course of 12 months: the roles of borderline personality disorder pathology and emotional consequences of NSSI,"Background: Despite theories that negative reinforcement in the form of relief from negative emotions maintains nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), no studies have examined the extent to which specific emotional consequences of NSSI predict the maintenance of NSSI over time or explain the greater risk for NSSI found among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) pathology. This study examined whether specific emotional consequences of NSSI relate to the continuance of NSSI behavior over a 12-month period and explain the relation of baseline BPD pathology to future NSSI. Methods: Participants with a history of recent repeated NSSI ( N = 84) completed baseline measures of BPD pathology, NSSI, and the emotional antecedents and consequences of NSSI, including self-conscious emotions, undifferentiated negative affect, anger, emptiness, sadness, and anxiety; follow-up data on NSSI were collected every three months for one year. Results: Of the emotional consequences of NSSI examined here, only self-conscious emotions significantly predicted the presence and frequency of NSSI during the 12-month follow-up period. Likewise, whereas BPD pathology was not directly associated with later NSSI, both overall BPD pathology and the specific BPD feature of identity problems were indirectly related to the presence of 12-month NSSI through the greater frequency of post-NSSI self-conscious emotions. Limitations: Emotional consequences of NSSI were assessed using a retrospective self-report measure. Only frequency, and not intensity, of emotions before and after NSSI were assessed. Conclusions: Results suggest a distinct role of post-NSSI self-conscious emotions in the maintenance of NSSI among individuals with and without BPD pathology.

"Linking peripheral IL-6, IL-1β and hypocretin-1 with cognitive impairment from major depression","Background: Cognitive impairment has long challenged the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), hypocretins and inflammation have recently been implicated in cognitive function. However, limited studies have compressively assessed their associations with cognitive impairment in MDD. Methods: A total of 100 MDD patients and 100 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for this study. They were tested with HAMD, HAMA, and MCCB scales. The plasma level of selected inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and hypocretin-1 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the plasma level of the factors and clinical performances. Results: Patients with MDD showed cognitive impairment in each MCCB subdomain except working memory compared with HC. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β and hypocretin-1 in MDD patients were higher than HC. Besides, IL-1β levels was negatively correlated with overall cognitive function in the combined group. Hypocretin-1 was positively correlated with socially cognitive impairment in MDD patients. A negative correlation between plasma hypocretin-1 levels and HAMA scales was also observed in MDD patients. Limitation: The study was cross-sectional, thereby limiting causal inference, and had a relatively small sample size. There are no subcategories for MDD based on characteristics. Conclusion: IL-1β, IL-6 and Hypocretin-1 were reported as potential factors involved in MDD pathology. Hypocretin-1 could contribute to the biological mechanisms of anxiety relief. Hypocretin-1, therefore, may be important in exploring the pathological mechanisms of social cognitive impairment in MDD patients. Conclusively, this study provides new insights for exploring cognitive impairment in depression.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review,"Background: As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (≤ 40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations: A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance. Mitigating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health is an international public health priority.

"""Bisexuality and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI): A narrative synthesis of associated variables and a meta-analysis of risk"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Bisexuality and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI): A narrative synthesis of associated variables and a meta-analysis of risk"" by Brendan J. Dunlop, Samantha Hartley, Olayinka Oladokun and Peter J. Taylor ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2020[Nov][1], Vol 276, 1159-1172). The authors wish to acknowledge an additional affiliated institution for Dr Samantha Hartley: Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Old Street, Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-64969-140). Background: Bisexual people have been found to be at increased risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) when compared to heterosexual and gay or lesbian people. The purpose of this review was to update the estimated risk of NSSI for bisexual people and to examine variables that have been associated with NSSI in this population. Methods: The protocol for this paper was pre-registered (CRD42019145299). An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, PubMed, Ovid Online and Web of Science was undertaken from earliest available date to October 2019. Twenty-four eligible papers were identified. Meta-analyses, including moderator analysis, were conducted to ascertain NSSI risk and a narrative synthesis was undertaken of predictors and correlates. All studies were assessed for risk of bias. Results: Bisexual people had up to six times the odds of engaging in NSSI compared to other sexualities. Mental health variables of anxiety and depression symptoms were found to be most commonly associated with NSSI for this population. The majority of studies had moderate risk of bias. This review demonstrates that bisexual people have an elevated risk of engaging in NSSI. Increased incidence of anxiety and depression and exposure to negative life events may explain this increased risk. Limitations: Studies were found to be consistently cross-sectional in design and limited to western cultures. A limitation of this review was that only English language papers were included. Conclusions: Results are clinically relevant as they suggest early identification and prevention of NSSI can be achieved. Future research should examine bisexual people independently of others.

What are the emotions underlying feeling fat and fear of weight gain?,"Background: Eating disorders (EDs) are most always accompanied by cognitive-affective comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. In addition to these common comorbidities, EDs are unique in that they are characterized by affective symptoms centered on body image and weight. Two of these primary, yet understudied, affective symptoms are feelings of fatness and fears of weight gain, which are theorized to be maintaining symptoms of EDs and are highly common in those with EDs. Despite the importance of these symptoms, there is no research characterizing which cognitive-affective symptoms contribute to feelings of fatness and fears of weight gain. Methods: The current study ( N = 168 individuals with an ED) tested cross-sectional and prospective models of cognitive-affect variables (negative affect, guilt, shame, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression) to identify which thoughts and emotions were uniquely associated and prospectively predicted feelings of fatness and fear of weight gain. Results: Depression both cross-sectionally and prospectively predicted feeling fat over and above all other forms of affect. Fears of negative evaluation and depression were uniquely associated with fears of weight gain, and shame prospectively predicted fear of weight gain. Limitations: Variables were self-reported, and the sample primarily consisted of women. Fear of weight gain and feelings of fatness were assessed using single items. Conclusions: This research suggests that depression may be an important intervention target when individuals with an ED report feeling fat. Additionally, treatment targeting fear of negative evaluation, depression, and shame may decrease fears of weight gain.

Validation of a Chinese version of the short form of Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30),"Background: This study investigated the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the short form of Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30), which is an effective tool to assess metacognitive beliefs that have been linked to mental disturbance/disorder. We also tested whether metacognition factors would correlate with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) tendency. Methods: Six hundred and eighty Chinese university students (Mean age = 19.72, SD = 1.38; 31.9% male) voluntarily completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Using standard translation procedures, the MCQ-30 items were translated from English into Chinese language and then back-translated. Depression, anxiety, and IGD tendency were assessed by validated scales. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results supported the five-factor structure of the MCQ-30, with satisfactory model fit and good reliability. Criterion-related validity was also supported by significant positive correlations between the five factors and depression/anxiety symptoms. All of the five metacognition factors were also significantly correlated with IGD tendency, with positive beliefs about worry and cognitive confidence being the most salient factor after controlling for gender and age. Limitations: This study did not examine the test–retest reliability of this scale, and the generalizability of the findings to other age groups remains unclear. Conclusions: This study showed satisfactory psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the MCQ-30 and is the first to demonstrate a positive association between specific metacognition factors and IGD tendency among Chinese people. The latter finding supports an application of metacognitive therapy to the treatment of behavioral addictions, including IGD.

Depression in and after COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the role of stress and loneliness in lockdown: A longitudinal study,"Governmental lockdown measures to prevent the uncontrolled spreading of the novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) are effective but can decrease mental health. For example, depression rates were 4% in 2014 and increased to 20% during the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. It is less known if depression changes when lockdown measures are lifted and who is at risk to still have depression after lockdown. Only one study addressed the question how mental health changes in vs. after quarantine but this previous study focused on anxiety and anger. In the current study, we explored changes of depression in vs. after lockdown and whether stress and loneliness during the lockdown affect subsequent depression after the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. Stress and loneliness were selected since they have been found to be associated with depression and are relevant problems in times of COVID-19.

Physical activity in early adolescence predicts depressive symptoms 3 years later: A community-based study,"Background: Physical activity (PA) during adolescence is associated with a wide range of health benefits, including lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Although the association between PA and mental health has been established, there are few prospective studies investigating if the association between PA and internalizing/externalizing symptoms remains after adjustment for the baseline occurrence of such symptoms, and those exploring any sex-specific pattern of the association. Methods: Swedish adolescents (N = 1428; mean age = 14.38 years) were assessed and followed up 3 years later. Self-reported data were collected for PA (recoded as low, moderate and high levels), internalizing (depression and anxiety) and externalizing (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behaviours) symptoms. A full path analysis was used to determine the main and interaction effects of PA and sex on internalizing/externalizing symptoms 3 years later, adjusting for these symptoms at baseline. Results: Higher levels of PA were correlated with lower internalizing/externalizing symptoms. In the full path analysis, PA during early adolescence predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or externalizing problems, 3 years later. A sex-specific effect of PA on depressive symptoms was found, wherein boys, but not girls, with high levels of PA showed reduced symptoms. Limitations: Including parental ratings, diagnostic assessments and objective measures of PA would have provided additional information to the study. Conclusions: Low levels of PA during early adolescence are a unique predictor for the development of depressive symptoms among boys. PA should be considered when discussing prevention and treatment for depression in adolescents.

Mental health of French students during the Covid-19 pandemic,"This study evaluates the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of 8004 French students in the East part of France, which has been the first and hardest hit region by the Covid-19 pandemic. This is, to our knowledge, the largest study conducted on mental health of students during the pandemic. Our results show that students suffer from particularly high level of anxiety, depression and distress. A significant proportion of students might require psychological support, especially because the high distress scores suggest that the epidemic and confinement have favored the emergence of post-traumatic stress symptoms.

Efficacy of light therapy for a college student sample with non-seasonal subthreshold depression: An RCT study,"Background: Light therapy has been successfully used to treat seasonal and non-seasonal depression, but there is limited evidence for its efficacy in subthreshold depression. This study examines the efficacy of light therapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-seasonal subthreshold depression. Methods: College students with non-seasonal subthreshold depression were recruited. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the three conditions: high- (LT-5000 lux) and low-intensity (LT-500 lux) light therapy conditions and a waiting-list control condition (WLC). The primary outcome was Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and secondary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and state anxiety inventory (SAI), which were assessed at baseline (Week 0), during the trial (Week 4), and after completion of the light therapy (Week 8). Results: A total of 142 participants completed the trial. The LT-5000 (effect size [d] = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.98) and LT-500 conditions (d = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.26) were significantly superior to the WLC condition. For the LT-5000, LT-500, and WLC conditions by the end of the 8-week trial, a response on the HAMD was achieved by 70.0%, 42.0% and 19.0% of the participants, and remission was achieved by 76.0%, 54.0%, and 19.0%, respectively. Limitations: The subjects were not followed up regularly after completion of the trial. Conclusion: Light therapy, both at high- and low-intensity, was efficacious in the treatment of college students with non-seasonal subthreshold depression.

Prevalence of perinatal depression and its determinants in Mainland China: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Perinatal depression is a maternal mental health condition that is associated with various adverse health outcomes both for the mothers and the babies. The study aim was to estimate the prevalence of perinatal depression and its risks and determinants in Mainland China. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in 10 major databases and random effect meta-analysis was performed to achieve the pooled variance of perinatal depression. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on region, scale, methods of diagnosis and study design. Meta-regression was performed with the variables such as age, quality assessment score and gross domestic product (GDP) of the province. Results: Pooled prevalence of perinatal depression was 16.3% (CI = 95%; 14.7% to 18.2%, P &lt; 0.001), with antenatal depression 19.7% (CI = 95%; 15.8% to 24.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and postnatal depression 14.8% (CI = 95%; 13.1% to 16.6%, P &lt; 0.001). Significant publication bias was found and heterogeneity was I ² = 98.13%. Lower socioeconomic status, poor physical health, anxiety about pregnancy and reduced social support were major risk factors while better living conditions and higher level of education were protective factors. The prevalence of perinatal depression showed a significant increasing trend in the last decade. Limitations: The review does not include studies with small sample size ( n &lt; 250). Moreover a narrative review of risk and protective factors was done, these were not included in meta-analysis. Conclusion: The prevalence of perinatal depression in China is similar to low and middle-income countries. Urgent attention is needed to address this public health priority in China.

Public mental health under the long-term influence of COVID-19 in China: Geographical and temporal distribution,"Background: The mental health status caused by major epidemics is serious and lasting. At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. Results: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. Limitations: This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, people's mental state is affected by the geographical and temporal distributions.

Regional cortical thinning and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Although recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that functional deficits in facial perception are associated with panic disorder (PD), the possibility of cortical thickness and perfusion abnormalities have not been studied in patients with PD. We aimed to investigate alterations in cortical thickness and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs) using three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) and 3D arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI. Method: An automated surface-based method (Cat12) measured the cortical thickness of each subject. Z-score normalization for CBF maps was used to generate Z-score maps. Statistical comparisons were performed using statistical parametric mapping with two-sample t-tests. Results: Subjects with PD, unlike HCs, displayed cortical thinning in the right fusiform gyrus (FG). Post hoc analysis also revealed a decreased Z-score in the right FG. There was significant positive correlation between the Z-score and the cortical thickness of the right FG. The cortical thickness and Z-score were negatively correlated with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores. Limitations: The small sample size may have restricted the identification of additional differences. Other caveats included the use of medication by nine participants. Conclusions: These results provide further evidence of the significant role structural and functional deficits in the right FG play in patients with PD. Due to the observed regional specificity, this finding bears important clinical implications for potential treatment strategies.

Longitudinal trajectories of mood symptoms and global functioning in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder,"Background: Little is known about the longitudinal course of mood symptoms and functioning in youth who are at high risk for bipolar disorder (BD). Identifying distinct course trajectories and predictors of those trajectories may help refine treatment approaches. Methods: This study examined the longitudinal course of mood symptoms and functioning ratings in 126 youth at high risk for BD based on family history and early mood symptoms. Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial of family-focused therapy and followed longitudinally (mean 2.0 years, SD = 53.6 weeks). Results: Using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), we observed three mood trajectories. All youth started the study with active mood symptoms. Following the index mood episode, participants were classified as having a “significantly improving course” ( n = 41, 32.5% of sample), a “moderately symptomatic course” ( n = 21, 16.7%), or a “predominantly symptomatic course” ( n = 64, 50.8%) at follow-up. More severe depression, anxiety, and suicidality at the study's baseline were associated with a poorer course of illness. LCGA also revealed three trajectories of global functioning that closely corresponded to symptom trajectories; however, fewer youth exhibited functional recovery than exhibited symptomatic recovery. Limitations: Mood trajectories were assessed within the context of a treatment trial. Ratings of mood and functioning were based on retrospective recall. Conclusions: This study suggests considerable heterogeneity in the course trajectories of youth at high risk for BD, with a significant proportion (32.5%) showing long-term remission of symptoms. Treatments that enhance psychosocial functioning may be just as important as those that ameliorate symptoms in youth at risk for BD.

Mental disorders and subsequent suicide events in a representative community population,"Objective: This study examined the patterns of association between mental disorders and subsequent suicide in a community sample representative of the Canadian household population. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2002 linked to the Death Database 2000-2011 and the Hospitalization Database 1999/2000-2012/2013) (n=27,000). Mental disorders (past year major depressive episodes (MDE), bipolar disorders (BPD), anxiety disorders (AD), and substance dependence (SD)) and subsequent suicide events (deaths or hospitalizations for suicide attempts) were identified. Competing risk regression models were used to analyze the time-to-event data, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and educational attainment. Results: Past year mental disorders were diagnosed in 11.38% of the cohort and 0.41% had suicide events. An increased hazard of suicide events associated with MDE, SD and AD weakened over-time, but this was not observed for BPD. For example, the HR of suicide events for MDE was 6.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.65, 13.68) in the first 4 years, whereas, it was 2.03 (95% CI = 0.91, 4.53) after 4 years. Whereas, the HRs of suicide events for BPD were 16.95 (95% CI = 6.88, 41.75) and 15.81 (95% CI = 5.89, 42.45) before and after 4 years. Limitations: Diagnostic data are likely to underestimate the prevalence of suicide events. Conclusions: The risk of suicide events declined over time for MDE, SA and AD, but remained high for BPD. This may reflect improvement over time in MDE, SA and AD, but indicates that people living with BPD have a persistent elevated hazard of suicide events.

Family and couple integrated cognitive-behavioural therapy for adults with OCD: A meta-analysis,"Background: Integrating family into the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is standard in pediatric populations; however, in adult populations, patients are typically treated independent of their family. Yet, there is compelling evidence to suggest that family members exacerbate OCD symptoms, and thus there is a strong rationale for integrating family members into the treatment of adult OCD. The present meta-analysis examined whether family treatment is effective for OCD in adult populations as well as moderators of treatment outcome. Methods: Fifteen studies were reviewed (16 independent samples). Results: Family treatment for adult OCD was found to improve patient OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment. There was also improvement in patient and family-reported general relationship satisfaction, antagonism, accommodation, and family member's mental health. Individual treatment format and targeting family accommodation were especially beneficial for improving patient depression. Family members reported greater relational improvements than patients. Fewer patient treatment sessions were associated with greater improvement in antagonism, as was female gender. Fewer sessions for family members was associated with greater improvement in family member mental health. FIT outperformed controls with individual ERP on reduction of OCD and depression symptoms, accommodation, and improvement in functional impairment. Limitations: Limitations of the present review include a relatively small sample size, lenient study inclusion criteria, and the subjectivity of some moderator categories. Conclusions: Family-integrated treatment appears to be effective for adult OCD, related symptoms, and relationship factors. There is preliminary support that family-integrated treatments lead to better outcomes than individual treatment. Clinical recommendations are discussed.

Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Method: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). Limitations: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Conclusion: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.

The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures: Experience from 4000 participants,"Background: In February 2020 the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in Kuwait. Inevitably as many countries worldwide, the general public were negatively affected by the pandemic. Unemployment, uncertainty, distress, increasing deaths, lockdown measures all of which are potential burdens on mental health. Aim: To assess the impact of COVID19 outbreak on mental health in Kuwait, and to explore the potential influencing risk factors. Methods: We conducted an online questionnaire-based study in Kuwait between 25th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. Questions were based on demographics, lifestyle during outbreak, depression and anxiety assessment. Total PHQ9 and GAD7 scores were calculated for each responder. Results: We had 4132 responders. Most were females (69.31%), married (59.37%), between the age of 21-30 (23.84%) and non-smokers (81.46%). Only (7.96%) had a positive past psychiatric history, (32.04%) had a past history of a chronic medical disease. During the outbreak most of the responders lost their jobs (39.21%) and only (12.83%) were attending work regularly, only (6.82%) worked in the healthcare sector. 59.27% report increased social media use compared to before the lockdown. When asked about their daily time spent following COVID19-related news, most (37.8%) spend more than 2 hours and (7.74%) spend more than 4 hours. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was (30.13%) and the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was (25.28%). Limitations: In the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a burden on mental health. Psychological support and mental health awareness should be implemented and made accessible to all individuals during pandemics.

Efficacy of phase 1 of life goals programme on symptom reduction and mood stability for bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND: Life Goals Programme (LGP) was developed as a psychological intervention for bipolar disorder, with its structured 6-session psychoeducation phase (Phase 1) targeting understanding of the disorder, medication adherence, early warning signs, and coping with symptoms and triggers. The present study tested the efficacy of Phase 1 of the LGP on symptom recovery and moment-by-moment mood stability, as well as medication adherence and quality of life. METHODS: Adults with bipolar disorder were randomly allocated to the LGP condition (six weekly group sessions) or the waitlist condition (six weeks of standard care, followed by the same LGP intervention). Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 6-month follow up. Waitlist participants were additionally assessed at baseline. Assessment included a clinical interview (SCID, MADRS, YMRS, and HAM-A), self-reported questionnaires, and 6-day experience sampling assessment on a mobile device. RESULTS: 64 out-patients with bipolar disorder (44 Bipolar I and 20 Bipolar II subtypes) participated in this study. LGP was well received and attended. Following LGP, there were significant improvements in knowledge about illness and level of anxiety, which were of large effect sizes and sustained at 6-month follow-up. Experience sampling assessment revealed small but significant improvements in moment-by-moment mood stability. Improvement in medication adherence was significant at 6 months and was of a moderate-to-large effect size. Changes in anxiety and mood stability were significantly greater following LGP than standard care. LIMITATIONS: Our results warrant further testing against active control. CONCLUSIONS: There was a robust improvement in emotional regulation following the 6-week LGP.

Prevalence and factors associated with postpartum posttraumatic stress in a population-based maternity survey in england,"Background: Studies on prevalence and factors associated with postpartum posttraumatic stress (PTS) typically do not distinguish between PTS related to childbirth (PTS-C) and PTS related to other stressors (PTS-O). This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with PTS-C and PTS-O in postpartum women. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional population-based survey of 16,000 postpartum women, selected at random from birth registrations in England to receive a postal questionnaire, including the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 4,509 women. The median age was 32 years (IQR=29-36), 64% were married, 77% were UK-born, and 76% were White-British. Prevalence of PTS-C was 2.5% (95%CI:2.0-3.0) and prevalence of PTS-O was 6.8% (95%CI:6.0-7.8). Women with PTS-C were significantly more likely to report re-experiencing symptoms (Chi-Square=7.69,p&lt;0.01). Factors associated with PTS-C were: higher level of deprivation, not having a health professional to talk to about sensitive issues during pregnancy, and the baby being admitted for neonatal intensive care. Factors associated with PTS-O were: age ≤24 years, depression during pregnancy, and having a pregnancy affected by long-term health problems. Factors associated with both were: living without a partner, anxiety during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific health problems, and lower birth satisfaction. Conclusions: PTS during the postpartum period is relatively common and, for many women, unrelated to childbirth. Increased awareness among health professionals of prevalence, clinical characteristics and factors associated with postpartum PTS-C and PTS-O will aid the development of appropriate management protocols to identify and support women during the perinatal period.

An ecological momentary assessment study of the role of emotional dysregulation in co-occurring adhd and internalising symptoms in adulthood,"Previous ecological momentary assessment (EMA) research in children has suggested that emotional dysregulation problems are commonly associated with ADHD symptoms and may help explain their relatively strong co-occurrence with anxiety and depression (collectively referred to as ‘internalising problems’); however, this has yet to be replicated for adults. In this study, we used data from a n=260 longitudinal cohort and EMA study, to evaluate the hypothesis that emotional dysregulation mediates the association between ADHD symptoms and internalising problems in emerging adulthood. Emotional dysregulation was based on affect data collected in near real time and in ecological context over a 14-day period, providing a measure of emotional lability in the context of participants’ daily lives. Cross-sectional mediation was tested using structural equation modelling. Emotional lability significantly mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and internalising problems. Results suggest that interventions that address the emotional dysregulation aspects of ADHD are likely to be beneficial for preventing and managing secondary internalising symptoms.

The prevalence of suicidal behaviors and their mental risk factors among young adolescents in 46 low- and middle-income countries,"BACKGROUND: To describe the prevalence of suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, and attempt) and their associated factors in young adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: We used the latest data from the Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) for adolescents aged 12–15 years during 2009–2015. The weighted prevalence and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) of suicidal behaviors were calculated using a random-effects model. The factors associated with suicidal behaviors were examined using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 130,488 adolescents (48.13% boys) in 46 LMICs were included in the study. Across all countries, the pooled 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempt were 14.5%, 14.6%, and 12.7%, respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempt were all in Africa (16.7%, 19.3% and 17.0%), and the lowest prevalence were all in South-East Asia (8.2%, 10.5% and 7.4%). The overall prevalence of three suicidal behaviors were higher in girls (all P &lt; 0.001). Suicidal ideation and planning were more common in the 14–15 age group than 12–13 age group (both P &lt; 0.001). The factors associated with suicidal behaviors were being female, older age, loneliness, anxiety, a lack of close friends, and having family supportive (all P &lt; 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The GSHS data were obtained from a self-report questionnaire and the participants included in the GSHS were adolescents in school. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of suicidal behaviors remains high among young adolescents in LMICs, especially in Africa. These countries should be intervention priorities.

How are you sleeping? Starting the conversation with fathers about their mental health in the early parenting years,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 10 fathers of infants experience symptoms of common mental health disorders, prompting calls for paternal postpartum screening. However, numerous obstacles exist to screening implementation. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary evidence for an alternative approach that starts with asking fathers about their sleep. METHODS: Using self-reported father data at 0 to 36 months postpartum (N=1204) from four Australian cohort studies, we assessed associations between responses to various single-item questions about sleep (good to poor), and scores on validated measures of mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). We conducted regressions, unadjusted and adjusted for father age, child age, household income, education, first or later child, and marital status, to test associations between sleep and each indicator of mental health. We then meta-analyzed effects and assessed interactions between sleep and each of the covariates. RESULTS: Consistent associations between fathers’ subjective poor sleep and depression, anxiety and stress were replicated across the four cohorts despite heterogeneity in the sleep questions. At the meta-analytic level, effects ranged from weak to moderate (0.25 to 0.37) and were robust to all adjustments. Interactions were only detected between family income and poor sleep, such that the association was stronger for high income fathers. LIMITATIONS: This study does not address the sensitivity or specificity of single-item sleep questions for assessing paternal mental health risk. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost, non-stigmatizing single question to postpartum fathers about their sleep may present a gateway opportunity to enquiring about mental health.

Using classification and regression tree modelling to investigate treatment response to a single low-dose ketamine infusion: Post hoc pooled analyses of randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials,"Background: Evidence suggests that clinical markers, such as comorbid anxiety, body weight, and others can assist in predicting response to low-dose ketamine infusion in treatment resistant depression patients. However, whether a composite of clinical markers may improve the predicted probability of response is uncertain. Methods: The current study investigated the results of our previous randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials in which 73 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) received a single ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg. Clinical characteristics at baseline, including depression severity, duration of the current episode, obesity, comorbidity of anxiety disorder, and current suicide risk, were assessed as potential predictors in a classification and regression tree model for treatment response to ketamine infusion. Results: The predicted probability of a composite of age at disease onset, depression severity, duration of current episode, and obesity/overweight was significantly greater (area under curve = .736, p = .001) than that of any one marker (all p &gt; .05). The most powerful predictors of treatment response to ketamine infusion were younger age at disease onset and obesity/overweight. The strongest predictors of treatment nonresponse were longer duration of the current episode and greater depression severity at baseline. Discussion: Depression severity, duration of the current episode, obesity, and age at disease onset may predict treatment response versus nonresponse to low-dose ketamine infusion. However, whether our predicted probability for a single infusion may be applied to repeated infusions would require further investigation.

Have I argued with my family this week?”: What questions do those with lived experience choose to monitor their bipolar disorder?,"BACKGROUND: Electronic self-report mood monitoring tools for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are rapidly emerging and predominately employ predefined symptom-based questions. Allowing individuals to additionally choose what they monitor in relation to their BD offers the unique opportunity to capture and gain a deeper insight into patient priorities in this context. METHODS: In addition to monitoring mood symptoms with two standardised self-rated questionnaires, 308 individuals with BD participating in the Bipolar Disorder Research Network True Colours electronic mood-monitoring tool for research chose to create and complete additional personalised questions. A content analysis approach was used to analyse the content of these questions. RESULTS: 35 categories were created based on the personalised questions with the most common being physical activity and exercise, anxiety and panic, sleep and coping/stress levels. The categories were grouped into six overarching themes 1) mental health; 2) behaviour and level of functioning; 3) physical wellbeing; 4) health behaviours; 5) active self-management; and, 6) interpersonal. LIMITATIONS: The average age of the sample was around 50 years meaning our findings may not be generalisable to younger individuals with BD. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of BD important to patients in relation to longitudinal monitoring extend well beyond mood symptoms, highlighting the limitations of solely relying on standardised questions/mood rating scales based on symptoms primarily used for diagnosis. Additional symptoms and aspects of life not necessarily useful diagnostically for BD may be more important for individuals themselves to monitor and have more meaning in capturing their own experience of changes in BD severity.

Measurement and correlates of irritability in clinically referred youth: Further examination of the affective reactivity index,"Background: Research on youth irritability has proliferated in recent years, largely facilitated by items from existing measures and by key new instruments like the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI). The present study extends this literature by investigating the psychometric properties of the parent- and youth-report ARI and the correlates of irritability in an independent, clinically referred sample. Method: Baseline assessment data were collected from 237 youths (ages 3-18; 36% female) and their parents, seen for outpatient therapy and/or assessment. We examined the ARI in terms of (1) its item, scale, and factor properties; (2) convergent/discriminant validity with internalizing, externalizing, and emotion regulation problems; (3) specificity of associations with reactive aggression, anger, dysregulation, and coping; and (4) robustness of associations after controlling for demographic variables (e.g., age, gender). Results: The ARI's internal consistency and unidimensional factor structure were acceptable or better, with some variation across items and informants. Irritability, as measured by parent- and youth-report, was associated with variables in the externalizing (inattention, hyperactivity, executive dysfunction, aggression), internalizing (anxiety, depression, suicidality), and emotion regulation domains. Associations with reactive aggression, anger, dysregulation, and coping problems were especially pronounced. Irritability's links with internalizing and externalizing problems remained robust after controlling for demographic covariates. Limitations: The sample was limited in diversity and moderate in size. Conclusions: Findings support the reliability and validity of the ARI for assessing parent- and youth-rated irritability among clinically referred youth. Future research is needed to understand variations in irritability's manifestations, measurement, and correlates across demographic groups.

Association between angiotensin receptor blockers and suicide: Nationwide population-based propensity score matching study,"Background: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to ameliorate anxiety and mood disorders in animal models. Cohort links between ARB use and suicide risk in humans require clarification. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients diagnosed as having hypertension according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (401–405) from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2012 were enrolled as the target population. We defined enrollees who had received ARB prescriptions for at least 28 days as ARB users. Those who had never taken ARB prior or during the study period were defined as ARB nonusers and were propensity score–matched with ARB users. The end outcome was confirmation of a suicide attempt. Results: After propensity score matching was conducted, 40,976 ARB users and 40,976 nonusers were selected as the matched cohorts. The overall incidence rate of suicide attempt was significantly lower in ARB users than in nonusers (0.51 vs. 1.07 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval = 0.26–0.87). A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test revealed a lower cumulative incidence of suicide attempt in ARB users than in nonusers ( p &lt; 0.001 for the unmatched cohort; p = 0.01 for the matched cohort). Conclusions: ARB use was not associated with an increased risk for suicide compared with non-ARB use.

Blunted neural effects of perceived control on reward feedback in major depressive disorder,"Background: Blunted reward processing has emerged as an endophenotype of major depressive disorder (MDD), but mechanistic understanding for this deficit remains elusive. The current event-related potential study examined whether this aberration is driven by the blunted effect of perceived control on reward processing. Methods: We adapted a well-validated gambling task in which perceived control was exercised by choice in 29 individuals with current MDD and 31 healthy controls. We examined the reward positivity in response to personally chosen versus passively received rewards. Results: We found that MDD patients relative to healthy controls exhibited a blunted reward positivity when rewards were delivered following voluntary choices but not when they were delivered following passive choices. This pattern was not observed during the relatively late stage, as indexed by the P300, of feedback processing. Limitation: The current findings may be confounded with medication and anxiety. Conclusions: These findings suggest that deficient reward processing in MDD is attributable to the deficiency in boosting reward responsivity by perceived control exercised by choice.

A randomised wait-list controlled pilot trial of one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for blood-injection-injury phobias,"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been recognized as an effective treatment for specific phobias and has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional in vivo exposure therapy (e.g., acceptability). No past research has evaluated the efficacy of VRET for the treatment of blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the acceptability and efficacy of a single-session VRET intervention for BII phobias. Participants who met DSM-5 criteria for BII phobia ( N = 43) were randomized to VRET or a waiting list control group, and completed self-report measures of BII severity (Medical Fear Survey [MFS] and Multidimensional Blood Phobia Inventory [MBPI]) and dental anxiety (Modified Dental Anxiety Scale), as well as clinician ratings of BII phobia severity and catastrophic cognitions at baseline, one-week post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. We found medium to large differences in catastrophic cognitions (probability [ g = 0.88] and cost [ g = 0.66] ratings), favouring VRET. We found moderate to large differences favouring VRET on the MBPI Injection and Injury fears subscales ( g's = 0.64–1.14) at one-week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, and on the MBPI Fainting subscale ( g = 0.84) and Injections subscale of the Medical Fear Survey ( g = 0.63) at follow-up. There were no other significant group differences. These findings provided some initial evidence to suggest that a single-session VRET may provide some improvements in fears of injections, injury, and fainting. While it may be a useful adjunct or interim step before in vivo exposure therapy, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for BII phobia.

Are Internet- and mobile-based interventions effective in adults with diagnosed panic disorder and/or agoraphobia? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: There is no meta-analysis that specifically evaluates the effectiveness of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) in adults with diagnosed panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/A) so far. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap (PROSPERO CRD 42016034016). Methods: Systematic literature searches in six databases for randomised and controlled clinical trials investigating IMIs in adults, who met diagnostic criteria for PD/A. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses, pre-planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted when appropriate. Primary outcomes were PD and A symptom severity. In addition, adherence, response, remission, quality of life, anxiety and depression symptom severity were examined. Results: A total of 16 trials (1015 patients), with 21 comparisons (9 IMI vs. waitlist; 7 IMI vs. IMI; 5 IMI vs. active treatment condition), were included. IMIs revealed beneficial effects on panic (Hedges’ g range −2.61 to −0.25) and agoraphobia symptom severity when compared to waitlist (pooled g = −1.15, [95%-CI = −1.56; −0.74]). Studies comparing IMIs to active controls (i.e., face-to-face CBT and applied relaxation) did not find significant differences for reductions in panic ( g = −0.02, [95%-CI = −0.25; 0.21]) and agoraphobia symptom severity ( g = −0.10, [95%-CI = −0.39; 0.19]). Furthermore, IMIs were superior to waitlist controls regarding anxiety and depression symptom severity and quality of life. Limitations: Tests for publication bias were not feasible due to the limited number of trials per comparison, and the risk of bias assessment indicated some methodological shortcomings. Conclusions: Findings from this meta-analytic review provide support for the effectiveness of IMIs in patients with verified PD/A. However, before IMIs can be included in treatment guidelines for PD/A, future high quality research is needed that substantiates and extends the evidence base, especially in regard to intervention safety.

Network structures and temporal stability of self- and informant-rated affective symptoms in Alzheimer's disease,"Background: Affective symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be rated with both informant- and self-ratings. Information from these two modalities may not converge. We estimated network structures of affective symptoms in AD with both rating modalities and assessed the longitudinal stability of the networks. Methods: Network analyses combining self-rated and informant-rated affective symptoms were conducted in 3198 individuals with AD at two time points (mean follow-up 387 days), drawn from the NACC database. Self-rated symptoms were assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale, and informant-rated symptoms included depression, apathy and anxiety questions from Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Results: Informant-rated symptoms were mainly connected to symptoms expressing lack of positive affect, but not to the more central symptoms of self-rated worthlessness and helplessness. Networks did not differ in structure ( p = .71), or connectivity ( p = .92) between visits. Symptoms formed four clinically meaningful clusters of depressive symptoms and decline, lack of positive affect, informant-rated apathy and anxiety and informant-rated depression. Limitations: The symptom dynamics in our study could have been present before AD diagnosis. The lack of positive affect cluster may represent a methodological artefact rather than a theoretically meaningful subgroup. Requiring follow-up lead to a selection of patients with less cognitive decline. Conclusions: Informant rating may only capture the more visible affective symptoms, such as not being in good spirits, instead of more central and severe symptoms, such as hopelessness and worthlessness. Future research should continue to be mindful of differences between self- and informant-rated symptoms even in earlier stages of AD.

Assessment of near-term risk for suicide attempts using the Suicide Crisis Inventory,"Background: The Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) describes a pre-suicidal mental state marked by entrapment accompanied by affective disturbances, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal and social withdrawal. This study tested the consistency and validity of the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), a proposed measure of SCS severity, amongst a large, heterogeneous patient sample. Methods: The SCI was used to assess 867 adult psychiatric inpatients and outpatients. Confirmatory factor analysis, logistic regressions and area under the curve analyses (AUC) were used to examine internal structure, construct validity and predictive validity for suicide ideation, plan and attempt one-month post-assessment. Results: The five-factor model of the SCS demonstrated good fit and excellent internal consistency. SCI scores indicated significant associations but non-redundancy with depression, anxiety, and independence from other dimensions of psychiatric distress. SCI scores specifically predicted suicide attempts with an AUC of 0.733 and odds ratio = 8.62 ( p &lt; 0.001) at optimal cut-off point. SCI incremental predictive validity over and beyond suicidal ideation and attempts history reported at baseline was supported for predicting suicide attempts (β = 0.012, S.E = 0.006; p = 0.046). Limitations: The SCI is subject to self-report bias and does not include the SCS social withdrawal component. Follow-up assessment retention was partial (68%, n = 591). Conclusion: The SCI is validated as a tool for the assessment of the SCS intensity and of imminent suicidal behavior. The SCI is suggested as a tool that could aid both researchers and clinicians in comprehensive assessment of a pre-suicidal mental state within moderate to high-risk populations, regardless of self-report on suicidal intent.

Clinical correlates of DSM-5 mixed features in bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis,"Background: Systematic data on clinical correlates of mixed features in bipolar disorder are not available, so far. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the association between DSM-5 mixed features and candidate characteristics in depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. Methods: We included observational studies indexed in the main electronic databases. The association between DSM-5 mixed features and relevant correlates was estimated using odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Analyses were based on random effects models. Results: Eight studies were included, involving 3070 individuals (1495 with a major depressive episode and 1575 with hypo/manic episode). No clinical characteristics were associated with mixed features in subjects with a depressive episode. Among subjects with a manic/hypomanic episode, those with mixed features were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.42 to 3.94; I² = 39.7%), co-occurring anxiety disorders (OR: 2.67; 95%CI: 1.28 to 5.57; I² = 0%), and a rapid cycling course (OR = 4.23; 95%CI: 1.29 to 13.81; I² = 0%), with less severe manic symptoms (SMD = -0.40; 95%CI: -0.65 to -0.16; I2=0%). Limitations: (1) the heterogeneity of methods across studies and the inconsistency of findings; (2) the limited amount of data on correlates of DSM-5 mixed features; (3) the possible influence of publication bias. Conclusions: Findings of this meta-analysis show that mixed features among individuals with a manic/hypomanic episode may identify a special clinical population, characterized not only by depressive symptoms, but also by anxiety, rapid cycling, and suicidality.

Brain functional abnormalities in the amygdala subregions is associated with anxious depression,"Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have provided strong support for the critical role the amygdala plays in emotional processing. The amygdala is composed of three primary distinct nuclei that have different functions in emotional regulation. Anxious depression (AD) was considered as a common dimensional symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, the neuroimaging basis of this special MDD subtype remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to study the functional connectivity of the amygdala's subregions in AD patients. Methods: Eighty-three patients with AD, 70 non-anxious depression (NAD) patients, and 62 healthy controls were collected. Age and gender were well-matched. The functional connectivity of three amygdala subregions, including centromedial (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF), were compared among the AD, NAD, and HC groups. The correlation between functional connectivity in the amygdala subregions and the HAMD factor scores were further analyzed. Results: Patients with AD showed decreased functional connectivity between the right CM/LB and the right middle frontal gyrus relative to the NAD group. The NAD patients showed decreased functional connectivity between the right precentral gyrus and the right CM/SF compared to the HC group. The functional connectivity between the right CM and the right middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the anxiety/somatization factor. Conclusion: The functional connectivity between the right CM/LB and the right middle frontal gyrus might be the neurobiological mechanism of anxious depression. The FC between the right CM and the right middle frontal gyrus may help to explain the special clinical feature of the AD patients.

"Skin autofluorescence of advanced glycation end products and course of affective disorders in the lifelines cohort study, a prospective investigation","Background: Skin autofluorescence (SAF), indicating concentration of advanced glycation end products in the skin and oxidative stress, is cross-sectionally associated with affective disorders. Prospective studies of oxidative stress markers will help to clarify the pathophysiological role of oxidative stress. Methods: Data of a population-based cohort study were used. Presence of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia was assessed at baseline and at 5-year follow-up with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Associations between SAF at baseline and incidence and persistence/recurrence of affective disorders were assessed with logistic regression. Results: Of 43,267 participants with no disorder at baseline, 2885 (6.7%) developed an incident disorder during follow-up. In 1360 of 3648 participants (37.3%) with an affective disorder at baseline, a persisting/recurrent disorder was present at follow-up. A modest association existed between SAF and incident affective disorders (OR = 1.07 [95%CI 1.03–1.12], P &lt; .001), specifically major depressive disorder (OR = 1.11 [95%CI 1.04–1.19], P = .003); this association lost statistical significance after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Associations between SAF and persistence/recurrence were not significant. Limitations: Many confounders might also act as intermediate: extensive adjustment for confounders caused overfitting and possibly masked effects of SAF on course of affective disorders. Relatively small sample sizes for analyses of SAF and persistence/recurrence of affective disorders resulted in a low power. Conclusions: Increased SAF modestly raises the odds of incident affective disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, providing evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in subsequent occurrence of affective disorders. However, significance of effects faded after adjustment for socioeconomic status.

Predictors of emotional distress in people with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review of prospective studies,"Background: Emotional distress (defined as any negative mood state, including anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms and global distress) is common in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). To develop more integrated care for PwMS requires a better understanding of causal variables underlying persistent emotional distress. This systematic review critically appraised and synthesised the findings of prospective studies investigating predictors of emotional distress in PwMS. Method: CINAHL, Medline, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for: i) prospective cohort studies with ≥1-month follow-up period, which; ii) evaluated baseline clinical and demographic, social and/or psychosocial predictors of emotional distress; iii) presented results for adults with MS; and iv) used validated measures to assess emotional distress. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Thirteen studies, reported in 17 papers, were included. A wide range of outcome measures and statistical methods were used. The most reliable finding was that baseline emotional distress and stress-coping variables predicted emotional distress. Less robust support was found for income, negative cognitive illness appraisals and poor social support. No other variables often predicted emotional distress. Limitations: Lack of consistency across included studies may limit confidence in the results obtained. Conclusions: Little is currently known about how or why some people become and remain distressed following a diagnosis of MS, whilst others do not. However, psychological and social factors such as emotional distress and stress-coping variables appear to be important. A better understanding of the psychological factors underpinning distress in PwMS is needed.

Personality traits in adults with hoarding disorder,"Background: Prior research has demonstrated a link between compulsive hoarding symptoms and personality traits; however, no studies have investigated the link between hoarding and personality traits utilizing a sample of individuals diagnosed with hoarding disorder (HD) using formal diagnostic criteria. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the frequency and type of personality traits in adults diagnosed with HD and to explore the associations among hoarding severity and personality disorder traits within this sample. Methods: Seventy-two veterans enrolled in an ongoing treatment trial for HD completed a battery of self-report measures during their initial assessment. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the unique variance accounted for by hoarding severity in predicting scores on the personality disorder scales from the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III). Results: The majority of participants had an elevated score on at least one of the MCMI-III Personality scales. The most frequently elevated scores were for the Avoidant, Dependent, Depressive, and Schizoid scales. Hoarding severity was a significant predictor of personality traits in 10 out of 14 MCMI-III scales. Limitations: Given the exploratory nature of the investigation, we did not control for multiple comparisons or the presence of mood or anxiety disorders. Conclusions: The elevated prevalence of co-occurring personality pathology in adults with HD indicates the importance of considering underlying personality structure when developing individualized treatment plans.

"Prospective associations between bullying victimisation, internalised stigma, and mental health in South African adolescents living with HIV","Background: Adolescents living with HIV may be at elevated risk of psychological problems, which are correlated with negative health outcomes. In cross-sectional research with HIV-affected adolescents, bullying victimisation and internalised HIV stigma have been associated with poorer psychological health. We extended these findings and tested longitudinal associations between bullying victimisation, internalised stigma, and mental health among adolescents living with HIV. We also tested whether relationships between bullying victimisation and psychological symptoms were mediated by internalised stigma. Method: Adolescents living with HIV ( n = 1060, 10–19 years, 55% female), who had ever initiated HIV treatment in 53 public health facilities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, were interviewed and followed up 18 months later ( n = 995, 94% retention). Participants completed well-validated measures of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, bullying victimisation, and internalised stigma. Results: After adjusting for baseline mental health and sociodemographic characteristics, baseline internalised stigma prospectively predicted poorer outcomes on all psychological measures. Bullying victimisation at baseline was not directly associated with any psychological measures at follow up; however, it was indirectly associated with all psychological measures via internalised stigma. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures and poor reliability of the depression scale. Conclusions: Bullying victimisation is associated with internalised stigma, which in turn predicts psychological symptoms over time. Interventions reducing internalised stigma and associated psychological distress are needed, and these should be integrated into HIV care to ensure optimal HIV management. The implementation of bullying prevention programs may reduce internalised stigma and promote mental health among adolescents living with HIV.

Dynamic fluctuations of emotional states in adolescents with delayed sleep phase—A longitudinal network modeling approach,"Background: Very late sleep rhythms are risks for social adjustment problems in adolescence. Using ecological momentary assessment data, we quantified and visualized temporal and contemporaneous within-persons dynamical relations of sleepiness and emotions in adolescents with and without late sleep rhythms. Methods: We analyzed a temporal network via multilevel vector autoregression (mlVAR) modeling and a contemporaneous network through the partial associations between the residuals of temporal and the between-subject multilevel models. We tested whether these networks were different between those with a late circadian rhythm [concurrent delayed sleep phase (DSP) N = 172, 37% boys, 63% girls] and those without ( N = 143, 22% boys, 78% girls). Results: In adolescents without DSP, the temporal networks showed continuity only for low mood from the previous to the following time point. In adolescents with DSP, there were more predictable patterns of emotions. Feelings of depression led to a decrease of positive emotions and increase of irritation and anxiety. The contemporaneous networks showed clusters of positive and negative emotions in both groups and sleepiness decreased the experience of positive emotions concurrently. Limitations: DSP in our current study was based only on one out of three diagnostic criteria of the full disorder (DSM-5) and it was assessed only once. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the dynamic organization of emotions and sleepiness is different in adolescents with and without DSP. DSP adolescents have more predictable and maladaptive emotional patterns during the day. Results provide new insight about why individuals with DSP are at a heightened risk for decreased emotional adjustment.

Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan,"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. Results: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (β = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (β = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (β = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.

Bisexuality and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI): A narrative synthesis of associated variables and a meta-analysis of risk,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 277 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-75728-134). The authors wish to acknowledge an additional affiliated institution for Dr Samantha Hartley: Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Old Street, Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.] Background: Bisexual people have been found to be at increased risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) when compared to heterosexual and gay or lesbian people. The purpose of this review was to update the estimated risk of NSSI for bisexual people and to examine variables that have been associated with NSSI in this population. Methods: The protocol for this paper was pre-registered (CRD42019145299). An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, PubMed, Ovid Online and Web of Science was undertaken from earliest available date to October 2019. Twenty-four eligible papers were identified. Meta-analyses, including moderator analysis, were conducted to ascertain NSSI risk and a narrative synthesis was undertaken of predictors and correlates. All studies were assessed for risk of bias. Results: Bisexual people had up to six times the odds of engaging in NSSI compared to other sexualities. Mental health variables of anxiety and depression symptoms were found to be most commonly associated with NSSI for this population. The majority of studies had moderate risk of bias. This review demonstrates that bisexual people have an elevated risk of engaging in NSSI. Increased incidence of anxiety and depression and exposure to negative life events may explain this increased risk. Limitations: Studies were found to be consistently cross-sectional in design and limited to western cultures. A limitation of this review was that only English language papers were included. Conclusions: Results are clinically relevant as they suggest early identification and prevention of NSSI can be achieved. Future research should examine bisexual people independently of others.

Eating disorder symptoms and core eating disorder fears decrease during online imaginal exposure therapy for eating disorders,"Background: Few evidence-based treatments for eating disorders (EDs) exist. Imaginal exposure therapy is a key component of effective treatment for anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, imaginal exposure has not been systematically tested as a treatment for EDs. The current study aimed to develop and test online imaginal exposure as a treatment for EDs. Methods: The current study tested a four-week trial of online imaginal exposure for EDs ( N = 229 participants with EDs recruited globally). Participants completed diagnostic interviews and four sessions of weekly online imaginal exposure, in which they wrote about and imagined a core ED fear (identified with a therapist). Participants completed measures of ED symptoms and fears (i.e., fear of weight gain, food) at pre-imaginal exposure, post-imaginal exposure, and six-month follow-up. Participants were recruited and participated in the protocol from November 2016 to October 2018. Results: All primary outcomes (ED symptoms, ED fears) significantly decreased at study completion and six-month follow-up with medium-to-large effect sizes. State anxiety across the exposure and follow-ups significantly decreased, specifically from initial sessions to follow-up. Worry, but not depression, significantly decreased. Limitations: This study was an open case trial and did not include a control condition. Conclusions: Significant decreases in ED symptoms and fears occurred during the course of imaginal exposure treatment. Online imaginal exposure is a feasible treatment for EDs and is associated with decreases in core ED symptomatology, which are comparable in magnitude to decreases seen from other evidence-based treatments. A future randomized-controlled trial is needed. Clinical trials registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03712748.

Data mining algorithm predicts a range of adverse outcomes in major depression,"Background: Course of illness in major depression (MD) is highly varied, which might lead to both under- and overtreatment if clinicians adhere to a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Novel opportunities in data mining could lead to prediction models that can assist clinicians in treatment decisions tailored to the individual patient. This study assesses the performance of a previously developed data mining algorithm to predict future episodes of MD based on clinical information in new data. Methods: We applied a prediction model utilizing baseline clinical characteristics in subjects who reported lifetime MD to two independent test samples (total n = 4226). We assessed the model's performance to predict future episodes of MD, anxiety disorders, and disability during follow-up (1–9 years after baseline). In addition, we compared its prediction performance with well-known risk factors for a severe course of illness. Results: Our model consistently predicted future episodes of MD in both test samples (AUC 0.68–0.73, modest prediction). Equally accurately, it predicted episodes of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and disability (AUC 0.65–0.78). Our model predicted these outcomes more accurately than risk factors for a severe course of illness such as family history of MD and lifetime traumas. Limitations: Prediction accuracy might be different for specific subgroups, such as hospitalized patients or patients with a different cultural background. Conclusions: Our prediction model consistently predicted a range of adverse outcomes in MD across two independent test samples derived from studies in different subpopulations, countries, using different measurement procedures. This replication study holds promise for application in clinical practice.

Fear acquisition and extinction in elderly patients with depression,"Background: Depression in elderly patients is common and characterized by anxiety symptoms and cognitive impairment. To our knowledge, no studies have yet investigated the process of fear extinction in these patients. We investigated fear extinction with a paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition and extinction. Methods: We included three age matched (mean age: 75.7 years) groups: Late Life Depression (LLD, n = 33), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 39), healthy controls (HC, n = 39). All participants were diagnosed with a standardized procedure including clinical examination, CERAD cognitive test battery, as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition, and extinction. During acquisition, a neutral face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an electrical unconditioned stimulus, whereas another face (safety stimulus, CS-) was unpaired. Conditioned responses were measured by US-expectancy and valence ratings. Results: Compared to HC, both patient groups showed a significantly lower, differential (CS+ vs. CS-) fear acquisition across all measurements. Patients with cognitive impairment showed a significantly slower extinction, which is characterized by higher US-expectancy and reduced positive valence for CS+. Fear extinction was significantly less differential (CS+ vs. CS-) in patients with LLD. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design we cannot distinguish whether the observed differences in fear extinction are state or trait markers in the LLD patients. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that fear extinction is impaired in elderly patients with depression. These results can have influence on treatment strategies.

An acute manic episode during 2019-nCov quarantine,"Background: The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation: A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion: Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.

The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing,"Background: There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method: An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results: 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers ( P &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion: There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected. More studies on cognitive and behavioral subsequence after a public health disaster among hospital workers are needed.

Emotional “inflection point” in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China,"Background: The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results: In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion: This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions.

Insight into the psychological problems on the epidemic of COVID-19 in China by online searching behaviors,"The letter presents a study on the psychological problems due to epidemic of COVID-19 in China. Authors tried to explore the potential psychological problems among the public in Wuhan city and the whole country of China, by using their online searching behaviors. According to the 2019 Chinese search engine user behavior study report released by China Internet Network Information Center Reports, there are 695 million searching engine users in China as of June 2019. Data on online searching behaviors indicated that the public were more likely to develop anxiety symptoms as panic and fear than depressive symptoms and insomnia in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic. With prevailed online services and well-developed network, we suggest that it is imperative to build network-based systems throughout the country which include active monitoring, early warning and intervention of potential psychological problems, to better serve the public, especially during public health-related emergencies. There were limitations in this study as we only discussed the short-term psychological impact of the epidemic among the public but the long-term psychological involvement will depend on the control of COVID-19. Again, we only offered insight on the “potential psychological problems” through keyword searching behaviors, rather than “disease diagnosis”. Hence, extrapolation of the conclusion needed to be cautious. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Letter",2020
Effectiveness of an alternative intervention in the treatment of depressive symptoms,"Background: There is a scarcity of studies in the international literature regarding alternative treatment to the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention in the face of depression symptoms. This study aimed to test a protocol based on natural therapy, alternatives to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic, through Mindfulness Meditation, Reiki, Acupuncture and Auriculotherapy, to treat the symptoms of depression for those who were with no pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatment for these symptoms. Methods: this is a randomized single-blind controlled pilot study. The final sample was 21 participants divided in two groups: experimental and control. Participants were evaluated by validated instruments during the screening process and after the intervention. The instruments were: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Intervention was performed in eight sessions, during two months. All the techniques were used in the experimental group. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to compare pre-intervention to post-intervention moments. Results: the result of analysis indicates a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression after the intervention among the experimental group. Limitations: there is no way to determine which of the techniques used produced the most significant result. Conclusions: The protocol proposed in this study was effective in reducing the symptoms of depression to whom are not eligible for traditional treatment.

"Reaching reliable change using short, daily, cognitive training exercises delivered on a mobile application: The case of Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) symptoms and cognitions in a subclinical cohort","Background: Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) is a presentation of OCD centering on interpersonal relationships. The aim of this Randomized Control Trial (RCT) was to assess the efficacy of short, game like, daily cognitive interventions delivered via mobile application in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated phenomena. Methods: Fifty university students identified as having subclinical levels of ROCD symptoms (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinical Version) were randomized into: immediate-use group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed-use group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the evaluated cognitive-behavioral training application at baseline for 15 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group commenced using the application at T1 for 15 days (T1 to T2). All participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 15 days from baseline (T1), and 30 days from baseline (T2). Results: Repeated measure MANOVAs showed significant Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interactions. These interactions indicated greater decrease in ROCD symptoms, OCD beliefs and social anxiety symptoms, as well as a greater increase in self-esteem in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1. Moreover, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) indicated reliable change on ROCD symptoms for a significant portion of participants (42–52%). Limitations: Sample size and the use of self-report measures limits the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Short, daily cognitive training interventions delivered via mobile applications may be useful in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated features. Further testing is needed for clinical populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
The role of psychiatric symptoms and environmental vulnerability factors in explaining the relationship between child maltreatment and suicidality: A prospective investigation,"Background: Childhood maltreatment has been associated with suicide thoughts and attempts; however, few longitudinal studies have assessed risk of suicidality into adulthood. Fewer have examined potential mediators (psychiatric symptoms and environmental vulnerability factors). Methods: Prospective cohort design. Children with documented cases of maltreatment ( N = 495, ages 0–11) were matched with non-maltreated children ( N = 395) and followed up into adulthood. Psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, dysthymia, post-traumatic stress,antisocial personality,and substance use) and environmental vulnerability (social isolation, physical disability/illness, and homelessness) were assessed at mean age 29 and suicide thoughts and attempts at 39. Structural equation models tested for mediation, controlling for age, sex, race, and IQ. Results: Childhood maltreatment predicted suicide attempts (Beta = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001), but not suicide thoughts only.Individuals with only suicide thoughts differed significantly from those with suicide attempts in psychiatric symptoms, physical disability/ illness, and homelessness. There were significant paths from child maltreatment to suicide attempts through psychiatric symptoms (0.18, p &lt; 0.001), ASPD (0.13, p &lt; 0.001), substance use (0.07, p &lt; 0.01), and homelessness (0.10, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Court cases of child maltreatment may not generalize to middle- or upper- class and non-reported cases.Effect sizes were small but significant. Conclusions: Psychiatric risk factors for suicide are well recognized. These new results provide strong evidence that environmental vulnerability factors, particularly homelessness, are associated with increased risk for suicide attempts and warrant attention.Although many people report suicide thoughts, maltreated children with more psychiatric symptoms and experience homelessness are more likely to attempt suicide and warrant targeted interventions.

"Characteristics associated with later self-harm hospitalization and/or suicide: A follow-up study of the HUNT-2 cohort, Norway","Background: To improve suicide and self-harm prevention in adults, better knowledge on preexisting characteristics and risk factors is of great importance. Methods: This is a population-based case-control study; baseline measures were collected in the second wave of the North-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT-2, 1995–1997) in Norway, and outcomes were observed for up to 19 years. Average follow up time was 4.9 years for self-harm and 6.8 years for suicides. Out of 93,898 eligible adult inhabitants aged 20 and above, a total of 65,229 (70%) participated in the study. The data were linked to the National Mortality Registry and hospital patient records in the three hospitals covering the HUNT-2 catchment area. Results: Among the participants, 332 patients (68% women) were hospitalized because of self-harm (HSH), and 91 patients (32% women) were died by suicide (SU). A total of 10% of those who died by SU had previously been HSH. People in the HSH and SU groups were younger, reported more depression and anxiety symptoms, sleeping problems, higher use of alcohol and tobacco, poorer social network and more economic problems, compared to the rest of the HUNT-2 population. In addition, the HSH group reported more somatic health problems, higher use of health services, higher sick leave, and lower work participation than the SU group. Limitations: Younger adults (20–40 years) were under-represented in HUNT-2. Younger adults (20–40 years) were constituted 31.7% in HUNT-2, 50% in HSH and 33% in SU. Further, we did not identify less severe self-harm, not requiring hospitalization. Life changes, adverse events, and other possible triggers to self-harming behavior were not recorded. Conclusion: Psychological problems were long-term predictors of both HSH and SU. Somatic health problems and lower functional performance were more present in HSH-group compared to the SU-group.

Trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms from early pregnancy to six weeks postpartum and their risk factors—A longitudinal study,"Background: Few studies explored trajectories of depressive symptoms from early pregnancy and covered the whole perinatal period. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. Results: Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (“Low-throughout”); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (“Antenatal-high”); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (“Postpartum-high”). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the “Antenatal-high” and “Postpartum-high” trajectories, respectively. Limitations: Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. Conclusions: We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy. Factors associated with each trajectory were different, raising the potential of individualized intervention to reduce the occurrence of depression.

The feasibility of acupuncture as an adjunct intervention for antenatal depression: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"Background: Antenatal depression is common and associated with adverse consequences for mothers, babies, and future generations. Limitations with conventional approaches has resulted in additional therapies being considered. This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of acupuncture for improving mental health. Methods: Fifty-seven pregnant women with depressive symptomologies were randomised to acupuncture (n = 19) plus treatment as usual (TAU), progressive muscle relaxation (PMR, n = 19) plus TAU or TAU (n = 19). Treatments were conducted from 24 to 31 weeks gestation. Clinical assessments were performed throughout the intervention, as well as at a six-week postnatal follow-up. The primary outcome measure was depression. Secondary outcome measurements were stress, anxiety, psychological distress, quality of life and adjustment to mothering. Intention to treat (ITT), Linear Mixed Model (LMM) repeated measures and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. Results: At end-of-intervention there were significantly lower depression scores in the acupuncture group versus TAU and PMR respectively [ITT p &lt; 0.001, mean difference (MD) -5.84 (95% CI -9.10 to -2.58); MD -3.42 (95% CI -6.64 to -0.20)]. LMM repeated measures analysis (including postnatal follow-up) also demonstrated significantly lowered acupuncture group scores for stress (p=0.006) and psychological distress (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to PMR and TAU. Between group differences were not significant at six-weeks postnatal. No adverse events were reported. Limitations: Main limitations are small sample size and the use of self-reported outcome measures. Conclusion: Prenatal acupuncture reduced depression, stress and distress, whilst also being well-tolerated and free from adverse events. Further research is warranted.

Impact of coronavirus syndromes on physical and mental health of health care workers: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of developing physical/mental health outcomes related to coronavirus syndromes. Nature and frequency of these outcomes are undetermined. Methods: PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant (PROSPERO-CRD42020180205) systematic review of Web of Science/grey literature until 15th April 2020, to identify studies reporting physical/mental health outcomes in HCW infected/exposed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS-, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -MERS-, Novel coronavirus -COVID-19-. Proportion random effect meta-analyses, I 2 statistic, quality assessment and sensitivity analysis. Results: 115 articles were included (n = 60,458 HCW, age 36.1±7.1, 77.1% female). Physical health outcomes: 75.9% HCW infected by SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported fever (95%CI = 65.9–83.7%, k = 12, n = 949), 47.9% cough (95%CI=39.2–56.8%, k = 14, n = 970), 43.6% myalgias (95%CI=31.9–56.0%, k = 13, n=898), 42.3% chills (95%CI = 20.2–67.9%, k = 7, n = 716), 41.2% fatigue (95%CI = 18.2–68.8%, k = 6, n = 386), 34.6% headaches (95%CI = 23.1–48.2%, k = 11, n = 893), 31.2% dyspnoea (95%CI = 23.2–40.5%, k = 12, n = 1003), 25.3% sore throat (95%CI=18.8–33.2%, k = 8, n = 747), 22.2% nausea/vomiting (95%CI = 14.9–31.8%, k = 6, n = 662), 18.8% diarrhoea (95%CI = 11.9–28.4%, k = 9, n = 824). Mental health outcomes: 62.5% HCW exposed to SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported general health concerns (95%CI = 57.0–67,8%, k = 2, n = 2254), 43.7% fear (95%CI=33.9–54.0%, k = 4, n = 584), 37.9% insomnia (95%CI = 30.9–45.5%, k = 6, n = 5067), 37.8% psychological distress (95%CI = 28.4–48.2%, k = 15, n = 24,346), 34.4% burnout (95%CI = 19.3–53.5%, k = 3, n = 1337), 29.0% anxiety features (95%CI=14.2–50.3%, k = 6, n = 9191), 26.3% depressive symptoms (95%CI = 12.5–47.1%, k = 8, n = 9893), 20.7% post-traumatic stress disorder features (95%CI = 13.2–31%, k = 11, n = 3826), 16.1% somatisation (95%CI=0.2–96.0%, k = 2, n = 2184), 14.0% stigmatisation feelings (95%CI = 6.4–28.1%, k = 2, n = 411).

The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study,"Background and objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI = 1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.

Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic functional connectivity alterations in major depressive disorder,"Background: The cerebellum plays an important role in the neural mechanism of depression and its static functional connectivity (FC) with the cerebrum is disrupted in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC alterations in MDD remain largely unknown. Methods: 50 patients with MDD and 36 well-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC analyses were performed using the cerebellar seeds previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Inter-group differences in the cerebellar dynamic FC and their associations with clinical and cognitive variables were examined. Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had decreased cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the executive, default-mode and affective-limbic networks. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregion connecting with the affective-limbic network was related to severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in MDD patients. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the default-mode and affective-limbic networks were related to sustained attention and prospective memory in controls, while the correlations were inverse or non-significant in patients. Limitations: The fairly modest sample size and potential medication effect may increase the instability of the results. Conclusions: Our findings provide further evidence for the pivotal role of the cerebellum in the neuropathology of depression, pointing to potential targets of cerebellar-cerebral pathways for alternative intervention or monitoring therapeutic responses.

Association between skin autofluorescence of advanced glycation end products and affective disorders in the lifelines cohort study,"Background: Oxidative stress may be a mechanistic link between affective disorders (depressive and anxiety disorders) and somatic disease. Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. Methods: Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. Results: Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18–91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR = 1.09 [95%CI 1.07–1.12], P &lt; .001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR = 1.31 [95%CI 1.25–1.36], P&lt;.001 in the crude model; OR = 1.12 [95%CI 1.07–1.17], P &lt; .001 in the fully adjusted model). For other disorders, associations lost significance after adjustment for cardiometabolic parameters and somatic morbidities. Limitations: Persons of non-Western descent and severely (mentally or physically) ill individuals were underrepresented. Conclusions: SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders, suggesting a link between these disorders and cumulative oxidative stress. For major depressive disorder, this association was strongest and independent of sociodemographic, cardiometabolic factors, and somatic morbidities.

"Effects of circulating vitamin D concentrations on emotion, behavior and attention: A cross-sectional study in preschool children with follow-up behavior experiments in juvenile mice","Background: Although few studies show that vitamin D (VitD) deficiency has a negative effect on children's emotion and behavior, the effects of the excessive VitD and the appropriate 25(OH)D concentration have never been reported. We investigated the effect of the deficient and excessive VitD on emotion, behavior and attention. Methods: 351 preschool children in a multicenter study in Shanghai, China that had serum 25(OH)D measurements and emotion, behavior and attention measures were included in the analyses. In animal experiments, C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control (C) group, VitD deficiency (VDD) group, and VitD overdose (VDO) group. The emotion, behavior and attention of juvenile mice were evaluated through the behavioral experiments. Results: There was an “U"" relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and emotion, behavior and attention. Compared with 20–40 ng/mL group, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.5 (1.0, 4.8) for emotional problem, 3.8 (1.2, 12.1) for conduct problem and 1.8 (1.1, 5.7) for inattention in &lt;20 ng/mL group. Meanwhile, compared with 20–40 ng/mL group, ORs were 9.5 (2.9, 31.4) for impulsive hyperactivity, and 3.9 (1.2, 12.9) for conduct problem in &gt;40 ng/mL group. Consistent with the results in children, animal experiments showed that the attention level decreased in VDD group, while the anxiety level, hyperactive level and aggressiveness in VDD group and VDO group were significantly increased, respectively. Limitations: 25(OH)D measurements were only available in one season. Conclusion: The deficient and excessive VitD status both adversely affected children's emotion, behavior and attention.

Negative memory bias as a transdiagnostic cognitive marker for depression symptom severity,"Background: Negative memory bias is a strong risk factor for the development and maintenance of depression. Recent evidence also found negative memory bias in other mental disorders. Here, we aim to: 1) assess the presence and strength of negative memory bias in a range of (comorbid) mental disorders, 2) investigate which disorder-specific symptoms are associated with negative memory bias, and 3) test whether negative memory bias might be a transdiagnostic mechanism. Methods: Negative memory bias was measured in patients with at least one diagnosis of a stress-related disorder ( n = 86), a neurodevelopmental disorder ( n = 53), or both ( n = 68), and 51 controls. Depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder symptom severity was assessed using questionnaires. Groups were compared on negative memory bias and the associations between negative memory bias and symptom severity were made using linear regression models. Results: All patient groups showed stronger negative memory bias than the controls. Negative memory bias was individually associated with all symptom severity indices, but when added into a single model, only the association with depressive symptom severity remained. This persisted after controlling for diagnostic group. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional sectional study design, we could only look at the associations between negative memory bias and disorder-specific symptoms and not at the direction of the effects. Conclusions: Negative memory bias is characteristic of a depressotypic processing style and present in different mental disorders. It might play a mechanistic role in the development of (subclinical) co-occurrence between mental disorders.

Exploring and assessing demoralization in patients with non-psychotic affective disorders,"Background: Demoralization, as assessed through the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research–Demoralization (DCPR/D) interview or the Demoralization Scale (DS), has been found to affect about 30% of patients with medical disorders, while few studies have been done in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: A convenience sample of 377 patients with ICD-10 diagnoses of mood, anxiety, stress-related disorders or other non-psychotic disorders was recruited from two Italian university psychiatry centers. The DCPR/D interview and the Italian version of the DS (DS-IT) were used to assess demoralization and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression. Results: Demoralization was diagnosable in more than 50% of the patients. Factor analysis of the DS-IT indicated four main factors, Meaninglessness/Helplessness, Disheartenment, Dysphoria and Sense of Failure, explaining 62% of the variance of the scale. Patients with bipolar or unipolar major depression and personality disorders had the highest prevalence of demoralization (DCPR/D) and the highest scores on all the DS-IT factors in comparison with patients with adjustment or anxiety disorders. About 50% of patients with moderate demoralization (DS-IT) were not clinically depressed (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), while almost all with severe demoralization were depressed. Limitations: Prospective studies on larger samples with other psychiatric disorders, also taking into account subjective incompetence, are needed. Since the DCPR/D assesses demoralization as a categorical construct, a dimensional framework should be necessary. Conclusions: The findings enrich the research on demoralization, showing for the first time the importance of this construct, as measured by the DCPR/D and the DS-IT, in patients with psychiatric disorders.

"Associations between mental and oral health in Spain: A cross-sectional study of more than 23,000 people aged 15 years and over","Background: This study aimed to investigate associations between mental health and several parameters of oral health, controlling for a variety of important covariates, in a large representative sample of Spanish people. Methods: Data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analysed. Mental (i.e., depression, chronic anxiety, other psychiatric disorders) and oral health (i.e., dental caries, dental extraction, dental filling, gingival bleeding, tooth movement, dental material, missing tooth) were evaluated. Control variables included sex, age, marital status, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical multimorbidity. Associations between psychiatric conditions (independent variables) and the number of poor oral health outcomes (dependent variable) were assessed using Poisson regression models. The associations were investigated in the overall population, in married participants and in those who were single/widowed/divorced/separated. Results: There were 23,089 participants [54.1% women; mean (standard deviation) age 53.4 (18.9) years]. The prevalence of at least one psychiatric condition was 15.4% in the overall sample, while the mean (standard deviation) number of poor oral health outcomes was 2.9 (1.4). There was a positive association between any psychiatric condition and the number of poor oral health outcomes [incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.12], and there was a significant interaction between any psychiatric condition and marital status. The association was stronger in those participants who were single/widowed/divorced/separated. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Oral and mental health were assessed with Yes/No questions. Exposure, outcome and covariates were self-reported. Conclusions: Those with poor mental health have worse oral health but being married has some protective benefits.

Use of ketamine to treat depression may increase the risk of relapse into drinking in abstinent alcoholics,"The letter presents a case report of a 59-year-old woman with severe treatment resistant depression (TRD), posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was in 12-year remission from alcohol dependence syndrome. She underwent 9 ketamine infusions across 50 days for TRD associated with anxiety and suicidal ideation; the dose increased in steps from 35 mg infused across 50 min to 90 mg infused across 60 min. Whereas she did not find the ketamine infusions pleasurable, she experienced 3 incidents of alcohol craving, triggered by environmental alcohol cues, between her third and eighth infusions. Three days after her eighth ketamine infusion, she consumed alcohol. She stated that oral ketamine gave her a “buzz”, similar to an “acid trip” with mild euphoria. She reported that discussions about her ketamine experiences triggered further alcohol cravings. She also reported that ketamine “triggered something” towards alcohol craving and use, which had been dormant for 12 years. Clinical trials of ketamine for depression generally exclude from recruitment patients with recent history of substance use disorders, and there is no examination of the effect of ketamine on issues related to craving and substance use in recruited, long-abstinent alcohol users. This is therefore an area that requires careful attention and documentation in clinical practice and in future research.

Chronic retinoic acid treatment induces affective disorders by impairing the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus,"Background: More and more people are suffering from depression in modern society. It is believed that the development of depression results from alterations in synaptic transmission, especially in the hippocampus. Animal experiments and clinical studies have demonstrated that retinoids are essential components in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and they have a close relationship with depression. However, it is still unclear how excessive retinoic acid (RA) causes depression and what synaptic and molecular mechanisms underlie it. Methods: Behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular approaches were employed to characterize the effects of RA on depression and synaptic plasticity. RA was continuously administered intracerebroventricularly through an osmotic pump. Results: RA treatment induced depression-like behaviors, as evidenced by decreased sucrose preference and increased immobile duration in both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. RA administration also induced anxiety-like behaviors, indicated by decreased duration in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central of the open field. RA treatment decreased the neuronal excitability of the hippocampus either by changing the excitatory/inhibitory receptor balance or by promoting the synthesis of inhibitory neurotransmitters. Moreover, long-term potentiation was decreased in both the excitatory postsynaptic potential and the population spike in RA-treated rats, presumably a consequence of the reduced glur1 transcript level. Limitations: The mechanism of how excess RA affects the hippocampal gene expression and synaptic plasticity requires further study. Conclusions: RA treatment can induce depression-like behavior in rats and impair hippocampal plasticity. Thus, improving synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus may ameliorate the affective disorders caused by excessive RA.

Birth with synthetic oxytocin and risk of childhood emotional disorders: A Danish population-based study,"Background: Concerns have been raised that synthetic oxytocin, a widely used obstetric tool for labor induction and augmentation, may have deleterious effects on the neuropsychological development of children. Few studies have examined the relationship between oxytocin-stimulated labor and emotional disorders. Methods: We conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study including 677,629 singletons born in Denmark in the years 2000 to 2012 and followed through 2016 (median age = 10.6 years). Data on oxytocin-stimulation were obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register. Cases of emotional disorders—anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood or traumatic stress disorders or a redeemed prescription for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor—were identified using Danish patient and prescription registries. Results: Oxytocin was used to stimulate 31% of births, and oxytocin-stimulated labor was not associated with childhood emotional disorders (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11) after adjustment for maternal history of psychopathology, antidepressants during pregnancy, cohabitation status, highest educational attainment, smoking status during pregnancy, birth year, and indications for labor stimulation. The crude cox model was also small and close to unity (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03, 1.15). Limitations: About 50% of our population had reached the age of 10 years, but the outcome included disorders with later average debut ages. Oxytocin dosage levels are not recorded in the registers. Conclusions: Our small effect size estimates suggest that perinatal synthetic oxytocin does not contribute to the development of emotional disorders. Current evidence does not warrant revision of guidelines for the use of oxytocin in obstetrics.

"The effectiveness of modified, group-based CBT for dementia worry among Chinese elders","Objectives: Dementias are highly prevalent among Chinese elders. This study examined the effectiveness of a modified group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on dementia worry among Chinese older adults. Methods: Eighty-two older adults recruited from four elder group homes were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group. The intervention group (n = 44) received eight weekly 60-minute face-to-face CBT, while the control group (n = 38) received treatment-as-usual. Results: Outcomes indicated that the modified group CBT has significantly reduced dementia worry and culturally biased beliefs about dementia ( p &lt; .001). Study findings supported both statistically and clinically significant effect of modified group CBT on dementia worry [ g = -1.52, 95% CI (-2.01, -1.03)] and biased beliefs about dementia [ g = -.95, 95% CI (-1.40, -.49)]. Discussion: The culturally adapted CBT is promising in alleviating worries and anxiety over dementia among Chinese older adults. Future research needs to include larger samples and participants from different regions to replicate findings.

Predictors of cognitive impairment in treatment-resistant depression,"Background: Cognitive impairment is a well-recognized symptom of major depressive disorder; however, contributing factors are not fully characterized. The present study examined the neurocognitive profiles and predictors of cognitive impairment in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: Moderate to severely depressed TRD patients were compared to matched healthy volunteers (HV) in verbal learning and recall and executive functions. Based on cognitive scores, cluster analysis was performed to identify subsets within the TRD sample. Predictors of cognitive impairment were also investigated. Results: TRD patients showed worse performance in tests assessing verbal memory, executive attentional shifting, and inhibitory control. The cluster analysis revealed two groups: a cognitively impaired (CI) group that showed a generalized deficit across cognitive domains, and a relatively cognitively intact group that performed better than CI in all domains except attentional shifting. A logistic binomial regression of the two groups revealed three significant contributing risk factors for CI: 1) older age, 2) lower premorbid IQ, and 3) benzodiazepine use. Cognitive impairment and benzodiazepine use were associated with worse functioning. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment is present in TRD and is associated with worse functioning. Age, lower premorbid IQ, and benzodiazepine use increased the likelihood of generalized cognitive impairment in TRD patients. The detrimental effect of benzodiazepine on cognitive impairment is independent of anxiety symptoms. Further research is needed to characterize the timeline of cognitive impairment in depression.

A mixed methods exploration of electrical stimulation in veterans with fibromyalgia symptoms &amp;amp; affective disorders,"Introduction: Past research has shown that electrical stimulation has modest beneficial effects on symptoms of fibromyalgia, which is also commonly associated with anxiety and depression. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness and utilization of electrical stimulation (AID or M units) at-home by Veterans. Methods: Sixty Veterans were identified using the Fibromyalgia Symptoms Questionnaire for an electrical stimulation trial during January 1-December 31, 2016 at a Midwestern VA Medical Center. Each patient completed a brief, semi-structured phone interview, which included an inquiry about the benefits of the units on affective symptoms. Results: Quantitative findings suggest that participants who were given any kind of unit (AID or M units) did not have a significant change in pain level from baseline to follow-up. Participants who were given any kind of unit (AID or M units) did not report a significant change in anxiety, depressive, or insomnia symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Qualitative findings produced three thematic maps: utilization, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Limitations: This study used a quasi-experimental, one group, pre-/post-test design, and explored the benefits of programming when based on patient self-selection. The instruments used in this study were self-report measures, and the lack of change may have been due to the use of binary versus continuous measures. The findings may differ among other Veterans as the current sample had a larger representation of minority groups compared to the typical Veteran profile. Conclusions: This information is invaluable in helping patients who suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms and affective disorders and for the providers aiding in their treatment.

"The effectiveness of repeated intravenous ketamine on depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and functional disability in adults with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence","Background: The effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) receiving care in real-word settings is insufficiently characterized. Herein, results from a naturalistic, retrospective study are presented from a Canadian outpatient IV ketamine clinic. Methods: Adults ( N = 213; M age = 45) with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, with a minimum of Stage 2 antidepressant resistance, received IV ketamine at a community-based multi-disciplinary clinic. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to post-infusion 4 on the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR16; n = 190). Secondary measures included QIDS-SR₁₆-measured response and remission rates, changes from baseline to endpoint in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7; n = 188) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; n = 168). Results: Significant improvement in total depressive symptoms severity ( p &lt; 0.0001) was observed after four infusions of IV ketamine 0.5–0.75 mg/kg. Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score change ≥ 50%) was 27% and remission (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score ≤ 5) rate was 13%. Patients receiving IV ketamine exhibited anxiolytic effects ( p &lt; 0.0001,), improved overall psychosocial function ( p &lt; 0.0001), and reduced suicidal ideation ( p &lt; 0.0001). Compared to the baseline infusion, dissociation severity significantly reduced in subsequent infusions. Limitations: This was a naturalistic, retrospective study, without a control group. Conclusions: IV ketamine was safe, well-tolerated, and effective at improving depressive, anxiety, and functional impairment symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of adults with TRD.

Sexual harassment exposure and impaired mental health in medical students. The MESSIAEN national study,"Background: A previous national study has suggested that around 20% of French working women reported sexual harassment (SH) at work but we lack of data in medical students of French hospitals to guide prevention programs. Objectives: To determine SH prevalence in a national sample of French medical students and to validate a theoretical model explaining SH causes and its impact of mental health. Methods: The study is a cross-sectional observational epidemiological national study. SH was defined according to the French legal definition. We further explored other discriminations and their potential association with impaired mental health in medical students. Mental health was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety &amp; Depression scale, psychotropic drug consumption and psychotherapy follow-up. A Structured Equation Modeling was carried out to confirm our theoretical model. Results: 2003 participants were recruited. SH was reported by 15.7% of the participants (19.8% of women and 5.2% of men). The SEM model showed good fit (RMSEA = 0.024, CFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.87, WRMR = 1.165). SH was associated with risk factors such as feminine gender and surgical and anesthesiology specialties. SH was also associated with exposure to discriminations based on the specialty choice and sexual orientation. SH was associated with impaired mental health. Conclusion: French medical student women reported similar rates of SH than other working women, suggesting that SH prevention programs are needed in French hospitals. Surgery and anesthesiology should be targeted in priority. The prevention programs should also target other discriminations and should be evaluated in terms of potential mental health improvement.

COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry,"Background: The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations: Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations: Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions: Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.

The biological underpinnings of perinatal depressive symptoms: A multi-systems approach,"Background: Well-established evidence exists of an association between depressive symptoms and alterations in the stress and inflammatory response systems; however, the picture is far less coherent during the perinatal period. This study combines the assessment of multiple stress and inflammatory biomarkers in late pregnancy and after delivery in order to investigate cross-sectional and prospective associations with perinatal depressive symptoms. Methods: One-hundred-ten healthy women were assessed in late pregnancy (mean gestational age = 34.76; SD = 1.12) and 89 were re-evaluated after delivery (mean hours after delivery = 52.36; SD = 19.70) for depressive and anxiety symptoms through the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and diurnal salivary cortisol levels were measured on both occasions, while diurnal salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels were assessed in late pregnancy. Results: Using Hierarchical Linear Models, higher depressive symptoms were found to be associated with higher IL-6 levels, lower morning cortisol levels and a flatter cortisol diurnal slope during pregnancy, while adjusting for potential confounders. No significant associations were found after delivery or with change in biomarker levels from pre- to post-partum. Furthermore, preliminary evidence of a positive association between inflammation and stress markers in women with higher antenatal depressive symptoms was found. Limitations: The sample was relatively small and highly selected, thus limiting generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Results emphasize the need for an integrated multi-systems approach to the understanding of the biological underpinnings of perinatal depression and suggest that the stress-immune interactions represent a promising avenue for future endeavor.

"The human gut microbiota and depression: Widely reviewed, yet poorly understood","Background: A large number of existing reviews have discussed the role of the gut microbiota in affective disorders, though syntheses have been overwhelmingly narrative in their focus. Method: In this correspondence, we compliment Sanada et al. (see record 2020-22174-002) on their recent systematic review of the gut microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the first to incorporate a meta-analysis. We also comment on how this synthesis should be extended in future research. Results: Sanada et al. (2020) conducted a meta-analysis of alpha diversity in participants with MDD compared to controls, whereby they unexpectedly observed no significant difference between groups. A meta-analysis was only able to be performed on alpha diversity indices. Future research should consider research quality, other forms of depression, incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses, where possible, as well as investigate associations between anxiety/depression symptom measures and the gut microbiota. Limitations: Further consideration of papers which incorporate functional analyses (e.g., metabolomics) is required to integrate this body of literature. Conclusions: Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression. We encourage further systematic reviews in this space, particularly which consider research quality and incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses.

Impacts of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; variants on large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults,"Background: FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) rs1360780 polymorphism has been identified as a molecular genetic marker associated with the dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The impact of FKBP5 rs1360780 on the large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults is still unknown. Methods: 479 healthy volunteers (age: 20-80years) completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments and blood analysis.All subjects were divided into CC, CT and TT genotypes. Within and between network connectivities (10 sub-networks) were calculated using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The genetic effects and gene-gender/age interaction on large-scale network connectivity were explored. Results: Compared with CC and CT groups, TT group showed increased intra-connectivity in default mode network (DMN) and increased inter-connectivity mainly distributed among the network of DMN, salience network (SAN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), subcortical network (SUB), and visual network (VIS). Gene-by-gender and gene-by-age interaction were found in inter-connectivity of DAN to VIS and DMN to FPN, respectively. The altered connectivities correlated with anxiety status test score. Limitations: Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cortisol were not measured,or else, we could estimate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity which may strengthen our results. Conclusions: FKBP5 rs1360780 modulates the large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults. TT carriers showed the increased intra- and inter-connectivities mainly distributed among the network of DMN, SAN, DAN, VAN, SUB and VIS.

"Self-esteem, symptom severity, and treatment response in adolescents with internalizing problems","Background: Adolescents with low self-esteem often experience internalizing psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, depression). Self-esteem may therefore be a clinically relevant construct for assessment and treatment outcomes. We examined whether general and domain-specific (family, peer, academic) self-esteem are related to adolescents’ internalizing symptom severity and response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Method: Participants were 89 adolescents ages 14 to 18 years ( M = 16.3, 70% females) from an outpatient clinic who were referred for CBT. Adolescents completed measures of self-esteem at baseline and measures of internalizing symptoms at baseline and at the end of a manualized group CBT intervention. Results: Lower peer and family self-esteem, but not academic self-esteem, were associated with more internalizing symptoms at baseline, after controlling for general self-esteem. However, only higher general self-esteem, and not any of the specific self-esteem domains, predicted lower internalizing symptoms at posttreatment. Follow-up analyses revealed differential associations between family and peer self-esteem domains and anxious and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Only self-report measures were used. The relatively small sample size may have limited power to detect small effects. Conclusions: Self-esteem in domains regarding family and peer relationships may be important in the evaluation of adolescents with internalizing problems. Adolescents with low general self-esteem may benefit less from CBT than other adolescents. Addressing negative self-perceptions may be necessary to reduce internalizing symptoms for adolescents with low self-esteem.

Depression with and without a history of psychotic symptoms in the general population: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics,"Background: : The aim of this study was to find the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of major depressive episode (MDE) with (MDE-HPS +) and without a history of psychotic symptoms (MDE-HPS) in the general population. Methods: : The Mental Health in the General Population survey interviewed 38,694 individuals in France by using the MINI. The prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of MDE-HPS + were assessed. Results: : Of the sample, 11.2% were diagnosed with current MDE and among them, 39.3% presented a history of at least one psychotic symptom (hallucination or delusion). Patients with MDE-HPS + were younger with more severe social impairment than those with MDE-HPS-. We also found a higher proportion of three generations of migrants in the MDE-HPS+ group. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as a history of a manic episode, alcohol use disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and a personal history of a suicide attempt were more frequent in patients with MDE-HPS+ than in those with MDE-HPS-. Finally, we found a specific gradient of severity for psychiatric comorbid disorders depending on the number of psychotic symptoms lifetime in MDE. Limitations: : The study also has an observational cross-sectional design that does not permit causal inferences, and it is difficult to eliminate recall bias and reporting errors. Conclusion: : In the general population, patients with MDE-HPS +, when compared to MDE-HPS-, presented with a more severe clinical profile, with increased rates of psychiatric comorbidities, particularly a history of bipolar disorder and a history of a suicide attempt.

"Mental disorders in Spanish university students: Prevalence, age-of-onset, severe role impairment and mental health treatment","Background: The university period carries risk for onset of common mental disorders. Epidemiological knowledge on mental disorders among Spanish university students is limited. Aims: To estimate lifetime and 12-month prevalence, persistence and age-of-onset of mental disorders among Spanish first-year university students, as well as associated role impairment and mental health treatment use. Methods: First-year university students (N = 2,118; 55.4% female; mean age = 18.8 years) from five Spanish universities completed a web-based survey, screening possible DSM–IV mental disorders (major depressive episode(MDE), mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder(GAD), panic disorder(PD), alcohol abuse/dependence(AUD), drug abuse/dependence(DUD), and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD)). Role impairment and treatment associated with mental disorders were assessed. Results: Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of any possible mental disorder was 41.3%(SE = 1.08) and 35.7%(SE = 1.05), respectively. Persistence (i.e., ratio of 12-month to lifetime prevalence) was 86.4%(SE = 1.58). Median age-of-onset was 14 for adult ADHD, 15 for mood disorders and AUD, and 16 for anxiety disorders and DUD. One third (29.2%) of 12-month disorders were associated with role impairment. Twelve-month PD (OR = 4.0;95%CI = 1.9-8.5) had the highest odds for role impairment. Only 12.6% of students with 12-month disorder received any mental health treatment. Twelve-month treatment was the highest among those students with 12-month GAD (OR = 7.4;95%CI = 3.7-14.8). Limitations: The assessment of mental disorders was based on self-reports. Cross-sectional nature of the data prevents causal associations. Conclusion: One third of Spanish university students report a common mental disorder in the past year, and one third of those report severe role impairment. Only one out of eight students with 12-month mental disorders receives mental health treatment.

Efficacy of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy in mood disorders: A critical review,"Background: Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) is an intervention introduced by Davanloo in order to treat anxiety, mood and somatic symptom, and personality disorders. It is a brief intervention aiming to identify and process painful or forbidden emotions and consequently to override symptoms and self-destructive tendencies. In this review we examine the efficacy of ISTDP on symptoms in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). Methods: A thorough search of articles in Pubmed, PsycINFO, Isi Web of Knowledge was carried out in order to obtain available studies of ISTDP for BD and MDD. We included all studies conducted on patients with a diagnosis of MDD or BD and who received ISTDP. Results: Eight studies were included. These were two randomized controlled trials and six observational studies. Overall the results of the included manuscripts suggest a positive effect of ISTDP on depressive symptoms for patients affected by mood disorders. Furthermore, they suggest ISTDP may be cost-effective through reducing doctor visits and hospitalizations in follow-up. Limitations: Most studies had small samples and consisted of non-randomized trials. Conclusions: These are preliminary positive results on the effectiveness of this approach for the treatment of depressive symptoms. They have to be confirmed by studies with larger sample sizes and by comparing this technique with other psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.

The role of alexithymia in social cognition: Evidence from a non-clinical population,"Background: Alexithymia is a personality construct characterised by difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions. We investigated whether people with alexithymia, who struggle with emotion-processing abilities, have diminished emotion-related social cognitive competencies, where social cognition encompasses the set of abilities that allows one to navigate one's social environment. Methods: We assessed alexithymia and four components of social cognition: recognition of others’ emotions, representation of others’ affective and cognitive mental states, empathy, and regulation of one's own feelings. We investigated whether alexithymia could significantly predict each of these components, beyond the effect of other individual difference variables (i.e., anxiety/depressive symptoms), which have been previously associated with both social cognition and alexithymia. Two hundred six participants were recruited. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed to assess the possible relationships between alexithymia and social cognition skills. Results: Alexithymia significantly predicted emotion recognition, empathy, and emotional regulation, even after controlling for the effect of potentially competing factors (i.e., anxiety/depressive symptoms). Alexithymia did not predict representation of others’ affective and cognitive mental states. Limitations: The present study adopted a cross-sectional design, which does not permit us to draw firm conclusions about the causality of the emergent relationships. Conclusions: These data provide support for the argument that recognising others’ emotions and feelings relies on the ability to identify correctly one's own feelings. Our results also indicate the importance of taking into consideration individual differences in levels of alexithymia when investigating social cognition in non-clinical populations, as alexithymia appears to be clearly related to social cognitive functioning.

Predicting second-generation antidepressant effectiveness in treating sadness using demographic and clinical information: A machine learning approach,"Introduction: Current guidelines for choosing antidepressant medications involve a trial-and-error process. Most patients try multiple antidepressants before finding an effective antidepressant. This study uses demographic and clinical information to create models predicting effectiveness of different antidepressants in treating sadness in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods: A secondary analysis of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey (CPES) was performed. Participants with or without a mental health diagnosis who reported sadness as a symptom, and were taking fluoxetine (n=156), sertraline (n=224), citalopram (n=91), paroxetine (n=156), venlafaxine (n=69), bupropion (n=92), or trazadone (n=26) within the past year were included. Two sets of principal component analyses (PCAs) and logistic regressions were performed: one determined associations between symptom clusters and antidepressant effectiveness for sadness, and the other created models to predict effectiveness. Both PCAs controlled for psychiatric and medical diagnoses, substance use, psychiatric medications, alternative treatments, and demographics. Results: Anxiety was associated with ineffectiveness of fluoxetine in treating sadness. Low mood scores were associated with ineffectiveness of paroxetine and venlafaxine, and fatigue was associated with ineffectiveness of sertraline. The models for predicting drug effectiveness had a mean accuracy of 83% and internal validity of 72%. Limitations: CPES data were collected from 2001-2003, so newer drugs were not included. Effectiveness was for sadness, so results are not directly comparable to studies using overall depressive symptom reductions as outcomes. Conclusion: Since fewer than 50% of patients currently respond to their first antidepressant, this model could provide modest improvement to choosing starting antidepressants in treating sadness.

Prevalence and psychiatric correlates of suicidal ideation in UK university students,"Background: Evidence highlights increased susceptibility to thoughts and behaviors related to suicide (i.e. suicidal ideation) in the student population, often in co-occurrence with mental health difficulties. Typically, studies focus on specific symptoms, with few providing comprehensive examination of risk factors. In this study we examined the prevalence of suicidal ideation among UK university students and assessed the association with multiple psychiatric risk factors. Methods: A total of N = 1273 students completed online measures of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, insomnia, mania, psychosis, and perceived stress. Results: 37.3% students were classified as high-risk for suicidal behaviour. Moreover, 42.2% of students contemplated suicide at least once within the past twelve months, and 25.1% reported telling someone about these thoughts at least once. Logistic regression analysis showed that suicidal ideation was significantly associated with symptoms of depression, mania, psychosis, and stress. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of ours study does not allow us to infer causality in the observed associations. Conclusions: Our results indicate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in a large sample of university students in the UK, and highlight associated mental health risk factors associated with it. Our findings have implications for mental health practitioners working with University students.

Prevalence of and recovery from common mental disorder including psychotic experiences in the UK Primary Care Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme,"Background: Psychotic experiences (PE) may co-occur with common mental disorders (CMD), such as depression and anxiety. However, we know very little about the prevalence of and recovery from PE in primary mental health care settings, such as the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in the UK National Health Service (NHS), where most CMD are treated. Methods: We used the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences—Positive 15-item Scale (CAPE-P15) to determine the prevalence of PE in patients receiving treatment from IAPT services. Patient-reported measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) are routinely collected and establish recovery in IAPT services. We studied recovery rates according to the absence and presence of PE. Multi-group growth models estimated improvement trajectories for each group. Results: A total of 2,042 patients with CMD completed the CAPE-P15. The mean age was 39.8. The overall prevalence of PE was 29.68%. The recovery rate was 27.43% compared to 62.08% for those without PE. Although patients with or without PE shared similar improvement trajectories, the initial severity of patients with PE impeded their likelihood of recovery. Limitations: We mirrored routine data collection in IAPT services, including self-report questionnaires that may affect valid reporting of symptoms. Missing data in the calculation of improvement trajectories may reduce generalisability. Conclusions: At least one in four patients receiving treatment from IAPT services in primary care experience CMD and PE. This significant group of people experience a lower recovery rate, with adverse implications not only for them but also for efficiency of services.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are related to reduced awareness of emotional valence,"Background: The Seeking Proxies for Internal States (SPIS) model of OCD asserts that obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies are associated with attenuated access to internal states. Here we explore the implications of this model for awareness of emotional valence. Methods: In Study 1, participants with high and low OC tendencies ( n = 30 in each group) rated how they felt while viewing different pictures with positive, neutral, or negative valence taken from the International Affective Picture System. Study 2 replicated Study 1 among non-selected participants ( n = 99) that rated positive and negative pictures chosen from the recently developed Basic-Emotions Nencki Affective Picture System. In both studies, mean deviation from norm ratings (of each picture system) served as the primary outcome measure. Results: Study 1 showed that high OC participants’ mean deviation score was significantly higher, compared with low OC participants, across positive, neutral, and negative pictures ( p = .01). Follow-up analyses revealed that while no group difference emerged for mean valence rating ( p = .16), groups differed on the mean standard deviation of ratings within each valence category ( p = .002). In Study 2, only OC tendencies, not depressive or anxiety symptoms, were positively correlated with mean deviation from norm ratings ( p = .026). Dividing the sample to high and low OC groups based on an OC cutoff score yielded similar group differences to those observed in Study 1 ( p &lt; .001). Limitations: Analog samples and a relative small sample size (Study 1). Conclusions: This study suggests that OC symptoms are associated with reduced awareness of emotional valence, possibly emanating from a noisier emotional perception.

Psychometric properties of the child and adolescent perfectionism scale in ecuadorian adolescents,"Background: This study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) in Ecuadorian adolescent population. Methods: The study involved 1,562 students aged 12 to 18 ( M age = 14.83, SD = 1.86) from Quito (Ecuador). Data analysis included Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with Satorra-Bentler scaled χ², Cronbach's alpha coefficients, Pearson's correlations, and Multigroup CFA to test factorial invariance across sex and age (configural, measurement and structural). Latent means differences were also examined across sex and age groups. Results: Results confirmed the structure of Spanish version of the CAPS with 13 items divided into three factors, Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (SPP), Self-Oriented Perfectionism-Critical (SOP-C) and Self-Oriented-Striving (SOP-S). Additionally, this model remained invariant across sex and age. Significant and positive correlations were obtained between SPP, SOP-C and the three measures of psychological distress (Anxiety, Depression and Stress), whereas SOP-S showed a more adaptive pattern of association. Acceptable reliability values were obtained and latent mean differences across sex and age groups were mainly observed in the SOP-S factor. Concretely, males reported significantly higher latent mean scores than females in SOP-S as well as students aged from 14 to 18 years old in comparison with their younger peers (12- and 13-year olds). Conclusions: The Spanish version of the CAPS has satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of validity and reliability remaining invariant across sex and age in Ecuadorian adolescents.

Euthymic bipolar disorder patients and EEG microstates: A neural signature of their abnormal self experience?,"Background: A growing number of neuroimaging studies have revealed spatial abnormalities of resting-state functional brain network activity in bipolar disorder (BD). Conversely, abnormalities of resting state temporal dynamics have been scarcely investigated so far. The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG microstates activity in BD patients with a history of manic predominant polarity. Patients were euthymic and pharmacologically stabilized. Methods: Nineteen BD patients (mean age 34.4 ± 11.0, 7 female) and 19 healthy controls (HC; mean age 38.2 ± 9.9, 7 female) were recruited. The psychometric evaluation included the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Two runs of 2 minutes of EEG activity by a 128-channel system were acquired at rest and analyzed through microstate analysis. Results: We found a reduced presence of microstate B in BD patients compared to HC, since BD patients have a tendency to transit from the microstate B to the microstates C and D significantly more than HC. Furthermore, microstate B features were correlated with DES, state STAI and trait STAI scores. Conclusion: The reduced presence of microstate B might be associated with episodic autobiographic memory deficit, exaggerated self-focusing and states of dissociations characteristic of BD. Strong correlations of microstate B metrics and dynamics with symptoms of dissociation and anxiety across the two groups supported this interpretation.

The rs6311 of serotonin receptor 2A ( &lt;i&gt;5-HT2A&lt;/i&gt;) gene is associated with alexithymia and mental health,"Backgrounds: Alexithymia, difficulties in identifying and describing one's own feelings, is related to substantial clinical practice. Inspired by the links between serotonin functions and affective disorders, this study investigated associations of the serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2A) gene with alexithymia and mental health. Methods: We differentiated subjects according to two functional polymorphisms (i.e., rs6311 and rs6313) of 5-HT2A gene and scored alexithymia and mental health of college students with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), respectively. Results: The analyses basing on sample 1 ( N = 566) and sample 2 ( N = 602) indicated that the G allele of rs6311 was related to higher score on the TAS-20 as compared to the AA genotype. The analysis with 467 individuals from sample 2 indicated that the rs6311 was associated with mental health, and this association was mediated by alexithymia. Limitations: The potential confounding variables such as depression and anxiety were neglected in the analyses. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the contribution of the 5-HT2A to alexithymia, and highlight the link between alexithymia and mental health at genetic level.

EZH2 is involved in vulnerability to neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress in different aged mice,"Background: Microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression is closely related to pathogenesis of depression. Aging is a known risk factor for neuroinflammation in the central nervous system and subsequent behavioral impairment. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a methyltransferase of histone H3 lysine 27 which regulates microglial activation, plays a crucial role in proinflammatory cytokines expression. However, whether the EZH2 is involved in susceptibility to depression in different ages remains elusive. Methods: Young and aged C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress for three weeks. Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, spatial memory impairment, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, P-p65, EZH2, H3K27me3 and SOCS3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were measured using an established behavioral battery, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. Moreover, EPZ-6438, an inhibitor of EZH2, was utilized to detect the role of EZH2 in neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities. Results: CUMS induced depression-like behaviors and spatial memory impairment, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and P-p65, enhanced M1 microglia activation, and increased levels of EZH2, H3K27me3 and SOCS3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in young and aged mice. Both unstressed and stressed aged mice displayed attention-deficit behavioral outcomes, alteration of protein levels compared with young mice. However, inhibition of EZH2 could relieve most of behavioral and molecular alterations. Limitations: A relative small sample size is a limitation. Conclusions: EZH2 might be involved in susceptibility to neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors in different aged mice.

Naturalistic follow-up in bipolar patients after successful electroconvulsive therapy,"Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for acute depression, mania and mixed states. We evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with bipolar depression or mixed state, responsive to ECT. Methods: this observational follow-up study was conducted in 70 patients with Bipolar Disorder: 36 patients met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) and 34 for a mixed episode (MXE). During the follow-up after ECT, the relapse rates and the duration of response and remission periods were recorded. Results: the mean duration of the follow-up was 57 weeks. 93% of the patients maintained at least a partial therapeutic response for more than 90% of the follow-up period. 73% of patients fulfilled the criteria for a full remission, 33% showed a depressive relapse and 10% a mixed relapse. No manic relapses occurred but almost 1/3 of the sample presented hypomanic episodes. MDE patients presented higher rates of remission compared to MXE ones. Patients with anxiety disorders reported earlier relapses than those without this comorbidity. Relapsed-patients showed higher functional impairment at baseline evaluation, compared to non-relapsed ones. Limitations: nonrandom allocation, limited sample size, possible influence of psychopharmacological treatment. Conclusions: Given several methodological limitations, this study cannot draw definite conclusions but could suggest that in treatment-resistant bipolar patients with severe depression or mixed state, ECT may represent a useful treatment option. Patients with mixed features, comorbid anxiety disorders and higher functional impairment present less favorable outcome. Future research on long-term efficacy of ECT and on clinical predictors of relapse is needed.

Prospective associations between hsCRP and GlycA inflammatory biomarkers and depression: The Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil),"Background: Although low-grade inflammation is associated with onset and persistence of depression, most biomarkers display modest predictive effects. GlycA (glycoprotein acetylation) is a unique metabolomic composite of pro-inflammatory acute-phase glycoproteins. We hypothesized that GlycA levels would predict depression incidence, remission and persistence, with higher accuracy than high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also explored the additive predictive value of GlycA above and beyond hsCRP. Methods: Cohort design using the sample of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)'s São Paulo site. Baseline GlycA and hsCRP levels were measured in blood plasma. Depression incidence, remission, and persistence were assessed using the Clinical Interview Scheduled Revised (CIS-R) at two time points separated by a mean of 3.8 years. Multivariable Poisson, logistic and linear regression models were used for prediction. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical confounders, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, cardiovascular assessments, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory drug use, anxiety disorders, alcohol use, and body mass index. Results: We included 4,364 participants (53.2% females, mean age 51.4 ± 8.9 years) with no autoimmune disorders. GlycA robustly predicted depression persistence (relative risk of 7.28, 95% confidence interval 1.33–45.57, p = 0.023 in the fully-adjusted model), but not depression onset. Although hsCRP also predicted depression persistence, its effects were fully explained by confounders and by GlycA levels. GlycA also predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in depressed patients and depression persistence vs. remission in fully-adjusted models. Limitations: Brief depressive episodes could not be measured by our assessments. Conclusions: GlycA might be a new inflammatory prognosis biomarker for depression.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms as prognostic makers for the elderly with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis,"Background: Although several neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) have been demonstrated to have value in the prediction of the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, these symptoms are less studied for the prediction of the transition from normal cognition (NC) to MCI. Methods: Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported on at least one NPS at baseline and had MCI as the outcome. Results: We obtained 13 cohort studies with a total population of 33,066. Depression was the most common neuropsychiatric symptom and could significantly predict transition to MCI (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13–1.86). However, depression was more capable of predicting amnestic MCI (RR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.04-1.83) than non-aMCI (RR= 0.96, 95% CI 95% CI: 0.60-1.33). Subgroup analysis suggested that the association between depression and MCI changed with depression severity, depression criteria, apolipoprotein-E-adjusted status, age, the percentage of females, and follow-up times, but some data were too sparse for a reliable estimate. Regarding other NPSs, there were insufficient data to assess their effect on the development of MCI. However, apathy, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and agitation might be risk factors for the prediction of NC-MCI transition with strong predictive value. Conclusions: Depression was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold sincreased risk of the progression to MCI in the population with normal cognition. Other NPSs with underlying predictive value deserve more attention.

Suicidal risks in 12 DSM-5 psychiatric disorders,"Objective: As modern studies evaluating suicidal behaviors in large samples of major psychiatric disorder patients are rare, we compared suicidal risks associated with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: We quantified rates of intake suicidal ideation and lifetime attempts, suicides, and violent acts (attempts + suicides) in 6050 adult patients in a European psychiatric center, diagnosed with 12 prevalent, DSM-5 psychiatric disorders. Results: Ideation ranged from 53.9% of subjects with bipolar disorder (BD) with mixed features, to 8.70% in anxiety disorders. Subjects making at least one suicide attempt were most prevalent in BD with mixed or psychotic features. Suicide rates ranked: substance abuse&gt;BD with psychotic features &gt; psychotic disorders ≥ BDI &gt; major depressive disorder (MDD). Suicidal intensity (acts/100 PEY) was highest with BD, psychotic disorders, and MDD; lethality (lower attempt/suicide ratio) was greatest with substance abuse, psychotic disorders, and BD with psychotic features. Rates of suicidal acts in BD vs. MDD were similarly high among ever-hospitalized subjects but much lower in never-hospitalized MDD subjects. Women had higher overall risks of ideation and attempt s, but violent acts and suicide were more likely among men, whereas SMR for suicide was greater among women, presumably reflecting very low risks among women in the regional general population. Conclusions: Suicidal risks were particularly high in BD with psychotic or mixed features as well as with substance abuse and in severe MDD with hospitalization.

Prevalence and related factors of suicide attempts in first-episode and untreated Chinese Han outpatients with psychotic major depression,"Background: Major depressive depression (MDD) is often accompanied by suicidal behavior. Increasing evidence shows that MDD patients display psychotic symptoms. However, the relationship between psychotic symptoms and suicide attempt in MDD has not been reported. Therefore, this study was to identify the prevalence and associated factors of suicide attempts in first-episode and untreated Chinese Han outpatients comorbid with psychotic major depression (PMD). Methods: 1718 first-episode and untreated MDD outpatients were assessed with Positive Symptom Scale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and clinical global impression of severity scale (CGI-S). Some glycolipid metabolism and thyroid hormone parameters were measured. Results: In MDD patients, the percentage of PMD was 10.0%. The incidence of attempted suicide in PMD patients was 51.5%, which was more than 3 times higher than that in non-PMD patients (16.7%). In PMD patients, compared to non-attempters, suicide attempters were older, had a longer course of disease, scored higher on all scales, as well as had higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidases antibody, anti-thyroglobulin and blood glucose. PANSS positive symptom, CGI, diastolic blood pressure and TSH were independently associated with suicide attempts of PMD. Conclusions: PMD patients have a higher prevalence of suicide attempt than non-PMD patients. Some demographic and clinical parameters are relevant factors for suicide attempt in PMD patients.

Thoughts of self-harm and associated risk factors among postpartum women in Canada,"Background: The prevalence of thoughts of self-harm during the postpartum period is not well documented in Canada. To estimate the prevalence of thoughts of self-harm among postpartum women in Canada, this study explored prevalence by socio-demographic characteristics and examined the associations between thoughts of self-harm and aspects of maternal mental health. Methods: This study used data from the 2018/2019 Survey on Maternal Health which surveyed women living in the 10 provinces anywhere between 6–13 months postpartum. Participants were asked to report experiencing thoughts of self-harm, rate their mental health, and participate in the abbreviated Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations. Results: Of the 6,558 respondents who agreed to share their data, 10.4% reported thoughts of self-harm since the birth of their child. Of these women, 37.0% reported low mental health, 54.2% had moderate levels of symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) and 37.1% had symptoms of GAD. Women who experienced low mental health, moderate levels of symptoms of PPD and/or GAD were more likely to report thoughts of self-harm. Limitations: As thoughts of self-harm and aspects of mental health are self-reported, there is the potential for social desirability bias and underreporting. The cross-sectional survey design did not allow the reporting of thoughts of self-harm at different time points. Discussion: The high proportion of postpartum women in Canada reporting thoughts of self-harm and strong associations with aspects of maternal mental health highlight the need for effective supports during postpartum.

Risk of bipolar disorder in patients with endometriosis: A nationwide population-based cohort study,"Background: Women with endometriosis (EM) have increased vulnerability to certain psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, as well as bipolar disorder (BD). This study investigates the risk of BD development in EM patients. Also, the impact of EM treatment on the risk of developing BD is examined. Methods: A total of 17,832 EM patients and 17,832 non-EM controls matched by age, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were included between 2000–2012 and followed to the end of 2013. Participants newly diagnosed as BD by board-certified psychiatrist were defined as incidents. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the BD incidence rate between two studied groups. Results: EM patients were associated with an increased risk of BD development compared with non-EM controls after adjusting for age, CCI score, and different treatment options (1.04 versus 0.56 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.75–3.12). Also, there was no significant difference in the risk estimate between different hormonal or surgical treatment groups, suggesting a limited impact of EM treatment on the risk of BD development. Limitations: This study deals with the duration of hormonal treatment, whether operated or not, which reduces the chances of showing the effect of individual EM treatment on the risk of BD development. Conclusion: This study shows that EM patients are associated with an increased risk of BD development. Further studies would be needed to elucidate the mechanism linking the EM and BD.

Risky cyber behaviors in adolescents with depression: A case control study,"Objective: This study aimed to compare adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy adolescents with regard to cyberbullying, cyber victimization, internet addiction, and digital game addiction. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in Selçuk University Hospital. The study sample consisted of 34 adolescents with MDD and 39 controls without any psychopathology. A socio-demographic data form, the Cyber bullying Scale (CBS), Cyber Victimization Scale (CVS), Cyber bullying Sensibility Scale (CBSS), Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), Digital Game Dependence Scale (DGA-7), and Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale-Refurbished (RCADS) were administered to all participants. Results: CBS, CVS, IAS and DGAS-7 scores of the MDD group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The significant differences persisted even after controlling for confounding factors such as age, gender, socio-economic level, and parental educational levels with MANCOVA. A strong positive correlation existed between CBS and CVS scores, and higher IAS scores were associated with higher CBS scores in the MDD group. CBSS scores negatively correlated with DGAS-7 scores in the MDD group. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, conclusions about causality remain speculative. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the importance of assessing problems related to the online environment in the presence of depression in adolescents. Our results suggested that evaluating the use of technology with a view to the potential for cyber bullying and cyber victimization as well as internet addiction and addiction to digital games may be necessary as a holistic approach in the follow-up of adolescent depression.

Progesterone levels predict reductions in behavioral avoidance following cognitive restructuring in women with spider phobia,"Background: Ovarian hormones have been implicated as a potential source of variability in the effectiveness of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders in women. Additionally, preclinical studies in healthy women indicate that ovarian hormones are related to cognitive modes of emotion regulation, like cognitive restructuring. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a relationship exists between endogenous ovarian hormones and the outcomes of cognitive restructuring in clinically anxious women. Methods: Ninety women with spider phobia received training in cognitive restructuring or a control task and provided a blood sample for the measurement of serum estradiol and progesterone levels. Behavioral avoidance, using a behavioral approach task with a live spider, and self-reported fear of spiders were measured at baseline and 1-week post-treatment. Results: The results indicated that heightened levels of progesterone, but not estradiol, at the time of cognitive restructuring predicted greater post-treatment reductions in behavioral avoidance, but not self-reported fear, amongst women who received cognitive restructuring but not those in the control group. Limitations: As menstrual cycle phase was not assessed; the present study provides information regarding how the benefits of cognitive therapy are predicted by between-person individual differences in absolute hormone levels, but does not examine the relationship between within-person fluctuations in hormone levels and outcomes. Conclusions: These results suggest the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders in women may differ depending on endogenous levels of progesterone, and raise the possibility that progesterone could be a useful pharmacological adjunct to cognitive therapy.

Associations of plasma androgens with suicidality among men and women: A 9-year longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Testosterone has been implicated in suicidality in cross-sectional studies. Stress that coincides with a suicide attempt may alter androgen levels, so prospective studies are needed to exclude reverse causation. We aimed to examine the associations of plasma androgens with concurrent and future suicidality, and if present, whether these associations were mediated by a behavioral trait like reactive aggression. Methods: Baseline plasma levels of total testosterone, 5α−dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione were determined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate with a radioimmunoassay. Suicidality was assessed using the Suicidal Ideation Scale at baseline and after 2-, 4-, 6-, and 9-year follow-up. Men and women were analyzed separately, and potential confounders were considered. Results: Participants ( N = 2861; 66.3% women) had a mean age of 42.0 years (range 18–65) and almost half (46.9%) fulfilled criteria for a major depressive or anxiety disorder. At baseline 13.2% of men and 11.2% of women reported current suicidal ideation. In participants who were non-suicidal at baseline, slightly more men than women reported suicidal ideation during follow-up (14.7% vs. 12.5%), whereas the reverse pattern was observed for suicide attempts (3.6% vs. 4.2%). None of the associations between androgens and current and future suicidality were significant. Limitations: Androgens were determined once, which may have been insufficient to predict suicidality over longer periods. Discussion: The lack of associations between plasma levels of androgens determined by ‘gold-standard’ laboratory methods with suicidality do not support previous cross-sectional and smaller studies in adult men and women with values within the physiological range.

"The uterine-chemokine-brain axis: Menstrual cycle-associated symptoms (MCAS) are in part mediated by CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8 and CXCL10","Objective: To examine associations between chemokines and menstrual cycle associated symptoms (MCAS). Methods: Forty-one women completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) rating scale during 28 consecutive days of the menstrual cycle. MCAS is diagnosed when the total daily DRSP score during the menstrual cycle is &gt; 0.666 percentile. We assayed plasma CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8, CXCL10, EGF, IGF-1, and PAI-1 at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle. Results: CCL2, CCL5, CCL11 and EGF are significantly higher in women with MCAS than in those without. Increased CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL8, CCL11 and CCL5 levels are significantly associated with DRSP scores while CCL2 is the most significant predictor explaining 39.6% of the variance. The sum of the neurotoxic chemokines CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 is significantly associated with the DRSP score and depression, physiosomatic, breast-craving and anxiety symptoms. The impact of chemokines on MCAS symptoms differ between consecutive weeks of the menstrual cycle with CCL2 being the most important predictor of increased DRSP levels during the first two weeks, and CXCL10 or a combination of CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 being the best predictors during week 3 and 4, respectively. Discussion: The novel case definition “MCAS” is externally validated by increased levels of uterus-associated chemokines and EGF. Those chemokines are involved in MCAS and are regulated by sex hormones and modulate endometrium functions and brain neuro-immune responses, which may underpin MCAS symptoms. As such, uterine-related chemokines may link the uterus with brain functions via a putative uterine-chemokine-brain axis.

Mental health of electronic cigarette advocates: Over both sides of the Atlantic,"Comments on an article by Tram Pham et al. (see record 2019-64167-083). Pham et al. must be commended for showing e-cigarette use is associated with adverse mental health status, particularly among the non-smoking general population and women. However, the concern about mental health could have been deeper. First, there is robust evidence that cigarette smoking are likely to be a causal risk factor for severe mental illness, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder. Accordingly, why Pham and colleagues where the first to be concerned by harmful mental health consequences of e-cigarette users? Indeed, the epidemic began in the late 2000s. Second, their findings must be added to a too long list of accumulating evidence of devastating harms of e-cigarette. Not to account the recent epidemic of vape-related lung illnesses in the US which have led to tens of deaths, the toxicity of vaping by-products cannot be denied.

Remission and recurrence in bipolar disorder: The data from Health Outcomes and Patient Evaluations in Bipolar Disorder (HOPE-BD) study,"Background: The HOPE-BD was a naturalistic study established to follow individuals in Canada seeking treatment for bipolar disorder (BD). The study aimed to examine the course of BD and describe how clinical and sociodemographic factors are associated with outcomes. Methods: Individuals with BD had their clinical data recorded at enrolment and were naturalistically treated. Participant were followed for up to four years, and visits occurred at least once every three months. We investigated the longitudinal outcomes with logistic, Cox, and quantile regressions. Results: Among the 354 participants, 57.3% had BD type I. Depression as first episode, younger ages at onset and older ages of the first professional help predicted longer delays in correct diagnosis. Among the symptomatic patients at baseline, the median time to remission was 10.9 months. Comorbid alcohol use disorder and the severity of baseline depressive symptoms predicted longer times to remission. Among the euthymic participants, the median time to recurrence was 14.5 months. History of anxiety disorder and younger ages at onset predicted shorter times to recurrence. Baseline depression scores predicted recurrence in euthymic patients. Limitations: We did not investigate the predictors of each polarity. Our findings may not apply to individuals followed in non-specialised outpatient services. Conclusion: Our study reinforces the necessity of early diagnosis and interventions, as well as the importance of treating depressive symptoms and comorbidities.

Sex differences in psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Sex differences between psychotic depression (PD) and non-psychotic depression (NPD) have received little systematic study. This study was conducted to investigate sex difference in patients with psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1718 first-episode and drug-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder were recruited. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. All subjects were rated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: The prevalence of PD in female patients (10.97%) was higher than that in male patients (7.99%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that female patients were older compared with male patients in NPD group, but there were no significant differences in demographic and clinical variables between female and male PD patients. Further, there were no sex differences in the scores of HAMD, HAMA and positive symptom subscale of PANSS in both PD and NPD groups. Two-way ANOVA showed that PD patients had significantly higher scores on the HAMD, HAMA and positive symptom subscale of PANSS than non-PD patients. However, there were no significant effects of sex and sex* subtypes. Limitations: The main limitations are cross-sectional design and inability to control selection bias. Conclusions: Our findings show significant differences in clinical profiles between PD and NPD patients; however, no sex difference has been observed in the either PD or NPD patients.

Personalized prediction of depression in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Depressive disturbances in Parkinson's disease (dPD) have been identified as the most important determinant of quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Prediction models to triage patients at risk of depression early in the disease course are needed for prognosis and stratification of participants in clinical trials. Methods: One machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the logistic regression technique were applied for the prediction of clinically significant depression (defined as The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS-15] ≥ 5) using a prospective cohort study of 312 drug-naïve patients with newly diagnosed PD during 2-year follow-up from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Established models were assessed with out-of-sample validation and the whole sample was divided into training and testing samples by the ratio of 7:3. Results: Both XGBoost model and logistic regression model achieved good discrimination and calibration. 2 PD-specific factors (age at onset, duration) and 4 nonspecific factors (baseline GDS-15 score, State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] score, Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire [RBDSQ] score, and history of depression) were identified as important predictors by two models. Limitations: Access to several variables was limited by database. Conclusions: In this longitudinal study, we developed promising tools to provide personalized estimates of depression in early PD and studied the relative contribution of PD-specific and nonspecific predictors, constituting a substantial addition to the current understanding of dPD.

"The mediating effect of psychological distress on cognitive function and physical frailty among the elderly: Evidence from rural Shandong, China","Background: Few studies have explored the underlying mechanism between physical frailty and cognitive function. The aim of this study is to explore the mediating role of psychological distress (PD) for the association between cognitive function and physical frailty among the elderly in rural China. Methods: A total of 3,242 rural older adults were included in the analysis. Logistic regression and Bootstrap analyses were employed to explore the association between cognitive function, PD and frailty, and the mediating role of PD. Results: This study found that the prevalence of frailty and cognitive impairment among the elderly in rural China was 18.0%, 22.4%. After adjusted for controlling variables, cognitive function was significantly associated with high level of PD, and elderly with higher level of PD had a higher probability of suffering from frailty. PD played a partially mediating effect in cognitive function and frailty and the mediating effect of PD can explain the 11.0% of the total effect of cognitive function on frailty. Limitations: The data were cross-sectional, thus the causal relationship between variables could not be determined. The main variables in this study were measured by self-report information, which might result in recall bias. Conclusions: This study provide evidence that the effect of cognitive function on physical frailty was partially mediated by PD among the elderly in rural China. Primary health care should strengthen the screening of PD characterized by depression and anxiety, and strive to improve the physical and psychological well-being of rural elderly in China.

Psychiatric comorbidities in bipolar disorders: An examination of the prevalence and chronology of onset according to sex and bipolar subtype,"Objectives: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. However, few studies systematically examine which disorders are more likely to occur pre- or post-BD onset. We examine the prevalence and Age At Onset (AAO) of psychiatric conditions in adults with BD. Methods: A structured clinical interview was used to assess lifetime history and AAO of alcohol and cannabis misuse, suicide attempts, anxiety and eating disorders in a French sample of euthymic patients with BD ( n = 739). Regression analyses were used to test for statistically significant associations between rates and AAO of comorbidities in BD groups stratified by sex or subtype. Results: Prevalence of alcohol and cannabis misuse was associated with male sex and BD-I subtype; whilst most anxiety and eating disorders were associated with female sex. The AAO of most comorbid conditions preceded that of BD, except for panic disorder, agoraphobia and alcohol misuse. Few variations were observed in AAO of comorbidities according to groups. Limitations: All assessments were retrospective, so estimates of prevalence rates and especially exact AAO of some comorbidities are at risk of recall bias. Conclusions: Sex and BD subtype are associated with different rates of comorbid disorders. However, there were minimal between group differences in median AAO of comorbidities. By describing the chronological sequence of comorbidities in BD we were able to demonstrate that a minority of comorbidities typically occurred post-onset of BD. This is noteworthy as these disorders might be amenable to interventions aimed at early secondary prevention.

Regulation of negative emotions through positive reappraisal and distancing in high-trait-anxious women,"Background: Positive reappraisal and distancing are two distinct cognitive reappraisal strategies for emotion regulation. Critically however, research examining the impact of elevated trait anxiety on cognitive reappraisal has often conflated these strategies. Thus, the present study investigated whether high-trait-anxious (HTA) women can effectively utilize positive reappraisal and distancing to regulate emotional responses to negative stimuli. Methods: Twenty-six HTA women and twenty-seven low-trait-anxious (LTA) women were investigated in a self-generated reappraisal paradigm. Subjective measures of emotional regulation and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were instructed to passively view neutral or negative pictures, or to reinterpret negative pictures in a positive way (positive reappraisal) or a detached and unemotional way (distancing). Results: HTA women, as compared to LTA women, reported smaller reductions in negative affect after positive reappraisal and smaller reductions in emotional arousal after distancing. Though ERP data did not reveal corresponding differences in the centro-parietal late positive potential during emotion regulation, data did reveal HTA women exhibited enhanced recruitment of cognitive control during positive reappraisal and greater preparatory processing before engaging in distancing. Limitations: Future research should examine the generalizability of the present results in clinical anxiety individuals, male sample and other reappraisal strategies. Conclusions: Overall, HTA women appeared to recruit more cortical resources, suggestive of compensatory mechanisms, to achieve a similar performance as LTA women when engaging in positive reappraisal and distancing strategies to regulate negative emotions. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that HTA women are characterized by the inefficient implementation of positive reappraisal and distancing strategies.

Cortisol levels in chronic fatigue syndrome and atypical depression measured using hair and saliva specimens,"Background: Several diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDE) overlap with those of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Furthermore, atypical MDE (A-MDE), a subtype of MDE characterised by profound fatigue and which has frequently been linked with CFS, exhibits similar low cortisol levels to CFS. However, this result has been only found in specimens designed for measuring acute cortisol levels. In this study, we measure cortisol levels in subjects with CFS and in subjects with A-MDE, without psychiatric comorbidity, using both hair and saliva specimens, to gain a measure of both short and long-term cortisol levels in these two conditions. Methods: Hair cortisol concentration, representing the cortisol concentration of the previous three months, and salivary cortisol, measured at six time-points across one day and including the cortisol awakening response (CAR), post-awakening delta cortisol and the total daily output, were assessed in an age and gender matched group of 34 controls, 15 subjects with A-MDE and 17 with CFS. Results: CFS (mean 92.2 nmol/l.h, s.d. 33.2 nmol/l.h) and A-MDE (mean 89.1 nmol/l.h, s.d. 22.6 nmol/l.h) subjects both showed lower cortisol total daily output in saliva (AUCg) in comparison to healthy controls (mean 125.5 nmol/l.h, s.d. 40.6 nmol/l.h). However, hair cortisol concentration was not lower than that of controls in either patient group. CFS and A-MDE did not differ from one another on any cortisol measures. CFS subjects reported fewer daily hassles and less severe psychic anxiety symptoms in comparison to A-MDE subjects (all p &lt; 0.05). However, they did not differ in the severity of somatic anxiety symptoms. There was also no difference in the presence of overlapping symptoms such as fatigability and concentration/memory problems between A-MDE and CFS subjects. Conclusion: Low levels of cortisol found using short-term measures of daily output may be transient, since cortisol levels were normal when a long-term measure (hair) was studied. This might be explained by a potential cortisol rhythm alteration. Although these disorders have their distinctive depressive and somatic features, they may from part of a wider group of Somatic Symptom Disorders (SSD), given the findings of the same pattern of cortisol secretion in both disorders and increased frequency of overlapping clinical features.

An evaluation of suicidal risk in bipolar patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: While bipolar disorder (BD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and individually have a higher risk of suicide compared to the general population, few studies have examined the impact of comorbid PTSD on suicidal ideation in patients with BD. Methods: We analyzed baseline data from the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for bipolar disorder study (Bipolar CHOICE), a 6-month, pharmacological comparative effectiveness trial of individuals with BD. Bipolar CHOICE enrolled 482 individuals. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis assessed whether comorbid PTSD was associated with increased suicidal ideation as assessed by the Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale (CHRT) total and factor scores, while controlling for common correlates of suicidal ideation in this population such as a current major depressive episode, comorbid anxiety disorders, severity of illness and previous suicide attempts. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, diagnosis of comorbid PTSD was a significant predictor of the CHRT total score (β = 2.59, p = .03). Comorbid PTSD was also a significant predictor of the CHRT propensity factor (β = 2.32, adjusted p = .04), but was not a significant predictor of the active suicidal thoughts factor. Additionally, all participants with comorbid PTSD ( N = 58) endorsed current suicidal ideation ( p = .005) and were more likely to have had a previous suicide attempt ( p &lt; .001) compared to those without PTSD. Limitations: Generalizability beyond outpatient settings is limited, mixed affective states were not assessed, and analyses were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Patients have an increased risk of suicidal ideation when PTSD is comorbid with BD.

Outcome of depressive mood disorder among adolescent outpatients in an eight-year follow-up,"Objectives: This study investigated the eight-year course and outcomes of depressive mood disorders and the key outcome predictors among adolescent outpatients. Methods: Depressive adolescent outpatients ( N = 148) in a naturalistic clinical setting were assessed at baseline, six months, 12 months and eight years using diagnostic and self-report instruments. Baseline predictors covered selected sociodemographic, clinical and treatment-related characteristics. The outcomes were time to recovery, recurrence, time spent being ill and longitudinal latent profiles of depressive symptoms. Results: The recovery rate from any depressive mood disorder was 73% at two years, 91% at five years and 94% by the end of the eight-year follow-up. Two thirds (67%) of the subjects presented at least one recurrence and 57% of them were depressed for 25% or more of the follow-up period. At the eight-year follow-up, 36% had a mood disorder, 48% suffered from anxiety and 26% had a personality disorder. Less severe depression at baseline predicted a shorter time to recovery, whereas recurrence was predicted by a younger age. A latent profile with initially moderate-level depressive symptoms but a poor distal outcome was associated with being female and borderline personality disorder. Limitations: The female preponderance in the sample warrants caution when interpreting sex differences in the findings. Conclusions: Although the depression outcome for some adolescents making the transition to young adulthood is promising, many of them experience long, even chronic episodes, and recurrences are common. Personality-disorder characteristics appeared to be significant outcome predictors in this adolescent population.

Self-guided online cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia: A naturalistic evaluation in patients with potential psychiatric comorbidities,"Background: Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide, and regularly co-occurs with anxiety and depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the gold standard treatment for insomnia (CBT-I), however demand for treatment providers drastically exceeds supply. Internet-delivered programs for insomnia (iCBT-I) improve treatment access. However the effects of unguided iCBT-I for individuals with comorbidities within a naturalistic setting remains unexplored. We developed a novel unguided iCBT-I program and evaluated its impact on insomnia, psychological distress, and wellbeing when accessed by the public. Methods: 317 participants experiencing insomnia for over 3 months enrolled in the program. The program consisted of 4 lessons delivered online with automated web support. Insomnia symptoms, psychological distress, and general wellbeing were assessed at lesson 1 and 4. Intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to examine effects on insomnia, distress, and wellbeing. Results: Participants experienced large ( g = 1.11) and significant reductions in insomnia, moderate ( g = 0.55) and significant reductions in distress, and small ( g = 0.37) but significant improvements in wellbeing. 65% of participants who reported pre-treatment insomnia severity at clinical levels remitted following treatment. Limitations: To examine the program in a naturalistic setting, we did not employ a control group or follow participants beyond the completion of treatment. Conclusions: Unguided iCBT-I is effective for individuals in the community who experience insomnia and are likely experiencing comorbid mental health problems. These effects in the absence of guided contact strengthen the utility of unguided iCBT-I as a scalable and cost-effective method of disseminating treatments for this disorder.

"Self-disgust, loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults: An eye-tracking study","Background: Self-disgust has been associated with loneliness and mental health difficulties in clinical and non-clinical populations, but there is limited research on the role of self-disgust in loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults. Methods: In Study 1 ( N = 102; M age = 68.4 years, SD = 10.9, 68% females) we used a cross-sectional survey to explore the association between loneliness, self-disgust and mental health outcomes. In Study 2 ( N = 80; M age = 68.8 years, SD = 11.4, 57% females) we used eye-tracking to investigate attentional vigilance, maintenance and avoidance in individuals with high (vs. low) self-disgust. Results: In study 1 we found that self-disgust mediated the associations of loneliness with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and in study 2 it was demonstrated that older adults with high (vs. low) self-disgust displayed attentional avoidance to their own faces, compared to the faces of unknown others, a process that may perpetuate loneliness. Limitations: The cross-sectional design used in Study 1 limits our potential to make causal inferences. Additionally, both studies included a wide age range of older adults. Conclusions: Our findings are novel and highlight the importance of self-disgust experiences in the context of loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults. Implications for practice and interventions against loneliness in this age group are discussed.

Clinical expression and treatment response among children with comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Background: Paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is highly comorbid with other psychological disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Preliminary evidence suggests that youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD may experience greater impairments than children with other comorbidities; however, there is limited research examining the clinical expression and treatment response of these youth. Methods: Youth (7 to 17 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD and comorbid ADHD ( n = 40) were compared a sample of age and gender matched youth with OCD and other comorbidity (without ADHD, n = 40). The study investigated symptoms, severity, functioning, comorbidity, family accommodation, in addition to parental psychopathology and rearing styles. Treatment response was investigated at post-treatment and six-month follow-up. Results: Youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD had fewer sexual obsessions, higher rates of comorbidity, poorer executive functioning and higher family impairment. Families of comorbid youth engaged in significantly more accommodation and reported more negative rearing. Finally, comorbid youth were significantly less likely to be responders or remitters at post-treatment. Limitations and Conclusions: Limitations include the cross-sectional design, relatively small clinical sample, and lack of an experimental control group of youth with ADHD without OCD. Current approaches to treatment may be improved for youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD by addressing cooccurring anxiety, behavioural difficulties, and maladaptive family accommodation and rearing. Moreover, given pronounced deficits in executive function, these youth may require a stronger initial dose of CBT to achieve an adequate response.

Psychometric properties of the Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) in suicide attempters and community controls of rural China,"Background: Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) were developed to measure four types of strain comprising value strain, deprivation strain, aspiration strain, and coping strain. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of 40-item PSS in suicide attempters and community controls of rural China. Methods: Data of this study came from the investigation of 132 suicide attempters and their paired community controls matched with the same sex, age (±3 years) and residence in five counties in rural Shandong, China. The Chinese version of PSS, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and the Self-esteem Scale (SES) were administered and reliability test and validity test of the PSS were conducted. Results: Cronbach's α and Guttman Spilt-Half coefficient of PSS was 0.942 and 0.842 for suicide attempters, and 0.950 and 0.874 for community controls. For both suicide attempters and community controls, the Exploratory Factor Analysis indicated a one-factor structure of each strain scale, which accorded with the original factor structure proposed by the authors. The scores of the total PSS and four subscales were positively correlated with the scores of CES-D and TAI; and negatively correlated with the score of SES, which indicated a good performance in convergent validity. Limitations: This study was limited to its generalizability to the Chinese urban population. Conclusions: The Chinese version of the 40-item PSS has satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity in Chinese rural suicide attempters and community controls.

Insomnia in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A Swedish population-based cohort study,"Background: The association between specific psychiatric disorders and insomnia is well established, but the prevalence of insomnia in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. This population-based study examined the prevalence of insomnia in patients with OCD compared to unaffected individuals from the general population and to their unaffected full siblings, and evaluated the contribution of psychiatric comorbidities to this association. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with OCD (31,856) were identified from a cohort of 13,017,902 individuals living in Sweden anytime during 1973 and 2013. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the odds of insomnia in individuals with OCD, compared to the general population and their unaffected full siblings. Sensitivity analyses were performed in subgroups from which all individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions were excluded, one at a time. Results: Individuals with OCD had almost 7-fold increased odds of receiving an insomnia diagnosis or being dispensed a drug with specific indication for insomnia, compared to unaffected individuals from the general population (42.2% vs. 11.0%, respectively; OR = 6.92 [95% CI, 6.76-7.08]). Familiar factors shared with siblings and comorbid conditions did not fully explain this association, but when individuals with comorbid depression and anxiety disorders were excluded, the odds of insomnia were significantly reduced (OR = 4.97 [95% CI, 4.81-5.14] and OR = 4.51 [95% CI, 4.33-4.69], respectively). Limitations: Due to the intrinsic coverage issues of the registers, results may not be generalizable to milder forms of the disorder and to individuals who do not seek help. Conclusions: Insomnia should be systematically evaluated and managed in individuals with OCD, particularly in those with comorbid anxiety and depression.

Pharmacological management of depression: Japanese expert consensus,"Background: Clinically relevant issues in the real-world treatment of depression have not always been captured by conventional treatment guidelines. Methods: Certified psychiatrists of the Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology were asked to evaluate treatment options regarding 23 clinical situations in the treatment of depression using a 9-point Likert scale (1 = “disagree” and 9 = “agree”). According to the responses of 114 experts, the options were categorized into first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Results: First-line antidepressants varied depending on predominant symptoms: escitalopram (mean ± standard deviation score, 7.8 ± 1.7) and sertraline (7.3 ± 1.7) were likely selected for anxiety; duloxetine (7.6 ± 1.9) and venlafaxine (7.2 ± 2.1) for loss of interest; mirtazapine for insomnia (8.2 ± 1.6), loss of appetite (7.9 ± 1.9), agitation and severe irritation (7.4 ± 2.0), and suicidal ideation (7.5 ± 1.9). While first-line treatment was switched to either an SNRI (7.7 ± 1.9) or mirtazapine (7.4 ± 2.0) in the case of non-response to an SSRI, switching to mirtazapine (7.1 ± 2.2) was recommended in the case of non-response to an SNRI, and vice versa (switching to an SNRI (7.0 ± 2.0) in the case of non-response to mirtazapine). Augmentation with aripiprazole was considered the first-line treatment for partial response to an SSRI (7.1 ± 2.3) or SNRI (7.0 ± 2.5). Limitations: The evidence level of expert consensus is considered low. All included experts were Japanese. Conclusions: Recommendations made by experts in the field are useful and can supplement guidelines and informed decision making in real-world clinical practice. We suggest that pharmacological strategies for depression be flexible and that each patient's situational needs as well as the pharmacotherapeutic profile of medications be considered.

The course of panic disorder during the peripartum period and the risk for adverse child development: A prospective-longitudinal study,"Background: Panic disorders during pregnancy and after delivery may have detrimental effects for mother and child, but no firm conclusions regarding the course and outcomes of peripartum panic disorders can be drawn from previous studies. Methods: N = 306 women were repeatedly interviewed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women. Social support and partnership quality, gestational outcomes, duration of breastfeeding, regulatory disorders, maternal bonding and parenting style were assessed via medical and maternal reports. Standardized observations of neuropsychological development, infant temperament and attachment were conducted 4 and 16 months after delivery. Results: Women reported heterogenous courses of panic disorders, and panic disorders/panic attacks were commonly observed during the early stages of pregnancy. Women with peripartum panic disorders presented with a worse psychosocial situation (e.g., lower social support). Clear behavioral differences (temperament, attachment) in infants of women with panic disorders as compared to women with no anxiety and depressive disorder could not be detected in this study, but differences concerning gestational outcomes, duration of breastfeeding, maternal parenting, and bonding as well as regulatory problems in infants were identified. Limitations: This prospective-longitudinal multi-wave study is restricted by the relative small sizes of the particular groups that limit the power to detect group differences. Conclusions: Heterogenous courses and outcomes of perinatal panic disorders require intensive monitoring of affected mother-infant-dyads who may benefit from early targeted interventions to prevent an escalation of dyadic problems.

Perceived parental support in childhood and adolescence as a tool for mental health screening in students: A longitudinal study in the i-Share cohort,"Background: Negative events in childhood are associated with increased risk of mental health problems, and evaluation could help identify students at high risk of mental health disorder. However, childhood adversity measures are difficult to implement in routine care. Perceived parental support in childhood and adolescence may be more easily assessed, as it is a rather neutral and non-intrusive question. Methods: We retrieved students’ health data collected from the French i-Share cohort, in a longitudinal population-based study including 4463 students of 18–24 years of age. Students in this cohort completed a self-reported questionnaire about major psychiatric problems at one-year follow-up. Results: Among 4463 participants, 26% reported a major mental health problem—including suicidal behavior (17%), major depression (7%), and severe generalized anxiety disorder (15%). Adjusted logistic regression revealed that a lower level of perceived parental support was significantly associated with higher risk of any mental health problem. Compared to students who reported extremely strong perceived parental support, students who perceived no support had a nearly 4-fold higher risk of mental health problems (aOR 3.80, CI 2.81–5.13). Lower levels of perceived parental support were dose-dependently associated with higher incidences of suicidal behavior, major depression, and severe generalized anxiety disorder. Limitations: Study limitations included a moderate follow-up response rate, and retrospective self-report questionnaires. Conclusion: Perceived parental support was strongly associated with the incidence of mental health problems among college students. If validated, these results suggest that health professionals should consider using this simple marker to improve mental health risk assessment and screening.

The learning effects and curves during high beta down-training neurofeedback for patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed increased beta activity in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety symptoms. Negative emotions and high beta activity could be decreased by a high beta down-training neurofeedback (NFB) protocol. The present study utilized three objective parameters—trainability, independence, and interpretability—to validate the effects of high beta down-training sessions. Methods: EEG data were collected from 23 patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms during high beta down-training sessions. Participants received five weeks of training, two sessions per week, to down-train high beta amplitude (20–32 Hz) at EEG sites P3 and P4. Three efficacy parameters were examined by comparing pre-training and post-training EEG. Results: The trainability index revealed the learning curves of reduced high beta activity at P3 and P4, confirming training effects across and within sessions. The independence index revealed only beta band activity decreased. The interpretability index revealed the decreased high beta activity was positively correlated with decreased severity of depression, especially for cognitive depression. Limitations: With only ten sessions in this study, it is unknown whether the NFB training caused extended and stable learning effects. Additionally, combining high beta down-training protocol with enhancing another target band could better ensure the desired changes in brain activity. Finally, the effect of medication on EEG cannot be excluded in present study. Conclusions: The trainability, independence and interpretability of the high beta down-training NFB protocol were confirmed, supporting the protocol's use in future research and clinical applications.

Evening chronotype as a discrete clinical subphenotype in bipolar disorder,"Objective: Our aim was to investigate evening chronotype, a proxy marker of circadian system dysfunction, as a clinical subphenotype in bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 773 BD participants and 146 control subjects were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and a set of questionnaires. Chronotype was determined using item-5 from the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Univariate analyses and regression models were used to compare evening and non-evening chronotype in BD and chronotype association with clinical variables. Results: Overall, 205 (27%) of BD patients reported an evening chronotype. Evening chronotype was higher in a matched sub-sample of BD patients ( n = 150) than in controls (24% and 5% respectively, OR = 5.4, p &lt; 0.01). Compared to those with non-evening chronotypes, BD patients with an evening chronotype were younger, had an earlier age of onset of BD, and had more prior depressive and manic episodes, higher rates of rapid cycling, past suicide attempts, more comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. Multivariate regression showed age, prior suicide attempts, and co-occurring substance use disorder were associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 0.97 to1.59). Hypertension, migraine, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea were significantly associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 1.56 to 2.0). Limitation: Limitations include a cross-sectional study design that precludes establishing causality. Analyses did not control for medication use. Younger participant age may prevent evaluation of associations with late-life illnesses. Conclusions: Evening chronotype may be a discrete clinical subphenotype in BD and circadian dysfunction a shared pathophysiological mechanism between psychopathology and medical morbidity.

First-year French medical students consume antidepressants and anxiolytics while second-years consume non-medical drugs,"Background: : First year exams are a major source of stress amongst first-year medical students. Objective: : To explore antidepressant and anxiolytic consumption and addictive behavior of medical students before and after exams. Methods: : Medical students of the 35 French medical schools were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and completed online Internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: : Overall, 4345 medical students were included (3051 first year vs. 1294 second year). In multivariate analyses, compared to those in the first year of medicine, second year students were found to have lower anxiolytic (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 0.56, p = 0.01) and antidepressant consumption (aOR = 0.21, p &lt; 0.0001) but higher psychiatric follow-up (aOR = 1.95, p &lt; 0.0001) after adjustment for age, gender and relationship status. Whilst second year students reported slightly higher quality of life (especially for mental health), they also reported more daily tobacco smoking (aOR = 1.78, p &lt; 0.0001), more cannabis use disorders (aOR = 2.37, p &lt; 0.0001), hazardous drinking (aOR = 3.61, p &lt; 0.0001), and alcohol dependence (aOR = 3.66, p &lt; 0.0001). Second year medical students reported fewer difficulties relating to studying in comparison to first year students (aOR = 0.60, p &lt; 0.0001) yet they reported a higher rate of recreational drugs use with a variety of reasons including self-treatment of anxiety; disinhibition and to copy their peers (all p &lt; 0.05). Limits: : These results should be confirmed by longitudinal studies. Conclusion: : First year medical students who are faced with challenges relating to studying consume more antidepressants and anxiolytics, whilst second year students have a higher consumption of recreational drugs for a range of reasons. This suggests that the first two years at medical school are an important contributor to adverse mental health and therefore present a window of opportunity for preventative intervention.

"Risk factors for suicidal ideation in a large, registry-based sample of adult long-term childhood cancer survivors","Introduction: Long-term childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk for physical and psychosocial late effects. Previous research has attested to increased rates of suicidal ideation (SI) in CCS, an especially dangerous indicator of distress. However, little was known about risk factors of SI among CCS which go beyond illness- and treatment related variables. Methods: A registry-based sample of 916 adult long-term CCS ( M age = 34.58 years [SD = 5.53], M age at diagnosis = 6.15 years [ SD = 4.28]) underwent medical assessments and filled out questionnaires. We conducted a linear regression analysis on SI, testing predictors of different areas: sociodemographic, social, physical health and health behavior, and psychological distress symptoms. Results: SI was reported by 73 (8.0%) CCS and previous suicide attempts were reported by 26 (2.8%) CCS. SI was most closely related to social and psychological factors, i.e. to concurrent distress symptoms (depression, anxiety, social phobia), previous suicide attempts, current loneliness, and the present living situation. Limitations: SI and previous suicide attempts were assessed using short self-report instruments. The cross-sectional study design does not allow for causal inferences. Conclusions: Long-term CCS are a previously understudied, vulnerable group. Decades after having survived cancer, a considerable percentage is affected by (recurrent) SI. CCS’ risk for SI is likely shaped by individual medical and psychological history, and by the current social environment and psychological comorbidities. There is a need for more interdisciplinary research and for screening efforts which take account of these factors. Interventions reducing CCS’ risk of suicide should foster social integration and counteract current stressors.

Couples becoming parents: Trajectories for psychological distress and buffering effects of social support,"Background: Becoming a parent is a time of both joy and stress. Associations between exposure to postnatal depression and negative child outcomes underscore the importance of understanding trajectories and correlates of perinatal depression and anxiety. Methods: In a study of 438 expectant couples (from the UK, USA and Netherlands) tracked across four time-points (third trimester, 4, 14 and 24 months), we used dyadic latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) of self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression (CES-D, GHQ, STAI) to investigate the affective impact of becoming a parent. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses of anxious-depressive symptoms revealed a single latent factor with measurement invariance across time and parent. Dyadic LGCM intercepts showed greater prenatal problems in mothers compared with fathers. LGCM slopes revealed stable maternal problems but worsening paternal problems. Both intercepts and slopes showed significant within-couple associations. Controlling for prenatal salivary cortisol levels and perinatal couple relationship quality, support from friends attenuated mothers’ psychological distress and support from family reduced fathers’ psychological distress across the transition to parenthood. Limitations: Our sample was low risk (i.e., predominantly well-educated and affluent and no history of serious mental illness), limiting the generalizability of findings. In addition, the inverse association between psychological distress and social support may, in part, reflect the use of self-report for both measures. Conclusions: The international dyadic longitudinal design strengthens conclusions regarding variation in trajectories of psychological distress in both mothers and fathers. Crucially, social support appears pivotal in enabling new parents to flourish.

Association between traumatic spinal cord injury and affective and other psychiatric disorders–A nationwide cohort study and effects of rehabilitation therapies,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) and the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders, and the role of the rehabilitation therapies. Methods: In this population-based, retrospective cohort study, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to analyze the patients who were newly diagnosed with TSCI between 2000 and 2015 were included, with a 1:3 ratio by age, sex, and index year matched in the non-TSCI comparison group, for the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders. Results: In total, 5375 out of 16,151 patients with TSCI developed psychiatric disorders, and 1467 out of 48,543 patients in the non-TSCI group developed psychiatric disorders (2930.88 vs 2823.29 per 100,000 persons/year). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the TSCI cohort had a significantly higher risk of psychiatric disorders (log-rank, p &lt; 0.001). Fine and Gray's survival analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.977 (95% CI: 1.914–2.042, p &lt; 0.001). Rehabilitation therapies, including physical and occupational therapies, within 90 days after the injury, was associated with a lowered risk of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, in the TSCI cohort (adjusted HR = 0.702 [95% CI: 0.661–0.746, p &lt; 0.001]). In the subgroups with low, medium, and high intensity, rehabilitation therapies were associated with a lowered risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: TSCI was associated with the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders, and rehabilitation therapies were associated with a lowered risk of these in the TSCI cohort.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of postpartum depression,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and gravely disabling health concern. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved treatment for major depression and may be a valuable tool in the treatment of PPD. The treatment effect of rTMS is rapid, generally well tolerated, without systemic effects, and without medication exposure to a fetus and/or breastfed infant. Methods: Six women with PPD received 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over a 4 week period. Psychiatric rating scales (BDI, EPDS, STATI), cognitive assessments (MMSE, Trails B, List Generation) and breastfeeding practices were surveyed at baseline and post rTMS treatment. BDI and EPDS were obtained weekly, as well as 3 months and 6 months post study conclusion. Results: Average BDI, EPDS, and STAI scores declined over the 4-week duration of rTMS treatment. Of the six patients, four achieved remission as assessed by EPDS and one achieved remission and two responded as assessed by BDI. Mean BDI and EPDS scores at 3 and 6 months follow-up remained below levels at study entry. No evidence of cognitive changes or breastfeeding disruptions. Limitations: This was an exploratory study with small sample size with no sham control arm. Daily administration of rTMS provides potential for confounding of behavioral activation in the otherwise often isolative postpartum period. Conclusions: rTMS was safe and well tolerated among participants with evidence of sustained improvements in depression and anxiety scores. This study supports rTMS as a promising non-pharmacologic treatment modality for perinatal depression.

The speed of progression towards obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: There is current interest in the elaboration of early intervention programs for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To this end, it is important to investigate the speed of progression from subthreshold symptoms to diagnosable OCD. In this study, we have retrospectively investigated the speed of progression towards full-blown OCD and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with a faster transition. Methods: Patients enrolled in the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders ( N = 954) were interviewed with a comprehensive assessment battery that included the interval (in years) between the onset of subthreshold OCD symptoms and the onset of full-blown OCD. Results: It took a median of 7 years (interquartile range: 2–13 years) for subthreshold symptoms to convert to diagnosable OCD. Faster OCD onset was associated with lower age at the time of assessment, male gender, being in new romantic states as precipitants for compulsions, greater severity of sexual/religious symptoms and lower severity of hoarding and YBOCS compulsions severity scores, greater rates of generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia without panic disorder, and negative family history for OCD. Limitations: The retrospective design of this study allowed for susceptibility to memory bias about age at onset of OCD symptoms. We were unable to capture progressions taking less than 12 months. Conclusions: We could identify a specific phenotype that was more likely to escalate rapidly to clinical levels within this large clinical sample. This phenomenon may be particularly relevant in the context of selecting individuals for early intervention initiatives in situations when resources are scarce.

Accelerated magnetic seizure therapy (aMST) for treatment of major depressive disorder: A pilot study,"Background: Magnetic Seizure therapy (MST) is an emerging treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) that is associated with fewer cognitive side effects compared to electroconvulsive therapy. The present pilot study sought to investigate whether daily MST treatments were associated to antidepressant effect and assess cognitive side effects associated with an accelerated MST (aMST) treatment schedule. Methods: Fifteen MDD patients underwent a six-day course of MST treatment to the vertex following assessment of symptom severity and neuropsychological testing. The primary outcome was severity on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-item (HRSD-17). Patient also underwent neuropsychological assessment with the RBANS and Stroop Colour-Word test. Results: There were no instances of delirium or disturbance of consciousness following aMST sessions. Patients showed significant decreases on indices of depression and anxiety symptoms, with 9 (60%) patients showing a clinical response and 7 (47%) patients experiencing remission. Significant improvements were reported in RBANS total score, as well as indices of immediate memory and delayed memory. No changes at follow-up were reported for visuospatial/constructional, language, and attention RBANS indices, nor for Stroop Colour/Word performance. Limitations: The results should be interpreted with caution as they are part of a non-randomized, open-label pilot study. Further, the short duration of the study does not provide longitudinal follow-up to determine whether treatment response lasts a meaningful duration of time. Conclusions: aMST well tolerated without significant evidence of cognitive side effects and rapid improvement in symptoms. Further research is required to fully characterize these changes and replicate them in independent samples.

Everyday life experiences and mental health among conflict-affected forced migrants: A meta-analysis,"Background: There are a growing number of forced migrants worldwide. Early detection of poor adjustment and interventions to facilitate positive adaptation within these communities is a critical global public health priority. A growing literature points to challenges within the post-migration context as key determents of poor mental health. Aims: The current meta-analysis evaluated the association between daily stressors and poor mental health among these populations. Method: A systematic search in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified relevant studies from inception until the end of 2018. Effect sizes (correlation coefficients) were pooled using Fisher's Z transformation and reported with 95% confidence intervals. Moderator and mediator analyses were conducted. The protocol is available in PROSPERO [CRD42018081207]. Results: Analysis of 59 eligible studies ( n = 17,763) revealed that daily stressors were associated with higher psychiatric symptoms ( Z r = 0.126–0.199, 95% CI = 0.084–0.168, 0.151–0.247, p &lt; 0.001) and general distress ( Z r = 0.542, 95% CI = 0.332–0.752, p &lt; 0.001). Stronger effect sizes were observed for mixed daily stressors relative to subjective, interpersonal, and material daily stressors, and for general distress relative to posttraumatic stress symptoms and general well-being. Effect sizes were also stronger for children and adolescents relative to adults. Daily stressors fully mediated the associations of prior trauma with post-migration anxiety, depressive, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides a synthesis of existing research on the role of unfavorable everyday life experiences and their associations with poor mental health among conflict-affected forced migrants. Routine assessment and intervention to reduce daily stressors can prevent and reduce psychiatric morbidity in these populations.

"Prevalence of depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders, in Quebec, Canada","Background: The prevalence of mood disorders was estimated at 5.4% according to the latest Canadian survey. It has been suggested to use administrative data and self-reported data to optimize the estimation for mental health care in the population. Using administrative data, algorithms (combination of codes from the International Classification of Diseases) had been previously developed to identify the population with mood and anxiety disorders. However, the specific prevalence of each component of mood disorders (depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders) are still unknown in Quebec, Canada. Objective: To 1) identify the population diagnosed respectively with depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders in administrative data, and 2) provide annual prevalence estimates of each component. Method: Data were extracted from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System and the entire population of Quebec (2000–2017) was included in this study (8.3 million; 2017). The prevalence of depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders were estimated using specific algorithms. Results: The annual prevalence of depressive disorders was 3.7% in 2000–2001; it decreased to 2.8% in 2016–2017. In comparison, the prevalence of bipolar disorders was 0.8% in 2000–2001, decreasing to 0.6% in 2016–2017, and the prevalence of adjustment disorders was 1.3% in 2000–2001 and increased to 1.6% in 2016–2017. Conclusion: Using specific algorithms, we observed that the trend of adjustment disorders is increasing while trends of depressive and bipolar disorders are decreasing. Further studies should assess if the related burden of care respectively follows the same trends as policy makers’ allocations of resources may need to be adapted.

Mothers’ emotions after pediatric burn injury: Longitudinal associations with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms 18 months postburn,"Background: Various emotions are implicated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Longitudinal studies examining temporal associations between emotions and posttraumatic stress may reveal who is at risk of chronic psychological problems. This study examined the longitudinal relationships of mothers’ trauma-related emotions with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms after pediatric burn injury. Methods: Data from two cohort studies were used ( n = 296). Mothers reported the intensity of burn-related emotions within the first month (T1) and 12 months postburn (T2). The Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-D; depression subscale) were administered at T1 and 18 months postburn (T3). Results: Based on two exploratory factor analyses, emotion variables were combined into acute and long-term basic emotions (fear, sadness, horror, anger) and self-conscious emotions (guilt, shame). The path model showed a positive relationship between acute and long-term basic emotions. Higher long-term basic emotions were related to persistence of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Acute self-conscious emotions showed associations with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms at T1 and were longitudinally related to depressive, but not posttraumatic stress, symptoms. Limitations: The posttraumatic stress measure was not based on DSM-5 PTSD criteria and results require replication using these criteria. Conclusions: This study suggests that mothers’ acute self-conscious and long-term basic emotions in relation to their child's burn injury are involved in the development of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Clinically, assessing and monitoring parents’ early posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms and burn-related emotions may be useful to identify parents at risk.

Association of poorer dietary quality and higher dietary inflammation with greater symptom severity in depressed individuals with appetite loss,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of years lived with disability; however, little is known about its etiology to inform treatment. For a subset of MDD patients, appetite change and/or bodily inflammation may play a role in exacerbating symptoms. The goal of this study is to examine whether, relative to healthy comparisons (HC), MDD individuals with increased versus decreased appetite symptoms show a differential relationship between diet quality and inflammation. Methods: Unmedicated current MDD ( n = 61) varying in appetite change (decrease (MDD-DE): n = 39; increase (MDD-IN): n = 22) and HC ( n = 42) completed 24-hour dietary recall and state depression/anxiety measures. Healthy eating and dietary inflammatory indices were calculated from dietary reports. Blood samples measured five inflammation-related biomarkers. Analyses investigated between- and within-group differences in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), inflammation-related blood biomarkers, and symptom severity. Results: While both MDD-DE and MDD-IN exhibited lower HEI scores than HC, only MDD-IN showed higher plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels than HC. In contrast, MDD-DE exhibited higher DII scores than MDD-IN and HC. Within MDD-DE, greater symptom severity was associated with lower HEI and higher DII. Limitations: Modest sample sizes and the cross-sectional study design limited power to detect within-MDD effects. Conclusions: Although MDD, regardless of appetite change, is linked to poorer dietary quality, depression severity was related to dietary characteristics only in subjects who reported appetite loss. Thus, increasing the quality of dietary intake could be a treatment target for some individuals with depression.

Purpose in life is a robust protective factor of reported cognitive decline among late middle-aged adults: The Emory Healthy Aging Study,"Background: Cognitive abilities tend to decline in advanced age. A novel protective factor of cognitive decline in advanced age is purpose-in-life (PiL), a trait-like tendency to derive life meanings and purpose. However, whether PiL protects against cognitive decline in late-middle-age is unclear. Hence, we examined the association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline, one of the earliest detectable cognitive symptoms before the onset of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we used a machine learning approach to investigate whether PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered with the known protective and risk factors for cognition. Methods: PiL was assessed with a 10-item questionnaire and perceived cognitive decline with the Cognitive Function Instrument among 5,441 Emory Healthy Aging Study participants, whose mean age was 63 and 51% were employed. Association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline was examined with linear regression adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Elastic Net was performed to identify the most robust predictors of cognitive decline. Results: Greater PiL was associated with less perceived cognitive decline after adjusting for the relevant factors. Furthermore, Elastic Net modeling suggested that PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered simultaneously with known protective (education, exercise, enrichment activities) and risk factors for cognition (depression, anxiety, diagnosed medical, mental health problems, smoking, alcohol use, family history of dementia, and others). Limitation: This is a cross-sectional study. Conclusions: PiL is a robust protective factor of perceived cognitive decline observed as early as middle age. Thus, interventions to enhance PiL merit further investigation.

Alexithymia as a possible specifier of adverse outcomes: Clinical correlates in euthymic unipolar individuals,"Background: Alexithymia is a disabling condition frequently linked to major depressive disorder (MDD) and able to enhance symptoms severity and suicide risk. This study aimed to clarify whether patients with and without alexithymia may differ concerning illness presentation and clinical course, which is a major gap in the scientific literature. Methods: The present sample included 381 euthymic outpatients with MDD recruited at the Department of Neuroscience (DINOGMI), University of Genoa. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and additional rating scales (Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Intent Score Scale (ISS) were administered to all participants. Results: Alexithymic patients were more likely to have lower educational level (11.6 ± 3.2 vs. 12.4 ± 3.4, p ≤ .05), have used previous psychiatric drugs (85.7% vs. 72.8%, p = .001), use current antidepressants (84.7% vs. 69.4%, p = &lt;.001), and have higher cardiological comorbid disorders (10.7% vs. 5.0%, p = ≤ .05). After multivariate analyses, alexithymia was associated with lower educational level (OR = 0.928, p = .05), and higher current antidepressants use (OR 2.302, p = .01); difficulties in identifying feelings were associated with lower educational level ( p = ≤ .005), higher psychiatric comorbidity ( p = ≤ .001), and previous psychiatric medications ( p = .01). Furthermore, having a lower educational level remained the only factor associated with both difficulties in communicating feelings ( p = ≤ .001) and thoughts oriented to external context ( p = ≤.005). Limitations: The study is limited by the small sample size and its cross-sectional nature. Conclusions: Alexithymia appears a useful specifier of adverse outcomes, associated with distinct socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Its identification would allow to provide a more personalized care.

Efficacy of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder reporting childhood or recent trauma,"Background: This analysis investigates the efficacy of vortioxetine in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who report childhood or recent trauma. Methods: Patient-level data were analyzed from 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled short-term studies investigating the efficacy of vortioxetine (5–20 mg/day) versus placebo in patients (18–75 years old) with DSM-IV-TR– defined MDD. Changes from baseline to week 8 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were examined at the individual study level and as in meta-analysis. A long-term relapse prevention study of 5 and 10 mg of vortioxetine was also analyzed. Traumatic events history was recorded at baseline. Results: Sixty-one percent of subjects (1113/1811) reported trauma history in the short-term studies. A significant effect vs. placebo was observed for vortioxetine on MADRS (10 mg, –2.2, P = .025; 20 mg, –4.4, P &lt; .001), HAM-A (20 mg, –1.60, P = .012), CGI-I (5 mg, –0.3, P = .028; 10 mg, –0.3, P = .013; 20 mg, –0.50, P = .009), and SDS (20 mg, –2.3, P = .007) in patients with any trauma (childhood and/or recent). In the relapse prevention study, 51% (198/392) of subjects reported a history of trauma. Subjects with any trauma (childhood and/or recent) randomized to placebo were significantly more likely to relapse than subjects treated with vortioxetine (hazard ratio 2.8, P = .0019). Limitations: An exploratory analysis. Discussion: Vortioxetine showed significant short- and long-term efficacy on depressive and anxiety symptoms and overall functioning in this large subpopulation of MDD patients with a history of trauma. A significantly lower risk of relapse was also observed with vortioxetine.

Socio-demographic and psychiatric risk factors in incident and persistent depression: An analysis in the occupational cohort of ELSA-Brasil,"Background: Depression is a main source of disability worldwide. Identifying risk factors associated with incident and persistent episodes could inform clinical practice and hence mitigate their burden. However, previous research has focused on populations from developed countries. Thus, we evaluated sociodemographic risk factors and psychiatric comorbidities associated with incident and persistent depression in a large Brazilian occupational cohort. Methods: We examined baseline (2008–2010, n = 15,105) and follow-up (2012–2014) data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Based on the presence of depression diagnosis at two timepoints, we diagnosed persistent and incident depression. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to explore risk factors associated with incident and persistent depression. As gender is associated with the exposure and outcome variables, analyses stratified by gender were also conducted. Results: Presence of any anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and female gender were significant ( p &lt; 0.001) risk factors for depression incidence (odds ratios of 2.59, 3.6, and 1.82, respectively) and persistence (odds ratios of 6.94, 14.37, and 2.85, respectively) in multiple models, whereas having university degree decreased the odds of depression incidence (0.74) and persistence (0.45). In stratified analyses, the effects of low education were only evident in women. Limitations: Brief depressive episodes could not be measured by our assessments. Conclusion: In this occupational cohort, female gender, low education and psychiatric comorbidities were associated with unfavorable depression courses. Interventions targeting comorbidities could prevent depression incidence and persistence.

The programming role of maternal antenatal inflammation on infants’ early neurodevelopment: A review of human studies,"Background: Maternal inflammation during pregnancy is a frequently proposed mechanism underlying the link between maternal antenatal physical (e.g. infections, immune disease, obesity) and/or psychological (e.g. depression, anxiety) conditions and child outcomes. However, the extent to which maternal inflammation is directly associated with offspring's early development and health in humans remains largely unknown. Methods: In this review, empirical findings on the prospective association between maternal prenatal levels of inflammatory markers and infants’ neurodevelopmental outcomes are summarized. Fifteen studies were included with sample sizes ranging from 36 to 6016 mother-infant dyads and average overall quality score 9.53 (range 6–12). Results: Findings concerning the link between maternal antenatal inflammation and, respectively, infants’ health and birth outcomes, stress reactivity or cognitive development are mixed. However, it is noteworthy that all higher quality studies (scores &gt; 10) reviewed here do find evidence of an association between levels of inflammation, mostly as indexed by Interleukin-6 (IL-6), in healthy women across the whole gestation and offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes, including structural and functional brain alterations. Limitations: The correlational nature of the findings and conspicuous methodological heterogeneity across studies make drawing strong conclusions premature. Conclusions: Findings, albeit preliminary, are consistent with animal studies and speak in favor of a role of maternal antenatal inflammation in shaping fetal development with possible long-term effects.

Patient interest in mental health mobile app interventions: Demographic and symptom-level differences,"Background: Mobile app interventions for mental health conditions (MH apps) are an accessible and effective but underutilized treatment option. Learning which patients are most interested in MH apps is important for informing stakeholders where to position these treatments within the healthcare landscape. This study examined the relationship between patient characteristics and interest in MH apps. Methods: A demographically-balanced sample of 400 patients diagnosed with depression, anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder were identified from VA corporate data warehouse records. These individuals were mailed an information packet explaining the study and the study survey for those who opted to participate. The survey contained questions on demographics, symptom severity and interest in MH apps. 149 participants returned completed surveys. Results: Level of interest in MH apps was consistent across race, sex and education level. Patients reporting no interest in MH apps had less severe symptoms and were older than patients reporting some or high interest. Limitations: Participants were Veterans in one geographic region; our sample size was not large enough to evaluate more fine-grained demographic differences; replication would be required to better understand generalizability of findings. Conclusions: Findings suggest interest in MH apps may be more similar across demographic groups than previously thought. This stands in juxtaposition to interest in clinic-based services, for which men and minorities have traditionally reported less interest and show lower utilization. Findings also counter prevailing notions that MH apps will be best received by less symptomatic patients. Implications for integrating MH apps into care are discussed.

Reverse translation of major depressive disorder symptoms: A framework for the behavioural phenotyping of putative biomarkers,"Background: Reverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is complex because Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogenous condition. This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant bio-behavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptoms. Methods: This systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of MDD and anti-depressant treatment response including the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in laboratory rodents. Results: The resulting battery of tests includes passive coping, anxiety-like behaviours, sleep, caloric intake, cognition, psychomotor functions, hedonic reactivity and aversive learning. These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD, providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be interpreted. Limitations: Certain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents, and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevance. Conclusions: Using this reverse translation approach, it is possible to clarify the functional significance of a putative biomarker in rodents and hence translate its contribution to specific clinical symptoms, or clusters of symptoms.

Results: Findings concerning the link between maternal antenatal inflammation and, respectively, infants’ health and birth outcomes, stress reactivity or cognitive development are mixed. However, it is noteworthy that all higher quality studies (scores &gt; 10) reviewed here do find evidence of an association between levels of inflammation, mostly as indexed by Interleukin-6 (IL-6), in healthy women across the whole gestation and offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes, including structural and functional brain alterations. Limitations: The correlational nature of the findings and conspicuous methodological heterogeneity across studies make drawing strong conclusions premature. Conclusions: Findings, albeit preliminary, are consistent with animal studies and speak in favor of a role of maternal antenatal inflammation in shaping fetal development with possible long-term effects.

Differences in the immune-inflammatory profiles of unipolar and bipolar depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD) both share increased immune-inflammatory activation. However, there are unclear patterns of differences in peripheral immune profiles between them. Methods: We examined such differences in 245 MDD and 59 BD patients, recruited in the same center, who were in an acute depressive episode of moderate severity. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models were used to compare levels of plasma biomarkers between groups and to predict dichotomous classification. Results: Interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, IL-12 and IL-10 were significantly higher in MDD than in BD, whereas IL-6, sTNFR2, IL-18, IL-33, ST2 (IL1R Like 1) and KLOTHO were significantly higher in BD than in MDD. Moreover, logistic regression analyses correctly classified BD and MDD patients with 98.1% accuracy, using a combination of IL-6, IL-8, ST2, sTNFR2 (directly associated with BD) and IL-12 and TNF-α (directly associated with MDD). Patients with MDD with melancholic features showed higher IL-1β levels than those without melancholia. The sTNFR1 / sTNFR2 ratio significantly predicted MDD and state and trait anxiety and negative affect. Results remained significant after covariate adjustment, including drug use. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Lack of control comparison group. Differences in exposure to medications among participants. Conclusions: Differences in immune profiles between BD and MDD patients exist, especially for the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS): increased IL-10 is the primary immune-regulatory mechanism in MDD, while increased sTNFR2 and KLOTHO are the primary regulatory mechanisms in BD.

Search trends preceding increases in suicide: A cross-correlation study of monthly Google search volume and suicide rate using transfer function models,"Background: Various associations between monthly Google search volumes (MGSVs) and monthly suicide rates (MSRs) have been reported. However, these studies often analyzed a limited number of search terms using suboptimal statistical methods. While controlling for spurious associations, this study examined a wide array of suicide-related search terms to elucidate if their MGSVs correlated with future MSRs. Methods: MGSVs of 111 candidate suicide-related terms were calculated by averaging 10 time-series data per term obtained from Google Trends. Box-Jenkins transfer function modeling was applied to time-series data of MGSV and MSR among the total, male, and female populations of the United States between 2004 and 2017. Cross-correlation coefficients between MGSVs and MSRs were calculated at lags -3, -2, and -1. Sensitivity analysis identified cross-correlations whose direction and significance ( p &lt; 0.05) persisted in two other time spans: 126 and 84 months. Results: Eighty-nine terms were analyzed. MGSVs of 31 terms significantly correlated with MSRs in the total, male, or female population. In the sensitivity analysis, three terms stably exhibited significant positive correlation: “ generalized anxiety disorder ” (total; lag -3), “ anxiety disorder ” (total and male; lag -3), and “ laid off ” (total, male, and female; lag -2). The term sleep problem (total and female; lag -1) consistently showed significant negative correlations. Limitations: Sex- or age-specific search-volume data, lags of less than a month, and potential confounding factors of MGSV and MSR were not explored. Conclusions: trends in MGSV of four terms tend to precede changes in MSR. These terms may enable more accurate forecasting of future suicides.

The predictive performance of the Bipolarity Index in a Dutch epidemiological sample manuscript,"Background: No instrument exists that can predict the incidence of bipolar disorders (BD). The Bipolarity index (BI), originally developed to improve diagnostic confidence for a lifetime diagnosis of BD, may predict incident BD. Aim: To assess the predictive performance of the BI for incident BD in persons with a lifetime depression. Methods: The BI score was composed from different questionnaires and interviews in n = 1857 subjects without BD and with a lifetime unipolar depressive disorder from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a longitudinal cohort study. The incidence of DSM-IV defined BD I or II as a criterion diagnosis was established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years of follow-up. Cox regression analyses calculated whether the BI predicts incident BD during 9-years of follow-up. The area Under the Curve (AUC) was determined. At the optimal cut-off score, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated. Results: Over the course of 9 years, bipolar conversion occurred in n = 46 subjects (2.5%). Each point increase in BI score significantly predicted incident BD (HR[95%CI]= 1.047[1.018–1.076], p = 0.001). The AUC was 0.61 (95%CI: 0.54–0.68). At the optimal cut-off of 30, sensitivity was 67%, specificity 52%, PPV 3% and NPV 98%. Limitations: Not all items of the BI were fully covered; mean age of the sample of 42. Conclusion: The BI score predicts bipolar conversion over 9 years in those with a lifetime depression. However, given the modest performance metrics, the BI cannot guide clinical decision making yet.

Mental health diagnoses and early removal of long-acting reversible contraception,"Background: Having a mental health diagnosis is associated with contraceptive non-adherence and user-related contraceptive failures of short-acting methods. There is a lack of research on the relationship between mental health diagnoses and early discontinuation of highly effective long-acting reversible (LARC) methods such as the intrauterine device (IUD) and subdermal implant (SDI). Methods: Using a Primary Care and Obstetrics and Gynecology Patient Data Registry, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between any mental health diagnosis (any anxiety disorder or depression) and early LARC removal (&lt; 1 year post-insertion) among 385 reproductive-aged (14–50 years) women in 2008–16. Adjusted logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Almost 10% ( n = 37) of the sample had an early LARC removal, of which 62.2% were hormonal IUD and 37.8% were SDI. Women with a mental health diagnosis had a higher prevalence of early LARC removal (13.6% vs. 8.0%, p = =.090). Although non-significant, there was a trend in adjusted analyses indicating twice the odds of early removal for women with a mental health diagnosis versus no diagnosis (OR = =2.04, 95% CI = =0.97–4.27). Limitations: This study is limited by a small sample size and availability of variables from a reportable medical record database. Pregnancy intentions and side effects of method use could not be accounted for which may have impacted timing of removal. Conclusions: Understanding why women choose early LARC removal can inform counseling to help women make informed choices about their contraceptive method that meets their reproductive needs.

Sedentary behavior and depression among community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years: Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing,"Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) may be a risk factor for depression in middle- and old age adults. The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between SB and depression in a large national sample of Irish people aged 50 and older taking into account a wide range of previously identified influential factors. Methods: Data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing survey were analyzed (wave 1: 2009–2011, wave 2: 2012–2013). Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Total weekday SB and control variables were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted to assess the associations. Results: The final sample consisted of 6903 individuals aged ≥ 50 years (63.6 ± 9.2 years; 52.1% female). After full adjustment for age, gender, social class, current smoking, physical activity, mobility, pain, cognition, chronic physical conditions, disability, anxiety, loneliness, and social network, the association between SB and depression was not statistically significant (OR = 1.06; 95%CI = 0.60–1.89). Mediation analysis showed that the association is explained by social network (mediated percentage 23.1%), physical activity (20.3%), loneliness (13.2%), chronic physical conditions (11.1%), and disability (7.9%). Cross-sectional analysis showed that SB is significantly associated with depression even after full adjustment. Limitations: SB was self-reported. Conclusions: Factors closely linked with SB such as social isolation, loneliness, physical inactivity, chronic physical conditions, and disability may play a major role in depression among middle-aged and older people. Lifestyle interventions focusing on reductions in depression in this population need to consider these factors.

A randomized clinical trial investigating perceived burdensomeness as a mediator of brief intervention effects on posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and impairing condition that often involves difficulties with interpersonal functioning. Targeting interpersonal difficulties may be a promising alternative approach to reducing PTSD symptoms, particularly given the relatively low rates of treatment engagement and efficacy for first-line treatments for PTSD. Recent research has identified perceived burdensomeness (i.e., feelings of being a burden on others) and thwarted belongingness (i.e., feeling isolated and as if one does not belong) as two specific interpersonal factors related to increased PTSD symptoms. Thus, the current study tested whether a brief, computerized intervention would reduce PTSD symptoms via reductions in perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, vs. a repeated contact control condition. Method: Hypotheses were tested among 250 trauma-exposed participants who were randomized to receive one of two active computerized interventions designed to target interpersonal factors (i.e., perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness) or anxiety sensitivity, or participate in a repeated contact control condition, as part of a larger randomized clinical trial. Participants were then followed over six-months. Results: Results indicated a direct effect of the active interventions on PTSD symptoms at month-one, that was not detected at months three or six. However, there was a significant indirect effect of condition at all-time points, such that reductions in perceived burdensomeness mediated condition effects on PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Findings identify perceived burdensomeness as a potential etiological factor in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms, and suggest that targeting perceived burdensomeness may be an effective approach to reducing PTSD symptoms.

Intimate partner violence and maternal mental health ten years after a first birth: An Australian prospective cohort study of first-time mothers,"Background: We aimed to assess the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and maternal mental health ten years after a first birth Methods: 1507 first-time mothers completed questionnaires at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postpartum and 4 and ten years post the index birth. Exposure to IPV was assessed using the Composite Abuse Scale at 1, 4 and ten years. Standardised measures of depressive (CES-D), anxiety (BAI) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL-C) were completed at ten-year follow-up. Results: One in three (34%) women experienced IPV between the birth of their first child and their child turning 10. For the one in six women (18.6%) who experienced IPV in the year prior to ten-year follow-up, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 38.9% compared with 14.2% for women who never reported IPV (adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–4.5). Prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 28.1% compared with 8.5% (AdjOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0–5.9); and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms was 41.9% compared with 11.3% (AdjOR 4.9, 95% CI 3.0–7.9). Limitations: Mental health symptoms and exposure to IPV were assessed by self-report and may be subject to misclassification bias as a result of non-disclosure. Conclusions: The high prevalence of mental health symptoms among women exposed to IPV in the ten years after giving birth coupled with the extent of post-traumatic stress symptoms and co-morbid mental health symptoms reinforce the need to provide appropriate care and referral pathways to women in the decade after having a baby. Recognition of the context of IPV and nature of mental health concerns is needed in tailoring responses.

Affective temperaments in caregiver of patients with bipolar disorder and their relation to caregiver burden,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is impose a severe burden on caregivers. The aspects of the burden should be evaluated from broad perspective, because caregivers contribute greatly to the treatment process. Affective temperaments are widely distributed in the population, in their mild forms can provide adaptive properties. The aim of this study was to assess the affective temperaments among caregiver of patients with BD and to evaluate the impact of affective temperaments on the burden. Methods: The study sample included 101 caregivers of patients diagnosed with BD type I according to DSM-5 and 107 healthy volunteers. The Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego self-report questionnaire (TEMPS-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were administered to both groups, and the Burden Assessment Scale (BAS) was administered to caregivers. Results: The hyperthymic and depressive temperament scores were higher in the caregivers than in the controls, and hyperthymic and depressive temperaments were predictor factors for caregiver. Irritable temperament also adversely affected the caregiver burden, but hyperthymic temperament was not related to development of burden. The mean BAS score was 43.2 ± 11 for the caregivers. The caregiver HDRS and HARS scores and the number of manic episodes were related to the level of burden. Limitation: Cross-sectional study Conclusion: Affective temperaments may be related to being a caregiver and to the caregiver burden. Hyperthymic and depressive temperaments may indicate predisposition for being a caregiver. Irritable temperament adversely affects burden, whereas hyperthymic temperament could protect the caregiver from burden.

Latent structure and factor invariance of somatic symptoms in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15),"Background: Somatic symptoms are highly prevalent in primary care although insufficiently understood. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) is a valuable screening test but it has not yet been possible to unequivocally demonstrate its latent structure and measurement invariance. Methods: A total of 1,255 patients from 28 primary care centres suffering symptoms of anxiety, depression or somatisation participated in a clinical trial. They completed the PHQ-15 at baseline and 374 retook it at three months. Exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) was used to compare three models: 1) a single global factor for somatisation, 2) four specific correlated factors, and 3) a bifactor model integrating the first two models. Results: A multi-group invariance analysis of the best-fit model was performed: the bifactor model (χ² = 25.17, df = 23, p = 0.34, RMSEA = 0.009, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 0.999). Strict invariance was good for both gender (RMSEA = 0.046, CFI = 0.973, TLI = 0.963) and age (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.964, TLI = 0.962). Configural and metric invariance were confirmed for moment of assessment, but scalar invariance was not. Limitations: The two main limitations were the sample (primary care patients with emotional disorders), which was not representative of the general population, and the utilisation of ESEM (vs. confirmatory factor analysis), which did not allow a second-order factor model to be tested. Conclusions: PHQ-15 showed a bifactor structure, providing both a single global measure of somatisation and specific measures of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary and fatigue factors. Its factor invariance with regard to both gender and age was confirmed.

Modulation of the inflammatory response benefits treatment-resistant bipolar depression: A randomized clinical trial,"Objective: The goal of this study was to reduce treatment resistance and enhance antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBDD) by modulating inflammatory activation. Methods: Forty-seven TRBDD patients completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled two-arm study using celecoxib (CBX), a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in combination with escitalopram (ESC). The Hamilton Depression (17-Item) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scales were used to quantify symptom severity. Self-rating instruments included BDI, BAI and QLES-Q questioner. An adverse events inventory was used, and the possibility of bleeding diathesis was monitored. Complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined. Comparison of mood scores between the CBX and PBO groups were conducted using a mixed ANOVA and an Independent Sample Student t -test. Results: The CBX adjunctive treatment produced significantly more responders and remitters than the PBO arm. Compared to the PBO group ( n = 20), the CBX group ( n = 27) experienced lower depression severity through the entire course of the study, showing significant decrease in depression and anxiety scores as early as week 1. Except for initial mild nausea, no adverse events were reported and study medications were well tolerated. Conclusions: Modulation of the inflammatory response through targeted inhibition of the enzyme COX-2 by means of CBX reduces TRBDD and augments and accelerates treatment response in an efficacious and safe manner. Future studies should replicate these findings and additionally investigate whether prolonged administration of CBX is required to maintain remission by adding a discontinuation phase to the study design.

Socio-demographic and clinical risk factors of treatment-resistant depression: A Danish population-based cohort study,"Background: Knowledge of risk factors of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes to understand the underlying mechanisms and to identify patients at risk. However, there is still a lack of studies on how different risk factors associate with TRD. The objective of this study was to determine the independent association of several socio-demographic and clinical risk factors with TRD. Methods: 194.074 patients with a first-time hospital contact for depression identified in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) from 1996 through 2014 were followed for TRD for 12 months after diagnosis. Socio-demographic and clinical risk factors were identified in nation-wide registries. Data were analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazard Regression and Fine-Gray model for competing mortality risk. Results: Indicators of disease severity (recurrent depression (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.17 (1.14–1.20)), severity of depression (aHR 2.01 (1.95–2.08)), admission to a psychiatric ward (aHR 2.03 (1.96, 2.10)) were strong risk factors. Aged 65–84 (aHR 1.96 (1.83–2.10)), lost labor market affiliation ((aHR 1.12 (1.08, 1.16)), cohabiting (aHR 1.27 (1.23, 1.30)), comorbid anxiety (aHR 1.18 (1.10–1.27)), insomnia (aHR 1.27 (1.06–1.51)), migraine (aHR 1.42 (1.16–1.73)) and use of psychotropic drugs was also associated with higher rates of TRD. Limitations: Information on drug use during hospitalization was not available. Information on rating scales could have provided a more precise assessment of symptom severity and treatment response. Conclusions: Besides indicators of disease severity, other important risk factors associated with TRD are age, lost labor market affiliation, cohabiting with a partner as well as anxiety, insomnia, migraine and the use of psychotropic medications.

"The role of self-compassion in the relationship between attachment, depression, and quality of life","Background: Self-compassion may be shaped by early attachment experiences, and has been linked to mental health and well-being. This study examined the role of two distinct features of self-compassion, self-warmth and self-coldness, in the relationship between attachment insecurity and depression as well as quality of life in a general population sample in Germany. Methods: Participants ( N = 2,253; 53.4% female, M age 50 years) completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Adult Attachment Scale (AAS), Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Mediation analysis was used to examine whether insecure attachment predicted increased symptoms of depression and decreased quality of life through decreased self-warmth and increased self-coldness. Results: Attachment-related anxiety and avoidance had a significant direct effect on depressive symptoms and significant indirect effect via self-warmth and self-coldness. The indirect effect via self-warmth appears to be of negligible magnitude. Attachment-related anxiety and avoidance had a significant direct effect on quality of life, and significant indirect effect via self-coldness. The indirect effect via self-warmth was not statistically significant, speaking against self-warmth as a relevant mediator. Limitations: Causal conclusions cannot be drawn based on cross-sectional research design. All measures were based on participant self-report. Conclusions: This study contributes to a more differentiated understanding of how attachment insecurity and self-compassion may contribute to affective disorders. Findings suggest that self-coldness may be particularly relevant in affective disorders and when addressing relational struggles, with both theoretical and clinical implications for psychotherapy and future research.

Connectivity between the anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex links early symptom improvement to treatment response,"Background: Early improvement (EI) following treatment with antidepressants is a widely reported predictor to the treatment response. This study aimed to identify the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and its related clinical features that link the treatment response at the time of EI. Methods: This study included 23 first-episode treatment-naive patients with MDD. After 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment, these patients received 3.0 Tesla resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and were subgrouped into an EI group ( N = 13) and a non-EI group ( N = 10). Using the anterior insula (rAI) as a seed region, this study identified the rs-FC that were associated with both EI and the treatment response at week 12, and further tested the associations of the identified rs-FC with either the clinical features or the early symptom improvement. Results: Rs-FC between rAI and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was associated with EI ( t ₂₁ = −6.091, p = 0.022 after FDR correction for multiple comparisons). This rs-FC was also associated with an interaction between EI and the treatment response at the week 12 ( t ₂₁ = −5.361, p = 6.37e-5). Moreover, among the clinical features, this rs-FC was associated with the early symptom improvement in the insomnia, somatic symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and these early symptom improvements were associated with the treatment response. Conclusion: Rs-FC between the rAI and the left dlPFC played a crucial role in the early antidepressant effect, which linked the treatment response. The early treatment effect relating to rAI may represent an early symptom improvement in self-perceptual anxiety, somatic symptoms and insomnia.

Bisexual individuals are at greater risk of poor mental health than lesbians and gay men: The mediating role of sexual identity stress at multiple levels,"Background: Although earlier studies have indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals are at greater risk of psychiatric symptoms than heterosexual individuals, limited attention has been paid to the mental health disparities within LGB populations, especially in non-Western societies. This study examined the disparities in depression, anxiety, and mental well-being between gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals and investigated how the disparities are explained by the greater sexual identity stress experienced by bisexual individuals compared to their gay and lesbian counterparts. Methods: The study sample included 931 cisgender LGB individuals in Hong Kong, with 70.1% identifying as gay/lesbian and 29.9% identifying as bisexual. They completed a self-report questionnaire on sexual identity stress and mental health. Results: Bisexual individuals showed higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than lesbians and gay men. Structural equation modeling showed that, compared with lesbians and gay men, bisexual individuals were more likely to report identity uncertainty, conceal their sexual orientation, and have a weaker sense of connection to the LGBT community, which were in turn associated with greater affective symptoms and poorer mental well-being. Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data does not allow conclusions on causal relationships among variables. Conclusions: Given the greater vulnerability of bisexual individuals to common mental health problems, evidence-based psychological interventions that strategically target their identity stress at multiple levels should be developed and made available to those in need. Social and psychoeducational interventions are also necessary to transform the monosexist culture and eradicate binegativity in the LGBT and wider communities.

The comorbidity of mental and physical disorders with self-reported chronic back or neck pain: Results from the China Mental Health Survey,"Background: To investigate mental and physical health comorbidity with chronic back or neck pain in the Chinese population, and assess the level of disability associated with chronic back or neck pain. Methods: Data were derived from a large-scale and nationally representative community survey of adult respondents on mental health disorders in China ( n = 28,140). Chronic back or neck pain, other chronic pain conditions and chronic physical conditions were assessed by self-report. Mental disorders were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Role disability during the past 30 days was assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS-II). Results: The 12-month prevalence of chronic back or neck pain was 10.8%. Most of respondents with chronic back or neck pain (71.2%) reported at least one other comorbid condition, including other chronic pain conditions (53.4%), chronic physical conditions (37.9%), and mental disorders (23.9%). It was found by logistic regression that mood disorders (OR = 3.7, 95%CI:2.8–4.8) showed stronger association with chronic back or neck pain than anxiety disorders and substance disorders. Most common chronic pains and physical conditions were significantly associated with chronic back or neck pain. Chronic back or neck pain was associated with role disability after controlling for demographics and for comorbidities. Physical and mental comorbidities explained 0.7% of the association between chronic back or neck pain and role disability. Conclusions: Chronic back or neck pain and physical-mental comorbidity is very common in China and chronic back or neck pain may increase the likelihood of other physical and mental diseases. This presents a great challenge for both clinical treatment and public health education. We believe that further study needs to be conducted to improve the diagnostic and management skills for comorbidity conditions.

Electronic cigarette use and mental health: A Canadian population-based study,"Background: To examine the association between electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use and adverse mental health status. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the 2015 and 2016 Canadian Community Health Survey ( n = 53,050). Sampling weights and associated bootstrap procedures were used to account for survey design effects. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to examine the association between e-cigarette use and the following mental health outcomes: depressive symptom ratings (using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9), self-reported professionally diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, perceived mental health, suicidal thoughts/attempts, and binge drinking. Results: The overall prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.6–3.1). 11.5% (95% CI: 10.4–12.7) of smokers reported also using e-cigarettes. Dual users had the highest prevalence of adverse mental health status. The association between e-cigarette use and mental health was found to be modified by smoking status and sex in most of the logistic models. E-cigarettes had less than multiplicative effects among smokers. Female e-cigarette users tended to have higher odds of adverse mental health than male users. Overall, in the multivariable modeling, e-cigarette use was consistently associated with poor mental health among non-smokers and women, a finding that persisted after adjustment for additional covariates. Conclusions: These results indicate that e-cigarette use is associated with adverse mental health status, particularly among the non-smoking general population and women. Limitations: The study relied on respondent self-report, and the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to clarify the direction of this association.

"Temporal stability of symptoms of affective disorders, cognitive vulnerability and personality over time","Background: Signs and symptoms of psychopathology can be chronic but are generally regarded as less stable over time than markers of cognitive vulnerability and personality. Some findings suggest that these differences in temporal stability are modest in size but a rigorous examination across concepts is lacking. The current study investigated the temporal stability of affective symptoms, cognitive vulnerability markers and personality traits at various assessments over nine years. Methods: Participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were assessed at baseline and reassessed after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years. They were grouped on the basis of waves of depression and anxiety CIDI-diagnoses into stable healthy ( n = 768), stable patients ( n = 352) and unstable patients ( n = 821). We determined temporal stability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and consistency indices of latent state-trait analyses (LST). Results: Temporal stability was moderate to high for symptoms (range ICC's 0.54–0.73; range consistency 0.64–0.74), cognitive vulnerability (range ICC's 0.53–0.76; range consistency 0.60–0.74) and personality (range ICC's 0.57–0.80; range consistency.60 -0.75). Consistency indices for all measures were on average a bit lower in the unstable group (ICC = 0.54) compared to the stable groups (ICC = 0.61). Overall stability was similarly high after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years.

White matter connectivity differences between treatment responders and non-responders in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Panic disorder (PD) is a prevalent and highly disabling mental condition. However, less is known about relationships between biomarkers that may together predict a better response to pharmacological treatment. The objective of the present study was to compare the brain white matter (WM) connectivity between treatment-responsive patients with panic disorder (RPD) and non-responsive patients with panic disorder (NRPD) after 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Methods: Sixty-four patients with PD were enrolled in this study (RPD, n = 37; NRPD, n = 27). All patients were examined by using magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered at baseline of the study. Fractional anisotropy (FA) data were compared using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: TBSS results showed that the FA values of the patients with NRPD were significantly higher than of those with RPD in the WM regions such as the precentral gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, posterior parts of the corpus callosum, and precuneus. Symptom severity scales, such as ASI-R scores, showed significant positive correlations of the FA values with the fronto-temporal WM regions in NRPD. Conclusions: These results suggest that structural changes to areas such as the fronto-limbic regions and the posterior part of default mode network, could influence medication response in PD. Further studies with a larger number of patients should be performed to confirm our findings.

Sedentary behavior relates to mental distress of pregnant women differently across trimesters: An observational study in China,"Background: The independent effect of sedentary behavior (SB) on maternal mental health is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the different relationships of SB with maternal distress in pregnant women across the three trimesters, controlling for the confounding factors including physical activity (PA), diet and gestational weight gain. Methods: Survey data were collected from 1272 participants in different trimesters of pregnancy. The data were divided into three data sets based on trimester, and regression analysis was conducted on each data set. Both the linear and quadratic relationships between SB and mental distress were estimated. Results: There was no significant association between SB and any mental distress symptoms in the first trimester. In the second trimester, SB was positively associated with higher mental overall distress symptoms (β = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001), including depress and anxiety. There is an inverted-U shaped curvilinear relationship between SB and mental distress in the third trimester, as SB-squared is significantly associated with mental overall distress (GSI: β = -0.65, P = 0.002, depression: β = -0.53, P = 0.014, anxiety: β = -0.46, P = 0.031). Limitations: The data were collected from only one city in China, which may limit the generalizability of the findings for all Chinese women. This was an observational study and causality cannot be established. Conclusion: This study found that the relationship between SB and maternal mental distress depends on trimesters. The stage of pregnancy should be considered when designing interventions for pregnant women to change SB to reduce mental distress.

“Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5: Psychometric properties in a Japanese population”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5: Psychometric properties in a Japanese population"" by Masaya Ito, Yoshitake Takebayashi, Yuriko Suzuki and Masaru Horikoshi ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2019[Mar][15], Vol 247, 11-19). In the original article, a sentence in the acknowledgement was incorrect. The corrected expression is: “Dr. Yoder, Dr. Weathers, Mr. Bernick, and Ms. Akiyama have no conflicts of interest to declare.” (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-05830-003). Background: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) is a widely used self-report measure of PTSD. The reliability/precision and validity of the updated PCL version for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (PCL-5) have only been evaluated in limited populations. This study aimed to examine the factor structure, reliability/precision, and validity of the PCL-5 as assessed by convergent and discriminant relationships with related constructs among Japanese individuals who experienced various traumatic events. Methods: We conducted an online survey of Japanese adults using the PCL-5 and other assessments for PTSD, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric comorbidities, and functionality. A total of 3090 individuals who met a probable diagnosis of PTSD and another 1837 who had experienced traumatic events but did not meet the probable PTSD diagnosis answered the questionnaires. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the best fit with a 7-factor model. This factor structure was temporally stable across 2 time points for 4 months. The total and subscale scores showed good internal consistency and modest test-retest reliability. The convergent and discriminant relationships of the PCL-5 total score with related constructs were demonstrated. Limitations: This study did not use the gold standard interview to assess the diagnostic status of PTSD. Also, the sampled population was younger and had lower incomes in comparison to the census data. Conclusions: Our results support the utility of the PCL-5 for assessing PTSD symptoms in Asian populations.

Does multispecies probiotic decrease anxiety of young adults: A comment,"Comments on an article by N. Tran et al. (see record 2019-35165-035). In the analysis of the data, the authors did not check the normality distribution assumption as a preliminary of the t-student test or any other paramedic tests. In case of violating normality assumption, non-parametric test such Mann–whitey U should be run to test the difference between two groups of intervention and placebo. Another strategy is to apply transformation functions such as log-transformation in order to rescale the data and provide normal distribution. The rest of the models that analyzes were run in subgroups with lower sample sizes the situation even will get worse.

Ratio of plasma BDNF to leptin levels are associated with treatment response in major depressive disorder but not in panic disorder: A 12-week follow-up study,"Background: A link between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and the mood regulatory effect of leptin has been suggested in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). We investigated treatment response and pre-treatment leptin and BDNF in patients with MDD and with panic disorder (PD). Methods: We recruited 41 patients with MDD, 52 patients with PD, and 59 matched healthy controls. All subjects completed five visits (at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks), and both MDD and PD patients were treated with standard pharmacotherapy for 12 weeks. Plasma BDNF (pBDNF) and blood leptin levels were obtained along with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale rating (HDRS-17) score at every visit. Results: The ratio of pre-treatment pBDNF to leptin was significantly lower in patients with MDD and PD compared to healthy controls ( p = 0.024), but was not associated with severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Pre-treatment pBDNF:leptin ratio was significantly higher in treatment responders than in non-responders ( p = 0.012) in MDD but not in PD. This difference was larger in MDD patients with appetite loss ( p = 0.034). In multivariate analysis, pre-treatment pBDNF:leptin ratio was significantly associated with treatment responsiveness (Adjusted Odds Ration [AOR] = 2.50, 95% CI 1.02–6.14) in MDD. Limitation: small sample size; limited information on detailed pharmacological effects. Conclusions: A relatively higher ratio of pre-treatment pBDNF to leptin was associated with greater treatment response in MDD but not in PD. Further research should focus on exploration of a link between BDNF and leptin underlying neuronal plasticity in depression.

Investigating the potential role of BDNF and PRL genotypes on antidepressant response in depression patients: A prospective inception cohort study in treatment-free patients,"Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with response to antidepressant drugs in mood and anxiety disorders. Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone with behavioural effects, acting as a neurotrophic factor within the brain and may be involved in antidepressant response. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between BDNF and PRL genotypes with antidepressant drug response. Methods: Prospective inception cohort of 186 Russian treatment-free participants (28 men and 158 women) between 18 and 70 years clinically diagnosed with depressive disorder who initiated antidepressant medication. DNA polymorphisms were genotyped for PRL rs1341239, BDNF rs6265 and rs7124442. Primary outcome was measured by differences in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (∆HAM-D) scores between baseline/week two, week two/week four, and baseline/week four. Linear regression and independent t -test determined the significance between polymorphisms and ∆HAM-D. Results: Comparisons between genotypes did not reveal any significant differences in scores during the first two weeks of treatment. In the latter two weeks, BDNF rs7124442 homozygous C patients responded significantly worse in comparison to homozygous T patients during this period. Further analysis within women and in post-menopausal women found a similar comparison between alleles. Limitations: Study lasted four weeks, which may be considered short to associate genuine antidepressant effects. Conclusions: Patients taking tricylic antidepressants were noted to have a significant improvement in ∆HAM-D compared to patients taking SSRIs. Homozygous C BDNF rs712442 patients were found to respond significantly worse in the last two weeks of treatment.

Body dysmorphic disorder and major depressive episode have comorbidity-independent associations with suicidality in an acute psychiatric setting,"Background: This study sought to examine whether mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders have unique (comorbidity-independent) associations with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in an acute psychiatric population. Methods: Patients ( N = 498) were evaluated during admission to a partial hospital. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess current psychiatric diagnoses and past-month suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors (e.g., suicide attempts). Results: After adjusting for age, gender and other psychiatric disorders, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) had a significant association with suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] = 6.62; 95% CI, 1.92–22.79) and suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.05–5.71). Similarly, major depressive episode was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 3.00; 95% CI, 1.95–4.63) and suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.12–3.98). When unipolar and bipolar depression were analyzed separately, unipolar depression was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.20–2.74), but not suicidal behaviors, whereas, bipolar depression was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.36–5.40) and marginally with suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.02; 95% CI, 0.99–4.13). Anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder were unrelated to suicidality in this sample after controlling for comorbid disorders. Limitations: Cross-sectional design and a relatively small sample for analyses of low base-rate conditions. Conclusions: Major depressive episode and BDD are unique markers of suicidality in an acute psychiatric setting. BDD is a common but often underdiagnosed condition, and clinicians should be aware of high rates of suicidality among these patients.

Adverse childhood experiences and mental health: Comparing the link in rural and urban men who have sex with men,"Background: Research shows individuals experiencing adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as well as identifying as a man who has sex with other men (MSM) are at an increased risk for mental health issues. Less has been studied, however, on ACEs in MSM; with even fewer studies investigating non-urban (e.g., rural/small town/suburban) MSM, as most research features urban samples. This is problematic due to studies showing that rurality can influence the behavior of MSM. The current study comparatively investigates the impact of ACEs on the mental health of rural/small town/suburban and urban MSM. Methods: Participants included 156 MSM residing in Oklahoma. Linear regression was used to test the association between ACEs’ and mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness). Split-sample regressions were conducted on rural/small town/suburban and urban MSM. Results: ACEs were associated with all three mental health outcomes in the full sample. However, ACEs were significantly linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms only in urban MSM. Limitations: Limitations include a smaller sample size with limited racial/ethnic variations. Conclusions: Results suggest that living in an urban environment may amplify the risks of ACEs, rural/small town/suburban MSM may acquire outside, unique support networks which work to limit the effect of ACEs, or that rural/small town/suburban MSM may manifest the effects of ACEs differently (or a combination of the three). Trauma-informed programming has been shown to effectively reduce mental health issues, yet consideration is generally not given with regards to rurality. Future programming and research should consider rurality/urbanity as influential factor.

The association between mental disorders and suicide: A systematic review and meta-analysis of record linkage studies,"Background: There has long been debate about the extent to which mental disorders contribute to suicide. We aimed to examine the evidence on the contribution of mental disorders to suicide among record linkage studies. Methods: We performed a systematic search using eight major health databases for English-language studies published between 1 January 2000 and 11 June 2018 that linked collected data on mental disorders and suicide. We then conducted a meta-analysis to assess risk of suicide conferred by mental disorders. Results: Our search identified 20 articles representing 13 unique studies. The pooled rate ratio (RR) was 13.2 (95% CI 8.6–20.3) for psychotic disorders, 12.3 (95% CI 8.9–17.1) for mood disorders, 8.1 (95% CI 4.6–14.2) for personality disorders, 4.4 (95% CI 2.9–6.8) for substance use disorders, and 4.1 (95% CI 2.4–6.9) for anxiety disorders in the general population. The overall pooled RR for these mental disorders was 7.5 (95% CI 6.6–8.6). The population attributable risk of mental disorders was up to 21%. Limitations: The overall heterogeneity between studies was very high. Conclusions: Our findings underline the important role of mental disorders in suicide. This suggests that ongoing efforts are required to improve access to and quality of mental health care to prevent suicide by people with mental disorders.

Prenatal SSRI antidepressant use and maternal internalizing symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum: Exploring effects on infant temperament trajectories for boys and girls,"Background: The severity and treatment of depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum has important implications for maternal and child well-being. Yet, little is known about prenatal SSRI use and early child socioemotional development. This study explores effects of prenatal SSRI exposure, and pre- and postnatal internalizing symptoms on trajectories of infant temperament, identifying potential differences for boys and girls. Methods: Using latent growth models, sex differences in infant temperament trajectories from 3- to 10-months were examined in relation to prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms and prenatal SSRI exposure among 185 mother-infant dyads. Results: For girls, prenatal internalizing symptoms were associated with greater initial distress to limitations, and lower duration of orienting, smiling/laughter, and soothability. Postnatal symptoms predicted slower decreases in girls’ duration of orienting. SSRI exposure predicted decreases in distress to limitations and slower increases in smiling and laughter. For boys, maternal internalizing symptoms did not generally affect temperament profiles. SSRI exposure was associated with higher initial activity level and slower declines in distress to limitations. Limitations: Only parent-report indicators of infant temperament across 10 months of infancy were provided. Maternal internalizing symptoms were measured at discrete times during pregnancy and postpartum, with no analysis of changes in symptoms across time. Conclusions: Prenatal SSRI treatment, and both prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms, exert unique effects on infant temperament. Overall, the present study suggests sex-dependent fetal programming effects that should be further evaluated in future research. Results have implications for perinatal mental health treatment and perceived impacts on child socioemotional development.

The association between a history of self-harm and mental disorders in pregnancy,"Background: Self-harm is prevalent, particularly among young women, and is associated with mental disorders. However, little is known about the mental health of pregnant women who have a history of self-harm. This study examined whether lifetime self-harm was associated with increased risk of antenatal mental disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 544 pregnant women recruited after their first antenatal appointment, oversampling those who responded positively to the depression-screening Whooley questions. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR was delivered, including questions about the lifetime occurrence of self-harm. The associations between lifetime self-harm and the presence of mental disorders, and more specifically anxiety and depressive disorders, were examined using survey-weighted logistic regression. The association between lifetime self-harm and symptoms of personality disorder, was investigated using survey-weighted linear regression. Results: After survey weighting, history of self-harm had a prevalence of 7.9% (95%CI 5.5–11.2%) and was associated with increased risk for mental disorders in early pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.03; 95%CI: 2.22–11.37; p &lt; 0.0001; n = 517). Women with a history of self-harm were more likely to experience antenatal anxiety disorders (AOR 4.41; 95%CI: 1.85–10.51; p = 0.001; n = 517) and antenatal depression (AOR 2.71; 95%CI: 1.04–7.05; p = 0.042; n = 517) than women who did not report self-harm. History of self-harm was also associated with higher SAPAS scores (adjusted coefficient 0.69; 95%CI: 0.21–1.17; n = 517). Limitations: Information on the timing and persistence of self-harm was not available. Conclusions: Women with a history of self-harm are more vulnerable to mental disorders in pregnancy. Further research should include more comprehensive assessments of self-harm and the social context of pregnant women.

Structural and functional neural correlates of vigilant and avoidant regulation style,"Background: Regulation of emotional arousal is a relevant factor for mental health. The investigation of neural underpinnings of regulation styles in healthy individuals may provide important insights regarding potential risk factors. To fill the gap of structural correlates of regulation styles and to expand previous results, we focused on the association between brain structure, neural responsiveness and vigilant/avoidant regulation style. Methods: In n = 302 healthy individuals regulation style was assessed with the Mainz Coping Inventory (MCI). Participants underwent structural and functional MRI during an emotion-processing paradigm. Structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry) and functional MRI were analysed in two regions of interest (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]). Results: Regulation styles did not show an association with brain structure after correction for gender, age, trait anxiety, depressive symptoms. During emotion processing, a vigilant regulation style was negatively associated with ACC activation. Limitations: The cross-sectional study in a non-pathological sample is not adequate to unveil causalities or draw conclusions regarding prevention interventions. Conclusion: Regulation styles are associated with specific neural activation patterns. The association of a high-vigilant regulation style and low ACC activation during emotion processing in healthy participants might be a potential risk factor.

Unstable wakefulness during resting-state fMRI and its associations with network connectivity and affective psychopathology in young adults,"Background: Drifts between wakefulness and sleep are common during resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Among healthy adults, within-scanner sleep can impact functional connectivity of default mode (DMN), task-positive (TPN), and thalamo-cortical networks. Because dysfunctional arousal states (i.e., sleepiness, sleep disturbance) are common in affective disorders, individuals with affective psychopathology may be more prone to unstable wakefulness during rsfMRI, hampering the estimation of clinically meaningful functional connectivity biomarkers. Methods: A transdiagnostic sample of 150 young adults (68 psychologically distressed; 82 psychiatrically healthy) completed rsfMRI and reported whether they experienced within-scanner sleep. Symptom scales were reduced into depression/anxiety and mania proneness dimensions using principal component analysis. We evaluated associations between within-scanner sleep, clinical status, and functional connectivity of the DMN, TPN, and thalamus. Results: Within-scanner sleep during rsfMRI was reported by 44% of participants ( n = 66) but was unrelated to psychiatric diagnoses or mood symptom severity ( p -values &gt; 0.05). Across all participants, self-reported within-scanner sleep was associated with connectivity signatures akin to objectively-assessed sleep, including lower within-DMN connectivity, lower DMN-TPN anti-correlation, and altered thalamo-cortical connectivity ( p &lt; 0.05, corrected). Among participants reporting sustained wakefulness ( n = 84), depression/anxiety severity positively associated with averaged DMN-TPN connectivity and mania proneness negatively associated with averaged thalamus-DMN connectivity ( p -values &lt; 0.05). Both relationships were attenuated and became non-significant when participants reporting within-scanner sleep were included ( p -values &gt; 0.05). Limitations: Subjective report of within-scanner sleep. Conclusions: Findings implicate within-scanner sleep as a source of variance in network connectivity; careful monitoring and correction for within-scanner sleep may enhance our ability to characterize network signatures underlying affective psychopathology.

"Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability questionnaire (RIPoSt-40) assessing emotional dysregulation: Development, reliability and validity","Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a heterogenous construct with great relevance in psychiatric research and clinical practice. In the present study, we validated a 40-items version of the Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability questionnaire (RIPoSt-40), a self-report measure of ED. Methods: A non-clinical sample ( N = 396) and two clinical samples of patients with cyclothymia ( N = 120) and ADHD ( N = 54) were recruited. Items were selected and subscales were derived based on inter-item correlations and PCA with promax rotation in the non-clinical sample. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a subsample ( N = 60). Internal consistency and concurrent validity with TEMPS-M factors were evaluated in each sample. The three groups results were compared to ascertain discriminant validity. Results: Four subscales were identified as measures of affective instability, emotional impulsivity, negative and positive emotionality. The first three subscales also sum up to a negative ED score comprising thirty items. Measures of reliability (test-retest r = 0.71–0.84) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.72–0.95) were generally high. Concurrent validity was supported by correlations with TEMPS-M factors. Discriminant validity was significant ( p &lt; 0.001) with cyclothymic and ADHD patients showing higher scores for each subscale, except for positive emotionality. Limitations: The non-clinical sample was recruited through a web-survey and mainly included young and highly educated subjects. Mood and anxiety comorbidity of the clinical samples were not taken into consideration. Conclusion: RIPoSt-40 questionnaire has proved to be a valid, reliable and useful tool to assess ED both in clinical and non-clinical contexts.

The authors regret the exclusion of the following cited reference: Smith, S.M., Stinson, F.S., Dawson, D.A., Goldstein, R., Huang, B., Grant, B.F., 2006. Race/ethnic differences in the prevalence and co-occurrence of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Psychol. Med. 36, 987-998. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-36157-008). Background: American Indian people have high suicide rates. However, little epidemiological data is available on depression prevalence, a suicide risk factor, in this population. Some research suggests that depression scales may perform differently for American Indian people. However, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a depression scale widely-used in clinical practice, had not been assessed for cross-cultural measurement invariance with American Indian people. Methods: In this retrospective study of existing electronic health record (EHR) data in an upper Midwestern healthcare system, we assessed the measurement invariance of the standard one-factor PHQ-9 and five previously identified two-factor models for 4443 American Indian and 4443 Caucasian American adults (age &gt; = 18) with a PHQ-9 in the EHR from 12/1/2005 to 12/31/2017. We also conducted subgroup analyses with adults ages &gt; = 65. Results: Models showed good fits (e.g., CFI &gt; 0.99, RMSEA &lt; 0.05) and internal consistency reliability (ordinal alpha &gt; 0.80). All models displayed measurement invariance between racial groups. Factor correlation was high for two-factor models, providing support for the one-factor model. American Indian adults had significantly higher odds of PHQ-9 total scores &gt; = 10 and &gt; = 15 than Caucasian American adults. Limitations: Data came from a single healthcare system. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 exhibited cross-cultural measurement invariance between American Indian and Caucasian American adults, supporting the PHQ-9 as a depression screening tool in this clinical care population. American Indian adults also had higher levels of depression than Caucasian Americans. Future research could confirm the generalizability of our findings to other American Indian populations.

"A systematic review of the antidepressant effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) functional agonists: Further link between metabolism and psychopathology: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders”. Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Introduction: An increasing amount of preclinical and clinical evidence links together metabolic regulations and psychopathological mechanisms, in particular linking mood disorders with changes in Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta and 5′Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase expression and activity. New hypoglycemic drugs, including thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) functional agonists, which work by these mechanisms, have also been described as potential antidepressants. The putative role of thiazolidinediones in depression has been already supported, but no clear evidence exists yet for GLP-1 functional agonists. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to describe the effect of GLP-1 functional agonists on depression rating scales and either support or confute a potential antidepressant role. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases for terms related to DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and depression, including symptoms and rating scales with acronyms and full names. We included longitudinal interventional and observational studies on GLP-1 functional agonists used for depression symptoms. We applied a random effects meta-analysis on standardized mean differences before-after treatment, comparing GLP-1 functional agonists versus control treatments. Results: Literature searches found 815 papers, 8 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Both control treatments (-0.67, 95%C.I. -0.99 – -0.36, Z = 4.24, p &lt; 0.0001) and GLP-1 functional agonists (-1.28, 95%C.I. -2.34 – -0.21, Z = 2.35, p = 0.02) resulted in a significant reduction of depression rating scores, although GLP-1 functional agonists tended to be superior. When a selection was made, including only studies conducted on diabetic patients that did not exclude depressed patients, the effect of GLP-1 functional agonists (-2.09, 95%C.I. -2.28 – -1.91, Z = 22.5, p &lt; 0.00001) was significantly superior to that of control treatments (-0.57, 95%C.I. -0.66 – -0.49, Z = 13.6, p &lt; 0.00001). Discussion: Results of this meta-analysis must be carefully considered, since the amount of studies available was low and heterogeneity was high. If further trials will confirm this hypothesis, GLP-1 functional agonists may be considered as antidepressants, either as adjuncts or in mono-therapy, with a peculiar value for preventing the adverse metabolic effects of long-term antipsychotic therapies used in rehabilitation.

Sympathetic arousal in children with oppositional defiant disorder and its relation to emotional dysregulation,"Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a trans-nosographical condition characterized by mood instability, severe irritability, aggression, temper outburst, and hyper-arousal. Pathophysiology of emotional dysregulation and its potential biomarkers are an emerging field of interest. A Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) profile, defined as Dysregulation Profile (DP), has been correlated to ED in youth. We examined the association between the CBCL-DP and indices of sympathetic arousal in children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and healthy controls. Method: The current study sought to compare the arousal level measured via electrodermal activity in response to emotional stimuli in three non-overlapping groups of children: (1) ODD + CBCL-DP (n = 28), (2) ODD without CBCL-DP ( n = 35), and (3) typically developing controls ( n = 25). Results: Analyses revealed a distinct electrodermal activity profile in the three groups. Specifically, children with ODD + CBCL-DP presented higher levels of sympathetic arousal for anger and sadness stimuli compared to the other two groups. Limitations: The relatively small sample and the lack of assessing causality limit the generalizability of this study which results need to be replicated in larger, different samples. Conclusion: The CBCL-DP was associated to higher levels of arousal for negative emotions, consistently with previous reports in individuals with depression and anxiety.

A functional variant of CB2 receptor gene interacts with childhood trauma and FAAH gene on anxious and depressive phenotypes,"Background: Accumulating data suggest that CB2 receptor plays a crucial role in development of anxiety via regulatory function of stress response and neuroimmune crosstalk. Although animal experiments confirm this relationship, relevant human genetic studies on CB2 receptor gene ( CNR2 ) in association with affective phenotype are absent. Methods: CNR2 R63Q and FAAH C385A functional polymorphisms were genotyped of 921 volunteers from the general population. Phenotypic variables were measured by the Zung Self-related Depression Scale (ZSDS), The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Trait subscale, STAI-T) and the depressive and anxious subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-DEP and BSI-ANX). Early life trauma was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CHQ). Using general linear models we tested possible associations between phenotypic variance and genotype distribution. Results: There was a significant main effect of RR genotype of R63Q on ZSDS score ( p = 0.007) and a remarkable interacting effect of CHQ and R63Q on scores of ZSDS, STAI-T and BSI-ANX scales ( p = 0.009; p = 0.003; p = 0.001; respectively). R allele of R63Q and A allele of FAAH C385A were associated with significantly higher ZSDS, STAI-T and BSI-ANX scores compared to non-risk allele carriers ( p = 0.009; p = 0.007; p = 0.007, respectively). The highest phenotypic scores were observed in GxGxE model ( p ZSDS = 0.04; p BSI-DEP = 0.006; p STAI-T = 0.001; p BSI-ANX = 3.8 × 10 −5 ). Conclusions: In this first human genetic study on CNR2 and childhood trauma we revealed that dysfunctional CB2 receptor and FAAH can contribute to greater sensitivity for childhood trauma possibly via weaker inhibition of inflammatory and overactivated HPA axis.

Development of a very brief scale for detecting and measuring panic disorder using two items from the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Self Report,"Objective: To minimize the burden in detecting and monitoring Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia by developing a very brief scale with selected items from the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Self Report (PDSS-SR), and to investigate the proposed scale's psychometric properties in a comorbid sample. Methods: A sample of 5103 patients from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Sweden, diagnosed and treated with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder ( n = 1390), social anxiety disorder ( n = 1313) or depression ( n = 2400), responded to the PDSS-SR. Six criteria related to factor structure, sensitivity to change and clinical representativeness were used to select items. Psychometric analyses for the selected very brief scale were performed. Results: Items 2 (distress during panic attacks) and 4 (agoraphobic avoidance), were selected to create the very brief PDSS-SR version. Correlations with the full scale were high at screening, pre and post, and for change (0.87–0.93). Categorical Omega was ⍵ C = 0.74. With a cut-off of 3 points, the scale could detect panic disorder in a psychiatric sample with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 66%. Limitations: Limitations include lack of healthy controls and lack of blinding on secondary outcome measures. Conclusion: The proposed 2-item PDSS-SR version is a good candidate for a very brief panic disorder questionnaire, both for detecting cases and for measuring change. This is especially useful in clinical settings when measuring more than one condition at a time.

What is at the core of OCD? A network analysis of selected obsessive-compulsive symptoms and beliefs,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous condition that consists of distinct subtypes, and identification of its core symptoms may inform how to best conceptualize the heterogeneity. Accordingly, we used network analysis to evaluate which symptoms (and associations between symptoms) are most central to OCD symptoms and beliefs. Methods: Participants consisted of a combined sample of adults with a primary diagnosis of OCD ( N = 150), those with other primary diagnoses ( N = 114), and an unselected nonclinical sample ( N = 310). Network analysis was used to identify the most central symptoms (nodes) and associations between symptoms (edges) assessed by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and the Obsessional Beliefs Questionnaire-44. Results: The most central symptoms in the network were negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts (i.e., Having intrusive thoughts means I'm out of control ). Some of the strongest associations between symptoms were also observed for those pertaining to intrusive thoughts and their negative appraisal. Furthermore, central symptoms in the network predicted depression and anxiety (over and above peripheral symptoms) among those with a primary diagnosis of OCD, but not the severity of OCD symptoms. Limitations: The approach was exploratory rather than experimental and relied solely on self-report measures of OCD symptoms and beliefs. Conclusions: Negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts were the most central symptoms in the OCD network, and they uniquely predict co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and depression, suggesting that these symptoms should be prioritized in theoretical and treatment models of OCD.

Sleep duration is associated with depressive symptoms among expatriate nurses,"Background: There is limited data on sleep and its impact on mental health among expatriate nurses in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to assess the association between sleep duration and symptoms of depression among expatriate nurses. Methods: Nurses in government healthcare facilities in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia responded to an electronic survey ( n = 977) on demography, lifestyle, job features, and symptoms of depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21). Binary and multinomial logistic regression, respectively, assessed the adjusted associations of daily sleep hours (≤ 5, 6–7, ≥ 8) with having any (no, yes) or degree of symptoms (no, mild to moderate, and severe to extremely severe). Results: There was a dose–response relationship between sleep hours and depressive symptoms (any as well as degree) ( p -values for trend &lt; 0.05). For nurses who slept 6–7 h, the odds ratio (OR) of having any symptoms of depression was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2 – 2.2), ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1 – 2.2), and ‘severe to extremely severe’ symptoms 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1 – 3.4). For nurses who slept ≤ 5 h, the OR of having any symptoms was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4–3.3), ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms 1.7 (95% CI: 1.0–2.6), and ‘severe to extremely severe’ symptoms 4.2 (95% CI: 2.2–8.1) (reference group ≥ 8 h). Limitations: The sleep data pertained to duration only and not to sleep quality. Conclusion: There was a strong association between sleep duration and symptoms of depression among expatriate nurses.

Predictors and outcomes of suicidal ideation during peripartum period,"Introduction: Suicide belongs to the leading causes of maternal perinatal mortality and suicidal ideation is one of the strongest predictors for suicide attempt and completion and thus represents an opportunity for early intervention prior to self and infant harm. This post-hoc analysis aims to investigate predictors of peripartum suicidality (PS) and potential maternal and infant outcomes of PS. Methods: In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) study, n = 306 women were repeatedly examined from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum using interviews (Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women) and questionnaires (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory) to obtain sociodemographic, gynecological and offspring characteristics as well as information about PS (thoughts of death/self-harm, suicide plans, suicide attempt). Results: PS was indicated by n = 15 women. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed a history of suicide attempt (OR = 17.84, 95%CI: 4.61–69.05), living together with the partner (OR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.03–0.63), and social support (OR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13–0.91) as significant predictors for PS (model fit: AUC = 0.7926). As compared to women with no PS, infants of women with PS presented lower scores in neuropsychological development ( p = 0.020). Limitations: This post-hoc analysis was conducted with the aim of generating hypotheses for future research. The small number of women who indicated PS limits the statistical power. Conclusion: PS is an important perinatal complication that requires clinical attention. Larger prospective studies are warranted to verify the findings. This will lead to improved preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the motives behind maternal suicide and infanticide.

Is resting state frontal alpha connectivity asymmetry a useful index to assess depressive symptoms? A preliminary investigation in a sample of university students,"Background: Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been widely investigated in depressive disorders (DDs) with contradictory and not conclusive results. The main aim of the current study was to explore the association between a new neurophysiological index, the so-called frontal alpha connectivity asymmetry index (FACA-I), and depressive symptoms. Methods: One hundred and thirteen participants (45 men and 68 women, mean age: 22.83 ± 2.26 years) were enrolled. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were performed during 5 min of resting state (RS). FACA-I was computed by subtracting connectivity at left frontal regions from right frontal regions and dividing by their sum. RS FAA were also computed and compared to the FACA-I in all analyses. Results: After controlling for the presence of potential confounding variables (i.e., sex, age and anxiety symptoms), only FACA-I scores between medial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex were negatively associated with both somatic and cognitive/affective depressive symptoms and were lower in individuals with significant level of depressive symptoms. Limitations: We focused on a sample of university students with no formal diagnosis of depression and we did not assess FAA and FACA-I during cognitive and/or emotional tasks, which make our interpretation specific to the RS condition. Conclusions: Taken together our data suggest that alpha connectivity asymmetry between medial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex may be a useful neurophysiological index in the assessment of depressive symptoms.

Longitudinal course of suicidal ideation and predictors of its persistence—A NESDA study,"Background: Prior research indicates that the factors that trigger suicidal ideation may differ from those that maintain it, but studies into the maintenance of suicidal ideation remain scarce. Our aim was to assess the longitudinal course of suicidal ideation, and to identify predictors of persistent suicidal ideation. Methods: We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We performed a linear mixed-effects growth model analysis ( n = 230 with current suicidal ideation at baseline) to assess the course of suicidal ideation over time (baseline through 2-, 4-, 6- and 9-year follow-up). We used logistic regression analysis ( n = 195) to test whether factors previously associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation in the literature (insomnia, hopelessness, loneliness, borderline personality traits, childhood trauma, negative life events) also predict persistence of suicidal ideation (i.e., reporting ideation at two consecutive assessment points, 6- and 9-years). We controlled for socio-demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, medication use, and suicide attempt history. Results: Suicidal ideation decreased over time, and this decrease became slower with increasing time, with the majority of symptom reductions occurring in the first two years of follow-up. More severe insomnia and hopelessness were associated with increased odds of persistent suicidal ideation, and hopelessness was a significant mediator of the relationship between insomnia and persistent suicidal ideation. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to those with more severe suicidal ideation due to dropout of those with the worst clinical profile. Conclusions: Targeting insomnia and hopelessness in treatment may be particularly important to prevent the persistence of suicidal ideation.

"Complex polypharmacy in bipolar disorder: Side effect burden, adherence, and response predictors","Background: Complex polypharmacy (CP) is common in bipolar disorder (BD). We assessed the associations between CP, adherence, and side effect burden, and patient traits associated with clinical improvement in relationship to CP. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 482 adult BD participants in the Bipolar CHOICE trial. We examined the associations between CP (use of ≥ 3 BD medications) and non-adherence (missing &gt;30% of BD medication doses in the last 30 days) and side effect burden (Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating scale) using multivariate models with patient random effects. We used logistic regression to assess the patient traits associated with remission among those with majority CP use (Clinical Global Impression-Severity for BD score ≤ 2 for 8 + weeks). Results: 43% of patients had any CP and 25% had CP for the majority of the study. CP was associated with non-adherence (OR = 2.51, 95% CI [1.81, 3.50]), but not worse side effect burden. Among those with CP, 16% achieved remission; those with non-adherence, comorbid social or generalized anxiety disorder, or BD I vs. II were less likely to achieve remission among those with CP. Limitations: There could be unmeasured confounding between use of CP and side effect burden or adherence. Adherence was measured by self-report, which could be subject to reporting error. Conclusions: BD patients with CP were less likely to adhere to therapy, and those with worse adherence to CP were less likely to clinically respond. Clinicians should assess medication adherence prior to adding another agent to medication regimens.

"The effects of cognitive remediation on cognitive abilities and real-world functioning among people with bipolar disorder: A systematic review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders”. Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by cognitive impairments that are known to predict psychosocial functioning and quality of life. While cognitive remediation (CR) was originally developed to directly target cognitive symptoms in traumatic brain injury and psychotic illnesses, the efficacy of CR in BD has begun to emerge only in the last decade. Functional Remediation (FR) is an integrated intervention that has been developed to restore psychosocial functioning by means of ecological neurocognitive techniques that involve psychoeducation about cognitive dysfunctions and their impact on the general functioning. Because of the heterogeneity of treatment targets and mechanisms of actions, here we aim to illustrate the effects induced by existing CR/FR approaches in BD. Methods: In this systematic review, we evaluated cognitive and functional outcomes after CR/FR in studies conducted in BD. Results: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria: 3 RCTs that compared CR/FR to one or more control condition ( n = 354), 5 secondary analyses that further examined data from these trials, 2 single-arm studies, and 1 naturalistic study. While features such as the use of computerized training tools and a group-based format recurred across studies, CR/FR paradigms targeting different cognitive and functional domains showed specificity of training focus to outcomes. Effect sizes were in the medium-large range, suggesting that patients with BD respond to treatment at or above the level reported in psychotic patients. Integrated approaches that combined cognitive exercises with group-based experiences were associated with both cognitive and functional improvements. Conclusions: In this review, we found support for the use of CR/FR paradigms in patients with BD with evidence of cognitive and functional improvements. The scarcity of currently published RCTs as well as of data examining mechanisms of action and neural correlates limits the generalizability of our findings.

Physical health in individuals with psychiatric disorders in Austria,"Introduction: The association between severe psychiatric disorders and metabolic syndrome is well documented and goes along with a reduced life expectancy. The prevalence of medical comorbidities in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders in Austria has not yet been examined; aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of comorbid somatic disorder in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders in Austria. Methods: Patients ( n = 600) with a life-time diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders undergoing a six-week course of intensive treatment in a psychiatric rehabilitation center were recruited. Prevalent somatic and psychological conditions, anamnestic data, medical history, blood samples, clinical and psychological tests as well as medication were examined to determine somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Metabolic disorders were highly prevalent especially in individuals diagnosed with affective disorders, respectively in bipolar disorder. Furthermore, obesity and thyroid dysfunction were found in about 40% of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the present study. Significant gender differences were found in CVD and hypertension with higher prevalence in men, while thyroid dysfunction occurred more often in women also compared to the general female population. Conclusions: Characterizing somatic comorbidity in individuals with psychiatric disorders can stimulate research to better understand possible shared etiologic factors and has public health implications for improving models of care. This could have a positive effect on the course of mental disorders, and additionally improve social integration and life expectancy. Knowledge about sex differences should be used to further improve individualized treatment of individuals with psychiatric disorders.

"Psychological burden of PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity in the U.S. veteran population: Suicidality, functioning, and service utilization","Background: Emerging evidence suggests that comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD) may impose an even greater burden than either disorder alone. However, nearly all previous studies examining these associations have relied on treatment-seeking samples. This study examined the mental health burden associated with co-occurring PTSD/MDD compared to PTSD and MDD alone using a nationally representative sample of U.S. veterans. Methods: Data were analyzed from National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative survey of U.S. veterans (n = 2,732). Analyses (a) estimated the current prevalence of PTSD only, MDD only, and comorbid PTSD/MDD; (b) compared demographic/military variables by PTSD/MDD status; and (c) examined associations between PTSD/MDD status and suicidality, functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, and service utilization. Results: The current prevalences of probable PTSD only, probable MDD only, and probable comorbid PTSD/MDD were 1.7%, 4.8%, and 3.4%. Compared to all other groups, the PTSD/MDD group was more likely to screen positive for current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide attempts, probable generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders, and ever utilize mental health services. They also scored lower on measures of mental health functioning (d = 1.49), cognitive functioning (d = 1.03), and quality of life (d = 0.84). Veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD were more than twice as likely as those with PTSD only to have attempted suicide. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal inference. Conclusions: Results provide a population-based characterization of the psychological burden of PTSD/MDD comorbidity in U.S. veterans. Findings further underscore the importance of screening, monitoring, and treatment of the comorbid manifestation of these disorders.

Depressive symptomatology in adolescents in Ghana: Examination of psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9,"Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) has been used extensively in research and clinical settings. However, there is limited information regarding the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 among adolescents, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Data were collected from 553 adolescents (girls = 322, 58.1%) using a cross-sectional survey design to investigate the factorial validity, construct validity and internal consistency of the PHQ-9 in Ghana. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multi-group CFA support a one-factor structure of the PHQ-9 that was invariant across gender. The PHQ-9 correlates significantly with measures of anxiety, depression, mental wellbeing, and suicidal behavior. The internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was 0.71. Limitation: The study did not include a gold standard measure of depression to assess the diagnostic properties (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of the PHQ-9. Conclusion: The results suggest that major depressive disorder, measured by the PHQ-9, is a homogeneous construct across gender and that the PHQ-9 can be used to screen for depressive symptoms in adolescent boys and girls in Ghana.

Potential predictors of depressive relapse following repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A systematic review,"Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is widely approved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, around 50% of individuals who recover from depression following rTMS interventions experience a relapse of depressive symptomatology by 12 months. The short-term durability of the rTMS treatment effect has been systematically investigated. However, variables relating to the long-term durability of the antidepressant effect produced by rTMS are less understood. Therefore, the current review systematically assessed the research on variables relating to relapse following rTMS. Method: This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive electronic literature search for terms related to relapse following rTMS treatment for MDD was performed on studies published before the end of October 2018. Results: A total of 18 studies assessing relapse related variables were identified. While there is some indication that comorbid anxiety, acute response, and residual symptomatology may hold predictive potential for depressive relapse following rTMS treatment, findings were not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Discussion: Identified studies assessed three main categories of variables including demographic information, clinical characteristics and rating scale scores, and rTMS treatment specific factors. Only a small number of studies were available, and considerable inconsistency exists between studies, only limited conclusions were able to be drawn. Conclusion: More studies assessing a wider range of predictor variables such as cognitive or neuroimaging markers are needed.

Relationship between internet addiction and depression among Japanese university students,"Background: Internet addiction (IA) has various adverse effects. We sought to elucidate the relationship between IA and depression among university students and to identify factors associated with IA. Methods: Anonymous, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 5,261 students and comprised basic characteristics, lifestyle habits, anxieties, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Center for Epidemiological Self-Depression Scale. Results: Responses were obtained from 4,490 students (response rate: 85.3%). After excluding those with missing responses, 3,251 participants were analyzed (valid response rate: 61.8%). Logistic regression analysis with severity of IA as the independent variable and depression as the dependent variable revealed that the odds ratio (OR) for depression increased with severity of IA (mild addiction: OR = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.45−3.36; severe addiction: OR = 7.31, 95% CI = 4.61−11.61). In a logistic regression analysis with mobile phone use as the independent variable and IA as the dependent variable, the highest OR was for message board use (OR = 3.74, 95% CI = 2.53−5.53) and the lowest OR was for use of LINE instant messenger (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.49−0.70). Logistic regression analysis with academic department as the independent variable and internet addiction as the dependent variable revealed high ORs for the humanities department (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.18−2.16) and fine arts department (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07−2.23). Limitations: The main limitations were the cross-sectional design, low valid response rate, single-university setting, and possible social desirability bias. Conclusions: Our results suggest a relationship between IA and depression in university students. IA tendency differed according to mobile phone use and academic department, suggesting these factors are associated with IA.

Bipolar disorder comorbidity in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: Prevalence and predictors,"Background: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with comorbidities, mainly anxiety and affective disorders, which may influence OCD course, help-seeking and treatment response. Some authors have studied bipolar disorder (BD) comorbidity in patients with OCD, but usually in small samples. The objective was to estimate the lifetime prevalence of BD in a large clinical sample of OCD patients, and to compare demographic and clinical features of patients with and without BD comorbidity. Method: This cross-sectional study with 955 adult OCD patients from the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders (C-TOC) used several assessment instruments, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were followed by logistic regression. Results: The lifetime prevalence of BD was 7.75% ( N = 74). The variables that were independently associated with BD comorbidity were: panic disorder with agoraphobia, impulse control disorders, and suicide attempts. Limitations: The cross-sectional design does not permit causal inferences; the external validity may be limited, as the participants were from tertiary services. Despite the large sample size, some analyses may have been underpowered due to the relatively low prevalence of the outcome and of some explanatory variables. Conclusions: Patients with OCD comorbid with BD have some clinical features indicative of greater severity, including higher suicide risk, and require a careful therapeutic approach for the appropriate treatment of both disorders.

Validation of the MGMQ in screening for emotional difficulties in women during pregnancy,"Background: Screening for emotional health difficulties in pregnant or postpartum women is becoming routine practice in health services. This screening is often done using the EPDS, usually using a screen positive score just to identify possible depression. This and other such scales often have a myriad of screen-positive scores, making them impractical within clinical settings. The recent MGMQ screens for a variety of negative moods, is brief, simple, and has just a few screen-positive thresholds. Method: At recruitment 391 women attending routine antenatal clinics completed various mood questionnaires. Several weeks later they were re-contacted by phone, at which time 247–252 of them provided valid data on the MGMQ, EPDS, and a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety disorders (numbers vary depending upon valid combinations). Results: The MGMQ showed good-excellent receiver operating characteristics (sensitivity specificity, positive predictive value) against diagnostic status for depression or anxiety disorders. It also showed good concurrent and concordant validity with the EPDS, and good discriminant validity between women with clinical and subclinical diagnostic caseness. Stability over several weeks was however low, indicating that, as with other measures, women's mood can naturally change during the perinatal period. Limitations: The findings only apply to English-speaking antenatal women from Sydney, Australia. Conclusion: The MGMQ has good psychometric properties when compared to the usual gold-standard applied to emotional health screening measures. Its brevity, simplicity to ‘score’ and interpret, together with its clinically useful questions, suggest it could be a practical alternative to other more complicated mood screening measures for perinatal women.

Racing thoughts revisited: A key dimension of activation in bipolar disorder,"Background: Racing and crowded thoughts are frequently reported respectively in manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (BD). However, questionnaires assessing this symptom are lacking. Here we aimed to investigate racing thoughts across different mood episodes of BD through a self-report questionnaire that we developed, the 34-item Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire (RCTQ). In addition to assessing its factor structure and validity, we were interested in the RCTQ's ability to discriminate mixed and non-mixed depression. Methods: 221 BD patients and 120 controls were clinically assessed via the YMRS (mania) and the QIDS-C16 (depression), then fulfilled the RCTQ, rumination, worry, and anxiety measures. Three depression groups were operationalized according to YMRS scores: YMRS scores 2 &gt; 6 and YMRS scores = 1 or 2, for respectively mixed and non-pure depression, and YMRS = 0 for pure-depression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the three-factor model of the RCTQ yielded the best fit indices, which improved after the removal of redundant items, resulting in a 13-item questionnaire. Hypomanic and anxiety symptoms were the main predictors of scores; rumination was not a significant predictor. RCTQ results were similar between mixed groups and non-pure depression, and both were higher than in pure-depression. Limitations: Patients’ pharmacological treatment might have influenced the results. Conclusions: The 13-item RCTQ captures different facets of racing thoughts heightened in hypomanic and mixed states, but also in depression with subclinical hypomanic/activation symptoms (e.g. non-pure depression characterized by enhanced subjective irritability), suggesting that it is particularly sensitive to activation symptoms in BD, and could become a valuable tool in the follow-up of patients.

This section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and related illnesses are associated with significant impairment in cognitive functioning which is among the strongest predictors of disability and poor quality of life. Cognitive remediation (CR) was developed as a set of behavioral interventions directly targeting cognitive symptoms. Studies have shown that CR produces cognitive improvements in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that may be associated with improvements in functioning. However, the relative efficacy of CR across diagnoses has not been established. Indirect evidence suggests that CR is effective in patients with affective illness as well as patients with schizophrenia (SZ); however, the one study to evaluate the effects of diagnosis on outcomes directly in patients with SZ versus schizoaffective disorder (SZA) found no differences by diagnosis. Methods: In this systematic review, we evaluated cognitive and functional outcomes after CR in studies including patients with SZA, and examined specificity of training content to outcomes. Results: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria: 10 studies that compared CR to a control condition ( n = 779) and 6 comparative effectiveness studies. None of the studies explicitly compared patients by diagnosis. Studies included a mixture of patients with SZA or SZ. Of the CR versus control studies, effect sizes for cognitive outcomes were moderate-large ( d = .36–.94). Studies comparing CR paradigms targeting different cognitive domains showed specificity of training focus to outcomes. Five of studies reported significant functional improvement after CR as secondary outcomes. Conclusions: In this review, we found support for the use of CR paradigms in patients with affective psychosis, with evidence that reported treatment effects in mixed affective and non-affective samples are at or above the levels previously reported in SZ. However, lack of availability of data directly comparing patients by diagnosis or examining moderator or mediator effects of diagnosis or diagnosis-related patient characteristics limits our understanding of the relative efficacy of CR across patient group.

Translational studies are thus seeking for novel targets for antidepressant drug development. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in mood and stress response, even if drugs targeting this system have not yet become available for clinical use. The dietary supplement N-Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a fatty acid amide belonging to the endocannabinoid system with potential antidepressant properties. Methods: We performed a bibliographic search to review current knowledge on the potential antidepressant effects of PEA and its underlying mechanism of action. Results: PEA targets not only the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), but also the endocannabinoid system, binding the G-protein-coupled receptor 55, a non-CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptor, and also the CB₁/CB₂ receptors, although with a weak affinity. Preclinical studies have shown antidepressant activity of PEA in animal paradigms of depression and of depression associated with neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury. In a translational perspective, PEA is increased in stress conditions, and a randomized, double-blind study in depressed patients indicated a fast-antidepressant action of PEA when associated with citalopram. Limitations: There are still limited preclinical and clinical studies investigating the effect of PEA upon the endocannabinoid system and its potential as antidepressant. Conclusions: PEA has potential antidepressant effects alone or in combinations with other classes of antidepressants. Future studies in depressed patients are needed to confirm the mood-modulating properties of PEA and its role as a biomarker of depression.

Psychiatry: A discipline at specific risk of mental health issues?,"Comments on an article by G. Fond et al. (see record 2018-36905-074). Fond et al. published data from a national online survey involving 2165 French interns (residents), 302 in psychiatry and 1863 in other specialties. Interns in psychiatry reported increased substance use behaviors (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis), were more exposed to violence during medical studies, were more frequently treated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist and used more often antidepressants and anxiolytic. Pointing out that medical students experience high rates of depression and suicidal ideation, the authors suggest that, according to their findings, interns in psychiatry are more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders.

Applications of the Chinese version of the primary care PTSD screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) for children,"Background: Effective screening is important for public mental health services. Although the primary care PTSD screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) is useful in screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults, its reliability and validity for use in children remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the performance characteristics of the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 for children in children aged 8 to 16 years. Methods: 4,022 rural children from Grades 4 to 9 in China were included in this study. All participants were assessed for PTSD using the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 for children and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and assessed for anxiety using the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C), and for depression using the Children's Depression Inventory - Short Form (CDI-S). The performance characteristics of the PC-PTSD-5 for children were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results: The mean scores on the PCL-5 and the PC-PTSD-5 were 17.45 ( SD = 14.78) and 1.78 ( SD = 1.33), respectively. There was a significant correlation between the PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5 ( r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.001), and small but significant correlations of the PC-PTSD-5 with the CSAS-C ( r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001) and CDI-S ( r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001). In this study, 2 and 3 were both found to be acceptable cutoff values. A cutoff value of 2 yielded a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.52, while a cutoff of 3 had sensitivity = 0.57, and specificity = 0.77. Limitations: A clinical interview was not used to validated diagnostic findings. Conclusions: The reliability and validity of the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 were statistically acceptable for screening for probable PTSD in children. Additionally, the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 had a favorable sensitivity at a cut off 2 and a favorable specificity at a cut off 3, based on PCL-5 results.

The measurement invariance of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for American Indian adults,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 257 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-51938-074). The authors regret the exclusion of the following cited reference: Smith, S.M., Stinson, F.S., Dawson, D.A., Goldstein, R., Huang, B., Grant, B.F., 2006. Race/ethnic differences in the prevalence and cooccurrence of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Psychol. Med. 36, 987-998.] Background: American Indian people have high suicide rates. However, little epidemiological data is available on depression prevalence, a suicide risk factor, in this population. Some research suggests that depression scales may perform differently for American Indian people. However, the Patient Health Questionnnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a depression scale widely-used in clinical practice, had not been assessed for cross-cultural measurement invariance with American Indian people. Methods: In this retrospective study of existing electronic health record (EHR) data in an upper Midwestern healthcare system, we assessed the measurement invariance of the standard one-factor PHQ-9 and five previously identified two-factor models for 4443 American Indian and 4443 Caucasian American adults (age &gt; = 18) with a PHQ-9 in the EHR from 12/1/2005 to 12/31/2017. We also conducted subgroup analyses with adults ages &gt; = 65. Results: Models showed good fits (e.g., CFI &gt; 0.99, RMSEA &lt; 0.05) and internal consistency reliability (ordinal alpha &gt; 0.80). All models displayed measurement invariance between racial groups. Factor correlation was high for two-factor models, providing support for the one-factor model. American Indian adults had significantly higher odds of PHQ-9 total scores &gt; = 10 and &gt; = 15 than Caucasian American adults. Limitations: Data came from a single healthcare system. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 exhibited cross-cultural measurement invariance between American Indian and Caucasian American adults, supporting the PHQ-9 as a depression screening tool in this clinical care population. American Indian adults also had higher levels of depression than Caucasian Americans. Future research could confirm the generalizability of our findings to other American Indian populations.

The course and clinical correlates of obsessive-compulsive disorder during the postpartum period: A naturalistic observational study,"Background: In this study, we aimed to investigate the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the demographic and clinical correlates associated with significant changes in symptom severity in postpartum women. Methods: Data were collected form 37 consecutive postpartum women who were diagnosed with OCD during psychiatric interviews by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Psychiatric assessments were carried out on the first day after delivery and at 6 to 8 weeks in the postpartum period. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was administered at both assessments while the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Coping orientation to problems Experienced (COPE) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A), were administered to the participants at the first assessment. Results: The mean score of Y-BOCS was significantly reduced from the baseline to the 6–8 week postpartum period. The proportion of patients with a decreaseof at least 35% in the total score of Y-BOCS during the postpartum period was 43.2%. When the patient groups with and without ≥ 35% decrease in the total score of Y-BOCS were compared, the group showing the decrease had a higher score of COPE-supression of competing activities, COPE-humor and TEMPS-A-hyperthymic affective temperament and more frequently reported a decrease in the severity of OCD symptoms after a previous childbirth. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the last two variables could accurately predict a ≥ 35 decrease in the severity of OCD symptoms during the postpartum period. Limitations: The study has relatively small sample size. Conclusions: The current results suggest that patients with OCD who exhibit hyperthymic affective temperament character and a decrease in symptoms following a previous childbirth may experience a significant alleviation in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the postpartum period.

Clinical utility of the CBCL Dysregulation Profile in children with disruptive behavior,"Background: Children who are severely dysregulated experience a range of concurrent and long-term impairments and psychopathology and are particularly at-risk for mood and anxiety disorders. The Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) may be useful in identifying children who are highly dysregulated, which could facilitate early intervention. Methods: We examined the prevalence, gender differences, parent-teacher agreement, and concurrent validity of two categorical definitions of the CBCL-DP in 348 children ages 6–12 who were clinic-referred for assessment and treatment because of disruptive behavior. Results: Rates of the CBCL-DP were 3 times higher when a less stringent versus a more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used (46.8% vs. 15.2%). Girls were more likely than boys to meet criteria for the CBCL-DP when the more stringent definition was used. Parent-teacher agreement was low, particularly when the more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used. Children with the CBCL-DP were rated by their parents, but not their teachers, as more impaired than other children, regardless of the definition of the CBCL-DP used, and even when compared to children with clinically elevated scores on other CBCL subscales. Limitations: Our cross-sectional data did not allow us to examine the predictive validity of the CBCL-DP, informant effects may have inflated associations between CBCL-DP and parent-rated impairment, and teacher ratings were missing for many children. Conclusions: Our findings support other reports that provide evidence that the CBCL-DP may identify a particularly symptomatic and impaired group of children with disruptive behavior, as rated by their parents.

Source activity during emotion processing and its relationship to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Neural mechanisms contributing to an underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. An effective method to probe cognitive processing deficits in PD is the examination of brain activity during emotional processes, particularly in explicit language emotion recognition contexts. Methods: The present study utilised cortical source imaging of event related potentials (ERP) from electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate valence judgements on negative and neutral target words in an automatic affective priming paradigm. Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed affective priming tasks during EEG monitoring. Cognitive impairment was measured using the validated Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS). Results: Results reveal that compared to healthy age-matched controls, PD patients demonstrate a reduced N400 activation during affective priming tasks in bilateral regions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and, notably, have a late wave ERP component (LPP) in left MFG, present between 600 and 800 ms, following family-wise error correction ( p FWE &lt; 0.05). LPP in PD patients were significantly associated with PD-CRS scores. Limitations: Although affective priming paradigms are an effective means for various domains of cognition, it is not a focused cognitive behavioural test for cognitive dysfunction. Our study is thus limited to a surrogate measure of cognitive dysfunction via examination of emotional word processing cues. Conclusions: These findings suggest that source imaging methods with ERP paradigms in PD are effective in identifying delayed cognitive processes in PD.

Association of defecation disorders with suicidal ideation in young adult with chronic abdominal discomfort,"Background: The role of physical symptoms on suicidal ideation in adolescents is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to discover the potential physical symptoms predictors for suicidal ideation in college freshmen. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in a randomly selected freshmen population in Wuhan China ( N = 2449). Questionnaire evaluated suicidal ideation as well as related psychosocial risks and gastrointestinal (GI) physical symptoms. The association between the suicidal ideation and potential predictors was analyzed by Mann–Whitney test and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 2053 (83.8%) completed this survey and 64 (3.1%) was reported to have suicidal ideation. Anxiety (OR 5.44(2.40–12.35)), depression (OR 8.36(3.90–17.94)) and chronic abdominal discomfort (OR 2.06(1.07–3.94)) were independent predictors for suicidal ideation. In freshmen with chronic abdominal discomfort, interestingly, defecation disorder( P = 0.01) and low satisfaction of defecation ( P = 0.04) was associated with high risk for suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Defecation disorders were associated with high risk of suicidal intention in young adult with chronic abdominal discomfort. Our result implied that clinicians should be vigilant for suicidal ideation in chronic abdominal discomfort patients, especially those with defecation disorders.

Examining the relationship between negative affect and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among smokers using ecological momentary assessment,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and negative affect (e.g., anger, depression, anxiety), are highly co-occurring. It remains unclear whether changes in PTSD symptoms subsequently impact negative affect, or vice versa. This study assessed associations between moment-to-moment PTSD symptoms and negative affect in a sample of smokers with PTSD to determine directionality of this relationship. Methods: Participants ( N = 125) enrolled in two smoking cessation studies with co-occurring PTSD and cigarette use completed measures of PTSD and negative affect. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology was used to record symptoms during a one-week baseline period, during which participants smoked ad lib . Cross-lagged path analyses assessed PTSD symptoms and negative affect for directionality of their relationship, controlling for whether an EMA reading was smoking or non-smoking. Path analyses examined the lagged associations between PTSD symptoms and negative affect. Results: Results found PTSD symptom severity at T-1 was significantly related to negative affect levels at time T, but negative affect at time T-1 was not associated with PTSD symptom severity at time T. Results indicated the model retaining the cross-lagged effect of PTSD symptom severity on negative affect provided better fit to the data than other models. Limitations: Limitations included use of self-report data, brief measures of symptoms, participants already had PTSD and/or MDD, participants were recruited from a specific clinical population, and use of DSM-IV data. Conclusions: Results suggest PTSD symptoms drive day-to-day fluctuations in negative affect, and highlight the importance of evaluating negative affect in the treatment of PTSD.

The relationship of physical activity to mental health: A 2015 behavioral risk factor surveillance system data analysis,"Introduction: Available literature has repeatedly ascertained the inverse relationship of physical activity to mental health. Engaging in regular physical activity decreases symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress in a dose-responsive manner. Methods: Cross-sectional, national data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were analyzed to establish the relationship between physical activity and days of poor mental health. The association between physical activity and days of poor mental health was assessed by multiple linear regression using SAS. Results: Findings support the assumption of an inverse dose-response relationship between physical activity levels and self-reported days of poor mental health. Individuals who engage in higher levels of physical activity reported significantly fewer days of poor mental health when compared to those who reported low or no physical activity (e.g. −2.23, 95%CI (−2.31, −2.15)) for highly active vs. inactive individuals (unadjusted model)). Furthermore, individuals who only met the guidelines for aerobic exercise reported significantly fewer days of poor mental health than those who only met the muscle strengthening guidelines (−0.85 (95% CI: −0.98, −0.73)). Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional study design, the direction of the relationship is unknown and reverse causation is possible. Conclusion: Higher physical activity levels were associated with fewer self-reported days of poor mental health, which reiterates the important association between physical activity and mental health with national data. The findings of this study could prove to be valuable for developing interventions aimed at improving mental health. Nonetheless, several research gaps persist that warrant further empirical inquiry.

Evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a cognitive behavior therapy-based transdiagnostic program for emotional problems in children in a regular school setting,"Background: The present study examined the real-world effectiveness of a transdiagnostic prevention program, Super Skills for Life (SSL), among children with emotional problems in regular school settings. SSL is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), behavioral activation, and social skills training. Methods: Participants were 205 children, aged 8–12 years, who were referred by their teachers as having significant emotional problems. All the children completed measures of emotional and behavioral problems and self-esteem, both before and after participating in SSL, and at six months after the intervention. The children's parents and class teachers also completed a questionnaire that measures children's general difficulties and positive attributes. Children also gave a 2-minute speech task in front of the video in sessions 1 and 8. Results: There was agreement among self, parent, and teacher report, showing significant decreases of emotional symptoms from pretest to posttest and pretest to follow-up. Main effect of gender was significant for anxiety symptoms, emotional symptoms peer problems, and prosocial behavior. Video analysis of the 2-minute speech task showed significant improvement in length of eye gaze, vocal quality, length of speech, manifestation of comfort, and conversational flow. However, hypothesized increases in self-esteem did not act as a mediator of change in pre- to post-anxiety symptoms or social phobia subscale scores. Limitations: The present study used an open clinical trial design. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for the effectiveness of the manual-guided CBT for emotional problems in regular school settings when delivered by school services staff.

Disagreement and factors between symptom on self-report and clinician rating of major depressive disorder: A report of a national survey in China,"Background: Measurement-based care (MBC) is a popular strategy of clinical management for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The consistency of self-report and clinical measurements is of importance, but whether individual symptom severity is in agreement for both self-report and clinician rating in MDD has not been comprehensively tested. This study aimed to test whether individual symptom severity of MDD was in agreement between self-report and clinician rating, and to explore factors affecting the agreement. Methods: In the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) of China, 3275 patients with a major depressive episode were evaluated by both self-report and a clinician-rated version of 62 questions. Results: On average, 59% of all patients reached absolute agreement with their research clinicians. Among all questions, 73% returned with moderate positive strength of correlation, followed by 27% with low positive correlation. In 77% of the total questions, there was a tendency to rate higher in the self-report version compared with the clinician-rated version. After classifying the symptoms by six major domains, it was found that patients and clinicians showed more consistent answers in history and somatic questions (81% and 65% reached agreement), and that there were more differences in mood, energy, and anxiety questions (up to 56% in full agreement). “Outpatient”, “high financial status”, “poor working condition”, and “high education level” were found to be significant positive predictors for patients rating higher than clinicians or patients and clinicians reaching agreement as opposed to clinicians rating higher than patients. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of our study undermines the interpretation of the results across the MDD treatment course. Conclusions: It is sufficient to use the self-report version of a questionnaire to screen, monitor, and detect remission for MDD symptoms. Complete assessment of depression severity should take both clinician-rated scales and self-reported measures into consideration. Factors other than source of admission, financial status, working condition, and education level should be further investigated for the discrepancy between self-report and clinician rating.

Efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy with medication for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: A multicentre randomised controlled trial in China,"Background: Meta-analyses support the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in Western cultures. However, there are no adequately powered multicentre studies in China. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of treatment with CBT combined with medication and medication alone in OCD patients in China. Methods: OCD patients ( N = 167) were recruited from outpatient clinics at three large tertiary psychiatric hospitals and one general hospital in China. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either CBT combined with medication ( n = 92) or medication alone ( n = 75) for a 24-week treatment period. Participants’ symptoms and social functioning were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity (CGI-S) at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks, and the effectiveness of the two treatments compared using linear mixed-effects models. Results: At 24 weeks, both groups showed large within-group effects in all measures. Significantly more patients receiving combined therapy than medication alone had a decrease in symptom severity of at least 35% (based on Y-BOCS total score). The CGI-S and GAF scores decreased in both groups, and significant differences were found between the groups. Limitations: Study limitations included lack of consideration of medication types and dosages, and the absence of a CBT-only arm. Conclusions: CBT combined with medication may be effective in alleviating symptoms and social functioning impairment associated with OCD, and is more effective than medication alone in China, particularly for the treatment of compulsive behaviours.

Psychological interventions for young people at risk for bipolar disorder: A systematic review,"Objectives: Several studies have recently been conducted that have explored the benefits of psychological interventions in reducing symptomatology or improving outcomes in young people at-risk of developing bipolar disorder. The aim of this review was to explore if such interventions reduce current psychiatric symptoms and prevent the development of new symptoms. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and SCOPUS from January 1990 until August 2018. The inclusion criteria were young people aged under 30 years with a family history of bipolar disorder and any empirical studies that contained a psychological or psychoeducation intervention. Results: A total of 7 articles ( N = 138, 55 males) were included (mean age ranged from 12 to 15 years). Interventions conducted included Family Focussed Therapy, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy, and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Children. Significant results were found in some studies, depending on the sample's initial symptoms, with reduced time to relapse and reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression and hypo/mania being found. Limitations: No studies have explored if interventions may delay the time to onset of first hypo/manic episodes and only two randomised controlled trials were identified. Conclusions: Some significant results were noted with lower symptoms of anxiety, depression and hypo/mania being found in some studies. It is currently unclear if psychological interventions may prevent the development of bipolar disorder or other psychiatric symptoms over time; further longitudinal studies are required.

Temperament and character influence on depression treatment outcome,"Background: Personality features have been repeatedly associated with depression treatment outcome in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), however conclusive results are still lacking. Moreover, as for Bipolar Disorder (BD), results are only few and preliminary. Aim: : the aim of the present study was to perform an exploratory investigation of the influence of personality traits as assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), on principal depression treatment outcomes (non remission, non response and resistance). Methods: : 743 mood disorders patients (455 MDD (61.24%) and 288 BD (38.76%)) were recruited in the context of 6 European studies. Generalized logit models were performed to test the effects of TCI dimensions on treatment outcomes, considering possible confounders such as age, gender and education. Positive results were controlled for comorbidities (anxiety and substance use disorders) as well. Results: : MDD Non-Remitters showed high Harm Avoidance (HA) and Self Transcendence (ST) ( p = 0.0004, d = 0.40; p = 0.007, d = 0.36 respectively) and low Persistence (P) and Self Directedness (SD) ( p = 0.05; d = 0.18; p = 0.002, d = 0.40, respectively); MDD Non-Responders showed a slightly different profile with high HA and low Reward Dependence (RD) and SD; finally, MDD Resistants showed low RD, P and Cooperativeness (C). In BD patients, only higher HA in non response was observed. Limitations: : the retrospective cross-sectional design, the TCI assessment regardless of the mood state and the small number of bipolar patients represent the main limitations. Conclusion: : specific TCI personality traits are associated with depression treatment outcome in MDD patients. The inclusion of such personality traits, together with other socio-demographic and clinical predictors, could ameliorate the accuracy of the prediction models available to date.

Neuroticism and chronicity as predictors of 9-year course of individual depressive symptoms,"Background: The large between-person differences in symptomatology suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder. However, symptom-specific prospective studies are scarce. We hypothesized that chronicity (i.e., being depressed for 24 months during a patient's preceding 48 months at baseline) and neuroticism at baseline would predict adverse course trajectories over 9 years of follow up with differential magnitudes for individual depressive symptoms. Methods: In total, 560 patients with a current MDD were included from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA-cohort). We used a multivariate linear mixed model with repeated measures, with a history of chronicity and neuroticism separately as main independent variables and with Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (IDS-SR) item scores as outcome variables. For each individual symptom, the model was adjusted for age, gender, and baseline depression severity. Results: Patients were on average 42.7 ( SD = 12.1) years old and 64.7% were women. Patients with chronic depression or high levels of neuroticism showed similar absolute rates of decline over time compared to their counterparts. However, because symptoms had higher starting points for mood, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms (in that order), symptom severity remained higher over time. Chronicity and neuroticism were especially linked to persistent low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity. Limitations: Neuroticism is partly state dependent and likely affected by depression severity. Conclusions: Chronicity and neuroticism predict long-term persistence of diverse psychiatric symptoms, in particular low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity.

Effectiveness and harms of mental health treatments in service members and veterans with deployment-related mild traumatic brain injury,"Background: Co-morbidity of psychiatric conditions with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common among service members and Veterans from recent deployments. Practice guidelines for mild TBI (mTBI) recommend management of co-occurring psychiatric conditions with existing treatments, but it is unclear whether the effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions is impacted by mTBI. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal ideation or attempts, and anxiety disorders in the presence of co-morbid deployment-related mTBI. Methods: We searched bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed, English language studies published from 2000 to October 2017. Two reviewers independently completed abstract triage and full text review. Results: We identified 7 studies (5 pre-post and 2 secondary analysis). Six assessed psychotherapy and one reported on hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO₂). Studies comparing outcomes by TBI history found that a history of TBI does not affect treatment outcomes. Harms were reported only for HBO₂ and were mild. No study examined the effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders or suicidal ideation, or the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for the psychiatric conditions of interest in service members and Veterans with mTBI. Limitations: Studies lacked usual care or wait-list control groups and no randomized trials were found, making the strength of evidence insufficient. Conclusions: Evidence is insufficient to fully assess the impact of TBI on the effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions. Higher quality evidence with definitive guidance for providers treating this population is needed.

Assessing interpersonal and mood factors to predict trajectories of suicidal ideation within an inpatient setting,"Background: A limited amount of research has assessed how suicide risk changes over time, and how changes can be predicted. The current study assessed suicidal ideation and risk factors throughout inpatient visits to a psychiatric facility to refine prediction of suicide risk. Method: In total, 491 patients (73% Female; mean age = 39.21) at a psychiatric inpatient facility self-reported the frequency of their suicidal thoughts, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, hopelessness, depression, and anxiety in the prior 24 h on a daily basis. Levels of suicidal ideation and risk factors at each quarter of an inpatient's stay were identified, and latent class growth analysis used to identify common patterns of change over time. Results: Changes in mood and interpersonal factors were associated with changes in suicidal ideation over days and weeks. Further, they contributed to the prediction of future levels of suicidal ideation. Thwarted belongingness at admission predicted whether patients had pervasively high suicidal thoughts over the course of inpatient visits or showed marked improvements, while perceived burdensomeness predicted which patients would develop suicidal thoughts during their visit. Limitations: The use of single item measures may limit specificity of measurement of suicide risk factors. Hourly, rather than daily measurement used in the current study, may more accurately identify suicide risk. Conclusions: Change in suicidal ideation is associated with changes in a number of psychological risk factors. Regular assessment of interpersonal risk factors may identify warning signs and aid clinical interventions in reducing suicidal thoughts and associated self-injurious behaviours.

"A panel of miRNAs is involved in the effect of sertraline on panic disorder, as implicated by a microarray-based analysis","Background: MiRNAs are considered to be significant contributors to the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases, but little is known about the potential roles of miRNAs in the treatment effect of panic disorder (PD). Therefore, we aimed to identify the miRNAs association with PD over the course of sertraline treatment. Methods: Sixty-seven patients were collected for a 6-week period of sertraline treatment, and evaluated using HAMD-17, HAMA-14 and PDSS both at the baseline and 6 weeks later. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment, respectively. Ten pairs of samples were analyzed using miRNA array, and the differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated using RT-PCR in the whole sample. Results: miR-451a, miR-144-5p, miR-25-3p and miR-660-5p were found to be significantly up-regulated, while miR-1 and miR-148-5p significantly down-regulated after sertraline treatment. The change of miR-25-3p before and after treatment (△miR-25-3p) was positively related to both the changes of PDSS3 scores (△PDSS3) (p = 0.017, 31.5% contribution) and △ PDSS7 (p = 0.016, 32.3% contribution). The △miR-660-5p was positively related to both the △HAMA5 (p = 0.03, 26% contribution) and △PDSS7 (p = 0.032). The △miR-148-5p was positively related to the △PDSS4 (p = 0.046, 21.5% contribution), but negatively related to the △HAMA13 (p = 0.005, 41.9% contribution). The △miR-144-5p was negatively related to the △HAMA9 (p = 0.032, 25.3% contribution). Conclusions: These findings might provide some evidences to the involvement of miRNA in the effect of anti-anxiety agents, which contributed to the better understanding the disease and developing new therapeutic genetic targets.

"Relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms, caregiving response, and parent mental health in youth exposed to single incident trauma","Background: Family factors may alter the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression in young people after a traumatic event, but it is not clear which modifiable family variables can be addressed in psychological therapies. This study examined the relationships between family factors (Expressed Emotion [EE] and family accommodation) and psychopathology (posttraumatic stress symptoms; PTSS) in young people following a single incident trauma. Potential mediators of these relationships were also investigated. Method: Sixty-six parent-child dyads (aged 8–17 years) were assessed within one month of attending an Emergency Department. Self-reported PTSS and perceived EE were assessed in young people. Parents’ own PTSS, mood symptoms, EE, and accommodating behaviours were also assessed. Results: Cross-sectional analyses revealed that young person-perceived EE, parent-reported emotional over involvement (EOI) and accommodation behaviours significantly predicted higher PTSS in young people. The stress experienced as a consequence of EE mediated the relationship between young person-perceived EOI and PTSS in young people. Parental PTSS and anxiety were positively correlated with EOI and accommodation. Parental PTSS was not significantly associated with symptoms in young people. Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that EE and accommodation are positively associated with PTSS in young people in the month following a potentially traumatic event. Understanding the child in the context of their family environment and relationships offers an important framework for making sense of and facilitating adaptive adjustment following a traumatic event.

Brief mindfulness-based stress management program for a better mental state in working populations—Happy Nurse Project: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: The efficacy of the mindfulness-based stress management program for maintaining a better mental state has not been examined among working populations. We aimed to explore the effectiveness of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program for hospital nurses. Methods: In a multi-center randomized trial, 80 junior nurses working in hospitals were randomly allocated either to the brief mindfulness-based stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet. The program consisted of four 30 min individual sessions conducted by trained senior nurses using a detailed manual. The primary outcome was the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at week 26. Secondary outcomes included presence of a major depressive episode; severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and presenteeism; utility scores; and adverse events up to 52 weeks. Results: The mean HADS score of all the participants at baseline was 7.2. At 26 weeks, adjusted mean scores on the HADS score were 7.2 (95% confidence intervals: 5.9, 8. 5) in the program group and 6.0 (4.8, 7.2) in the leaflet group, respectively. The coefficient of the group by time interaction was not statistically significant at -1.41 (-3.35, 0.54; P = 0.156). No significant superiority or inferiority was observed on the other outcomes. Limitations: We did not manage to recruit the number of participants we initially set out, although our post-hoc analyses showed that this did not lead to changes in our conclusions. Conclusions: The additive value of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program was not confirmed in mental state and self-evaluated work efficiency.

Physical activity as prognostic factor for bipolar disorder: An 18-month prospective study,"Introduction: Exercise is an adjuvant therapy indicated for various psychiatric disorders. However, prospective studies in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are scarce and with uncertain conclusions. This study aims to evaluate physical activity as a prognostic factor for BD, analyzing relationship with levels of anxiety, functionality, sleep, mood episodes and hospitalizations. Methods: Three psychiatrists interviewed 80 BD outpatients in euthymia, referred from four different institutions in Brazil. In this moment, they evaluated the intensity of physical activities using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)—short form. They reevaluated patients and reviewed medical records monthly for 18 months to identify mood episodes and psychiatric hospitalizations. Results: Thirty-eight patients (47.5%) were physically inactive (or sedentary) and 42 (52.5%) active. Physically active patients had lower Body Mass Index ( p = 0.006), waist circumference ( p = 0.002), lower levels of anxiety ( p = 0.032) and less insomnia ( p = 0.001). Sedentary individuals revealed poorer global functioning ( p &lt; 0.001) and in all domains: autonomy ( p &lt; 0.001), occupational functioning ( p = 0.008), cognitive functioning ( p = 0.013), capacity of managing the finances ( p = 0.012), interpersonal relationships ( p = 0.011) and leisure time ( p = 0.001). Less activity was associated with more mood episodes ( p = 0.042) and psychiatric hospitalizations ( p = 0.043) over 18 months. Conclusion: This study suggested physical activity as a good prognostic factor for BD during euthymia. This reinforces the need to encourage this practice in clinical settings. Future prospective surveys with longer duration using objective instruments are proposed.

"Allergies, asthma, and psychopathology in a nationally-representative US sample","Background: Symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety have been associated with immune dysregulation and atopic disorders, however it is unclear whether this relationship spans other forms of psychopathology. The objective of this study was to use a large, population-based sample to examine the association between several common psychiatric conditions and two atopic disorders: seasonal allergies and asthma. This study also examined whether comorbidity between psychiatric disorders confounded the relationship between atopy and each psychiatric disorder. Methods: Data come from the Comprehensive Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, a nationally-representative sample of US adults ( N = 10,309). Lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory. History of seasonal allergies and asthma were assessed by self-report. Weighted logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between allergies and asthma and psychopathology. Psychiatric comorbidities were also examined as potential confounders. Results: Approximately 36.6% had a history of allergies and 11.5% a history of asthma. Seasonal allergies were positively associated with odds of MDD (Odds ratio (OR): 1.24, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.06–1.46), GAD (OR: 1.54 (1.28–1.84)), PD (OR: 1.54 (1.24–1.91)), and PTSD (OR: 1.32 (1.09–1.59)). Asthma was not significantly associated with any psychiatric disorder. All significant associations persisted after adjustment for psychiatric comorbidities. Limitations: Limitations include self-reporting of atopic disorder status and of all disorder ages of onset. Conclusions: This study confirms the association between MDD and PD and seasonal allergies, and extends this relationship to GAD and PTSD.

"In vivo molecular chronotyping, circadian misalignment, and high rates of depression in young adults","Background: Young adults are disproportionately affected by depression and related mental disorders. Circadian misalignment (a phase advance or delay in the body's internal clock timing) is thought to exert adverse effects on downstream physiological processes regulating mood. Circadian disruption may represent an additional, under-appreciated risk factor affecting young adults. Here, we test the hypothesis that depression in young adults is associated with circadian misalignment—the lack of concordance between an individual's endogenous rhythm and their external social and academic environment. Methods: We screened 528 individuals for morningness-eveningness diurnal preference and sleep-wake chronotype. We selected individuals with extreme scores ( n = 130) for estimation of circadian phase by measuring clock gene mRNA oscillations in hair follicles (a peripheral clock). Using an independent, data-driven cluster analysis, we define the circadian misalignment of both advanced- and delayed-phase individuals from clock gene mRNA expression levels. We compare depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), social jetlag, sleep duration, and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) scores between misaligned individuals and control individuals of intermediate chronotype ( n = 173). Results: We demonstrate that depression scores in young adults are significantly higher in individuals with circadian phase delays and in individuals with a mismatch between circadian behavioral phenotypes and circadian molecular phase. Evening-type individuals with circadian phase delays are 20 times more likely and mismatched individuals are 5–8 times more likely to be depressed than control individuals. Sleep disturbance shows a similar relationship with circadian phenotypes, but the mood effects described in this study are independent of sleep duration, social jetlag and gender. Limitations: Our study examined peripheral clock genes that represents a circadian rhythm potentially influenced by both intrinsic and external, environmental factors. Our study population spanned a limited age-group and our results cannot distinguish between cause and effect of circadian, sleep and mood variables. Conclusions: Our study validates previous theoretical predictions of circadian effects on mood disorders and highlights a critical, hidden risk factor affecting mood in young adults—circadian disruption.

Baseline serum C-reactive protein levels may predict antidepressant treatment responses in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Inflammation has been shown previously to predict antidepressant treatment response. This retrospective study was conducted to test if the baseline serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could predict antidepressant treatment responses in a Chinese sample. Methods: 75 adult inpatients (26 male, 49 female) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed according to DSM-5 were included in this study. Sociodemographic and clinical features, baseline CRP levels, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) scores assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 were then collected. Afterwards patients were divided into two groups: the low CRP group (baseline CRP &lt; 1 mg/L, n = 47) and the high CRP group (baseline CRP ≥ 1 mg/L, n = 28). Depression severity and treatment response were compared between the two groups. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant group * assessments interaction in HDRS-17 scores ( F = 4.754; p = 0.005). Post-hoc test showed that the two groups differed in HDRS-17 scores at week 4 ( F = 6.698; p = 0.012), with the low CRP group having lower HDRS-17 scores than the high CRP group. Moreover, the low CRP group exhibited higher percent reduction in HDRS-17 scores at week 3 ( F = 5.016; p = 0.028) and week 4 ( F = 9.865; p = 0.003) as compared to the high CRP group. Cox proportional hazard model showed that the remission rate was higher in the low CRP group ( p = 0.010). Limitations: Patients received uncontrolled antidepressant therapy and the sample size was limited. Conclusions: Baseline serum CRP levels may predict antidepressant treatment responses in patients with MDD and patients with higher levels of CRP were less likely to get remission.

"Effects of melatonin administration on mental health parameters, metabolic and genetic profiles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin supplementation on mental health parameters, metabolic and genetic parameters in women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 58 subjects, aged 18–40 years old. Subjects were randomly allocated to take either 10 mg melatonin (2 melatonin capsules, 5 mg each) ( n = 29) or placebo ( n = 29) once a day 1 h before bedtime for 12 weeks. Glycemic control and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Using RT-PCR method, gene expression related to insulin and lipid metabolism was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PCOS women. Results: Melatonin supplementation significantly decreased Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (β −2.15; 95% CI, −3.62, −0.68; P = 0.005), Beck Depression Inventory index (β −3.62; 95% CI, −5.53, −1.78; P &lt; 0.001) and Beck Anxiety Inventory index (β −1.95; 95% CI, −3.41, −0.48; P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. In addition, melatonin administration, compared with the placebo, significantly reduced serum insulin (β −1.20 µIU/mL; 95% CI, −2.14, −0.26; P = 0.01), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (β −0.28; 95% CI, −0.50, −0.05; P = 0.01), serum total- (β −7.96 mg/dL; 95% CI, −13.75, −2.17; P = 0.008) and LDL-cholesterol levels (β −5.88 mg/dL; 95% CI, −11.42, −0.33; P = 0.03), and significantly increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (β 0.008; 95% CI, 0.002, 0.014; P = 0.007). Moreover, melatonin supplementation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) ( P = 0.004) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. Conclusions: Overall, melatonin administration for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, and gene expression of PPAR-γ and LDLR among women with PCOS.

Depression is associated with diabetes status of family members: NHANES (1999–2016),"Background: The majority of the studies in this area focus on the psychological impact of having diabetic children or adolescents on parents, while a limited number of studies have investigated the effect of diabetes on the mental health status of family members in the general population. Thus, the aim of the current study is to explore the possible association between mental health disorders (depression, anxiety and panic) and diabetes status of family members among a national sample of adults in the United States. Methods: Our analysis included 1,787 and 25,574 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004 and 2005–2016, respectively. Diabetes status of family members was self-reported by the participants, and depression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in NHANES (1999–2004) and NHANES (2005–2016), respectively. Results: With NHANES (1999–2004) participants, logistic regression indicated a marginally significant association between depression and diabetes status of family members after multivariable adjustment ( P = 0.07), and trend analysis suggested that participants who had more diabetic family members were at a higher risk of depression ( P trend &lt; 0.01). We further validated these results using data from NHANES (2005–2016), which indicated diabetes status of family members was associated with both clinically relevant depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) ( P &lt; 0.01). Limitations: The information about the mental health status of family members and the exact role of participants in caring for diabetic patients was inadequate. Conclusions: A positive association between depression and diabetes status of family members was observed in the general population, suggesting that psychological interventions targeting the family members of diabetic patients are worthy of attention.

"Stressful life events, insomnia and suicidality in a large sample of Chinese adolescents","Aims: This study aimed to examine the associations between stressful life events, insomnia, and suicidality including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP) and suicide attempt (SA) in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. Methods: A total of 11,831 adolescents who participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort were included for the analysis. Participants were sampled from 8 middle/high schools in 3 counties of Shandong, China. Participants completed a structured behavior and health questionnaire, including suicidality, demographics, depression/anxiety, stressful life events (SLEs), and insomnia in November-December 2015. A series of logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed to examine the associations between SLEs, insomnia and suicidality. Results: The prevalence rates of overall suicidality, SI, SP and SA in the last year were 13.1%, 12.5%, 3.3%, and 1.5%, respectively. SLEs were significantly associated with overall suicidality, SI, and SP. Insomnia was an independent risk factor of suicidality and a mediator of the association between SLEs and suicidality. The total effect of SLEs on overall suicidality was 0.597 (95%CI: 0.534–0.661), including 0.457 (95%CI: 0.391–0.523) for direct effect and 0.158 (95%CI: 0.138–0.178) for indirect effect. Insomnia also mediated the associations of SLEs with SI, SP and SA, respectively. Limitations: Causal relationship could not be concluded because this study is cross-sectional. Conclusions: Stressful life events and insomnia are directly associated with suicidality in adolescents. The association between SLEs and suicidality is partially mediated by insomnia.

"Prevalence, clinical correlates and IQ of suicidal ideation in drug naïve Chinese Han patients with major depressive disorder","Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) is a common and serious clinical concern in people with major depressive disorder (MDD). Inconsistent evidence suggests that individuals with SI may have a lower measured intelligence quotient (IQ) than those without SI. The aims of this study were to examine SI prevalence and its associations with demographic, clinical variables and IQ in Chinese drug-naïve MDD patients. Methods: 488 drug-naïve Chinese Han patients (male: 203, 41.6%) meeting a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD were enrolled in a cross-sectional study involving seven hospitals. All participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires, which include information on socio-demographic and clinical variables. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were also administered. Verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full-scale IQ (FIQ) scores were measured using the Chinese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). We categorized patients with SI based on a cut-off score of ≥ 3 on HAMD item 3. Results: An estimated prevalence 32.8% (160/488) of drug-naïve MDD patients experienced SI during the current episode of illness. Patients with SI were more likely to be divorced ( x ² = 6.93, p = 0.031), male ( x ² = 6.04, p = 0.014), had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms ( t = −8.14, p &lt; 0.001, t = −3.28, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), comorbid psychotic features ( t = −5.71, p &lt; 0.001), and lower FIQ levels ( t = −4.21, p &lt; 0.001), when compared to patients without SI. Using logistic regression analysis and adjusting for confounding variables, the following variables were independently associated with SI: divorced marital status compared to married (OR = 4.674, 95% CI: 1.676~13.036), severity of depression symptoms (OR = 1.312, 95% CI: 1.196~1.440), psychotic features (OR = 1.044; 1.012~1.077), and FIQ /PIQ levels which expressed in OR per SD increase in IQ score (OR = 0.740, 95% CI: 0.561~0.977; OR = 0.744, 95% CI: 0.557~0.994, respectively). Limitations: A cross-sectional study which did not assess the influence of severity of SI. Conclusions: The prevalence of SI in drug-naive Chinese patients with MDD is high, and associated with marital status, severity of depression, psychotic features and measured IQ. Further research is needed to further explore these and other potentially relevant risk factors which might affect clinical outcomes.

An inflammatory profile linked to increased suicide risk,"Background: Suicide risk assessments are often challenging for clinicians, and therefore, biological markers are warranted as guiding tools in these assessments. Suicidal patients display increased cytokine levels in peripheral blood, although the composite inflammatory profile in the subjects is still unknown. It is also not yet established whether certain inflammatory changes are specific to suicidal subjects. To address this, we measured 45 immunobiological factors in peripheral blood and identified the biological profiles associated with cross-diagnostic suicide risk and depression, respectively. Methods: Sixty-six women with mood and anxiety disorders underwent computerized adaptive testing for mental health, assessing depression and suicide risk. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to uncover system level associations between suicide risk, depression, and the immunobiological factors in plasma. Secondary regression models were used to establish the sensitivity of the results to potential confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI), treatment and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The biological profile of patients assessed to be at increased suicide risk differed from that associated with depression. At the system level, a biological cluster containing increased levels of interleukin-6, lymphocytes, monocytes, white blood cell count and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count significantly impacted suicide risk, with the latter two inferring the strongest influence. The cytokine interleukin-8 was independently and negatively associated with increased suicide risk. The results remained after adjusting for confounders. Limitations: This study is cross-sectional and not designed to prove causality. Discussion: A unique immunobiological profile was linked to increased suicide risk. The profile was different from that observed in patients with depressive symptoms, and indicates that granulocyte mediated biological mechanisms could be activated in patients at risk for suicide.

"Symptom manifestation and treatment effectiveness, -obstacles and -facilitators in Turkish and Moroccan groups with depression in European countries: A systematic review","Background: This study examined the state of the art relevant for clinical practice on symptom manifestation of depression or depression-related idioms of distress, the treatment effectiveness and obstacles and facilitators for therapeutic success in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant populations with depression in Europe. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane databases (1970-31 July 2017). Peer-reviewed studies, with adult populations, and an instrument assessing depressive symptoms met inclusion criteria and were evaluated following quality guidelines. Results: We included 13 studies on symptom manifestation, 6 on treatment effectiveness, and 17 on obstacles and facilitators, published between 2000 and 2017, from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden ( n Turkish individuals = 11,533; n Moroccan individuals = 5278; n native individuals = 303,212). Both ethnic groups more often reported combined mood and somatic symptoms (and anxiety in the case of Turkish groups) than natives, and had higher levels of symptoms. There was no report on effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and there was weak evidence of the effectiveness of examined psychological treatments for depression in Turkish groups. No treatment has been examined in Moroccan groups. Salient obstacles to therapeutic success were socioeconomic problems, higher level of psychological symptoms at baseline, and negative attitudes towards psychotherapy. Possible facilitators were interventions attuned to social, cultural and individual needs. Results were most representative of first generation, low SES Turkish immigrant patients, and Moroccan-Dutch members of the general populations. Conclusion: Turkish and Moroccan immigrants with depression presented a comorbid symptom profile with more intertwined depressive and somatic complaints. There were indications that the available therapies are insufficient for Turkish groups, but the current evidence is scarce and heterogeneous, and RCTs suffer from methodological limitations.

Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5: Psychometric properties in a Japanese population,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 260 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-64167-097). In the original article, a sentence in the acknowledgement was incorrect. The corrected expression is: “Dr. Yoder, Dr. Weathers, Mr. Bernick, and Ms. Akiyama have no conflicts of interest to declare.”] Background: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) is a widely used self-report measure of PTSD. The reliability/precision and validity of the updated PCL version for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (PCL-5) have only been evaluated in limited populations. This study aimed to examine the factor structure, reliability/precision, and validity of the PCL-5 as assessed by convergent and discriminant relationships with related constructs among Japanese individuals who experienced various traumatic events. Methods: We conducted an online survey of Japanese adults using the PCL-5 and other assessments for PTSD, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric comorbidities, and functionality. A total of 3090 individuals who met a probable diagnosis of PTSD and another 1837 who had experienced traumatic events but did not meet the probable PTSD diagnosis answered the questionnaires. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the best fit with a 7-factor model. This factor structure was temporally stable across 2 time points for 4 months. The total and subscale scores showed good internal consistency and modest test-retest reliability. The convergent and discriminant relationships of the PCL-5 total score with related constructs were demonstrated. Limitations: This study did not use the gold standard interview to assess the diagnostic status of PTSD. Also, the sampled population was younger and had lower incomes in comparison to the census data. Conclusions: Our results support the utility of the PCL-5 for assessing PTSD symptoms in Asian populations.

Predominant polarity in bipolar I and II disorders: A five-year follow-up study,"Background: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) differ in their relative predominance of types of episodes, yielding predominant polarity, which has important treatment implications. However, few prospective studies of predominant polarity exist. Methods: In the Jorvi Bipolar Study (JoBS), a regionally representative cohort of 191 BD I and BD II in- and outpatients was followed for five years using life-chart methodology. Differences between depressive (DP), manic (MP), and no predominant polarity (NP) groups were examined regarding time ill, incidence of suicide attempts, and comorbidity. Results: At baseline, 16% of patients had MP, 36% DP, and 48% NP. During the follow-up the MP group spent significantly more time euthymic, less time in major depressive episodes, and more time in manic states than the DP and NP groups. The MP group had significantly lower incidence of suicide attempts than the DP and NP group, lower prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders but more psychotic symptoms lifetime and more often (hypo)manic first phase of the illness than the DP group. Classification of predominant polarity was influenced by the timeframe used. Limitations: The retrospective counting of former phases is vulnerable to recall bias. Assignment of dominant polarity may necessitate a sufficient number of illness phases. Conclusions: Predominant polarity has predictive value in predicting group differences in course of illness, but individual patients’ classification may change over time. Patients with manic polarity may represent a more distinct subgroup than the two others regarding illness course, suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidity.

Early cognitive processes in OCD: An ERP study,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, intrusive, and distressing obsessions and/or compulsions and is associated with marked impairments in quality of life. The goal of the present study was to examine initial stages of information processing, specifically, perceptual and attention orientation phases that precede response preparation in OCD. Methods: The P3 event-related potential (ERP) component was used as a measure of early cognitive processes of visual stimulus perception. ERPs were recorded while 38 participants diagnosed with OCD and 38 healthy controls performed a passive visual oddball task with neutral and angry schematic faces. Results: OCD participants demonstrated significantly enhanced P3 amplitude over bilateral parietal areas in response to neutral stimuli that activate basic primary perceptual processes. Emotional valence reduced this effect such that OCD patients did not differ from healthy controls in P3 amplitude under the angry stimuli condition. Limitations: Patients in this study were noncomorbid and unmedicated partially limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Our hypothesis of altered early perceptual processes in OCD was supported. These alterations, specific to OCD and not anxiety and depression symptoms, may represent distracted primary cognitive processes in OCD, possibly serving as a basic source for compulsion initiation.

Antidepressants have complex associations with longitudinal depressive burden in bipolar disorder,"Aims: Antidepressants are common in bipolar disorder (BD), but controversial due to questionable efficacy/tolerability. We assessed baseline antidepressant use/depression associations in BD. Methods: Stanford BD Clinic outpatients, enrolled during 2000–2011, assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation, were monitored up to two years with the STEP-BD Clinical Monitoring Form while receiving naturalistic expert treatment. Prevalence/correlates of baseline antidepressant use in recovered (euthymic ≥ 8 weeks)/depressed patients were assessed. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses assessed times to depressive recurrence/recovery in patients with/without baseline antidepressant use, and Cox Proportional Hazard regression analyses assessed covariate effects. Results: Baseline antidepressant use was significantly (albeit without Bonferroni multiple comparison correction) less among 105 recovered (31.4%) versus 153 depressed (44.4%) patients, and among recovered patients (again without Bonferroni correction), associated with Caucasian race, earlier onset, worse Clinical Global Impression scores, and hastened depressive recurrence (only if mood elevation episodes were not censored), driven by lifetime anxiety disorder, and more (even with Bonferroni correction) bipolar II disorder, lifetime anxiety and eating disorders, and core psychotropics. Baseline antidepressant use among depressed patients was associated with significantly (again without Bonferroni correction) older age, female gender, and more (even with Bonferroni correction) anxiolytics/hypnotics, complex pharmacotherapy, and core psychotropics, but no other unfavorable illness characteristic/current mood symptom, and not time to depressive recovery. Limitations: Tertiary BD clinic referral sample receiving open naturalistic expert treatment. Analyses without/with Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: Additional research is required to assess the complex associations between baseline antidepressant use and longitudinal depressive burden in BD.

Worry and anger are associated with latent classes of problematic smartphone use severity among college students,"Background: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity throughout the literature. However, many important psychopathology constructs have not been examined for associations with PSU severity. Worry and anger are two psychopathology constructs receiving little empirical scrutiny in relation to PSU, but theoretically should demonstrate significant relationships. Furthermore, few studies have used person-centered analyses, such as mixture modeling, to analyze possible latent subgroups of individuals based on PSU symptom ratings. Method: We conducted a web survey of 300 American college students, using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated Version, and Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 Scale. Results: Conducting mixture modeling using latent profile analysis, we found most support for a three-class model of latent groups of individuals based on their PSU item ratings. Adjusting for age and sex, worry and anger scores were significantly higher in the more severe PSU classes. Discussion: Results are discussed in the context of uses and gratifications theory, as well as compensatory internet use theory, in terms of individual differences explaining excessive technology use. Limitations: Limitations include the non-clinical nature of the sample. Conclusions: Worry and anger may be helpful constructs in understanding the phenomenology of PSU, and psychological interventions for worry and anger may offset PSU.

Does social and professional establishment at age 30 mediate the association between school connectedness and family climate at age 16 and mental health symptoms at age 43?,"Background: The aim was to use a theoretical framework developed by Bronfenbrenner in order to investigate if the association between school connectedness and family climate at age 16 and mental health symptoms at age 43 is mediated by social and professional establishment at age 30. Methods: Data were drawn from The Northern Swedish Cohort, a prospective population-based cohort. The present study included 506 women and 577 men who responded to questionnaires at age 16 (in year 1981), age 30 (in 1995) and age 43 (in 2008). Mediation was tested by fitting structural equation models (SEM) and estimating direct effects between proximal processes (school connectedness and family climate) and symptoms of depression and anxiety respectively, and indirect effects via social and professional establishment (professional activity, educational level, and civil status). Results: The standardised estimate for the direct path from school connectedness to depression was -0.147 ( p = .000) and the indirect effect mediated by professional activity −0.017 ( p = .011) and by civil status −0.020 ( p = .002). The standardised direct effect between school connectedness and anxiety was −0.147 ( p = .000) and the indirect effect mediated by civil status −0.018 (p=.005). Family climate was not significantly associated with the outcomes or mediators. Limitations: Self-reported data; mental health measures not diagnostic; closed cohort; intelligence, personality and home situation before age 16 not accounted for. Conclusions: Professional and social establishment in early adulthood appear to partially mediate the association between adolescent school connectedness and mental health symptoms in middle-age.

"The relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolarity and mixed features in major depressive patients: Evidence from the BRIDGE-II-Mix Study","Objective: This study primarily focused on the relationship between comorbid attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mixed features and bipolarity in major depressive patients. Methods: The sample comprised 2777 patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) enrolled in a multicentre, multinational study originally designed to assess different definitions of mixed depression. Socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics were compared in patients with (ADHD +) and without (ADHD-) comorbid ADHD. Results: Sixty-one patients (2.2%) met criteria for ADHD. ADHD was associated with a higher number of (hypo) manic symptoms during depression. Mixed depression was more represented in ADHD + patients than in ADHD-using both DSM-5 and experimental criteria. Differences were maintained after removing overlapping symptoms between (hypo)mania and ADHD. ADHD in MDE was also associated with a variety of clinical and course features such as onset before the age of 20, first-degree family history of (hypo)mania, past history of anti-depressant-induced (hypo)manic switches, higher number of depressive and affective episodes, atypical depressive features, higher rates of bipolarity specifier, psychiatric comorbidities with eating, anxiety and borderline personality disorders. Limitations: The study was primarily designed to address mixed features in ADHD, with slightly reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of ADHD. Other possible diagnostic biases due to heterogeneity of participating clinicians. Conclusions: In a sample of major depressive patients, the comorbid diagnosis of current ADHD is associated with bipolar diathesis, mixed features, multiple psychiatric comorbidity and a more unstable course. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the possible mediating role of temperamental mood instability and emotional dysregulation in such a complex clinical presentation.

Obsessive compulsive disorder with and without hoarding symptoms: Characterizing differences,"Objective: In recent years there has been some ambiguity about the way hoarding and OCD are related to each other. The present study examines the differences between persons with OCD/hoarding and OCD/non-hoarding and examines which characteristics are associated with the OCD/hoarding group. Information is established about prevalences, socio-demographical characteristics, OCD and related characteristics, OCD subtypes, comorbidity (depression, anxiety disorders and PTSD) and personality traits. Methods: Data from baseline assessment of The Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association (NOCDA) study are used. The NOCDA sample consists of 419 participants between 18 and 79 years of age, including participants with current or remitted full DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD. Results: Results show that 58 persons (14.3%) are classified as persons with OCD/hoarding and 349 persons (85,7%) are classified as persons with OCD/non-hoarding. OCD/hoarding is independently associated with severity of autism symptoms ( p &lt; .001), living without a partner ( p &lt; .05) and being less conscientious ( p &lt; .05). Persons with OCD/hoarding are not associated with childhood trauma (p = .31), PTSD (p = .91) and AD(H)D, inattentive type (p = .22) and hyperactive type (p = .57). Limitations: Causal interferences about associations between the risk indicators and hoarding symptoms were precluded since results were based on cross-sectional data. Conclusion: This study confirmed differences between persons with OCD/hoarding and persons with OCD/non-hoarding. The most relevant outcome of this study was the association between persons with OCD/hoarding and the increased severity of autism symptoms. These results provide a better understanding of persons with OCD/hoarding and have the potential to improve treatment.

High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves neurocognitive function in bipolar disorder,"Background: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) present widespread and significant neurocognitive impairments during all stages of the disorder. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to improve clinical outcomes in common psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and BD. Whether rTMS can improve cognitive function in BD patients remains unclear. The present study explored the regulatory effects of rTMS on cognitive function in patients with BD. Methods: Fifty-two eligible subjects with BD were randomly assigned to receive active or sham rTMS via high-speed magnetic stimulator with a figure-of-eight coil for 10 consecutive days. In the active rTMS group, a total of 25,000 stimuli were applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 110% of the motor threshold. The sham group received corresponding sham stimulation. Clinical manifestations and cognitive functions were assessed using a modified 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Results: Ten consecutive days of high-frequency active rTMS improved scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span, and the MCCB Category Fluency subtest, without intolerable adverse effects. No significant differences in HDRS or YMRS scores were found between groups. Limitations: No follow-up after the intervention. The effect of the drug on cognitive function in subjects was not excluded. Conclusions: Short-term rTMS can improve cognitive function in BD patients.

The clinical trait self-criticism and its relation to psychopathology: A systematic review—Update,"Background: Self-criticism represents a central phenomenon in a variety of mental disorders. The review looks at the recent body of literature (2012–2018) to summarize the relation of self-criticism and psychopathology beyond depression and aims at detecting how different conceptualizations of self-criticism with psychoanalytical, psychodynamic, or cognitive-evolutionary background are related to psychopathology. Furthermore, latest treatment approaches for dysfunctional forms of self-criticism are reviewed. Methods: The literature research of five databases (PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Library) took place in August 2018. Inclusion criteria for studies to enter the review narrative were an adult sample, non-clinical samples as well as clinical samples, and an empirical approach, which resulted in quantitative data. Results: 48 studies entered the review. Besides depressive symptoms, self-criticism showed positive relations to symptoms of eating disorders, social anxiety disorder, and personality disorders as well as to psychotic symptoms or interpersonal problems through different conceptualizations of self-criticism. Regarding the treatment of self-criticism, compassion- or emotion-focused therapy interventions were investigated in most of the reviewed studies and both reduced self-criticism in clinical and non-clinical samples. However, harsh forms of self-criticism were more persistent and difficult to change. Limitations: The review focused only on the latest empirical findings regarding self-criticism and psychopathology. Conclusion: Potentially functional forms and functions of self-criticism need further consideration, as they represent a possible goal of psychotherapeutic treatment. Future research should address specific questions regarding antecedents and consequences of self-criticism.

"""Nonlinear dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Nonlinear dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients"" by A. Ortiz, K. Bradler, J. Garnham, C. Slaney, S. McLean and M. Alda ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2019[Jan][15], Vol 243, 274-279). The authors’ names were incompletely printed at the time of publication. The names appear correctly in this record, and have been corrected in the original record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-52847-038). Background: Mood regulation is a complex and poorly understood process. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder using time-series analysis. Methods: We recruited 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients. Participants rated their mood, anxiety and energy levels using a paper-based visual analog scale; they recorded their sleep and life events as well. Participants provided information on these variables over a three month period, twice per day. We compared their data using Box-Jenkins time series analysis with data from 30 healthy controls (HC) and 30 euthymic bipolar patients (BD) to obtain information on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the series, and calculated entropy for mood, anxiety and energy series. Results: We analyzed 14,980 data points: 5200 in the healthy control group; 4970 in the bipolar group and 4810 in the unaffected relatives group. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex or education levels. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that individual measures were normally distributed in the whole sample ( D = 0.23, p &gt; 0.1). Autocorrelation functions for mood in all groups are governed by the ARIMA (1,1,0) model, which means that current values in the series are related to one previous point only. In terms of entropy for the mood series, unaffected relatives and bipolar patients showed lower values [mean (SD) : 1.028 ± 0.679; 1.042 ± 0.680], respectively, compared to healthy controls [(1.476 ± 0.33); F (2,74) = 4.39, p &lt; 0.01]. The same case was seen in the energy series, with lower values in the unaffected relatives and bipolar patient groups [mean (SD) : 1.644 ± 0.566; 1.511 ± 0.879], respectively, compared to healthy controls [2.230 ± 0.531; F(2, 75) = 7.89, p &lt; 0.001]. Limitations: Low resolution for the visual analog scale. Conclusions: Using nonlinear analyses, we found that the underlying structure of mood regulation in unaffected relatives is undistinguishable from the one found in bipolar patients. Compared to healthy controls, both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives showed lower entropy levels, which is in keeping with a more rigid system, not as flexible to cope with the demands of a changing environment.

A placebo controlled treatment trial of sertraline and interpersonal psychotherapy for postpartum depression,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy of sertraline and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) relative to pill placebo in a two site randomized controlled trial over a period of 12 weeks. It was hypothesized that sertraline and IPT would be more efficacious than pill placebo with respect to depression and social adjustment. Methods: 162 breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women experiencing a major depressive episode in the first year postpartum from two sites in Iowa and Rhode Island were randomly assigned to IPT, sertraline-clinical management (CM), or pill placebo-CM. CM included infant-focused psychoeducation. Interview-based and self-report measures of depression and social adjustment were obtained at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks of treatment. Linear mixed effects regression (LMER) was used for the longitudinal data analysis. Results: There was no significant effect for treatment condition associated with the primary outcome measure, the HamD-17, but there was a significant effect for sertraline-CM relative to the IPT and placebo conditions over the duration of the trial based on the General Depression scale of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms. There was a main effect for time in that study subjects across all three conditions showed significant improvement for the duration of the trial. Limitations: Limitations of the present study included significant non-engagement with assigned condition and differential effects of IPT across the two study sites. Conclusions: There was improvement for all postpartum women in all conditions. The results do suggest that active interventions with or without medication delivered over a period of twelve weeks can lead to significant improvement in depression and social adjustment among postpartum women.

The impact of depressive comorbidity on neural plasticity following cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic disorder with agoraphobia,"Background: : Depressive disorders are a frequent comorbidity of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD/AG effectively reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, irrespective of comorbidities. However, as depressive comorbidities can confound fear circuitry activation (i.e. amygdalae, insulae, anterior cingulate cortex) in PD/AG, we investigated whether comorbid depressive disorders alter neural plasticity following CBT. Methods: : Within a randomized, controlled clinical trial on exposure-based CBT, forty-two PD/AG patients including fifteen (35.7%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG + DEP) participated in a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A differential fear conditioning task was used as probe of interest. A generalized psycho-physiological interaction analysis (gPPI) served to study functional connectivity patterns. Results: : After CBT, only PD/AG patients without comorbid depressive disorders (PD/AG-DEP) showed reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) extending to the insula. While PD/AG-DEP patients showed enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between the left IFG and subcortical structures (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and midbrain), PD/AG + DEP patients exhibited increased FC between the left IFG and cortical structures (prefrontal, parietal regions). In both groups, FC decreased following CBT. Limitations: : Primary depressed and medicated patients were excluded. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed. Conclusions: : Reduced activation in the left IFG, as previously shown in PD/AG, appears to be a specific substrate of CBT effects in PD/AG-DEP patients only. Differential patterns of FC pertaining to fear circuitry networks in patients without depression vs. cognitive networks in patients with comorbid depression may point towards different pathways recruited by CBT as a function of comorbidity.

Professor Van Den Bergh rightly suggests that good quality reviews that include longitudinal follow-up should examine earlier work to assess sample information, which we did. While we did not cite it (as it offered little additional insight to the paper), we were aware of the earlier work by Mennes, et al. With respect to the suggested omissions/corrections, Section 3.2.2 (Timing of measurement) is in reference to timing of predictor variable measurement, so no change is necessary there.

"The role of neurotrophic factors in manic-, anxious- and depressive-like behaviors induced by amphetamine sensitization: Implications to the animal model of bipolar disorder","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) and substance use disorders share common symptoms, such as behavioral sensitization. Amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization can serve as an animal model of BD. Neurotrophic factors have an important role in BD pathophysiology. This study evaluated the effects of amphetamine sensitization on behavior and neurotrophic factor levels in the brains of rats. Methods: Wistar rats received daily intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of dextroamphetamine (D-AMPH) 2 mg/kg or saline for 14 days. After seven days of withdrawal, the animals were challenged with D-AMPH (0.5 mg/kg, i.p) and locomotor behavior was assessed. In a second protocol, rats were similarly treated with D-AMPH (2 mg/kg, i.p) for 14 days. After withdrawal, without D-AMPH challenge, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated through forced swimming test and elevated plus maze. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were evaluated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Results: D-AMPH for 14 days augmented locomotor sensitization to a lower dose of D-AMPH (0.5 mg/kg) after the withdrawal. D-AMPH withdrawal induced depressive- and anxious-like behaviors. BDNF, NGF, and GDNF levels were decreased, while NT-3 and NT-4 levels were increased in brains after D-AMPH sensitization. Limitations: Although D-AMPH induces manic-like behavior, the mechanisms underlying these effects can also be related to phenotypes of drug abuse. Conclusions: Together, vulnerability to mania-like behavior following D-AMPH challenge and extensive neurotrophic alterations, suggest amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization is a good model of BD pathophysiology.

Memory bias and its association with memory function in women with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: Memory abnormalities are among a central feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is suggested that individuals with PTSD exhibit memory bias; while evidence shows poor memory function in these individuals. We aimed to examine memory bias in PTSD patients relative to controls and to explore an association between memory bias and memory function. Methods: Forty-six women with DSM-IV PTSD, most of whom developed the disorder after interpersonal violence, and 68 non-trauma-exposed healthy control women were studied. Memory bias was assessed by a recognition memory task using negative, neutral, and positive words. Memory function was assessed by a standardized neuropsychological test battery. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed by self-report measures. Results: Compared to controls, patients showed significantly greater negative bias scores (i.e., correctly recognized rates for negative words minus those for neutral words) and poorer memory function. Negative bias scores were significantly correlated with worse memory function in patients. When patients were divided into those with lower vs. normal memory function, the former patients had significantly greater negative bias than the latter patients and controls. Memory bias scores in patients were not significantly correlated with depression or anxiety symptoms, nor were they significantly different between patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and those without. Limitations: The cross-sectional design and absence of the trauma-exposed non-PTSD group limited our findings. Conclusions: PTSD patients have greater negative memory bias, which can be associated with poorer memory function. Our findings may provide an insight into the nature of memory abnormalities in PTSD.

Predominant polarity classification and associated clinical variables in bipolar disorder: A machine learning approach,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by periodic episodes of manic and depressive symptomatology. Predominant polarity (PP) appears to be an important specifier of BD. The present study employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately determine a patient´s PP without the inclusion of number and polarity of past episodes, while exploring associations between PP and demographic and clinical variables. Methods: From a cohort of 148 BD patients, demographic and clinical variables were collected using a customized questionnaire and the SCID-CV. The algorithm employed was the Random-Forest method. The algorithm was programed to classify patients into either depressive or manic predominant polarities and to reveal which variables were associated to the specifier. Results: The algorithm attained an AUC ROC of 74.72% (95% CI = 72.29–77.15%) in classifying patients into either manic or depressive PP. The variables selected by the algorithm were: (1) age at first depressive episode; (2) number of hospitalizations; (3) BD Type II; (4) manic onset; (5) delusions; (6) psychotic features at onset; (7) tobacco addiction; (8) family history of BD; (9) hallucinations; and (10) comorbid anxiety disorders, (11) alcohol dependence, (12) eating disorders and (13) substance dependence. Limitations: The study is limited due to the small sample size, the inclusion of only self-reported and clinician-observed clinical variables and its cross-sectional design. Discussion: The results suggest that the ML approach could be effective in determining a patient´s PP. Furthermore, although not previously reported, some variables, such as tobacco use and comorbid eating disorders, appear to be closely associated with PP.

Body mass index in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Psychiatric disorders are associated with overweight/obesity. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be an exception, as anecdotal evidence suggests lower BMI in OCD. Additionally, depression is associated with elevated BMI, but effects of comorbid secondary depression are unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess BMI and risk for overweight/obesity in OCD and to assess the effect of comorbid depression on BMI. Methods: BMI, demographics, and clinical status were assessed in large samples of individuals with OCD, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, comorbid anxiety/depressive disorders, and non-clinical controls (NCC). Results: Although no initial differences were found between the samples on BMI, the non-depressed OCD subsample had significantly lower BMI and risk for overweight/obesity compared to all other clinical samples. NCC were nearly twice as likely to be overweight compared to non-depressed OCD. Limitations: Eating disorders were excluded in the OCD sample, but BMI &lt; 17 was used as an exclusion criterion in the clinical control groups in lieu of screening for Anorexia. Group differences on demographics were controlled for. Recruitment methodology differed between samples. Conclusions: OCD is associated with significantly lower rates of obesity and overweight, but this relationship was not found when comorbid depression was present. This suggests that the purer the phenotype of OCD, the more substantial protective factor against overweight/obesity emerges compared to other clinical samples and NCC. An OCD-specific reward/anhedonia model, previously offered to elucidate lower smoking rates in OCD, may account for lower BMI in OCD. These results warrant careful clinical attention to the negative impact of comorbid depression on OCD that spans from increasing risk for obesity and cigarette smoking, to hindering treatment response.

Decreased plasma glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor level in major depressive disorder is associated with age and clinical severity,"Background: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as a neurotrophic factor closely related to depression is able to promote the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of multiple neurons. Clinical features, recurrence rates and suicide rates are significant different in major depressive disorder (MDD) according to age. GDNF level changes in the peripheral blood has been reported in patients with MDD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether GDNF levels differentiated within various age groups and its relationship with age/clinical severity. Method: MDD subjects and healthy controls (HC) are divided into younger (age 13–24 years) group (yMDD n = 35, yHC n = 44) and older (age 25–45 years) group (oMDD n = 30, oHC n = 55) based on the age of brain maturity. Clinical symptom severity was evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-17). The levels of plasma GDNF were compared within subgroups. Results: Plasma GDNF levels in yMDD patients were significantly decreased compared to yHC (yMDD 1.55 ± 0.46pg/ml, yHC 1.77 ± 0.47pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, such difference was not found between oMDD group and oHC group. Our results also showed negative correlations between plasma GDNF levels and HAMD/HAMA scores ( r = −0.33, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.39, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This study was underpowered to observe dynamic changes between age and GDNF in MDD due to the cross-sectional design of present study. We also failed to divided subjects into more age groups because of moderate sample size. Conclusion: The present result showed the level of protective neurotrophic factor GDNF associated with age in MDD, suggesting a relevance between GDNF and MDD subjects abnormal brain development in adolescent and young adult period.

Depression symptomatology correlates with event-related potentials in Parkinson's disease: An affective priming study,"Background: Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD. Methods: Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores. Results: Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores. Limitations: Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.

"Nutraceuticals for major depressive disorder—More is not merrier: An 8-week double-blind, randomised, controlled trial","Background: One of the most pressing questions in “Nutritional Psychiatry” is whether using combinations of different nutraceuticals with putative antidepressant activity may provide an enhanced synergistic antidepressant effect. Methods: A phase II/III, Australian multi-site, 8-week, double-blind, RCT involving 158 outpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD. The intervention consisted of a nutraceutical combination: S-adenosyl methionine; Folinic acid; Omega-3 fatty acids; 5-HTP, Zinc picolinate, and relevant co-factors versus placebo. The primary outcome was change in MADRS score. Hypothesis-driven analyses of potential moderators of response involving key SNPs, and BDNF were also conducted. Results: Placebo was superior to the nutraceutical combination in reducing MADRS score (differential reduction -1.75 points), however a mixed linear model revealed a non-significant Group X Time interaction ( p = 0.33). Response rates were 40% for the active intervention and 51% for the placebo; remission rates were 34% and 43% for active and placebo groups, respectively. No significant differences were found between groups on any other secondary depression, anxiety, psychosocial, or sleep outcome measures. Key SNPs and BDNF did not significantly moderate response. No significant differences occurred between groups for total adverse effects, aside from more nausea in the active group. Limitations: Very high placebo response rates suggest a placebo run-in design may have been valuable. Interpretation: The adoption of a nutraceutical ‘shotgun’ approach to treating MDD was not supported, and appeared to be less effective than adding placebo to treatment as usual.

Fear of cancer recurrence among breast cancer survivors could be controlled by prudent dietary modification with polyunsaturated fatty acids,"Background: The pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), the leading unmet psychological need of cancer survivors, may involve the dysfunctional processing of fear memory. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have beneficial effects on psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, and are involved in fear memory processing. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA composition is associated with FCR in cancer survivors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the relationship between n-3 PUFAs and FCR among breast cancer survivors. Adults who had been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were not undergoing chemotherapy were asked to participate. Blood PUFA composition was evaluated by using capillary blood. We directly administered the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS) to assess the grade of FCR. Results: Among 126 participants used for the analysis, the mean age (SD) was 58 (11) years and 47% had stage I cancer. Multiple regression analysis controlling for possible confounders, depressive symptoms, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms revealed that the alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) level was significantly inversely associated with the average score on the CARS overall fear index ( beta = −0.165, p = 0.04). No significant associations were found for other PUFAs. Limitations: Our findings were obtained from a cross-sectional study in a single institute. Conclusion: These findings provide the first evidence of a beneficial effect of ALA on FCR and indicate the need for prospective study of this association. FCR among breast cancer survivors might be controllable by prudent selection of ALA-containing cooking oil.

Application of a transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders to body dysmorphic disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common disorder which is associated with a high rate of comorbidity and functional impairment. Although research shows that cognitive-behavioral therapy can be an efficacious treatment for BDD, there is growing evidence that dysregulated emotion is a core deficit. The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a transdiagnostic, emotion focused cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol that has been developed to target emotion regulation processes that play an important role in the development and maintenance of many emotional disorders Methods: : In the present study, 128 patients meeting criteria for BDD were randomized to either the UP ( n = 64) or waitlist/treatment-as-usual (WL/TAU) condition. Diagnoses were determined using semi-structural interviews and patients also completed the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Results: Repeated measure ANOVA indicated that the UP significantly decreased depression, BDD symptoms and body-related anxiety, as well as significantly improving emotional regulation all with large effect sizes compared to the TAU/WL condition. Treatment gains as well as remission of comorbid conditions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Limitations: : Our study limitations include restricted follow-up periods and excluding participants who were actively suicidal. Conclusions: : To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the UP for BDD, and results suggest that this disorder shares common mechanisms with other disorders of emotion, and that the UP may be an additional efficacious treatment for this condition.

Childhood narcissism: A call for interventions,"The past decades have seen a global shift toward greater individualism, with cultures increasingly valuing separateness and uniqueness over connectedness and similarity. Such values may underlie narcissism, an everyday personality trait that exists throughout the population. Narcissistic children feel superior to others, believe they are entitled to privileges, and crave admiration. When they receive the admiration they crave, they feel on top of the world; but when they do not, they feel like sinking into the ground—a feeling that can spiral into anxiety and depression. Narcissistic children often respond to insults by lashing out aggressively against others. Unsurprisingly, then, they have trouble maintaining close relationships with others. Such pernicious consequences of narcissism have been demonstrated around the globe. Thus, narcissism has become a pressing problem, hurting children as well as society at large.

"Childhood sexual abuse, poly-victimization and internalizing disorders across adulthood and older age: Findings from a 25-year longitudinal study","Background: We aimed to investigate associations between childhood sexual abuse and maltreatment and internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression, PTSD) across adulthood. Methods: Following a postal survey of 2220 women, a subsample was selected to participate in an interview. The subsample included 276 women reporting childhood sexual abuse and 221 women with no reported history of childhood sexual abuse. Interviews were repeated six and 25 years following the first interview. Internalizing disorders were assessed using ICD-8 and DSM-III criteria. Results: There was a lower probability of having an internalizing disorder at older ages than younger ages for all women, regardless of maltreatment history. Latent class analysis was used to define three classes (no/low maltreatment, sexual abuse, poly-victimisation). Compared with no/low maltreatment, a history of childhood sexual abuse was associated with almost double the risk of an internalizing disorder and a history of poly-victimisation was associated with over four times the risk of an internalizing disorder. Childhood sexual abuse and poly-victimisation remained associated with an elevated risk of a disorder in older age. Limitations: Findings are limited by attrition (39% participated at Time 3), low prevalence of severe physical abuse, and changes in assessment practice of childhood maltreatment and mental disorder in the past 30 years. Conclusions: Screening and treatment for internalizing disorders in women with histories of childhood maltreatment remains important in older aged populations.

Treatment effectiveness and tolerability outcomes that are most important to individuals with bipolar and unipolar depression,"Objective: To evaluate patient-reported determinants of treatment effectiveness and tolerability amongst persons with major depressive or bipolar disorders. Methods: The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) conducted an online survey February 2016–April 2016 asking participants about which outcomes are most important in determining subjective treatment effectiveness and tolerability. Results: In total, 896 participants completed the survey [49.9% unipolar depression ( n = 447) and 50.1% bipolar depression ( n = 449)]. Survey respondents reported several previous medication trials with the minority (25% of depression and 29% of bipolar group) of respondents reporting that their current treatment plan was completely effective. When asked how they know that the treatment is working, for both groups, the highest rated response was, “I don't feel overly anxious, agitated or irritable.” Weight gain was the adverse effect that most commonly led respondents to discontinue a medication. Lethargy, emotional blunting, shaking/trembling and anxiety were also identified as common treatment-emergent experiences leading to medication discontinuation in greater than one-third of respondents. The bipolar group more frequently identified several signs that suggested treatment was working (e.g., improved neurocognitive function, improved sleep), as well as more frequently reported several reasons to discontinue medications (e.g., weight gain, trembling). Conclusion: Numerous factors emerged as important to patients when evaluating treatment effectiveness and tolerability. Some of these factors are inadequately assessed by current standard clinical trial outcome measures. Considering these important patient-centred outcomes in future clinical trials, treatment guidelines and direct patient care may serve to improve patient satisfaction, quality of life and the therapeutic alliance.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of group treatments for adults with symptoms associated with complex post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: No previous meta-analyses have specifically investigated the effectiveness of psychological group therapy for symptoms associated with complex interpersonal trauma, including whether trauma memory processing (TMP) therapies are superior to psychoeducational approaches alone. Methods: A systematic review identified 36 randomised control trials (RCTs) which were included in the meta-analysis. Results: Large significant effect sizes were evident for TMP interventions when compared to usual care for three outcome domains including: PTSD (k = 6, g = -0.98, 95% CI -1.53, -0.43), Depression (k = 7, g = -1.12, 95% CI -2.01, -0.23) and Psychological Distress (k = 6, g = -0.98, 95% CI 1.66, -0.40). When TMP and psychoeducation interventions were directly compared, results indicated a small non-significant effect in favour of the former for PTSD symptoms, (k = 4, g = -0.34, 95% CI -1.05, 0.36) and small non-significant effect sizes in favour of the latter for Depression (k = 3, g = 0.29, 95% CI -0.83, 1.4) and Psychological Distress (k = 6, g = 0.19, 95% CI -0.34, 0.71). Limitations: Heterogeneity and a limited number of high quality RCTs, particularly in the Substance Misuse and Dissociation domains, resulted in uncertainty regarding meta-analytical estimates and subsequent conclusions. Conclusions: Results suggest that TMP interventions are useful for traumatic stress whereas non-TMP interventions can be useful for symptoms of general distress (e.g. anxiety and depression). Thus, both TMP and psychoeducation can be useful for the treatment of complex interpersonal trauma symptoms and further research should unravel appropriate sequencing and dose of these interventions.

Nonlinear dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 245 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-05834-004). The authors’ names were incompletely printed at the time of publication. The names now appear correctly in this record.] Background: Mood regulation is a complex and poorly understood process. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder using time-series analysis. Methods: We recruited 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients. Participants rated their mood, anxiety and energy levels using a paper-based visual analog scale; they recorded their sleep and life events as well. Participants provided information on these variables over a three month period, twice per day. We compared their data using Box-Jenkins time series analysis with data from 30 healthy controls (HC) and 30 euthymic bipolar patients (BD) to obtain information on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the series, and calculated entropy for mood, anxiety and energy series. Results: We analyzed 14,980 data points: 5200 in the healthy control group; 4970 in the bipolar group and 4810 in the unaffected relatives group. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex or education levels. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that individual measures were normally distributed in the whole sample ( D = 0.23, p &gt; 0.1). Autocorrelation functions for mood in all groups are governed by the ARIMA (1,1,0) model, which means that current values in the series are related to one previous point only. In terms of entropy for the mood series, unaffected relatives and bipolar patients showed lower values [mean (SD) : 1.028 ± 0.679; 1.042 ± 0.680], respectively, compared to healthy controls [(1.476 ± 0.33); F (2,74) = 4.39, p &lt; 0.01]. The same case was seen in the energy series, with lower values in the unaffected relatives and bipolar patient groups [mean (SD) : 1.644 ± 0.566; 1.511 ± 0.879], respectively, compared to healthy controls [2.230 ± 0.531; F(2, 75) = 7.89, p &lt; 0.001]. Limitations: Low resolution for the visual analog scale. Conclusions: Using nonlinear analyses, we found that the underlying structure of mood regulation in unaffected relatives is undistinguishable from the one found in bipolar patients. Compared to healthy controls, both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives showed lower entropy levels, which is in keeping with a more rigid system, not as flexible to cope with the demands of a changing environment.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder in adult bipolar disorder patients,"Background: It has long been recognized that bipolar disorder (BD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) co-occur in an uncertain proportion of patients, recognized commonly in juvenile years. There is growing suspicion that such co-occurrence is associated with several clinically unfavorable characteristics. Accordingly, we compared 703 type I or II BD subjects with vs. without a lifetime diagnosis of ADHD. Methods: We compared 173 BD patients with vs. 530 without co-occurring ADHD for selected demographic and clinical factors, using standard initial bivariate comparisons followed by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Results: ADHD was found in 25% of BD subjects, more among men and with type I BD. Those with ADHD had higher scores at the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), were more likely to have had less successful school performance, unemployment, lower socioeconomic status, less marriage and more divorce, as well as more substance abuse, suicide attempts, and [hypo]mania, but were less likely to have an anxiety disorder or a family history of mood disorder. Multivariable logistic regression modeling found six factors differing between BD subjects with versus without ADHD: less education after high school, higher ASRS score for inattention, ever separated or divorced, irritable temperament, male sex, and lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at intake. Comments: Co-occurrence of ADHD with BD was identified at a moderate rate, and was associated with several unfavorable outcomes as well as a tendency toward [hypo]mania.

"The impact of COMT polymorphisms on cognition in Bipolar Disorder: A review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders” Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Cognitive deficits represent a core feature of Bipolar Disorder. The dopamine system is considered fundamental for cognitive functions relying on prefrontal cortex, such as attention and executive functions. A genetic regulation of prefrontal dopamine has been described and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has been extensively studied in relation to numerous psychiatric phenotypes, especially because of the involvement of its polymorphisms in the regulation of cognitive functions. Specifically, the Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism greatly alters COMT function and cognitive performance in both psychiatric disorders and healthy controls. However, only few studies assessed the association between COMT polymorphisms and cognitive functions in bipolar disorder (BD) subjects and this association might help in the comprehension of cognitive alterations in BD. Methods: In this context, the present review summarizes results from genetic studies that investigated COMT genetic modulation on cognitive performance in patients affected by BD. Results: Overall the results confirmed that (a) COMT Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism is associated with altered cognitive functions in BD patients, especially in the domains of memory, executive functions and emotion detection; and (b) COMT genotype may interact with both mood episodes and pharmacologic treatments in determining the cognitive profile of these subjects. Limitations: Few genetic studies exploring COMT genetic effect on cognition in BD. Conclusions: These findings seem to indicate a role of COMT polymorphisms in regulating cognitive functioning in patients with BD. The genetically determined dopaminergic tone may be further affected by mood episodes and pharmacological treatments.

"The impact of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on cognition in Bipolar Disorder: A review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders” Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Converging lines of evidence suggest that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) may play a central role in the pathogenesis of Bipolar Disorder (BD), thus representing a valid biomarker of the disease. A common genetic variation in the BDNF gene, the Val66Met, is associated with reduced maturation and secretion of BDNF and therefore it has been related to specific mood, cognitive and neuroanatomical alterations in BD. However, so far, only a handful of studies have investigated the association between Val66Met polymorphism and cognitive functioning in BD. Methods: We performed a bibliographic search on PUBMED of all genetic studies investigating Val66Met modulation on cognitive performances in BD subjects. The inclusion criteria were met by nine studies, including a total amount of 897 BD subjects and 803 healthy controls. Results: From the analysis of the existing literature emerged that a) Val allele in BD adults, but not in BD adolescents, was associated with better performances in selective cognitive domains including executive functions, verbal learning and memory; b) Met allele may negatively modulate the association between childhood trauma and performances in memory, verbal ability and verbal fluency tasks; c) Met allele may also negatively regulate structural abnormalities in cognitive cerebral structures; d) Val/Met carriers showed greater improvements in cognitive functions compared to Val/Val and Met/Met carriers. Limitations: Few genetic studies exploring the impact of Val66Met on cognition in BD. Conclusions: Val66Met polymorphism likely modulates cognitive functions in BD patients with complex gene-environment interactions and through potential modulations of cerebral structures. Further and larger genetic studies are required in order to detect association between BDNF polymorphism, BDNF levels, brain abnormalities and cognition in BD.

"MRI features of clinical outcome in bipolar disorder: A selected review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders”. Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and disabling mental illness, which is characterized by selective gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) brain alterations, as observed by several imaging studies. However, the clinical course of the disease is uncertain and can vary across BD patients, with some having a benign course and others a severe disability. In this perspective, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help identifying biological markers of worse prognosis. Methods: The present selected review aimed at summarizing structural MRI (sMRI) studies exploring the correlation between brain morphology and features of clinical outcome, which could include treatment response, cognitive impairment and global functioning. Results: Overall, the results from the reviewed sMRI studies reported that WM hyperintensities and GM volume reductions, mainly in fronto-limbic areas, correlate with worse outcome in BD. However, the selected outcome measures vary across studies, thus these observations cannot be conclusive. Limitations: Heterogeneity across studies and inconsistency on the outcome measures adopted limit the conclusion of the present review. Absence of widely shared definitions of outcome should be object of further research on BD in order to indicate more stable features of illness course. Conclusions: In summary, WM hyperintensities and fronto-temporo-limbic GM alterations may be potential indices of worse outcome in BD patients, particularly in terms of illness severity and progression. The identification of stable markers of prognosis can help the clinicians in selecting subgroups of bipolar patients who need specific treatment to preserve cognitive/psychosocial functioning, in the light of personalized approaches. To further characterize outcome in BD, future sMRI studies should a) longitudinally investigate patients with either poor or good course of the disease, and b) correlate neuroimaging measures with clinical, cognitive and genetic markers.

The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Non-affective and affective psychoses are very common mental disorders. However, their neurobiological underpinnings are still poorly understood. Therefore, the goal of the present review was to evaluate structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies exploring brain deficits in both non-affective (NA-FEP) and affective first episode psychosis (A-FEP). Methods: A bibliographic search on PUBMED of all MRI studies exploring gray matter (GM) differences between NA-FEP and A-FEP was conducted. Results: Overall, the results from the available evidence showed that the two diagnostic groups share common GM alterations in fronto-temporal regions and anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, unique GM deficits have also been observed, with reductions in amygdala for A-FEP and in hippocampus and insula for NA-FEP. Limitations: Few small MRI studies with heterogeneous methodology. Conclusions: Although the evidences are far to be conclusive, they suggest the presence of common and distinct pattern of GM alterations in NA-FEP and A-FEP. Future larger longitudinal studies are needed to further characterize specific neural biomarkers in homogenous NA-FEP and A-FEP samples.

Testosterone is related to GABA+ levels in the posterior-cingulate in unmedicated depressed women during reproductive life,"Background: The role of testosterone (T) in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and anxiety is broadly supported. Evidence suggests that T has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. One proposed route for the central effects of T is its interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. We explored the relationship between T levels and GABA+ levels in anterior-cingulate (ACC) and the posterior-cingulate (PCC) regions in depressed women, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS). Methods: Twenty-one depressed patients with regularly cycling who were not taking hormonal or psychotropic drugs were recruited. We assessed severity of depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Blood samples were taken for quantification of free (FT) and total testosterone (TT) on the day of the magnetic resonance (MR) scan. We evaluated GABA+ levels in the PCC and ACC, using the Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of MEGA-Edited Spectroscopy (HERMES) sequence. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the association between FT, TT, GABA+ concentrations, and HDRS scores. Results: TT and FT levels were positively correlated with GABA+ levels in the PCC. No correlation was observed between T levels and GABA+ levels in the ACC. The HDRS total scores correlated negatively with FT levels. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional evaluation and the lack of a comparative healthy group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of T are related to increased GABA+ levels in the PCC. This observation may contribute to increased understanding of the role of T in depressive and anxiety symptoms in women.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and suicidality: The mediating effects of psychiatric comorbidities and family function,"Objective: To explore the association between Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and suicidality in children. Mediating effects of family function and psychiatric co-morbidities were also explored. Methods: This is a national representative cross-sectional survey of school-based sample of 4739 children aged 7–15. Logistic regression was used to assess the excess risks of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempts) in 412 children with ADHD. Serial multiple mediator models were conducted to assess the mediating effects of family function and psychiatric comorbidities. Results: The prevalence of suicidality in children with ADHD was approximately 20% in Taiwan. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of suicidality among children with ADHD was approximately four times higher than among non-ADHD children [(adjusted Odds Ratio [“OR”] = 3.82, 95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) (2.73, 5.34)] for suicidal ideation, adjusted OR = 4.18, 95% CI (2.57, 6.80) for suicide plan and adjusted OR = 4.45, 95% CI (1.99, 9.93) for suicide attempts. The mediating effects of anxiety/depression and conduct problems were about 20% and 8%, respectively, across all suicide outcomes. The mediating effects of family function were around 6–7% for suicidal ideation and 16–18% for suicide plan and suicide attempts. The effects of ADHD on suicidality, in general, remained after considering the mediating roles of family function and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Children with ADHD are at a high risk of suicide. Although the family function and psychiatric co-morbidities partially mediate this association, ADHD in itself is a potent suicide risk factor and should be an important target for suicide prevention.

The relation between empathy and depressive symptoms in a Dutch population sample,"Background: Impairments in social functioning are common in individuals with (sub)clinical levels of depression. One possible underlying mechanism of this relationship is low empathy. The present study examined linear and non-linear associations between empathy and depressive symptoms, and whether these associations were moderated by gender. Methods: Using the Empathy Quotient scale, cognitive and affective empathy were assessed using a large convenience sample from the general Dutch population (N = 3076). Depressive symptoms were indexed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16). Results: Low cognitive empathy was associated with more depressive symptoms. There was a weak positive relation between affective empathy and depressive symptoms, indexed by the QIDS rather than the DASS. Limitations: Generalizing results to the general population remains difficult with a convenience sample. Self-reported data may be affected by social-desirability or sex-stereotypical reporting biases. Conclusions: Our results support a linear relationship between cognitive empathy and symptoms of depression. There was some evidence for non-linear associations and a moderating role of gender, but these patterns were not observed across all types of analysis.

Neurocognitive clusters: A pilot study of young people with affective disorders in an inpatient facility,"Background: There is growing evidence to support the need for personalised intervention in the early stages of a major psychiatric illness, as well as the clear delineation of subgroups in psychiatric disorders based on cognitive impairment. Affective disorders are often accompanied by neurocognitive deficits; however a lack of research among young adult inpatients highlights the need to assess the utility of cognitive testing in this population. Methods: A computerised cognitive battery was administered to 50 current inpatient young adults (16–30 years; 75% female) with an affective disorder. Patients also completed a computerised self-report questionnaire (to measure demographics and clinical features) that included items evaluating subjective impressions of their cognition. Results: Hierarchical cluster analysis determined two neurocognitive subgroups: cluster 1 ( n = 16) showed more severe impairments in sustained attention and memory as well as higher anxiety levels, compared to their peers in cluster 2 ( n = 30) who showed the most impaired attentional switching. Across the sample, poor sustained attention was significantly correlated with higher levels of current anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas poor verbal memory was significantly associated with increased psychological distress. Limitations: This study has a relatively small sample size (due to it being a pilot/feasibility study). Furthermore, future studies should aim to assess inpatient samples compared to community care samples, as well as healthy controls, on a larger scale. Conclusions: The findings suggest neurocognitive profiles are important in understanding phenotypes within young people with severe affective disorders. With clear subgroups based on cognitive impairment being demonstrated, the clinical utility and use of new and emerging technologies is warranted in such inpatients facilities. This pilot/feasibility study has strengthened the utility of cognitive screening as standard clinical care in an inpatient unit.

Brain neurokinin-1 receptor availability in never-medicated patients with major depression—A pilot study,"Background: Neurotransmitter substance P (SP) and its preferred neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been implicated in the treatment of affective and addiction disorders. Despite promising preclinical data on antidepressant action, the clinical trials of NK1R antagonists in major depression have been disappointing. There are no direct in vivo imaging studies on NK1R characteristics in patients with a major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, we recruited nine never-medicated patients with moderate to severe MDD and nine matched healthy controls. NK1R availability (NK1R binding potential, BP ND ) was measured with in viv o 3-D positron emission tomography and a specific NK1 receptor tracer [¹⁸F]SPA-RQ. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17). Results: NK1R-BP ND did not differ statistically significantly between patients with MDD and healthy controls. HAM-D17 total scores (range 21–32) correlated positively with NK1R-BP ND in cortical and limbic areas. HAM-D17 subscale score for anxiety symptoms correlated positively with NK1R-BP ND in specific brain areas implicated in fear and anxiety. Limitations: Small sample size. Low variability in the clinical HAM-D subscale ratings may affect the observed correlations. Conclusions: Our preliminary results do not support a different baseline expression of NK1Rs in a representative sample of never-medicated patients with MDD during a current moderate/severe depressive episode. The modulatory effect of NK1Rs on affective symptoms is in line with early positive results on antidepressant action of NK1 antagonists. However, the effect is likely to be too weak for treatment of MDD with NK1R antagonists alone in clinical practice.

Course of subthreshold depression into a depressive disorder and its risk factors,"Background: Information on the natural course of subthreshold depression and risk factors for the development of a full-blown depressive disorder in the general population is scarce. This information is crucial to understand the development of depression and to advance indicated depression prevention. Methods: Using longitudinal data from a representative population-based study (the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2) we assessed 3-year course of subthreshold depression (depressive symptoms causing clinically significant distress for at least 2 weeks, or for 3 days per month for a year; n = 120), compared to an asymptomatic group ( n = 4111) and a depressive disorder group (major depression or dysthymia; n = 294). Next, risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder among adults with subthreshold depression were determined. Results: Twelve percent of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder during 3-year follow-up. Risk factors were lower social support, having recurrent short episodes of depressive symptomatology, remitted and current anxiety disorder, remitted substance use disorder, lifetime suicide thoughts, a chronic physical disorder and diminished mental and physical functioning. Limitations: The number of subjects with subthreshold depression that developed a depressive disorder was small. This limits the possibility to detect significant risk factors. Conclusion: Only a minority of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder over three years. This shows that subthreshold depression does not, by itself, carry an a priori risk to warrant focusing indicated prevention. The identified risk factors could help to detect those subthreshold cases in whom depression prevention is economically and practically viable.

The associations between CM, psychopathological symptoms, and physical health outcomes were assessed with linear and Poisson regression models. Mediation was assessed with difference-in-coefficients method. Results: In the fully-adjusted models, CM was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, psychological distress, difficulty in sleeping, insomnia, and use of sleeping pills and antidepressants in adulthood ( p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, CM was associated with a more than two-folds increased risk of consultation with psychiatrist ( p &lt; 0.001), a 26% increased risk of forgetfulness ( p &lt; 0.001), a 15% increased risk of decline in memory ( p &lt; 0.001), and a 96% increased risk of psychiatric problems ( p &lt; 0.001) over the course of life. In the fully-adjusted models, CM was associated with a 27–82% increased risk of physical health outcomes in adulthood ( p &lt; 0.05). Indicators of psychopathological symptoms significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) mediate the associations between CM and physical health outcomes. Limitations: The design of this study is cross-sectional, and all measures are self-reported. Conclusion: The associations between retrospectively-reported CM and physical health outcomes in adulthood are partially driven by psychopathological symptoms in adulthood.

"Retraction notice to ""The effectiveness of group-based behavioral activation in the treatment of depression: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial""","Reports an error in ""The effectiveness of group-based behavioral activation in the treatment of depression: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial"" by Aaroy T. Y. Chan, Grace Y. Y. Sun, Wilson W. S. Tam, Kelvin K. F. Tsoi and Samuel Y. S. Wong ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2017[Jan][15], Vol 208, 345-354). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief of the Journal of Affective Disorders, as the choice of data analyzed was found to be inaccurate after updated data was provided by the authors, and this had a significant impact on the original article data and conclusions. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-60687-051). Background: Depression is a common mental health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Amongst various psychological treatments for depression, individual behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be effective and relatively simple in its delivery by health care providers although its effectiveness as a group based intervention requires further evidence. The objective of this study is to evaluate and update on the effectiveness of group-based BA to relieve symptoms of depression. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed and prospective randomized trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials comparing group-based BA intervention versus usual care or waitlist controls were included. Depressive symptom measured by various validated scales was the primary outcome. As the interventions can be heterogeneous across the included studies, all analyses were performed by random-effects model. Results: Seven randomized control trials were identified from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden and Iran from 2003 to 2013. A total of 240 subjects were randomly assigned to group-based BA, and all participants included met the criteria for moderate to severe depression at baseline with the majority of participants being females. Participants who joined the group-based BA showed lower depressive symptoms (MD of BDI-II: −6.06 (95% CI: −8.28 to −3.85 and MD of HRSD: −2.82 (95% CI: −4.62 to −1.02)) than participants randomized to the control group with usual treatment. The group-based BA also showed significant reduction in anxiety level (MD of BAI: −3.66 (95% CI: −6.11 to −1.22)) but not quality of life according to two studies. Risk of bias was evident amongst the studies as blinding of health providers and patients were not feasible in psychological studies. Conclusions: Group-based behavioral activation remains promising in relieving depressive symptoms for people with moderate to severe depression from this meta-analysis. Future studies should be higher quality research with larger sample size, longer follow-up periods, and synchronized clinical outcome measures. Patient feedback for group-based behavioral activation can also be further evaluated in order to ensure long term satisfaction and usage in health services.

"Medical and non-medical marijuana use in depression: Longitudinal associations with suicidal ideation, everyday functioning, and psychiatry service utilization","Background: Marijuana use is clinically problematic in depression, and non-medical and medical use may both contribute to barriers to care in this population. Among outpatients with depression, we examined the differential impact of medical or non-medical marijuana use, relative to no-use, on psychopathology and service use over time. Method: Participants were 307 psychiatry outpatients participating in a trial of drug/alcohol use treatment for depression. Measures of past 30-day marijuana use, depression/anxiety symptoms, psychiatry visits, and functional data related to health status were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Regressions (baseline and 1 year) and growth models (over time) predicted clinical and psychiatry visit outcomes, from medical or non-medical marijuana use (no-use = reference). Results: At baseline, 40.0% of the sample used marijuana and more reported non-medical (71.7%) than medical (28.2%) use. Relative to non-users at baseline, patients using medically had worse mental/physical health functioning ( p 's &lt; 0.05), and non-medical use was associated with higher suicidal ideation ( B = 1.08, p = .002), worse mental health functioning ( B = -3.79, p = .015), and fewer psychiatry visits ( B = -0.69, p = .009). Patients using non-medically over time improved less in depression symptoms ( B = 1.49, p = .026) and suicidal ideation ( B = 1.08, p = .003) than non-users. Limitations: Participants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Marijuana use, especially non-medical use, among patients with depression may impede depression symptom improvement while lessening the likelihood of psychiatry visits. Marijuana use and associated barriers to care should receive consideration by depression treatment providers.

"""Person-centered analysis of psychological traits to explain heterogeneity in patient-reported outcomes of coronary artery disease- the THORESCI study"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Person-centered analysis of psychological traits to explain heterogeneity in patient-reported outcomes of coronary artery disease—The THORESCI study"" by Eveline van Montfort, Nina Kupper, Jos Widdershoven and Johan Denollet ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[Aug][1], Vol 236, 14-22). In the original article, there were errors in Table 5 and in the abstract. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-26491-004). Background: Heterogeneity in the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may be explained by relatively stable individual psychological differences. Therefore, we studied multiple personality and coping traits using a person-centered approach, and examined the predictive value of this approach for patient-reported outcomes. Method: 657 CAD patients (age = 66.39 ± 10.6; 79% men) completed multiple self-report questionnaires focusing on demographics, negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS14), neuroticism and extraversion (EPQ), resilience (DRS-15), and coping styles (CISS) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and treatment adherence (MOS) were assessed at 6 months follow-up. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A step-3 latent class analysis identified four subgroup profiles: Low distress (31%), Passive coping (21%), Active coping (20%), and High distress (28%). For all patient-reported outcomes, overall significant differences between the subgroups were observed ( p- values &lt; .05). The High distress profile was associated with the highest levels of emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .94), and lowest levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02) and treatment adherence ( d = −2.75) at follow-up. Patients with an Active coping profile also experienced increased emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .50), but participated in cardiac rehabilitation most often ( d = .13), and reported high levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02). Patients with a Passive coping profile displayed few emotional problems after six months (d’s &lt; .30), but participation to cardiac rehabilitation was relatively low ( d = .04). Conclusions: This study revealed four distinct psychological latent subgroups, which were predictive of patient-reported outcomes. The results indicate that a person-centered approach is useful in explaining heterogeneity in recovery from PCI, and may enhance personalized medicine in patients with CAD.

Treatment of acute stress disorder for victims of violent crime,"Background: Victims of violent crime are at elevated risk of developing acute stress disorder (ASD) as well as subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both of which are linked to severe psychological distress. The aim of this 12-month prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy with a significant other (CBT-SO), relative to usual care (UC), for the improvement of post-traumatic, depression and anxiety symptoms and the prevention of PTSD among victims of violent crime with ASD. Methods: A total of 166 victims of violent crime with ASD were assigned to CBT (n = 54), CBT-SO (n = 52) or UC (n = 60). Self-report assessments and diagnostic interviews were completed at pre-treatment and post-treatment as well as at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Results: CBT and CBT-SO participants had fewer depression symptoms than those in the UC group up to 12 months post-event. Significantly fewer participants in the CBT condition met criteria for PTSD than in the UC group up to 12 months post-event. The CBT group did not differ from the CBT-SO group on any variable at any assessment time. Limitations: Findings must be interpreted in light of the quasi-experimental nature of the study and limitations concerning the management of missing data. Conclusions: Further research is warranted in order to assess whether more extensive involvement of a significant other in therapy may lead to better outcomes for victims of violent crime with ASD.

Bipolar features in major depressive disorder: Results from the Iranian mental health survey (IranMHS),"Background: Past research suggests that individuals suffering from depressive disorders with bipolar features might have different clinical outcomes resembling bipolar disorders. The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of bipolar features among individuals meeting the criteria for 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Iranian population and to examine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with these features. Methods: Data were drawn from the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS), a representative household survey of the Iranian population aged 15–64 years. The study sample consisted of all individuals with a 12-month MDD (n = 1014) ascertained by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1) without a lifetime history of bipolar I or II disorders. Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used to screen for the lifetime history of bipolar features among participants with MDD. Results: Among participants meeting the 12-month MDD criteria, 22.1% (95% CI: 19.6–24.7) had a lifetime history of bipolar features. Compared with those without these features, participants with bipolar features had higher odds of endorsing suicidal ideations and suicide attempts, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders, severe impairment, history of psychotic symptoms, some features of atypical depression and fewer depressive symptoms. Associations with comorbid anxiety disorders [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00–2.03] and history of psychotic symptoms (OR = 2.63 95% CI: 1.81–3.81) persisted in multivariable models. Limitation: Relying on self-reports of lifetime bipolar symptoms which is open to recall bias, and cross-sectional study design which limits interpretation of outcome and course of MDD are two major limitations of this study. Conclusion: The presence of bipolar features is associated with a distinct demographic and clinical profile in MDD. Identifying these cases would enhance the homogeneity of the depressive disorder phenotype in general population surveys. Identifying MDD patients with these features has potential clinical implications.

Cortical thickness reductions in the middle frontal cortex in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Panic disorder (PD), an anxiety disorder characterized by the recurrence of panic attacks, has been reported to be associated with volumetric changes in several brain regions. There are, however, very few studies investigating abnormalities in cortical thickness, and little is known about the relationship between cortical thickness and social dysfunction in PD. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 healthy control participants (HC) were recruited for this study. A whole-brain analysis was performed to evaluate groupwise differences in cortical thickness using the FreeSurfer software. Symptom severity and social functioning were evaluated with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Results: The patients with PD demonstrated a significant reduction in cortical thickness in the left rostral middle frontal cortex (MFC), compared with the HC. Correlational analyses revealed that cortical thickness in the left rostral MFC showed a significant negative relationship with PDSS score and a significant positive relationship with GAF scores in the PD patients. Limitations: All the patients received medication. Conclusion: PD patients showed reduced cortical thickness in the left rostral MFC compared with HC. Furthermore, cortical thickness in this region was associated with patients’ symptom severity and degree of social dysfunction.

Deficits of perceived spatial separation-induced prepulse inhibition in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls,"Objective: This study aimed to assess sensorimotor gating deficits in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) using a modified perceived spatial separation-induced prepulse inhibition (PSS-PPI) paradigm. The relationships between PSS-PPI, demographic and clinical characteristics, and cognitive functioning were also analyzed. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 30 patients with BD were compared to 33 healthy controls (HC) with respect to prepulse inhibition measures of PSS-PPI using a 120 ms lead interval. The Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale were used to assess manic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. Cognition was evaluated using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and the Stroop color-word test. Results: Compared with HC, patients with BD had a lower PSS-PPI level. PSS-PPI showed medium effect size (ES) between patients with BD and HC (ES = 0.65). Among patients with BD, PSS-PPI was positively correlated with the language domain of RBANS and negatively correlated with double word time and color interference time. There were no differences in PSS-PPI levels between patients with and without psychotic symptoms or between those euthymic patients or depressive patients with BD. Conclusions: Patients with BD show a sensorimotor gating deficit as measured by perceived spatial separation-induced PPI of the startle response, which was more sensitive compared to the classic PPI paradigm. Euthymic bipolar patients and depressive bipolar patients show similar PPI level. PPI deficit in patients with BD is related to cognition, but not with demographic and clinical characteristics.

History of suicide attempt and right superior temporal gyrus volume in youth with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder,"Background: Growing evidence suggests an endophenotype for suicidality, including brain morphometric features, could provide an improved platform for suicide risk assessment. Reduced right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) volumes have been implicated in suicidality across psychiatric disorders. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has unique neurobiology and adolescents with TRD are at increased suicide risk. Here, we investigated whether reduced rSTG volume was present in adolescents with TRD and history of suicide attempt. Methods: 45 adolescents—14 with history of suicide attempt and TRD, 14 without a suicide attempt history and TRD, and 17 healthy controls—underwent magnetic resonance imaging and reconstructed rSTG volumes were compared. Depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed with Hamilton depression and anxiety rating scales, and differences between attempters and non-attempters were explored. Results: Adolescents with TRD and history of suicide attempt showed reduced rSTG volume compared to healthy controls. Exploratory analyses revealed greater diurnal variation in depressive symptoms in the suicide attempt group compared to non-attempters. Limitations: Sample size and temporal separation between suicide attempt date and data collection limits interpretation of findings. Conclusions: Reduced rSTG volume may serve as a marker of suicide attempt in adolescence and specific symptom features may have a role in suicide risk assessment. Presently, risk assessment is limited by patient self-report and clinical judgement. A biological model of suicidality will be key to improve risk assessment and could lead to novel treatment approaches. Our findings extend previous results and contribute to our neurobiological understanding of suicidality.

State and trait hopelessness in a prospective five-year study of patients with depressive disorders,"Background: Hopelessness is a common experience of patients with depressive disorders (DD) and an important predictor of suicidal behaviour. However, stability and factors explaining state and trait variation of hopelessness in patients with DD over time are poorly known. Methods: Patients with DD ( n = 406) from the Vantaa Depression Study and the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study filled in the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Social Support Scale–Revised (PSSS-R), and Eysenck Personality Inventory–Q (EPI-Q) at baseline, at six and eighteen months, and at five years. We conducted a multilevel linear regression analyses predicting BHS with these covariates. Results: During the five-year follow-up half of the variance in BHS was attributable to between-patient variance (50.6%, CI = 41.2–61.5%), and the rest arose from within-patient variance and measurement errors. BDI and BAI explained 5.6% of within-patient and 28.4% of between-patient variance of BHS. High Neuroticism and low Extraversion explained 2.6% of the between-patient variance of BHS. PSSS-R explained 5% of between-patient variance and 1.7% of within-patient variance of BHS. Limitations: No treatment effects were controlled. Conclusions: Hopelessness varies markedly over time both within and between patients with depression; it is both state- and trait-related. Concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms and low social support explain both state and trait variance, whereas high Neuroticism and low Extraversion explain only trait variance of hopelessness. These variations influence the utility of hopelessness as an indicator of suicide risk.

Venus and Mars on the benches of the faculty: Influence of gender on mental health and behavior of medical students. Results from the BOURBON national study,"Medical student wellness has emerged as an important issue in medical education. Objective: To evaluate the gender influence on psychiatric and/or psychological follow-up, psychotropic and illicit drug consumption, addictive behaviors, quality of life and motives for consumption in a large multicentric national sample of medical students. Methods: Medical students of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and fulfilled Internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: Overall, 10,985 medical students were included in the present study (mean age 21.8 years, 9640 (87.8%) women). Compared to men, women were found to smoke tobacco and cannabis less frequently (aOR = 0.8 [0.7–0.9], p &lt; 0.0001 and aOR = 0.3 [0.3–0.4], p &lt; 0.0001 respectively), to have lower rate of alcohol use disorders (aOR = 0.7 [0.6–0.7], p &lt; 0.0001). Men were also found to consume more frequently ecstasy, cocaine, mushrooms, amphetamine, LSD, codeine and ketamine (all p &lt; 0.0001) for pleasure and novelty seeking, group effect, but also alleviating anxiety, sedative and stimulant effect and stress before exam (all p &lt; 0.001) while women were more frequently followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist (aOR = 2.0 [1.7–2.3], p &lt; 0.0001), consumed more frequently anxiolytics (aOR = 1.6[1.3–1.9], p &lt; 0.0001) and antidepressants (aOR = 1.4[1.1–1.9], p = 0.01), reported lower rates of physical and mental quality of life in all subscores (all p &lt; 0.0001). They were more frequently exposed to sexual assault (aOR = 4.1 [2.5–6.9], p &lt; 0.0001) and domestic violence (aOR = 1.6[1.1–2.5], p = 0.02) while men were more frequently exposed to physical assault (aOR = 0.4[0.4–0.5], p &lt; 0.0001) during their medical studies. Conclusions: Medical students are mostly women. While men and women are both exposed to professional and personal stress with differences, men are more frequently involved in addictive behavior and psychoactive substance consumption while women are mostly followed-up by psychiatrist and/or psychologist and psychotropic drug consumers, with more impaired self-reported mental and physical quality of life scores. These results should orientate future health strategies for the prevention of later mental illness onset and stress at work in hospital.

Psychiatry: A discipline at specific risk of mental health issues and addictive behavior? Results from the national BOURBON study,"Background: Physicians are at risk for burnout, anxiety and depression. Objective: To explore the self-reported mental health status, substance use behavior and motives of a national sample of interns in psychiatry compared to other specialties. Methods: Interns of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2018 and fulfilled internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: Overall, 2165 interns (302 interns in psychiatry and 1863 in other specialties) mean aged 25.9 years (± 2.8), 35% males were included in the present study. In multivariate analyses, interns in psychiatry were found to have higher rates of current tobacco smoking (aOR = 1.9 [1.4–2.5], p &lt; 0.001), alcohol use disorder (aOR = 1.5 [1.2–2.0], p = 0.001), cannabis use disorder (aOR = 2.7 [1.8–4.2], p &lt; 0.001)). They were more frequently followed by a psychiatrist and/ or a psychologist (aOR = 2.5 1.9–3.3], p &lt; 0.001), they consumed more often antidepressants (aOR = 3.8 [2.2–6.6], p &lt; 0.001) and anxiolytic (aOR = 1.8[1.2–2.8]; p = 0.006). They reported to have been more frequently exposed to sexual assault (aOR = 2.2 [1.1–4.8], p = 0.04) and physical assault (aOR = 1.9[1.3–2.9], p = 0.002), and to have lower vitality (β = 3.5 [0.6–6.4], p = 0.02). Interns in psychiatry reported to have more often experienced ecstasy (aOR = 1.6 [1.2–2.3], p = 0.004), mushrooms (aOR = 1.5 [1.1–2.2], p = 0.04), amphetamines (aOR = 1.9 [1.2–3.1], p = 0.009) and LSD (aOR = 1.8 [1.1–3.1], p = 0.04). Beyond classical motives for this consumption (party, group effect), interns in psychiatry reported to seek more frequently disinhibition (aOR = 1.7 [1.3–2.2], p &lt; 0.001), dealing with anxiety (aOR = 1.7 [1.3–2.3], p = 0.001), and to seek both stimulant (aOR = 1.4 [1.1–1.9], p = 0.04) and sedative effects (aOR = 1.9[1.3–2.7], p = 0.001). Conclusions: Interns in psychiatry are more exposed to violence during medical studies, they report lower vitality and increased substance use behavior. Their motives for consumption suggest mental health problems associated with increased engagement in psychotherapy and self-medication of antidepressant/anxiolytic. This population should be targeted as a specific vulnerable population among interns in medicine to prevent ulterior bad health outcomes.

The association of duration and severity of disease with executive function: Differences between drug-naïve patients with bipolar and unipolar depression,"Background: The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in executive function and the relationship with clinical factors between drug-naïve patients with bipolar depression (BDD) and unipolar depression (UPD). Methods: Drug-naïve patients with BDD, UPD and healthy controls (HC) were recruited (30 cases in each group). All patients were assessed with Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 (HAM-D), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Executive function was evaluated by Stroop color-word test (CWT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Results: In the BDD group, only the CWT number of missing was higher than HCs ( P = 0.047). In the UDP group, CWT number of correct was lower, CWT number of missing was higher, and the WCST indices were worse than the HC group ( P &lt; 0.05). The WCST percentage of errors (PE) and percentage of conceptual level responses (PCLR) in the UPD group were worse than the BDD group ( P &lt; 0.05). In the BDD group, no correlations between CWT and WCST indices and clinical features were detected after correcting for multiple comparisons ( P &gt; 0.05). In the UDP group, the WCST PE, PCLR, number of categories completed (CC), and the percentage of perseverative responses (PPR) were correlated to the number of mood episodes ( P &lt; 0.01). Limitation: This was a small-sample cross-sectional study. The possibility of UPD transforming to bipolar disorder (BD) in future could not be ruled out. Conclusion: Our results suggested only small differences in executive function between drug-naïve patients with BDD and UPD, but in this sample only the UPD group showed differences with HCs. The executive function of drug-naïve BDD patients may be associated with duration of current depressive episode, while for UDP patients executive function indices were significantly correlated with number of mood episodes.

Subconstructs of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale in a postpartum sample in Mexico City,"Background: Postpartum depression is an important cause of morbidity in mothers and children. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the most widely used self-reported measure of postpartum depression, was conceived as a one-dimensional measure. However, evidence that depressive symptoms may be experienced differentially across cultural and racial groups highlights the need to examine structural equivalence using factor analysis across populations. Variation in factor structure for the EPDS remains understudied in middle/low income countries. Methods: We examined the factor structure of the EPDS assessed 6 months postpartum in 628 Mexican women in a longitudinal Mexico City birth cohort. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the optimal fit in our sample and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the fit of two- and three-factor models previously reported in Hispanic populations. Results: The majority of participants had no more than high school education (77%), maternal age was 28 ± 5.4 years and the mean total EPDS score was 6.72 ± 5.8. Using EFA, we identified that the three-factor model provided the optimal fit, with subscales for depression, anxiety, and anhedonia. CFA confirmed that the three-factor model provided the best fit. Limitations: The study population was lower SES, potentially limiting generalizability. The single administration of the EPDS measure in the postpartum period limited our ability to assess stability over time. Conclusions: Better delineation of the multi-factorial structure of the EPDS will allow a more comprehensive understanding of psychological functioning in postpartum women and better inform diagnosis, management and policy.

Mapping depression rating scale phenotypes onto research domain criteria (RDoC) to inform biological research in mood disorders,"Background: Substantial research progress can be achieved if available clinical datasets can be mapped to the National Institute of Mental Health Research-Domain-Criteria (RDoC) constructs. This mapping would allow investigators to both explore more narrowly defined clinical phenotypes and the relationship of these phenotypes to biological markers and clinical outcomes approximating RDoC criteria. Methods: Using expert review and consensus, we defined four major depression phenotypes based on specific RDoC constructs. Having matched these constructs to individual items from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, we identified subjects meeting criteria for each of these phenotypes from two large clinical trials of patients treated for major depression. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the overall treatment response based on the phenotypes: Core Depression (CD), Anxiety (ANX), and Neurovegetative Symptoms of Melancholia (NVSM) and Atypical Depression (NVSAD). Results: The phenotypes were prevalent (range 10.5–52.4%, 50% reduction range 51.9–82.9%) and tracked with overall treatment response. Although the CD phenotype was associated with lower rates of remission in both cohorts, this was mainly driven by baseline symptom severity. However, when controlling for baseline severity, patients with the ANX phenotype had a significantly lower rate of remission. Limitations: The lack of replication between the studies of the phenotypes’ treatment prediction value reflects important variability across studies that may limit generalizability. Conclusion: Further work evaluating biological markers associated with these phenotypes is needed for further RDoC concept development.

Factors associated with false positives in MDQ screening for bipolar disorder: Insight into the construct validity of the scale,"Background: Identifying bipolar patients in the first phases of the illness is essential to establish adequate treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the discriminant ability of the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) in recognizing bipolar patients referred to a tertiary care structure. Methods: Between 2006 and 2012, we assessed 843 individuals referred to the Mood Disorders Program by family physicians in the community. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) was used to assess diagnoses. A nurse collected the information about lifetime symptoms of (hypo)mania in 759 individuals using the MDQ. Univariate chi-square test and logistic regression were used for the statistical analysis. Results: Overall, 86% of the sample had a current anxiety or depressive disorder. When compared to the diagnoses formulated through the SCID, the sensitivity of the MDQ was 75.0%, the specificity was 74%, the positive predictive value was 55%, and the negative predictive value was 88%. Among non-bipolar patients, current post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, current or early remission substance use disorder, and the history of childhood abuse were independently associated with false positive screening using the MDQ. Limitations: Individuals with current substance use disorders were under-represented, whether or not the patients were aware of their diagnosis of bipolar disorder was not recorded, and the history of childhood abuse was collected based on an open interview. Conclusions: The self-rated measure of the symptoms listed by the MDQ seems to measure a dimension shared by both bipolar disorder and other conditions characterized by affective instability and impulsivity.

"The influences of vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation on clinical, metabolic and genetic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid on clinical, metabolic and genetic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 subjects, aged 18–40 years old with PCOS. Subjects were randomly allocated to take either 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks plus 2000 mg/day omega-3 fatty acid from fish oil ( n = 30) or placebo ( n = 30) for 12 weeks. Gene expression analysis of inflammatory cytokines was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PCOS women using RT-PCR method. Results: Vitamin D and omega -3 fatty acid co-supplementation significantly decreased serum total testosterone levels (−0.2 ± 0.5 vs. + 0.1 ± 0.4 ng/mL, P = 0.02) compared with the placebo. In addition, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in beck depression inventory (−1.4 ± 1.6 vs. −0.5 ± 0.6, P = 0.01), general health questionnaire scores (−4.5 ± 4.3 vs. −1.9 ± 2.3, P = 0.005) and depression anxiety and stress scale scores (−5.0 ± 5.1 vs. −2.3 ± 3.5, P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. Additionally, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-administration significantly decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (−1.2 ± 1.9 vs. + 0.1 ± 0.7 mg/L, P = 0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (−0.4 ± 0.4 vs. + 0.2 ± 0.6 µmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), and significantly increased plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels (+ 114.6 ± 122.2 vs. -2.4 ± 168.2 mmol/L, P = 0.003) compared with the placebo. Results of RT-PCR demonstrated that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-supplementation significantly downregulated gene expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) ( P = 0.03), and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ( P = 0.004) in PBMCs of subjects with PCOS, when compared with placebo. Conclusions: Overall, the co-administration of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, serum total testosterone, hs-CRP, plasma TAC and MDA levels, and gene expression of IL-1 and VEGF among women with PCOS.

Person-centered analysis of psychological traits to explain heterogeneity in patient-reported outcomes of coronary artery disease—The THORESCI study,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 241 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2018-46262-086). In the original article, there were errors in Table 5 and in the abstract. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: Heterogeneity in the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may be explained by relatively stable individual psychological differences. Therefore, we studied multiple personality and coping traits using a person-centered approach, and examined the predictive value of this approach for patient-reported outcomes. Method: 657 CAD patients (age = 66.39 ± 10.6; 79% men) completed multiple self-report questionnaires focusing on demographics, negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS14), neuroticism and extraversion (EPQ), resilience (DRS-15), and coping styles (CISS) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and treatment adherence (MOS) were assessed at 6 months follow-up. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A step-3 latent class analysis identified four subgroup profiles: Low distress (31%), Passive coping (21%), Active coping (20%), and High distress (28%). For all patient-reported outcomes, overall significant differences between the subgroups were observed ( p- values &lt; .05). The High distress profile was associated with the highest levels of emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .94), and lowest levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02) and treatment adherence ( d = −2.75) at follow-up. Patients with an Active coping profile also experienced increased emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .50), but participated in cardiac rehabilitation most often ( d = .13), and reported high levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02). Patients with a Passive coping profile displayed few emotional problems after six months (d’s &lt; .30), but participation to cardiac rehabilitation was relatively low ( d = .04). Conclusions: This study revealed four distinct psychological latent subgroups, which were predictive of patient-reported outcomes. The results indicate that a person-centered approach is useful in explaining heterogeneity in recovery from PCI, and may enhance personalized medicine in patients with CAD.

Meta-analysis: Second generation antidepressants and headache,"Background: To assess the risk of headache associated with commonly prescribed antidepressant medications and to examine the impact of medication class, pharmacodynamics and dosage on risk of headache. Methods: We searched PubMed to identify all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of second generation antidepressant medications in the treatment of adults with depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorders. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis to examine the pooled risk ratio of headache reported as a side-effect in adults treated with second generation antidepressants compared to placebo. We used stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression to examine the effects of medication type, class, dosage, indication, and receptor affinity profile on the measured risk of headache. Results: SSRIs were associated with a significantly increased risk of headache (RR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.00–1.13, z = 2.0, p = 0.045) when compared to placebo. There was no significant difference (test for subgroup differences χ² = 2.2, df = 1, p = 0.14) in the risk of headache between SSRIs and SNRIs (RR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.88–1.06, p = 0.63). There was no significant difference in the relative risk of headache with second generation antidepressants based on diagnostic indication, pharmacological properties and dosage of medications. The only antidepressants that were found to be significantly associated with increased risk of headache compared to placebo were bupropion (RR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.06–1.41, z = 2.73, p = 0.006) and escitalopram (RR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.01–1.37, z = 2.11, p = 0.04). Limitations: The small number of studies that examined side effects within fixed-dose trials may have limited the power to examine the association between medication dosing and risk of headache. Additionally, reporting bias could potentially occur non-randomly across agents and therefore effect meta-analysis results. Conclusions: Headaches reported after the initiation of second generation antidepressant medications are more likely to be coincidental than a treatment-emergent side effect of these medications.

"A naturalistic longitudinal study of extended inpatient treatment for adults with borderline personality disorder: An examination of treatment response, remission and deterioration","Background: Experts express reluctance to hospitalize patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) for more than a few days, arguing that extended inpatient care leads to deterioration and adverse events. To date, there is no empirical support for these assertions. Aims: The current study examined the assumption of iatrogenic effects among BPD adults. Methods: Clinically significant and reliable change in symptoms, functional capacities, and adverse events were quantified for both inpatients with BPD (n = 245) and a well-matched inpatient reference (n = 220) sample. Latent growth curve (LGC) models were used to evaluate moderators of the trajectory of PHQ-9 depression scores over the course of hospitalization. Results: Large effect size improvements were observed in depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and functional disability among patients with BPD (Cohen's d ≥ 1.0) and those in the reference sample (Cohen's d ≥ .80). Clinical deterioration and adverse events were rare (occurring in no more than 1.1% of BPD and reference patients on any outcome) with no difference across patient cohorts. BPD diagnosis failed to influence the trajectory of continuous depression severity. Rather, trait emotion dysregulation was associated with initial depression severity. Conclusions: Twenty-five years ago it was assumed that adults with BPD could not benefit from psychiatric treatment. Today there are a number of effective evidence-based outpatient treatments for BPD, but beliefs about extended inpatient treatment have changed little. Current results indicate that extended inpatient treatment can result in significant and clinically meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement in BPD patients without iatrogenic effects.

“Post-traumatic stress symptoms are associated with physical multimorbidity: Findings from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Post-traumatic stress symptoms are associated with physical multimorbidity: Findings from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007"" by Louis Jacob, Josep Maria Haro and Ai Koyanagi ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[May], Vol 232, 385-392). In the original article, the odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the total and the direct effect of each mediator have been switched in Table 4. For example, the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the total effect of alcohol dependence were supposed to be 2.46 and [1.76, 3.46], respectively, and the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the direct effect 2.39 and [1.70, 3.35], respectively. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-12472-052). Background: Studies on the association between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical multimorbidity (i.e., ≥ 2 chronic conditions) are lacking. Thus, we assessed the association between PTSD symptoms and physical multimorbidity using nationally representative, community-based data of the UK adult population. Methods: Data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were analyzed. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ). A total score of ≥ 6 points indicated a probable PTSD. Information was collected on 20 doctor/other health professional diagnosed physical health conditions that were present in the past 12 months. Multimorbidity was defined as ≥ 2 physical diseases. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between PTSD and physical multimorbidity, and the influence of behavioral and psychological factors in this association. Results: Among 7403 individuals aged ≥ 16 years [mean age (SD) = 46.3 (18.6) years; 51.5% females], the prevalence of PTSD increased from 2.1% in individuals with no physical conditions to 5.4% in those with ≥ 4 physical conditions. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and lifetime occurrence of a traumatic event, PTSD was associated with higher odds for physical multimorbidity (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.71–3.56). Anxiety, depression, and disordered eating explained 35%, 21%, and 8% of the PTSD-multimorbidity association, respectively. Limitations: Causality or temporal associations cannot be established due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. In addition, PTSD and physical conditions were assessed using self-reports. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms may be risk factors for physical multimorbidity. Anxiety and depressive symptoms might play an important role in this association. Screening for chronic physical conditions among individuals with PTSD and treating them simultaneously may lead to better clinical outcomes.

The association between severity of depression and prescription opioid misuse among chronic pain patients with and without anxiety: A cross-sectional study,"Background: In light of the increased rates of Prescription Opioid (PO) misuse and associated mortality in several developed countries in recent years, efforts have been made to identify populations who may be at increased risk for misuse of POs. Though the association between depression and PO misuse among pain patients is well documented, little is known regarding the effects of severity of depression on rates of misuse. In this study we explored rates of PO misuse among chronic pain patients screening positive for depression according to level of severity. Methods: Participants included chronic pain patients receiving POs ( N = 554). All participants were screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; cut-off scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 for mild, moderate, moderate-severe and severe depression, respectively) and for opioid misuse using the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM). Logistic regression analyses controlling for additional sociodemographic and clinical factors were conducted. Results: Participants who screened positive for depression were at significantly increased odds to screen positive for opioid misuse (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.63; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.71–7.7) compared to those without depression. Severity of depression was significantly associated with increased odds for opioid misuse for moderate (AOR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–13.76), moderate-severe (AOR = 6.28; 95% CI = 1.6–24.57) and severe (AOR = 14.66; 95% CI = 3.28–65.52) depression but not among those who screened positive for mild depression (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI = 0.39–5.68). Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need to properly asses and address level of severity of co-morbid depression among chronic pain patients receiving POs.

Scared and surrounded by clutter: The influence of emotional reactivity,"Background: Home visits can improve treatment outcomes for hoarding disorder, but factors influencing the success of home visits remain unknown. As home visits expose individuals to clutter and fear, the present study examined the effect that fear and emotional reactivity have on the relationship between clutter and discarding behaviour. Methods: Participants with at least subclinical discarding problems ( n = 143) were asked to save or discard personal possessions of varying value following an emotional induction that took place in either a tidy or cluttered context. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing hoarding severity, emotional state, and emotional reactivity, as defined by one's sensitivity, persistence, and intensity of reactions to emotional stimuli. Results: As expected, participants discarded more items in the presence of clutter and when feeling fearful. However, emotional reactivity moderated the relations between environmental context, acute emotional state, and discarding. Low sensitivity, low persistence, and high emotional intensity negatively influenced discarding in the cluttered context. When feeling fearful, low dispositional emotional intensity negatively influenced discarding in the tidy context. Limitations: Individuals in the tidy environment reported higher levels of fear and anxiety than individuals in the cluttered environment after the fear induction. These differences could have contributed to the difference noted between the two contexts when examining the effect of emotional intensity tendencies. Conclusions: Providing treatment in an environment more representative of the cluttered home can improve discarding or at the very least give therapists a more accurate picture of what clients do in the context that matters most.

A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of Internet-delivered behavioral activation,"Background: Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence-based treatment for depression which has attracted interest and started to accumulate evidence for other conditions when delivered face-to-face. Due to its parsimoniousness, it is suitable to be delivered via the Internet. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy of Internet-based BA and assess the quality of this evidence. Methods: Studies were identified from electronic databases (EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, CINHAL, PsycINFO, Cochrane) and reference lists of included studies. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted data. They assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Results: Nine RCTs on different forms of depression were included with 2157 adult participants. Random effects meta-analyses showed that in non-clinical settings, guided Internet-based BA was non-inferior to other forms of behavioral therapy and mindfulness (mainly very low to low quality evidence) and superior to physical activity (very low quality evidence), psychoeducation/treatment as usual (moderate quality evidence) and waitlist (low quality evidence) at reducing depression and anxiety outcomes at post-treatment and short follow-up. Limitations: The poor quality of some of the findings means that results should be cautiously interpreted. Conclusions: Evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based BA as a treatment for depression is promising. However, high quality studies with longer follow-ups are needed to increase confidence in findings and determine its efficacy in clinical settings and other conditions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for post-stroke depression: A meta-analysis,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used for post-stroke depression (PSD), but the findings have been inconsistent. This is a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for PSD. Methods: Both English (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase) and Chinese (WanFang Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and SinoMed) databases were systematically searched. Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMDs/SMDs), and the risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model. Results: Altogether 23 studies with 1,972 participants with PSD were included and analyzed. Of the 23 RCTs, 39.1% (9/23) were rated as high quality studies, while 60.9% (14/23) were rated as low quality. CBT showed positive effects on PSD compared to control groups (23 arms, SMD = −0.83, 95% CI: −1.05 to −0.60, P &lt; 0.001). Both CBT alone (7 arms, SMD = −0.76, 95% CI: −1.22 to −0.29, P = 0.001) and CBT with antidepressants (14 arms, SMD = −0.95, 95% CI: −1.20 to −0.71, P &lt; 0.00001) significantly improved depressive symptoms in PSD. CBT had significantly higher remission (6 arms, RR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37–2.25, P &lt; 0.00001) and response rates (6 arms, RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22–1.63, P &lt; 0.00001), with improvement in anxiety, neurological functional deficits and activities of daily living. CBT effects were associated with sample size, mean age, proportion of male subjects, baseline depression score, mean CBT duration, mean number of CBT sessions, treatment duration in each session and study quality. Conclusion: Although this meta-analysis found positive effects of CBT on depressive symptoms in PSD, the evidence for CBT is still inconclusive due to the limitations of the included studies. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the benefits of CBT in PSD.

Childhood adversities as predictors of improvement in psychiatric symptoms and global functioning in solution-focused and short- and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy during a 5-year follow-up,"Background: Childhood adversities are frequent among adults who seek treatment for depression or anxiety. These disorders are commonly treated by psychotherapy. Yet it is not known if specific types or durations of psychotherapy are particularly suited for patients who have suffered various early adversities. Methods: 221 depressed and anxious adult outpatients from community, student, occupational, and private healthcare services filled the Childhood Family Atmosphere Questionnaire. They were randomly assigned to short- (solution-focused or psychodynamic) or long-term (psychodynamic) psychotherapy. Outcome was assessed via patient questionnaires and clinician interviews of psychiatric symptoms and global functioning during a 5-year follow-up. Linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Less separations from caregivers expectedly predicted better outcomes in all therapies; unexpectedly, so did greater abuse. Family unhappiness and parental problems predicted faster or greater improvement when patients were assigned to a short- or long-term psychodynamic therapy model. Limitations: As patients with psychotic, substance abuse, and severe personality disorders were screened out, findings might not generalize to these patient groups. Conclusions: Patients with certain childhood adversities appear to respond with faster or greater improvement when the psychotherapy model is explicitly focused on working through the potential connections between past and current problems. If confirmed by in-depth studies, the findings may help match psychotherapeutic models with given patient complaints, as well as fine-tune different psychosocial interventions to individual needs for optimizing treatment outcomes.

Psychological and genetic risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders,"Introduction: To prevent suicide, a nationwide important issue in Korea, understanding its etiology is essential. This study aimed to delineate the risk factors for suicidal behavior in mood disorder patients in Korea. Methods: 216 patients with mood disorders were recruited. We measured suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) history and the association of six gene polymorphisms with SB: COMT (rs4680), HTR1A (rs6295), TPH1 (rs1800532), BDNF (rs6265), SLC1A3 (rs2269272), and SLC1A2 (rs4755404). Results: Patients in the high-SI and SA groups reported more severe depressive, hopelessness, and anxiety symptoms and lower resilience and used less social support-seeking coping than those in the non-significant SI and non-SA groups. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that depressive disorder, depressive symptoms, poor social support, and less social support-seeking coping were significant independent predictors of suicidal ideation. After adjustment for covariates, age, alcohol consumption, and the rs4680 AA genotype in the COMT gene were associated with suicide attempt. Limitations: The modest sample size and a relatively few candidate genes are limitations of the study. In addition, there is no normal control group and the retrospective evaluation of SA limits the interpretation of the causal relationship with factors affecting SA. Conclusions: Suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders may be associated with younger age, alcohol consumption, depressive symptoms, poor social support, less social support-seeking coping, and the COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype.

‘Cool’ and ‘Hot’ executive functions in suicide attempters with major depressive disorder,"Rationale: The World Health Organization reports that, by 2030, depression is expected to be the largest contributor to disease burden. Only small proportion of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) achieves remission and the majority of them do not achieve long-term functional recovery. One of the neuropsychological domains that have been shown to be particularly impaired in depression, is that of executive function (EF). Objectives: We examined whether the patients with MDD with and without suicide attempts had deteriorated ‘cool’ EF and ‘hot’ EF. Methods: The study population comprised 34 MDD attempters, 36 MDD non-attempters, and 55 healthy controls. We adopted the symmetry span task (SSPAN) to measure the updating and the affective shifting task (AST) to measure the inhibition and set-shifting in general and in response to emotional material. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was used to examine the affective decision-making ability. Results: After controlling for PHQ-9, Anxiety (HADS), suicidal ideation, education year and gender, we reported that (1) the MDD non-attempters had worse updating than the healthy controls and the MDD attempters; (2) the MDD attempters had worse general inhibition (GI) than the healthy controls and the MDD non-attempters; (3) the MDD non-attempters had worse general set-shifting (GS) than the healthy controls and the MDD attempters; (4) there was no between-group difference in the ‘hot’ EFs; and (5) MDD attempters with longer durations (over 5 years) since last attempt had worse general inhibition. Conclusions: The disrupted ‘cool’ EFs patients with MDD are consistent with previous review and meta-analytic studies. On the other hand, the two groups with MDD performed similarly to the healthy controls in the ‘hot’ EF.

Effects of repeated attachment security priming in outpatients with primary depressive disorders,"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the potential effectiveness of secure attachment priming in outpatients with depressive disorders. Methods: Forty-eight participants engaged in secure attachment priming or neutral priming in the laboratory (Time 1), after which they received three daily consecutive primes via text message (Times 2–4), aimed at maintaining the effects from Time 1. A follow-up one day later (Time 5) was also included. Dependent measures were assessed at Times 1, 4 and 5. Results: Participants in the secure attachment priming condition experienced higher felt-security than the control group at all time-points, indicating that the felt-security benefit was maintained through repeated priming. Secure priming had a greater impact on reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in comparison to the control prime, though the differences were only significant at Time 4. Limitations: The moderate sample size limited our statistical power. Conclusions: This study was the first experiment using repeated secure attachment priming within a clinical sample. Our findings have potential clinical implications; security priming could be used alongside other treatments to improve outcome. Recommendations for further research are discussed.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summarise relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in cognitive and emotional self-control. Optical technique acquisitions, such as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), seem to be very promising during developmental ages, as they are non- invasive techniques and less influenced by body movements than other neuroimaging methods. Recently, these new techniques are being widely used to measure neural correlates underlying neuropsychological deficits in children with ADHD. Methods: In a short series of articles, we will review the results of functional NIRS (fNIRS) studies in children with ADHD. The present brief review will focus on the results of the fNIRS studies that investigate cortical activity during neuropsychological and/or emotional tasks. Results: According to the reviewed studies, children and adolescents with ADHD show peculiar cortical activation both during neurological and emotional tasks, and the majority of the reviewed studies revealed lower prefrontal cortex activation in patients compared to typically developmental controls. Limitations: a consistent interpretation of these results is limited by the substantial methodological heterogeneity including patients’ medication status and washout period, explored cerebral regions, neuropsychological tasks, number of channels and sampling temporal resolutions. Conclusions: fNIRS seems to be a promising tool for investigating neural substrates of emotional dysregulation and executive function deficits in individuals with ADHD during developmental ages.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Although it has been consistently reported the important role of genetic and environmental risk factors on structural and functional alterations in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the mechanism and the magnitude of the interactions between specific genetic and/or environmental risk factors on brain structures in this disabling disorder are still elusive. Therefore, in the last two decades an increased interest has been devoted to neuroimaging investigations on monozygotic and dizygotic twin samples mainly because their intrinsic characteristics may help to separate the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors on clinical phenotypes, including MDD. Methods: In this context, the present review summarizes results from structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies that investigated twin samples in correlation with MDD. Results: Overall the results confirmed that a) MDD is characterized by significant alterations in selective brain areas presiding over emotion recognition and evaluation, including amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortices, and b) both genetic and environmental risk factors play a key role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Limitations: Few MRI studies exploring MDD in twin samples. Conclusions: The specific contribution of both aspects is still not fully elucidated especially because genes and environment have an impact on the same brain areas, which are particularly vulnerable in MDD. Expansion of the current twin sample sizes would help to clearly establish the potential relationship between risk factors and the development of MDD.

Low cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide levels in human cerebrospinal fluid of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients,"Background: Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is a candidate neuropeptide as a biomarker for major depressive disorder (MDD) because of its effects on emotion and distribution covering brain areas involved in the pathophysiology of MDD symptoms. However, it is unknown whether CART peptide levels are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MDD patients and are correlated with MDD symptoms. Methods: Subjects were 24 patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity (Japanese). We measured CSF CART levels by a commercially available immunoassay kit and analyzed the relationships of the levels with antidepressant dose and symptoms assessed with the 21 item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21). Results: CSF CART levels were significantly decreased in the patients than in the controls ( p &lt; 0.05). In MDD patient group, the CART levels had a negative correlation with antidepressant dose (imipramine-equivalent dose) (ρ = −0.55, p &lt; 0.01) and significantly decreased in antidepressant-treated group (AD-treated group) compared to controls ( p &lt; 0.05). CSF CART levels showed significant negative correlations with psychomotor retardation, somatic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms (all p &lt; 0.05) and a positive correlation with obsessive and compulsive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: In our analysis, all classes of antidepressants were combined together and the effects of medication use in a longitudinal manner did not confirm. Conclusions: We report for the first time that CSF CART peptide levels are reduced in patients with MDD compared with healthy controls. The CART levels showed negative correlations with antidepressant dose and some symptoms, supporting the possibility that CART peptide is involved in the development of depressive symptoms.

Post-traumatic stress symptoms are associated with physical multimorbidity: Findings from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 235 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2018-23782-027). In the original article, the odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the total and the direct effect of each mediator have been switched in Table 4. For example, the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the total effect of alcohol dependence were supposed to be 2.46 and [1.76, 3.46], respectively, and the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the direct effect 2.39 and [1.70, 3.35], respectively.] Background: Studies on the association between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical multimorbidity (i.e., ≥ 2 chronic conditions) are lacking. Thus, we assessed the association between PTSD symptoms and physical multimorbidity using nationally representative, community-based data of the UK adult population. Methods: Data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were analyzed. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ). A total score of ≥ 6 points indicated a probable PTSD. Information was collected on 20 doctor/other health professional diagnosed physical health conditions that were present in the past 12 months. Multimorbidity was defined as ≥ 2 physical diseases. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between PTSD and physical multimorbidity, and the influence of behavioral and psychological factors in this association. Results: Among 7403 individuals aged ≥ 16 years [mean age (SD) = 46.3 (18.6) years; 51.5% females], the prevalence of PTSD increased from 2.1% in individuals with no physical conditions to 5.4% in those with ≥ 4 physical conditions. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and lifetime occurrence of a traumatic event, PTSD was associated with higher odds for physical multimorbidity (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.71–3.56). Anxiety, depression, and disordered eating explained 35%, 21%, and 8% of the PTSD-multimorbidity association, respectively. Limitations: Causality or temporal associations cannot be established due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. In addition, PTSD and physical conditions were assessed using self-reports. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms may be risk factors for physical multimorbidity. Anxiety and depressive symptoms might play an important role in this association. Screening for chronic physical conditions among individuals with PTSD and treating them simultaneously may lead to better clinical outcomes.

Young adult’s attachment style as a partial mediator between maternal functioning and young adult offsprings’ functioning,"Background: The quality of our early attachment relationships with primary caregivers is carried forward to new developmental domains, including interpersonal contexts in adulthood. One of the factors that can disrupt early attachment is maternal depression, which may be associated with less responsive care and may impede the development of a secure attachment. Moreover, this disruption in secure attachment may act as a mechanism by which offspring of depressed mothers are more likely to experience their own psychopathology. In this study we predicted that attachment anxiety and avoidance would mediate the relationship between maternal depression diagnosis and functional impairment predicting young adult offspring's functional impairment. Methods: This study utilized longitudinal data from 98 families with clinically diagnosed depressed and well mothers, and two of their young adult children, an older and younger sibling ( N = 123, Female = 75, M age = 22.09, SD = 2.57). Mother's and young adult children's functioning was based on clinical ratings on the Global Assessment Scale. Attachment was based on the young adult's self-report on the Experiences in Close Relationships. Results: Results indicate that maternal diagnosis and functional impairment predicted offspring's functional impairment. This relationship was partially mediated through offspring's attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance. Limitations: The mediator and outcome variable were measured concurrently, thus causal implications are limited. Conclusions: Our study provides critical evidence that early experiences with depressed mothers may have influence into young adulthood in typical and atypical domains of development. This work extends our understanding of the impact of early experiences in long-term development, and may have treatment implications for intervening on both maternal and romantic relationships to improve attachment.

Differential associations between patterns of child maltreatment and comorbidity in adult depressed patients,"Background: Types of maltreatment often co-occur and it is unclear how maltreatment patterns impact on comorbidity in depressed patients. Methods: We analysed associations of maltreatment patterns with a broad range of comorbidities assessed with diagnostic interviews in 311 treatment-seeking depressed outpatients. Results: Latent class analyses identified a “no maltreatment class” (39%), a “mild to moderate abuse and neglect class” (34%), a “severe abuse and neglect class” (14%) and a “severe neglect class” (13%). We found a dose-response association for the first three classes with comorbid disorders, a general psychopathology factor and an interpersonal insecurity factor. Patients in the “severe abuse and neglect” class had increased odds ratios (OR) of suffering from an anxiety disorder (OR 3.58), PTSD (OR 7.09), Borderline personality disorder (OR 7.97) and suicidality (OR 10.04) compared to those without child maltreatment. Patients in the “severe neglect” class did not have a higher risk for comorbidity than those in the “no maltreatment” class. Limitations: Class sizes in the “severe abuse and neglect” and the “severe neglect” classes were small and findings should be replicated with other clinical and population samples. Conclusions: A higher severity rather than the constellation of types of child abuse and neglect was associated with more comorbid disorders. An exception were patients reporting solely severe emotional and physical neglect who had a similar risk for comorbidity as patients without a history of child maltreatment. This may be associated with distinct learning experiences and may inform treatment decisions.

Physical exercise for late-life depression: Effects on symptom dimensions and time course,"Background: Physical exercise is increasingly recognized as a treatment for major depression, even among older patients. However, it is still unknown which depressive symptoms exercise affects most, (e.g. somatic vs. affective) and the timing of its effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the changes of depressive symptoms after treatment with exercise. Methods: We analyzed data from the SEEDS study, a trial comparing the antidepressant effectiveness of sertraline (S) and sertraline plus exercise (S + EX). Exercise was delivered thrice weekly in small groups and monitored by heart rate meters. Patients with late life depression (n = 121) were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks with the Hamilton Depression Scale. Scores of affective, vegetative, anxiety and agitation/insight factors were analyzed using Multilevel Growth Curve Models and sensitivity analyses (multiple imputation). Results: Compared with the S group, patients in the S + EX group displayed significantly greater improvements of the affective symptom dimension (total effect size = 0.79) with largest changes in the first 4 weeks and last 12 weeks. Improvements were mainly driven by depressed mood and psychomotor retardation. Limitations: Sample size; lack of an exercise only treatment arm Conclusions: Adding exercise to antidepressant drug treatment may offer significant advantages over affective symptoms of depression, rather than somatic symptoms or other dimensions of depression. Compared with standard antidepressant treatment, clinical advantages should be expected both at an early (first 4 weeks) and later stage (after 12 weeks).

Are affective temperaments determinants of quality of life in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder?,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a disabling illness that is associated with low quality of life (QoL). This low QoL goes further than mood episodes, which suggests that stable traits, such as affective temperaments, can cause functional impairment. Objective: Our study analyses the impact of affective temperaments on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of QoL in euthymic BD patients. Methods: A multicentre study was conducted in 180 euthymic BD patients and 95 healthy controls. Firstly, statistical analyses were performed to compare QoL and affective temperaments between the two groups. Secondly, Adaptive Lasso Analysis was carried out to identify the potential confounding variables and select the affective temperaments as potential predictors on the PCS and MCS of QoL in BD patients, as well as the control group. Results: QoL scores in terms of PCS and MCS in BD patients were significantly lower than in healthy individuals. Whereas anxious temperament, anxiety disorder comorbidity, and age were the best predictors of PCS impairment in BD patients, anxious temperament, subclinical depressive symptoms, and age were the best predictors of MCS impairment. Limitations: Further longitudinal studies with unaffected high-risk relatives are needed to examine the potential interaction between affective temperament and psychopathology. Conclusions: Anxious temperament has an impact on QoL in BD in terms of both the physical component and the mental component. Systematic screening of temperament in BD would give clinicians better knowledge of QoL predictors. Further research should allow more individualized treatment of BD patients based on temperamental factors.

Association of suicidal risk with ratings of affective temperaments,"Background: Ratings of particular temperament-types with the TEMPS-A autoquestionnaire have been associated with suicidal risk, and combinations of such ratings may enhance the association. However, the predictive value of scores for individual temperaments and combinations remains to be quantified. Method: We evaluated associations of TEMPS-A ratings for anxious (anx), cyclothymic (cyc), dysthymic (dys), hyperthymic (hyp) and irritable (irr) temperaments, with a history of suicidal acts or reported suicidal ideation in 882 patients with bipolar (BD; n = 509), major depressive (MDD; n = 268) or anxiety (ANX; n = 105) disorders. Results: With BD, scores for cyc and irr were highest and anx lowest; with MDD, dys scored highest, hyp lowest; anx was highest with ANX and MDD. Women (n = 497) had higher anx and cyc scores than men; scores for irr and hyp decreased with age. Scores for dys, anx, and cyc, were higher, and hyp lower, with greater HDRS21 depression ratings. Among 347 suicidal subjects (112 with attempts), cyc, dys, and irr scores were higher, hyp lower. Pooled score [ cyc + dys + irr—hyp ] best distinguished subjects with suicide attempts versus nonsuicidal subjects, including in Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis (AUC for acts = 70.1% [64.9– 75.3]). Multivariable modeling associated suicidal acts with TEMPS-A [cyc + dys + irr—hyp] composite-score, depression severity, BD or MDD diagnosis, and older at illness-onset. Conclusions: Subjects with suicidal acts or ideation were best distinguished by composite TEMPS-A score [ cyc + dys + irr—hyp ]. These factors should help to identify those at suicidal risk.

"Relationship between sedentary behavior and depression: A mediation analysis of influential factors across the lifespan among 42,469 people in low- and middle-income countries","Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) is associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and low mood. There is a paucity of multi-national research investigating SB and depression, particularly among low- and middle-income countries. This study investigated the association between SB and depression, and factors which influence this. Methods: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. Depression was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The association between depression and SB (self-report) was estimated by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. Mediation analysis was used to identify influential factors. Results: A total of 42,469 individuals (50.1% female, mean 43.8 years) were included. People with depression spent 25.6 (95%CI8.5–42.7) more daily minutes in SB than non-depressed participants. This discrepancy was most notable in adults aged ≥ 65 y (35.6min more in those with depression). Overall, adjusting for socio-demographics and country, depression was associated with a 1.94 (95%CI1.31–2.85) times higher odds for high SB (i.e., ≥ 8 h/day). The largest proportion of the SB-depression relationship was explained by mobility limitations (49.9%), followed by impairments in sleep/energy (43.4%), pain/discomfort (31.1%), anxiety (30.0%), disability (25.6%), cognition (16.1%), and problems with vision (11.0%). Other health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking), body mass index, and social cohesion did not influence the SB-depression relationship. Conclusion: People with depression are at increased risk of engaging in high levels of SB. This first multi-national study offers potentially valuable insight for a number of hypotheses which may influence this relationship, although testing with longitudinal studies is needed.

"Pregnant women with depressive and anxiety symptoms read, talk, and sing less to their fetuses","Of interest in this paper is the study of mothers’ vocalizations directed toward the fetus in relation to maternal mood disorder. This would be important to know because as documented in the literature, maternal verbal output has an important impact on young children's cognitive and social-emotional development. Moreover, as reviewed above, fetuses respond to and learn maternal vocalizations, suggesting that the fetal brain may be primed to receive maternal language output. For the purpose of our study, we recruited pregnant women in their third trimester and examined how they were communicating with their fetuses using a scale developed for this study (Communicating with your Baby Scale: CBS). Generally, the scale examined the frequency and type of maternal auditory output aimed at the fetus. In particular, the scale assessed the frequency of maternal reading, singing, and talking directed at the fetus during the latter part of pregnancy as well as other types of stimulation provided to the fetus. We hypothesized that depressed and/or anxious mothers would read, sing and talk to their fetuses less frequently than non-depressed/non-anxious pregnant women based on postnatal research on how mood affected women interact with their children.

Amyloid burden and incident depressive symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,"Background: Relationships between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may become clearer if studied in preclinical AD where dementia is not present. Method: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively, relationships between brain amyloid-β (Aβ), depressive symptoms and screen positive depression in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Inventory (GDS-15) in CN adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study without depression at baseline and classified as having abnormally high (Aβ+; n = 136) or low (Aβ−; n = 449) Aβ according to positron emission tomography at 18-month intervals over 72 months. Results: Incident cases of screen positive depression were not increased in Aβ+ CN adults although small increases in overall depressive symptoms severity ( d = − 0.25; 95% CI, − 0.45, − 0.05) and apathy-anxiety symptoms ( d = − 0.28; 95% CI − 0.48, − 0.08) were. Limitations: As the AIBL sample is an experimental sample, no individuals had severe medical illnesses or significant psychiatric disorders. Additionally, individuals who had evidence of screen-positive depression at screening were excluded from enrolment in the AIBL study. Thus, the current data can be considered only as providing a foundation for understanding relationships between Aβ and depression in preclinical AD. Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence of a depressive disorder or even increased depressive symptoms are themselves unlikely to be a direct consequence of increasing Aβ. New depressive disorders presenting in CN older adults could therefore be investigated for aetiologies beyond AD.

Early life social stress and resting state functional connectivity in postpartum rat anterior cingulate circuits,"Introduction: Continued development and refinement of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI techniques in both animal and clinical studies has enhanced our comprehension of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health. The objective of the current study was to assess both maternal behavior and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes in these animals when they were dams caring for their own young. It was hypothesized that ECSS exposed dams would express depressed maternal care and exhibit similar (same networks), yet different specific changes in RSFC (different individual nuclei) than reported when they were adult females. Methods: We have developed an ethologically relevant transgenerational model of the role of chronic social stress (CSS) in the etiology of postpartum depression and anxiety. Initial fMRI investigation of the CSS model indicates that early life exposure to CSS (ECSS) induces long term changes in functional connectivity in adult nulliparous female F1 offspring. Results: ECSS in F1 dams resulted in depressed maternal care specifically during early lactation, consistent with previous CSS studies, and induced changes in functional connectivity in regions associated with sensory processing, maternal and emotional responsiveness, memory, and the reward pathway, with robust changes in anterior cingulate circuits. Limitations: The sample sizes for the fMRI groups were low, limiting statistical power. Conclusion: This behavioral and functional neuroanatomical foundation can now be used to enhance our understanding of the neural etiology of early life stress associated disorders and test preventative measures and treatments for stress related disorders.

"Examining a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive thinking in depressed, formerly depressed and never-depressed individuals","Background: Evidence that repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a shared feature of a number of disorders has prompted the need for transdiagnostic self-report instruments; that is, measures of RNT that can be administered to individuals irrespective of their diagnosis. The Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ; McEvoy et al., 2010) was developed to meet this need, and its psychometric properties and capacity to predict psychopathology have been tested in undergraduate and clinically anxious samples. Methods: We administered the RTQ to currently depressed ( n = 29), formerly depressed ( n = 61) and never-depressed ( n = 93) community participants. Results: The RTQ demonstrated good psychometric properties, with excellent internal consistency for the RNT subscale (α = .93) and good convergent validity with measures of negative affect and psychopathology symptoms ( r s = .47–.61). In addition, and in accord with our predictions, currently depressed and recovered depressed participants reported more RNT than never-depressed participants, but currently and recovered depressed participants did not differ. In addition, RNT scores explained additional variance in depression and anxiety symptoms, after controlling for gender, age, neuroticism, state negative affect, and intolerance of uncertainty. Limitations: Our sample was drawn from the community but participants were not treatment–seeking, and we employed a cross-sectional design. Discussion: Taken together with previous experimental and longitudinal studies, our results support the utility of addressing RNT in the treatment and prevention of relapse in depression. Moreover, these data confirm the utility of the RTQ as a brief, transdiagnostic self-report measure of RNT.

The effects of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on parameters of mental health and gene expression related to insulin and inflammation in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on parameters of mental health and gene expression related to insulin and inflammation in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: Forty PCOS women were allocated into two groups and treated with 1000mg omega-3 fatty acids plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) per day for 12 weeks. Parameters of mental health were recorded at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Gene expression related to insulin and inflammation were measured in blood samples of PCOS women. Results: After the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation led to significant improvements in beck depression inventory total score (− 2.2 ± 2.0 vs. − 0.2 ± 1.3, P = 0.001), general health questionnaire scores (− 5.5 ± 4.6 vs. − 1.0 ± 2.3, P &lt; 0.001) and depression anxiety and stress scale scores (− 7.2 ± 5.2 vs. − 1.3 ± 1.3, P &lt; 0.001). Compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation could up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression (P = 0.04) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of PCOS women. In addition, compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation down-regulated interleukin-8 (IL-8) (P = 0.003) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression (P = 0.001) in PBMC of PCOS women. There were no significant difference between-group changes in glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in PBMC of PCOS women. Conclusion: Omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation was effective in improving parameters of mental health, and gene expression of PPAR-γ, IL-8 and TNF-α of women with PCOS.

Association of comorbid personality disorders with clinical characteristics and outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing two psychotherapies for early-onset persistent depressive disorder,"Background: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is associated with high rates of comorbid personality disorders (PD). The association of comorbid PD and clinical characteristics has not been systematically studied in PDD. Results regarding effects on treatment outcome are heterogeneous. Methods: We analyzed the association of comorbid personality disorders with clinical characteristics and outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing the disorder-specific Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) with nonspecific supportive psychotherapy (SP) in patients with early-onset PDD. The main outcome measure was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Further baseline measures were comorbid axis-I diagnoses (SCID-I), quality of life (QLDS), global functioning (GAF), interpersonal problems (IIP-64) and childhood maltreatment (CTQ). Results: Out of the 268 patients, 103 (38.4%) met criteria for at least one PD. PD was associated with higher rates of axis I comorbidities (mainly anxiety disorders) and interpersonal problems (patients with PD were more vindictive, more self-sacrificing, less assertive and more inhibited socially than patients without PD). There was no significant main effect of PD on treatment outcome and no significant interaction between PD and treatment group. Limitations: The main limitation was the exclusion of patients with certain personality disorders (antisocial, schizotypal, and borderline personality disorders). Furthermore, the study was underpowered to find interaction effects of small size. Conclusion: Persistently depressed patients with and without comorbid PD primarily seemed to differ in the rate of axis I comorbidity and the severity of interpersonal problems. Treatment outcomes appear to be not significantly affected by the presence of PD.

Predictors of remission from probable depression among Hong Kong adolescents—A large-scale longitudinal study,"Background: This study investigated the incidence of remission from probable depression among adolescents in Hong Kong. Remissions were defined as having Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) scores changed from ≥ 16 at baseline to &lt; 16 over the 12-month follow-up period. The study tested the predictors of remissions, including perceived changes in family support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, positive affect, negative events, social anxiety, and loneliness. Methods: The study surveyed 9666 secondary school students and identified 5487 (57%) students with probable depression in Hong Kong. A questionnaire assessing the levels of the aforementioned variables was completed at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Results: Among participants with probable depression at baseline, 23.2% remitted from depression at follow-up. Remissions were more common among males than females. Univariate logistic regression showed that perceived changes in all the aforementioned variables significantly predicted remission for both males and females. The same is true for most of these variables when they were entered together into multiple logistic regression models (with and without controlling for baseline CESD scores), except for family support in the female model and self-efficacy in both male and female models. Limitations: Limitations include potential self-report bias and only one follow-up observation over time. The design treats cases of probable mild to severe depression as a single group (CESD ≥ 16). Conclusions: The findings are potentially useful for designing and guiding related intervention programs. Results highlight the importance of long-term follow-up of those screened as probable depression to understand the course of changes in levels of depression.

A meta-analysis of the use of probiotics to alleviate depressive symptoms,"Introduction: Some preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the positive impact of probiotic supplementation on depressive symptoms. This paper aims to provide an updated meta-analysis on the topic. Methods: Using the keywords [probiotics OR gut OR microflora OR microbiome OR bacteria OR yeast OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium] AND [mood OR depression OR MDD OR suicide], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Ovid, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR) and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine database yielded 917 papers published in English between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-June-2017. Results: 10 clinical trials with a total of 1349 patients were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. There was no significant difference in mood between the treatment and placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference (SMD) was −0.128 (95% CI −0.261 to 0.00463, P = 0.059). A separate subgroup analysis of studies conducted in healthy versus depressed individuals found significant improvements in the moods of individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (SMD −0.684, 95% CI −1.296 to −0.0712, P = 0.029) and non-significant effects in healthy individuals (SMD −0.0999, 95% CI −0.235 to 0.0348, P=0.146). Limitations: Inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing, bacterial strains and strain combinations limit the comparability of current clinical trials. Furthermore, majority of existing RCTs were conducted in healthy individuals, making it difficult to extrapolate the results to depressed individuals. Conclusion: Probiotic supplementation has an overall insignificant effect on mood. Future studies should be conducted on more patients with clinically diagnosed depression.

Psychological distress and risk for suicidal behavior among university students in contemporary China,"Background: Psychological distress and suicidal behavior are important mental health problems among university students and warrant research to inform strategies for effective prevention in this young population. The present study aimed to assess psychological distress and suicidal behavior and to unravel their associations among university students. Methods: A total of 5972 undergraduate students, randomly selected from six universities in central China, comprised the sample. The Chinese version of the Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R) was used to assess various psychological symptoms. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between psychological distress and risk for suicidal behavior. Results: 40.7% of the university students reported positive in a least one of the 9 psychological symptom dimensions assessed by the SCL-90-R. 7.6% of the students reported suicidal behavior in the previous twelve months. The risk of suicidal behavior was significantly associated with psychological symptoms of all types, but there were notable differences by sex. For male students, depression and phobic anxiety increased the risk of suicidal behavior. Meanwhile, depression and obsessive-compulsiveness were positively associated with suicidal behavior in female students. Furthermore, increasing risk of suicidal behavior was associated with increasing positive symptom total (PST) score and a statistically significant trend was observed. Limitations: Data collected from a cross-sectional survey does not allow any examination of causal inference. Conclusions: Psychological distress and suicidal behavior were both common among university students; and psychological distress was highly associated with suicidal behavior. The findings underscore the importance of mental health care for university students.

Predictors of hospitalization length of stay among re-admitted treatment-resistant Bipolar Disorder inpatients,"Background: Hospitalization accounts for significant health care resource utilization for treatment-resistant Bipolar Disorder (BD), especially among frequent users of acute inpatient psychiatric units. Appraisal of the clinical features and predictive role of selected variables is therefore crucial in such population, representing the aim of the present research. Methods: A hundred and nineteen BD inpatients with an established history of pharmacological treatment resistance for either mania or bipolar depression were classified as long hospitalization cases (LOS + ) and their controls and compared against each other for a number of demographic, clinical, and psychopathological features. Results: Overall, female sex, current second-generation atypical antipsychotic (SGA)/mood stabilizer other than lithium as well as antidepressant treatment at the admission occurred statistically more frequently among LOS + cases, concordant with higher scores at the Hamilton scales for depression and anxiety. Lithium utilization at the time of hospitalization did not differ between cases and controls (LOS-, n = 81/119), as predominant affective temperament and other psychopathological rating did not. Overall, the time of admission, use of SGA, anticonvulsant (other than lithium), antidepressant, lifetime alcohol dependence, and BD Type (-I or -II), but not current mood polarity at the time of hospitalization, correctly predicted LOS + grouping 68.2% of the times: Exp(B) = 3.151, p042. Limitations: Post-hoc, cross-sectional study, relatively small sample size, recall and selection bias on some diagnoses. Conclusions: Overall, LOS+ treatment-resistant BD inpatients characterize for higher severity and greater pharmaco-utilization use, which warrants replication studies to include additional predictors to shed further light on the matter.

Prenatal maternal mood patterns predict child temperament and adolescent mental health,"Background: This study quantifies the dynamics of maternal mood focusing on unpredictability, and to assess if greater unpredictability of prenatal maternal mood predicts child temperament and internalizing symptoms through early adolescence. Methods: The association between prenatal mood predictability and child internalizing symptoms were assessed in two longitudinal cohorts (N's = 227 and 180). Maternal mood was assessed repeatedly during pregnancy as early as 15 weeks’ gestation. Predictability of maternal mood was calculated by applying Shannon's entropy to the distribution of responses on mood questionnaires. Maternal reports of child negative affectivity (a predictor of later internalizing) were collected at 6, 12, 24 months and 7 years of age. Child self-reports of anxiety symptoms were collected at 10 years and reports of depression symptoms at 13 years. Results: Fetal exposure to more elevated maternal mood entropy predicted higher levels of child negative affectivity at 12 months (r = .36; p &lt; 01), 24 months (r = .31; p &lt; 01) and 7 years (r = .32; p &lt; 01) of age. In addition, children exposed to higher prenatal maternal mood entropy, reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms at 10 years (r = .24; p &lt; 01) and elevated depressive symptoms at 13 years (r = .29; p &lt; .01). These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal pre and postnatal mood valence (e.g. depression levels) and for other relevant demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Our findings provide strong support for the notion that patterns of maternal mood influence the developing brain. More specifically, they suggest that prenatal maternal mood predictability may be a critical predictor of developmental mental health trajectories and should be considered when assessing early life influences on lifespan mental health.

Major depressive disorder in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Prevalence and clinical characteristics,"Background: This study investigated the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We enrolled patients with at least one service claim for ambulatory or inpatient care with a principal diagnosis of MDD and at least two service claims for ambulatory care or one service claim for inpatient care with a principal diagnosis of T2DM, as listed in Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Results: We enrolled 715,756 people from the general population (GP), 61,589 patients with T2DM but without MDD, and 778 patients with both T2DM and MDD. The prevalence of MDD increased from 0.70% to 1.25% in the patients with T2DM, whereas it increased from 0.25% to 0.67% in the GP from 2000 to 2010. The higher prevalence of MDD was associated with the female sex, residing in the southern regions of Taiwan, and having comorbidities of cerebrovascular disease and anxiety disorder as well as higher comorbidity severity (Charlson comorbidity index, 1–2 and &gt; 2). Limitations: One limitation is the use of secondary data on diagnoses of MDD and T2DM. Another limitation is that we could not access some crucial related variables. Conclusions: The prevalence of MDD was higher in the patients with T2DM than in the GP. In this study, the prevalence of MDD in the patients with T2DM was lower than that reported in Western countries.

"Alexithymia, not fibromyalgia, predicts the attribution of pain to anger-related facial expressions","Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain, occurring predominantly in women. Previous studies have shown that patients with FM display a pattern of selective processing or cognitive bias which fosters the encoding of pain-related information. The present study tested the hypothesis of an increased attribution of pain to facial expressions of emotions (FEE), in patients with FM. As previous studies have shown that alexithymia influences the processing of facial expressions, independent of specific clinical conditions, we also investigated whether alexithymia, rather than FM per se, influenced attribution of pain to FEE. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three women (41 with FM, 82 healthy controls, HC) were enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study. We adopted two pain-attribution tasks, the Emotional Pain Estimation and the Emotional Pain Ascription, both using a modified version of the Ekman 60 Faces Test. Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and alexithymia was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Patients with FM did not report increased attribution of pain to FEE. Alexithymic individuals demonstrated no specific problem in the recognition of basic emotions, but attributed significantly more pain to angry facial expression. Limitations: Our study involved a relatively small sample size. The use of self-reported instruments might have led to underestimation of the presence of frank alexithymia in individuals having borderline cut-off scores. Conclusions: Alexithymia, rather than FM per se, plays a key role in explaining the observed differences in pain attribution to anger-related facial expressions.

Engagement in mobile phone app for self-monitoring of emotional wellbeing predicts changes in mental health: MoodPrism,"Background: Mobile apps are being used increasingly for mental health purposes, but evidence of their efficacy remains limited. The mechanisms underlying any effects of such apps are also unclear. This study examined the effectiveness of a self-monitoring mobile phone app by investigating the relationships between app engagement and mental health outcomes. Method: Participants downloaded the MoodPrism app from the iOS and Android app stores, completing in-app assessments at start of use and again 30 days later. The app prompted participants daily to complete a short mood questionnaire and formulated their responses into a mood diary. Data from 234 assessment completers (73% female; M age = 34.8 years) were analysed via hierarchical and mediation regressions. Results: In this community sample, app engagement ratings predicted decreases in depression and anxiety, and increases in mental well-being. These effects were mediated by increases in emotional self-awareness, but only for participants who were clinically depressed or anxious at the time of the baseline assessment. Mental health literacy and coping self-efficacy did not play mediating roles. Limitations: Findings suggest that other influential mediators may have not been measured, and future studies could verify the findings by using alternative methodologies, such as comparison with a control group. Conclusions: Engaging with an emotional wellbeing self-monitoring app may reduce depressive and anxious symptoms, and increase mental well-being. Increases in emotional self-awareness may mediate these changes in clinical populations, and further research is needed to reveal other mechanisms that mental health apps can utilize.

Changes in miRNA-132 and miR-124 levels in non-treated and citalopram-treated patients with depression,"Background: Neurotrophins including brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, the roles of brain-specific BDNF-related miRNAs miR-132 and miR-124 are unclear. Methods: We enrolled 45 treatment-free patients with MDD, 32 citalopram-treated patients with MDD, and 32 healthy control subjects. Participants were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). In a case-control sub-study, we followed 14 treatment-free patients who were subsequently treated with citalopram for 2 months. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect plasma BDNF, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify relative plasma miR-132 and miR-124 expression. Results: Patients with MDD had significantly higher HAMA and HAMD scores than the control group, with the highest scores in the treatment-free MDD group. Plasma miR-132 in the treatment-free MDD group was 2.4-fold that in the control group and significantly higher than that in the citalopram-treated MDD group. Plasma miR- 124 in the treatment-free MDD and citalopram-treated MDD groups was 1.8-fold and 4-fold that in the control group, respectively. Compared to the control group, plasma BDNF levels were increased in both MDD groups, but not significantly different between them. There was a positive correlation between miR-132 and HAMD and HAMA scores, whereas no significant correlations were identified for plasma miR-124 or BDNF. Limitations: The range of neurotrophin-related MiRNAs and the number of follow-up cases were limited. Conclusions: BDNF and miR-124 in plasma increase with depression and antidepressants. Plasma MiR-132 might be an indication for depression status.

The centrality of DSM and non-DSM depressive symptoms in Han Chinese women with major depression,"Introduction: We compared DSM-IV criteria for major depression (MD) with clinically selected non-DSM criteria in their ability to represent clinical features of depression. Method: We conducted network analyses of 19 DSM and non-DSM symptoms of MD assessed at personal interview in 5952 Han Chinese women meeting DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MD. We estimated an Ising model (the state-of-the-art network model for binary data), compared the centrality (interconnectedness) of DSM-IV and non-DSM symptoms, and investigated the community structure (symptoms strongly clustered together). Results: The DSM and non-DSM criteria were intermingled within the same symptom network. In both the DSMIV and non-DSM criteria sets, some symptoms were central (highly interconnected) while others were more peripheral. The mean centrality of the DSM and non-DSM criteria sets did not significantly differ. In at least two cases, non-DSM criteria were more central than symptomatically related DSM criteria: lowered libido vs. sleep and appetite changes, and hopelessness versus worthlessness. The overall network had three sub-clusters reflecting neurovegetative/mood symptoms, cognitive changes and anxiety/irritability. Limitations: The sample were severely ill Han Chinese females limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Consistent with prior historical reviews, our results suggest that the DSM-IV criteria for MD reflect one possible sub-set of a larger pool of plausible depressive symptoms and signs. While the DSM criteria on average perform well, they are not unique and may not be optimal in their ability to describe the depressive syndrome.

Insular subdivisions functional connectivity dysfunction within major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive and affective deficits. Previous studies suggested that insula is a crucial node of the salience network for initiating network switching, and dysfunctional connection to this region may be related to the mechanism of MDD. In this study, we systematically investigated and quantified the altered functional connectivity (FC) of the specific insular subdivisions and its relationship to psychopathology of MDD. Methods: Resting-state FC of insular subdivisions, including bilateral ventral/dorsal anterior insula and posterior insula, were estimated in 19 MDD patients and 19 healthy controls. Abnormal FC was quantified between groups. Additionally, we investigated the relationships between insular connectivity and depressive symptom severity. Results: MDD patients demonstrated aberrant FC for insular subdivisions to superior temporal sulcus, inferior prefrontal gyrus, amygdala and posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, depression symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scorers) were associated with the FC values of insular subdivisions. Limitations: First, the sample size of our current study is relatively small, which may affect the statistic power. Second, using standardized insular subdivision seeds for FC analyses may neglect subtle natural differences in size and location of functional area across individuals and may thus affect connectivity maps. Conclusions: Abnormal FC of insular subdivisions to default network and central executive network may represent impaired intrinsic networks switching which may affect the underlying emotional and sensory disturbances in MDD. And our findings can help to understand the pathophysiology and underlying neural mechanisms of MDD.

Development of a prognostic model for predicting depression severity in adult primary patients with depressive symptoms using the &lt;i&gt;diamond&lt;/i&gt; longitudinal study,"Background: Depression trajectories among primary care patients are highly variable, making it difficult to identify patients that require intensive treatments or those that are likely to spontaneously remit. Currently, there are no easily implementable tools clinicians can use to stratify patients with depressive symptoms into different treatments according to their likely depression trajectory. We aimed to develop a prognostic tool to predict future depression severity among primary care patients with current depressive symptoms at three months. Methods: Patient-reported data from the diamond study, a prospective cohort of 593 primary care patients with depressive symptoms attending 30 Australian general practices. Participants responded affirmatively to at least one of the first two PHQ-9 items. Twenty predictors were pre-selected by expert consensus based on reliability, ease of administration, likely patient acceptability, and international applicability. Multivariable mixed effects linear regression was used to build the model. Results: The prognostic model included eight baseline predictors: sex, depressive symptoms, anxiety, history of depression, self-rated health, chronic physical illness, living alone, and perceived ability to manage on available income. Discrimination (c-statistic =0.74; 95% CI: 0.70–0.78) and calibration (agreement between predicted and observed symptom scores) were acceptable and comparable to other prognostic models in primary care. Limitations: More complex model was not feasible because of modest sample size. Validation studies needed to confirm model performance in new primary care attendees. Conclusion: A brief, easily administered algorithm predicting the severity of depressive symptoms has potential to assist clinicians to tailor treatment for adult primary care patients with current depressive symptoms.

Longitudinal association between mental disorders in childhood and subsequent depression—A nationwide prospective cohort study,"Background: Depression ranges among the most impairing mental disorders worldwide, and early detection is a global health priority. Little is known about the association between non-affective mental disorders in childhood/ adolescence and later depression. Methods: Nationwide register-based prospective cohort study, estimating cumulative incidences and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for later depression in individuals with and without non-affective mental disorders in early life. Results: 475,213 females and 484,813 males born 1990–2007 were followed for a mean of 9.14 years (contributing a total of 8778,331 person-years of observation). In the cohort, 7963 (5451 females) were diagnosed with depression. Depression was more common in individuals with prior non-affective mental disorders in adolescence (15.98% in females and 7.02% in males) and in childhood (4.98% in females and 1.6% in males), than in the background population (3.94% and 1.3% in females; 1.37% and 0.47% in males). Eating and anxiety disorders in childhood/adolescence carried the highest absolute risk of depression. The relative risk of depression was particularly high the first year after the first non-affective disorder (IRR = 15.5; 14.07–17.10), but remained highly elevated more than five years after the first non-affective diagnosis (IRR = 2.05; 1.84–2.28), when compared to young people without such disorders. Limitations: This study only included diagnoses given at hospital departments, representing the more severe mental disorders. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with non-affective mental disorders were at substantially increased absolute and relative risk of developing depression in young adulthood, especially females diagnosed with anxiety or eating disorders in adolescence. These findings may help identify groups of children and adolescents at very high risk of developing depression.

Evaluating an e-mental health program (“deprexis”) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Background: Depressive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions for depression have shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psychotherapy for depression. Methods: Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy plus a web-based depression program („deprexis“). Primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results: The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-group effect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = .51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on secondary outcomes (Cohen's d = .07–.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations: The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions: This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to consider in future treatment for depression.

Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments, and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods: Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results: Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations: The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions: Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.

"Acceptance alone is a better predictor of psychopathology and well-being than emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness","Emotional competence, emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance have all been strongly associated to emotional disorders and psychological well-being in multiple studies. However little research has compared the unique predictive ability of these different constructs. We hypothesised that they will all share a large proportion of common variance and that when compared to the broader constructs emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness, acceptance alone would predict a larger proportion of unique variance Methods: 228 participants from a community sample completed anonymously measures of anxiety, depression, happiness, acceptance, mindfulness, emotional competence and emotion regulation. We then ran multiple regressions to assess and compare the predictive ability of these different constructs. Results: For measures of psychological distress, the acceptance measure uniquely accounted for between 4 and 30 times the variance that the emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness measures did. Limitations: These results are based on cross-sectional designs and non-clinical samples, longitudinal and experimental studies as clinical samples may be useful in order to assess the potential protective power of acceptance over time. Another limitation is the use of self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: Results confirmed our hypothesis, supporting the research on the importance of acceptance as a central factor in the understanding of the onset and maintenance of emotional disorders.

Elevation of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in schizophrenia patients,"Background: Psychiatric diseases are usually accompanied by immune dysregulation and activation of the inflammatory response system. However, the characteristics of immunoinflammatory markers in psychiatric diseases are not well defined. Methods: Seventy-three patients with psychiatric diseases were divided into four groups, including a schizophrenia group, an anxiety disorder group, a unipolar depression group, and a bipolar disorder group, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and associated classical immunoinflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), total leukocyte count (TLC), and neutrophilic granulocyte percentage (NEU%) were analysed; patients with physical diseases were excluded to avoid confounders. Fifteen healthy, age- and gender-matched individuals served as controls. Results: Compared with the corresponding values in the control group, the level of CRP in each psychiatric disease group, the levels of IFN-γ and NGAL in the schizophrenia group, and the NEU% in the depression group were significantly elevated (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the levels in the schizophrenia group, the levels of CRP in the bipolar disorder and depression groups, the level of IFN-γ in the bipolar disorder group, and the levels of NGAL in the anxiety disorder and depression groups were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the depression group, the bipolar disorder group showed significant elevation the NGAL level. Limitation: The sample size was relatively small. Conclusions: Immunoinflammatory markers were elevated in patients with psychiatric diseases, especially schizophrenia. We are the first to report that the level of NGAL is significantly increased in schizophrenia patients.

Group-based multicomponent treatment to reduce depressive symptoms in women with co-morbid psychiatric and psychosocial problems during pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Depressive symptoms in pregnant women, which are common and debilitating, are often co-morbid with other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety and personality disorders), and related to low socioeconomic status (SES). This situation may hamper treatment outcome, which has often been neglected in previous studies on the treatment of depression during pregnancy. We developed a new group-based multicomponent treatment (GMT) comprising cognitive behavioral therapy, psycho-education and body-oriented therapy and compared the effect on depressive symptoms with individual counseling (treatment as usual, TAU) in a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES. Methods: An outpatient sample from a university hospital of 158 pregnant women who met DSM-IV criteria for mental disorders were included and 99 participants were randomized to GMT or TAU from January 2010 until January 2013. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used at baseline, every 5 weeks during pregnancy and as the primary outcome measure of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcome measures included the clinician-reported Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), obstetric outcomes and a ‘Patient Satisfaction’ questionnaire. Results: 155 participants were included the intention-to-treat (ITT)-analysis. GMT was not superior above TAU according to estimated EDS (β = 0.13, CI = − 0.46–0.71, p = 0.67) and HDRS scores (β = − 0.39, CI = − 0.82–0.05, p = 0.08) at 6 weeks postpartum. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the GMT and TAU, nor between the randomized condition and patient-preference condition. Limitations: The ability to detect an effect of GMT may have been limited by sample size, missing data and the ceiling effect of TAU. Conclusions: GMT is an acceptable treatment for a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with depressive symptoms and co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES, but not superior to TAU. Further research should focus on understanding and treating co-morbid disorders and psychosocial problems during pregnancy.

A study in the general population about sadness to disentangle the continuum from well-being to depressive disorders,"Objective: Sadness is both a common experience in general population and one of the main criteria of major depressive disorder (MDD). We tested the hypothesis of a depressive continuum using sadness as an intermediate experience between well-being and disorder. Methods: A French cross-sectional Mental Health survey in General Population interviewed 38,694 individuals. We examined prevalences and compared sociodemographic correlates and psychiatric disorders of individuals in 3 independent groups 1) MDD, 2) sadness without MDD, and 3) controls. Results: The prevalence of sadness was of 29.8% in the whole sample and of 93% in subjects suffering from MDD (n = 4976). The “sadness” group shared the same sociodemographic patterns as the “MDD” group. All psychiatric disorders assessed (i.e. bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, psychotic disorder and suicide attempts) were significantly associated with both “sadness” and “MDD” groups compared to “controls”. Individuals with sadness, compared to those with MDD, were significantly less likely to meet the criteria for all psychiatric disorders. MDD's sensitivity of sadness was 94,2%. Limitations: Even though we used a quota sampling method, the sample was not strictly representative of the general population. Conclusion: Sadness validates the depressive continuum hypothesis, since it is more frequent in the general population than MDD itself and at the same time shares with MDD the same sociodemographic and clinical correlates. A gradual association from controls to MDD was observed for psychiatric comorbidities. Finally, the high sensitivity of sadness may suggest its use to screen at-risk individuals converting from well-being to full psychiatric disorders.

"The associations between problematic Facebook use, psychological distress and well-being among adolescents and young adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: A growing body of research has analyzed the potential risks of problematic Facebook use for mental health and well-being. The current meta-analysis is the first to examine the associations between problematic Facebook use, psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) and well-being (life satisfaction, positive mental health) among adolescents and young adults. Method: A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies in PsychInfo, Pubmed, Scopus, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar. Results: The final sample included 23 independent samples with a total of 13,929 participants (60.7% females; M age = 21.93, range: 16.5–32.4). Results of random effects meta-analysis confirmed a positive correlation between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress ( r = .34, 95% CI [.28, .39]). Moderation analysis revealed that effect sizes were larger in older samples. Moreover, a negative correlation between problematic Facebook use and well-being was observed ( r = −.22, 95% CI [−.28, −.15]). Limitations: All available studies used a cross-sectional design thus hampering the possibility to establish the direction of the association between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress and well-being. Conclusions: Results are discussed within the extant literature on problematic Facebook use and future research directions are proposed. This research may also inform clinical and prevention interventions on problematic Facebook use.

Video game addiction in emerging adulthood: Cross-sectional evidence of pathology in video game addicts as compared to matched healthy controls,"Background: The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS) is a widely used measure of video game addiction, a pathology affecting a small percentage of all people who play video games. Emerging adult males are significantly more likely to be video game addicts. Few researchers have examined how people who qualify as video game addicts based on the IGDS compared to matched controls based on age, gender, race, and marital status. Method: The current study compared IGDS video game addicts to matched non-addicts in terms of their mental, physical, social-emotional health using self-report, survey methods. Results: Addicts had poorer mental health and cognitive functioning including poorer impulse control and ADHD symptoms compared to controls. Additionally, addicts displayed increased emotional difficulties including increased depression and anxiety, felt more socially isolated, and were more likely to display internet pornography pathological use symptoms. Female video game addicts were at unique risk for negative outcomes. Limitations: The sample for this study was undergraduate college students and self-report measures were used. Conclusions: Participants who met the IGDS criteria for video game addiction displayed poorer emotional, physical, mental, and social health, adding to the growing evidence that video game addictions are a valid phenomenon.

Sleep disturbance may impact treatment outcome in bipolar disorder: A preliminary investigation in the context of a large comparative effectiveness trial,"Background: Bipolar patients experience sleep disturbances during and between mood episodes. Yet the impact of sleep on treatment with different medications has not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential impact of poor sleep at baseline on outcomes in a randomized effectiveness trial of quetiapine and lithium. Methods: The Bipolar CHOICE study was a 6-month, parallel group, multisite randomized controlled trial. Participants with bipolar disorder (N = 482; 59% female and age 18–70 years) received quetiapine or lithium. Patients were allowed to also receive adjunctive personalized treatments, which were guideline-informed, empirically- based medications added to treatment as needed. Medication changes were recorded as necessary clinical adjustments (NCA). Fisher's exact tests, mixed-regression models, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess demographic and clinical characteristics as well as whether sleep disturbance would predict outcomes. Results: 63% of patients had baseline sleep disturbance. Individuals with sleep disturbance had worse bipolar illness severity, greater severity of depression, mania, anxiety, irritability, and psychosis, were less likely to have sustained response (17% vs. 29%; adjusted RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38–0.78, p = 0.0006) and had more NCAs (median 0.71 vs. 0.59, p = 0.03). Limitations: Our findings were limited by how we defined sleep disturbance, and by how severity of sleep disturbance was assessed with one item with a non-sleep specific measure. Conclusions: Baseline sleep disturbance was associated with more severe bipolar symptoms and worse 6-month outcomes. Further research is warranted on improving sleep in bipolar disorder, especially the role of psychosocial interventions.

Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care,"Background: Attachment theory posits that attachment has a persistent, long-term impact on depression. Empirical data on associations between adult attachment and the long-term course of depression is, however, scarce. The present study addresses this omission. Method: Primary care patients with a history of depression ( n = 103) completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire measuring adult attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and styles (secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful). The subsequent seven-year course of depression was assessed with the face-to-face administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and a life-chart interview based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). At the end of the seven-year follow-up severity of depression was additionally measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: The attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety both showed significant associations during the seven-year course with lower proportions of depressive symptom-free time and higher severity of depression (LIFE and BDI). The secure style predicted compared to preoccupied attachment a significantly higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 1.10 years), compared to dismissing attachment a higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 2.20 years) and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.14; BDI 6.04 vs. 9.52), and compared to fearful attachment a lower relapse/recurrence rate (45.7% vs. 76.9%), higher proportions of depression diagnosis-free time (7.31 vs. 6.65 years) and symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 0.29 years), and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.19; BDI 6.04 vs. 15.54). Limitations: Sample size was restricted. Conclusion: Insecure attachment predicts an unfavorable course of depression over a seven-year period.

Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the longitudinal treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder with fear of harm phenotype,"Objectives: Fear of Harm (FOH) is a pediatric onset phenotype of bipolar disorder (BD) characterized by BD plus treatment resistance, separation anxiety, aggressive obsessions, parasomnias, and thermal dysregulation. Intranasal ketamine (InK) in 12 youths with BD-FOH produced marked improvement during a two-week trial. Here we report on the open effectiveness and safety of InK in maintenance treatment of BD-FOH from the private practice of one author. Methods: As part of a chart review, patients 18 years or older and parents of younger children responded to a clinical effectiveness and safety survey. Effectiveness was assessed from analysis of responses to 49 questions on symptomatology plus qualitative content analyses of written reports and chart review. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed by frequency, duration and severity. Peak InK doses ranged from 20 to 360 mg per administration. Results: Surveys were completed on 45 patients treated with InK for 3 months to 6.5 years. Almost all patients were “much” to “very much” improved clinically and in ratings of social function and academic performance. Significant reductions were reported in all symptom categories. There were 13 reports of persistent AEs, none of which resulted in discontinuation. Acute emergence reactions were sporadically observed in up to 75%, but were mild and of brief duration. Limitations: Retrospective review from a single practice without placebo control with potential for response and recall bias. Conclusions: InK every 3–4 days at sub-anesthetic doses appeared to be a beneficial and well-tolerated treatment. Use of InK may be considered as a tertiary alternative in treatment refractory cases. Randomized control trials are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
Meta-analytic review of the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on threat processing in humans,"Background: Heightened threat sensitivity is a transdiagnostic feature in several psychiatric disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to reduce fear related behaviours and facilitated fear extinction in animals. These findings have led to increasing interest to explore the effects of intranasal oxytocin on threat processing in humans. Methods: The review included 26 studies (N = 1173), nine of which included clinical populations (N = 234). The clinical groups included were people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence disorder. We examined the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on startle response, attentional responses, and behavioural responses to threat. Results: A single dose of intranasal oxytocin significantly increased the physiological startle response to threat in healthy people with a small effect size. However, oxytocin did not have significant effects on attentional bias towards social or disorder-specific threat, fixation towards threatening stimuli among healthy or clinical populations, or on threat related behavioural approach or avoidance responses. Limitations: No studies investigated the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations. Additionally, only one of the reviewed studies had sufficient power to detect at least a moderate effect of oxytocin according to our criterion. Discussion: The synthesis of literature suggest that oxytocin may influence the salience of threatening stimuli among healthy individuals, increasing the startle response to threat. It would be of interest to investigate the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations.

The classification of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms in male and female adolescents,"Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) was categorised in DSM-5 within the newly created ‘obsessive-compulsive and related disorders’ chapter, however this classification remains subject to debate. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test competing models of the co-occurrence of symptoms of BDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, unipolar depression, anxiety, and eating disorders in a community sample of adolescents, and to explore potential sex differences in these models. Methods: Self-report questionnaires assessing disorder symptoms were completed by 3149 Australian adolescents. The fit of correlated factor models was calculated separately in males and females, and measurement invariance testing compared parameters of the best-fitting model between males and females. Results: All theoretical models of the classification of BDD had poor fit to the data. Good fit was found for a novel model where BDD symptoms formed a distinct latent factor, correlated with affective disorder and eating disorder latent factors. Metric non-invariance was found between males and females, and the majority of factor loadings differed between males and females. Correlations between some latent factors also differed by sex. Limitations: Only cross-sectional data were collected, and the study did not assess a broad range of DSM-5 defined eating disorder symptoms or other disorders in the DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorders chapter. Conclusions: This study is the first to statistically evaluate competing models of BDD classification. The findings highlight the unique features of BDD and its associations with affective and eating disorders. Future studies examining the classification of BDD should consider developmental and sex differences in their models.

Music-based interventions to reduce internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis,"Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted. Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = −0.73; 95%CI [−1.42;−0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions ( n = 100) compared to different control group interventions ( n = 95). Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design. Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed.

Reduced white matter integrity in borderline personality disorder: A diffusion tensor imaging study,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions. BPD may be linked to an abnormal brain anatomy, but little is known about possible impairments of the white matter microstructure in BPD or their relationship with impulsivity or risky behaviors. The aims of the present study were to explore the relationship between BPD and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and psychological tests. Methods: We evaluated 35 un-medicated BPD patients in a medication-free state and 50 healthy controls (HCs). We performed DTI tractography in BPD patients and HCs. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Profile of Mood State (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), and Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to BPD patients and HCs. Results: A tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) revealed that the BPD group had three clusters with a significantly lower axial diffusivity (AD) than the HC group: one located mainly in the cingulum and the other mainly in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Regarding the AD values, one cluster correlated negatively and significantly with POMS (Depression) and it was located in the cingulum, while another cluster correlated positively and significantly with DACS (Future Denial) and it was located in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Limitations: The small sample size of this study prevents us from forming any definitive conclusions, meaning that more studies are needed to confirm our findings. We are unable to generalize our findings to include other ethnic groups. Conclusions: Our results suggested that hypo-metabolism in a front-limbic network dysfunction is characterized by the cingulum and a front-occipital network dysfunction characterized by the occipital lobe, while an occipitaltemporal network dysfunction characterized by the inferior longitudinal fasciculus.

The relationship between cognitions and symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: The cognitive theory of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ascertains that catastrophic (mis) interpretations of normally occurring intrusive thoughts are related to the maintenance of OCD. Nonetheless, findings supporting the relationship between cognitive biases and OCD symptoms are largely inconsistent. In the present study we examined the relationship between OCD cognitions and symptoms among 382 OCD patients participating in the longitudinal Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association (NOCDA) study. Methods: OCD cognitions and OC, anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report questionnaires at baseline and at two-year follow-up. Baseline multiple regression analyses assessed the specificity of OC cognitions to OCD symptoms. Cross-lagged analyses examined whether cognitions predict OCD symptoms at two-year follow up. Results: Baseline analyses demonstrated significant relationships between comorbid anxiety, depressive severity and OC cognitions, adjusted for OCD symptoms (β =.283, p &lt; .001 and β =.246, p &lt; .001, respectively). OCD severity adjusted for comorbid symptoms was unrelated to cognitions at baseline (β = .040, p = n.s). Unique associations were found between cognitions and two OCD symptom subtypes (Impulses: β = .215, p &lt; .001; Rumination/doubting: β = .205, p &lt; .001). Longitudinal analyses yielded non-significant associations between OCD cognitions and symptom severity. Prospective analyses of cognitions and OCD symptom subtypes yielded significant effects for both bidirectional and unidirectional associations (β = .11–.16, p &lt; .05). Limitations: Given the naturalistic design of the study, we did not assess therapeutic interventions between baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Results only partially concord with the predictions of the cognitive theory of OCD. Future studies should focus on mechanisms alternative to cognitions when investigating the course of OCD.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mental health in young Australian women: Results from the Safe-D study,"Background: While there is evidence linking vitamin D status with mood, this association and its clinical significance remain uncertain. Moreover, few studies have focused on young, community-dwelling females. The Safe-D study examined the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels and mental health in young women. Methods: Participants completed an online questionnaire, wore a UV dosimeter to measure personal sun exposure and underwent a comprehensive health assessment. Serum 25OHD was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 353 healthy women aged 16–25 years, living in Victoria, Australia. Mental health measures included: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) and 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12), plus any self-reported mental disorder diagnoses or medication use. Results: The prevalence of self-reported mental disorder was 26% and of vitamin D deficiency 27%. The median (Q1, Q3) scores for the PHQ-9, GAD-7, K10 and SF-12 MCS were 6 (3, 9), 5 (2, 8), 19 (15, 25) and 43 (34, 49), respectively. Serum 25OHD levels were not associated with mental health scores. Vitamin D status was not associated with a reported diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Limitations: There was a low prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency and mental health symptoms, which may reduce study power. Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between serum 25OHD levels and mental health status in young women. Longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials investigating vitamin D and mood in young women are needed to confirm and extend these results.

"Tea, cocoa, coffee, and affective disorders: Vicious or virtuous cycle?","Background: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is increasing worldwide, which underscores the importance of increasing research in this field, in terms of better detection, prevention based on improvement of lifestyle and diet, and effectiveness of treatment. Increasing evidence suggest that diet and exercise can affect proper neuronal development and physiology and protect the brain from neurological illnesses or injuries. Of note, cocoa, tea, and coffee are being actively investigated because they are rich in (poly)phenolic compounds that can modulate mental health, namely brain plasticity, behavior, mood, depression, and cognition. Methods: We here systematically review human studies conducted on tea, cocoa, and coffee as related to affective disorders such as depression and anxiety. We carried out a systematic literature search in April 2016, using MEDLINE, on data from the last 10 years. After screening 955 articles, we selected 17 articles that met the criteria of being human studies and that used whole foods or their components. Results: The results of our systematic review indicate that consumption of tea, cocoa, or coffee might have protective effects against depression. Conclusions: Even though this is encouraging, it should be underscored that the near totality of the current evidence comes from observational studies. Ad-hoc human trials and mechanistic, basic science studies are needed before we can provide sound advice to the public.

Internet- and mobile-based depression interventions for people with diagnosed depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: To summarize and critically evaluate the effectiveness of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for depression in adults with a diagnosed depression. Methods: Preregistered systematic review of RCTs investigating internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting adults with diagnosed depression. IMIs had to be compared with waitlist, attention placebo, other IMIs or other (face-to-face) therapies. A comprehensive search of primary studies was conducted. Study selection and data extraction was done by two independent researchers. Primary outcome was symptom severity of depression. Furthermore, treatment response, depression remission, treatment adherence, anxiety and quality of life were investigated. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted where possible, as well as pre-planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results: Database search resulted in 4858 references, of which 19 studies were eligible for inclusion and provided data on 29 IMIs. IMIs showed beneficial effects on depression severity when compared to waitlist conditions at the end of treatment (pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) g = −0.90, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.73, n = 10). The comparison between different IMIs did not result in any superiority or inferiority. All IMIs reduced depression symptoms from pre- to post-treatment (within group SMD range −2.24; −0.64, n = 29) and from pre-treatment to follow-up assessments (SMD range −3.07; −0.93, n = 27). Conclusion: IMIs significantly reduce depression symptoms in adults with diagnosed depression at the end of treatment and at follow-up assessments when compared to waitlist conditions. These findings argue for IMIs to be recommended in depression treatment guidelines.

"Altered connectivity within and between the default mode, central executive, and salience networks in obsessive-compulsive disorder","Background: Default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN) are the three most important intrinsic networks of the human brain. Recent studies emphasized the importance of the “triple-network model” which illustrated the interactions within and between DMN, CEN and SN in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. However, previous studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) just explored the altered connectivity within these networks while neglected the coupling between them. Hence, the present study was designed to fill this research gap. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 35 OCD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were acquired. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract sub-networks of the DMN, CEN, and SN. Functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured. Results: OCD patients had increased FC within several DMN, CEN, and SN subsystems. In addition, OCD patients demonstrated aberrant functional interactions between the SN and anterior DMN (aDMN) as well as between the SN and the dorsal CEN (dCEN), and the interaction between the SN and dCEN significantly correlated with trait anxiety level in the OCD group. Limitation: Lack of the assessments of cognitive functions is the main limitation of the present study. Conclusions: Not only impaired coupling within the brain core intrinsic large-scale networks, but also coupling between large-scale neurocognitive networks, which reflect the difficulties in switching between task-negative and task-positive processing modes are involved in the neurobiological mechanism of OCD.

Apathy in early and late-life depression,"Background: Late-life depression is thought to differ in clinical presentation from early-life depression. Particularly, late-life depression is considered to be more characterized by apathy than is early-life depression. Lacking convincing evidence, this study examines the presence and associated socio-demographic/clinical characteristics of apathy in older compared to younger depressed persons. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from two naturalistic cohort studies, i.e. the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO) and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). These studies included 605 persons (aged 18–93 years) with a major depressive disorder, divided into 217 early-life (&lt; 60 years) and 388 late-life (≥ 60 years) depressed persons. Apathy was considered present if a score of ≥14 on the Apathy Scale. Results: Apathy was strongly associated with age: it was more frequently present in persons with late-life depression (74.5%) than in those with early-life depression (53.5%). Independent of age, the following characteristics were associated with the presence of apathy: male gender, low education, use of benzodiazepines, chronic diseases, and more severe depression. Of all potential risk factors, only former and current smoking was associated with the presence of apathy in older depressed persons but not in younger depressed persons (p-value for age interaction = 0.01). Limitations: No causal relationships can be drawn due to the cross-sectional design of the study. Conclusions: In depressed individuals, clinically relevant apathy was more frequently present in older compared to younger persons. Both age groups showed largely the same associated risk factors. Apathy was independently associated with older age, male gender and more severe depression.

Suicidal ideation and attentional biases in children: An eye-tracking study,"Background: Despite theoretical and empirical evidence for a heighted responsiveness to signals of social-threat in suicidal individuals, no studies to date have examined whether this responsiveness might also manifest in the form of specific biases in attention to interpersonal stimuli. The current study, therefore, examined the presence and nature of attentional biases for facial expressions of emotion in children with and without a history of suicidal ideation (SI). Method: Participants were 88 children (44 with a history of SI and 44 demographically and clinically matched controls without such history) recruited from the community. The average age of children was 9.26 years (44.3% female; 67.0% Caucasian). Children's history of SI was assessed via structured interviews with children and their parent. Attentional biases were assessed using a dot probe task and included fearful, happy, and sad facial stimuli and focused on eye tracking and reaction time indices of attentional bias. Results: Children with a history of SI exhibited significantly greater gaze duration toward fearful faces. The findings appeared to be at least partially independent of children's history of major depression or anxiety disorders or their current depressive or anxious symptoms. Limitations: The study is limited by its cross-sectional design, which precludes any causal conclusions regarding the role of attentional biases in future suicide risk. Conclusions: Our results suggest that children with a history of SI exhibit biases in sustained attention toward socially-threatening facial expressions. Pending replications, these findings might represent a new avenue of suicide risk assessment and intervention.

Psychotic-like experiences and happiness in the English general population,"Background: Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) have been associated with a variety of adverse outcomes but how they affect happiness in individuals with PLE is unknown. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the association between PLEs and happiness, and the factors that may influence this association. Methods: Nationally representative data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey including adults aged ≥ 16 years was analyzed. The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire was used to assess past 12-month PLE. Individuals who endorsed at least one of the following were considered to have any PLE: thought control, paranoia, strange experiences, auditory hallucinations. Happiness (3-point scale) was assessed with a validated question with higher scores indicating lower levels of happiness. The association between PLE and happiness was assessed by multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Mediation analysis was also performed. Results: Among the 7363 individuals included in the analysis, the prevalence of any PLE increased with decreasing levels of happiness [very happy (2.3%), fairly happy (5.4%), not too happy (14.9%)]. This was also shown in the multivariable analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors and stressful life events (from very happy to not too happy: OR = 2.41; 95%CI = 1.86–3.12). Mediation analysis showed that anxiety disorders explained the largest proportion of the association (38.8%) followed by depressive episode (28.5%), insomnia (21.9%), disability (16.5%), pain (12.5%), social support (10.0%), and physical health conditions (6.0%). Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference. Conclusion: Interventions to identify and address conditions that may have a negative impact on happiness in individuals with PLE may be important to improve their well-being.

Sample heterogeneity in unipolar depression as assessed by functional connectivity analyses is dominated by general disease effects,"Objectives: Combinations of resting-state fMRI and machine-learning techniques are increasingly employed to develop diagnostic models for mental disorders. However, little is known about the neurobiological heterogeneity of depression and diagnostic machine learning has mainly been tested in homogeneous samples. Our main objective was to explore the inherent structure of a diverse unipolar depression sample. The secondary objective was to assess, if such information can improve diagnostic classification. Materials and methods: We analyzed data from 360 patients with unipolar depression and 360 non-depressed population controls, who were subdivided into two independent subsets. Cluster analyses (unsupervised learning) of functional connectivity were used to generate hypotheses about potential patient subgroups from the first subset. The relationship of clusters with demographical and clinical measures was assessed. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers (supervised learning), which incorporated information about these putative depression subgroups, were trained. Results: Exploratory cluster analyses revealed two weakly separable subgroups of depressed patients. These subgroups differed in the average duration of depression and in the proportion of patients with concurrently severe depression and anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic classification models performed at chance level. Limitations: It remains unresolved, if subgroups represent distinct biological subtypes, variability of continuous clinical variables or in part an overfitting of sparsely structured data. Conclusions: Functional connectivity in unipolar depression is associated with general disease effects. Cluster analyses provide hypotheses about potential depression subtypes. Diagnostic models did not benefit from this additional information regarding heterogeneity.

The association between the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and tryptophan metabolism in persons with recurrent major depressive disorder and healthy controls,"Objectives: Persistent changes in serotonergic and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning are implicated in recurrent types of major depressive disorder (MDD). Systemic tryptophan levels, which influence the rate of serotonin synthesis, are regulated by glucocorticoids produced along the HPA axis. We investigated tryptophan metabolism and its association with HPA axis functioning in single episode MDD, recurrent MDD and non-depressed individuals. Methods: We included depressed individuals (n = 1320) and controls (n = 406) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (kyn/trp ratio) was established using serum kynurenine and tryptophan levels. Several HPA axis parameters were calculated using salivary cortisol samples. We adjusted the regression analyses for a wide range of potential confounders and differentiated between single episode MDD, recurrent MDD and control. Results: Tryptophan, kynurenine and the kyn/trp ratio did not differ between controls and depressed individuals. Increased evening cortisol levels were associated with a decreased kyn/trp ratio in the total sample (Crude: β = −.102, p &lt; .001; Adjusted: β = −.083, p &lt; .001). This association was found to be restricted to recurrently depressed individuals (Crude: β = −.196, p &lt; .001; Adjusted: β = −.145, p = .001). Antidepressant treatment did not affect this association. Conclusions: Our results suggest that an imbalance between HPA axis function and tryptophan metabolism could be involved in recurrent depression.

Symptom severity and disability in psychiatric disorders: The U.S. Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey,"Background: While most psychiatric diagnoses are based on simple counts of symptoms, some symptoms may be sign of a more severe mental syndrome than others. This calls for validated estimates of the relative severity specific symptoms imply within a disorder. We focused on four diagnostic disorders: Manic Episode (ME), Major Depressive Episode (MDE), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Symptom-specific severity parameters were estimated, and validated by examining their association with levels of self-reported disability in daily activities over and above the number of symptoms. Methods: Data from the cohort study of the U.S. Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) was used, which comprises the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, National Survey of American Life, and the National Latino and Asian American Study. The four analytic datasets included respondents who endorsed disorder-specific pre-screening symptoms according to the World Mental Health Survey Initiative's version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Disability was measured using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Item Response Theory and Tobit models were implemented. Results: For ME, PTSD, and GAD (not MDE) symptom severity based on psychometric Item Response Theory predicted disability outcomes after adjusting for symptom count. For PTSD, symptom count was not associated with disability. Limitations: The analytic sample for each psychiatric disorder was based on a pre-selection stemming from index criteria (e.g. sadness or pleasure loss for MDE), which implies that our results are only generalizable to those individuals at risk rather than for the entire population. Additionally, we acknowledge that the use of unidimensional models is only one of the several options to model psychopathological constructs. Conclusions: The same number of symptoms may be related to different levels of disability, depending on the specific symptoms from which the person suffers. Diagnostic procedures and treatment decisions may benefit from such additional information without extra costs.

Internet delivered cognitive behavior therapy for antenatal depression: A randomised controlled trial,"Major depression occurs in 5–10% of pregnancies and is associated with many negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group. Objective: To test the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Online and telephone. Population or sample: Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10–28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder. Methods: 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12–28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. Results: The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p &lt; 0.001, Hedges g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression. Limitations: Small sample size and no long-term evaluation. Conclusion: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

Emotional blunting with antidepressant treatments: A survey among depressed patients,"Background: Emotional blunting is regularly reported in depressed patients on antidepressant treatment but its actual frequency is poorly understood. We have previously used qualitative methods to develop an appropriate scale, the Oxford Questionnaire on the Emotional Side-Effects of Antidepressants (OQESA). Methods results: Six hundred and sixty nine depressed patients on treatment and 150 recovered (formerly depressed) controls (aged ≥ 18 years) participated in this internet-based survey. The rate of emotional blunting in treated depressed patients was 46%, slightly more frequent in men than women (52% versus 44%) and in those with higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale scores. There was no difference according to antidepressant agent, though it appeared less frequent with bupropion. Depressed patients with emotional blunting had much higher total blunting scores on OQESA than controls (42.83 ± 14.73 versus 25.73 ± 15.00, p &lt; 0.0001) and there was a correlation between total blunting score and HAD-Depression score ( r = 0.521). Thus, those with HAD-D score &gt; 7 (n = 170) had a higher total questionnaire score, 49.23±12.03, than those with HAD-D score ≤ 7 (n = 140), 35.07 ± 13.98, and the difference between the two groups was highly significant. However, patients with HAD-D score ≤ 7 (n = 140) had a higher total score (35.07 ± 13.98) than the recovered controls (n = 150) (25.73 ± 15.00), and the difference between the two groups was significant. Among the patients with emotional blunting, 37% had a negative perception of their condition and 38% positive. Men reported a more negative perception than women (p = 0.008), and patients with a negative perception were more likely to have higher HAD scores. Higher levels of emotional blunting are associated with a more negative perception of it by the patient ( r = –0.423). Limitations: Include self-evaluation and the modest size of the sample for detection of differences between antidepressants. Conclusions: Emotional blunting is reported by nearly half of depressed patients on antidepressants. It appears to be common to all monoaminergic antidepressants. The OQESA scores are highly correlated with HAD depression score; emotional blunting cannot be described simply as a side-effect of antidepressants, but also as a symptom of depression.

Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting,"Background: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. Methods: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). Results: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p &lt; 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI &lt; 13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. Limitations: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. Conclusions: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2017
Non-suicidal self-injury and suicide attempts in a New Zealand birth cohort,"Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts are related, but distinct behaviors. The primary aim of the current study was to identify factors that distinguish those with different lifetime histories of self-injury. A secondary aim was to test whether lifetime history of self-injury at age 26 predicted current suicide ideation at age 32. Methods: Participants were 26 year olds from a large birth cohort with a lifetime history of no self-injury ( n = 466), a lifetime history of NSSI ( n = 191), or a lifetime history of NSSI and a suicide attempt (NSSI + SA; n = 52). They were compared on a history of psychiatric disorders, 12-month suicide ideation, lifetime history of childhood sexual abuse, and lifetime exposure to suicide. Results: An anxiety disorder, a substance dependence disorder, suicide ideation, and a history of childhood sexual abuse distinguished the NSSI + SA and NSSI only groups. Longitudinal results demonstrated that a history of NSSI predicted future suicide ideation after adjusting for other selected risk factors. Limitations: The majority of analyses are cross-sectional which limits inferences about causality. The retrospective self-report for lifetime behavior could be subject to reporting biases. Conclusions: Adults with a history of NSSI and adults with a history of NSSI and a suicide attempt are clinically distinct groups that are both at risk of future suicide ideation. Identifying and treating NSSI could be a key preventive factor in reducing subsequent suicide risk.

Complex psychotropic polypharmacy in bipolar disorder across varying mood polarities: A prospective cohort study of 2712 inpatients,"Background: It is common for patients with bipolar disorder (BP) to receive multiple psychotropics, but few studies have assessed demographic and clinical features associated with risk for receiving complex psychotropic polypharmacy. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study examined 2712 inpatients with a DSM-IV clinical diagnosis of BP to assess associations between complex polypharmacy (defined as ≥ 4 psychotropics) and demographic and clinical features; associations with risk of rehospitalization were also examined. Logistic regressions were performed with the sample as a whole and with each of four DSM-IV BP subtypes individually. Results: Complex polypharmacy was present in 21.0%. BP-I depressed patients were more likely to receive complex regimens than BP-I manic, BP-I mixed or BP-II patients. In the sample as a whole, variables significantly associated with complex polypharmacy included female, white, psychotic features and a co-diagnosis of borderline personality, post-traumatic stress or another anxiety disorder. The only examined medication not significantly associated with complex polypharmacy was lithium, although only in BP-I depressed and BP-I mixed. Complex polypharmacy was associated with rehospitalization in BP-I mania within 15 and 30days post index hospitalization. Limitations: All data were from one clinical facility; results may not generalize to other settings and patient populations. Conclusions: BP-I depression may pose a greater treatment challenge than the other BP subtypes. Lithium may confer an overall advantage compared to other medications in BP-I depressed and BP-I mixed. Further research is needed to guide pharmacotherapy decisions in BP patients.

Psychiatric disorders moderate the relationship between insomnia and cognitive problems in military soldiers,"Background: There has been a great deal of research on the comorbidity of insomnia and psychiatric disorders, but much of the existing data is based on small samples and does not assess the full diagnostic criteria for each disorder. Further, the exact nature of the relationship between these conditions and their impact on cognitive problems are under-researched in military samples. Method: Data were collected from the All Army Study of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members (unweighted N = 21, 449; weighted N = 674,335; 18–61 years; 13.5% female). Participants completed the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire to assess for insomnia disorder and a self-administered version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales to assess for psychiatric disorders and cognitive problems. Results: Military soldiers with current major depressive episode (MDE) had the highest prevalence of insomnia disorder (INS; 85.0%), followed by current generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; 82.6%) and current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 69.7%), respectively. Significant interactions were found between insomnia and psychiatric disorders; specifically, MDE, PTSD, and GAD status influenced the relationship between insomnia and memory/concentration problems. Limitations: Cross-sectional nature of the assessment and the absence of a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. Conclusion: Psychiatric disorders moderated the relationship between insomnia and memory/concentration problems, suggesting that psychiatric disorders contribute unique variance to cognitive problems even though they are associated with insomnia disorder. Results highlight the importance of considering both insomnia and psychiatric disorders in the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive deficits in military soldiers.

Depressive symptoms and the role of affective temperament in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): A comparison with bipolar disorder,"Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of depressive symptoms and the influence of affective temperament in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in comparison with bipolar disorder (BD) patients and healthy controls (HCs). Method: Sixty patients with ADHD, 50 patients with BD, and 30 HCs were assessed with instruments for measuring depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and affective temperaments (Temperament Scale of Memphis, Pisa and San Diego, self-administered version; TEMPS-A). In addition, participants were evaluated with scales for measuring ADHD symptoms, impulsiveness, anxiety, executive dysfunction, and quality of life. Results: ADHD patients showed levels of depressive symptoms similar to BD patients and higher than HCs. Only neurovegetative symptoms of depression differentiated ADHD and BD groups (BD &gt; ADHD). Depressive symptoms in ADHD patients correlated positively with core ADHD, impulsivity, anxiety, and dysexecutive symptoms and negatively with quality of life. Thirty-eight percent of patients with ADHD scored above the cutoff for at least one affective temperament. Cyclothymic was the more common affective temperament (25%). ADHD patients with affective temperamental traits were more depressed and impulsive than patients without those traits and showed a symptomatic profile analogous to BD patients. Limitations: The small size of resultant samples when ADHD group was stratified by the presence of affective temperament. In addition, results may not generalize to less severe ADHD patients from the community. Conclusions: Concomitant depressive symptoms constitute a common occurrence in adults with ADHD that carries significant psychopathological and functional consequences. The concept of affective temperaments may be an interesting link for explaining depressive symptomatology and emotional impulsivity in a subgroup of patients with ADHD, beyond the classic idea of comorbidity.

Fornix microalterations associated with early trauma in panic disorder,"Background: It is well accepted that panic disorder (PD) is associated with early trauma, and that the limbic systems are one of the main structures involved in PD pathophysiology. However, previous studies have not addressed the relationship between early trauma and major limbic white-matter (WM) structures in PD. Methods: Participants enrolled in the study consisted of 53 right-handed patients with PD and 21 healthy controls (HC). The Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), and the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ) were applied in the study. Tract-based spatial statistics were used for diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Results: Among the patients with PD, the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the fornix body in major limbic WM regions showed significant negative correlation with the ETISR-SF total score, while the scores of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in the same region of fornix had significant positive correlation with those scores (p &lt; 0.05; FWE corrected). Further significant correlation was observed between these four scores and the measures of symptom severity in PD, such as that in ASI-R and APPQ in the same region. Limitations: Recall bias is possible in evaluating early trauma in the participants. Conclusions: The current study suggests a significant association of early trauma with the fornix body possibly through axons and myelin disruptions within major limbic structures in PD. A multi-centered large sample will be needed to confirm these findings.

Challenging assumptions from emotion dysregulation psychological treatments,"Background: Contemporary treatments assume that the inability to downregulate negative emotional arousal is a key problem in the development and maintenance of psychopathology and that lack of effective regulation efforts and a preference to use maladaptive regulation strategies is a primary mechanism. Though ubiquitous, there is limited empirical evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether self-reported emotion dysregulation equated to difficulties reducing emotional arousal during a behavioral task and to primary use of maladaptive strategies to manage negative emotions. Methods: 44 anxious and depressed adults with high emotion dysregulation induced negative distress using autobiographic memory recall. After induction, participants were instructed to downregulate but were not provided any specific instructions in strategies to use. Self-reported emotional arousal was assessed before and after induction and after regulation. Qualitative descriptions of regulation efforts were collected and codedinto effective and maladaptive strategies. Results: The task was successful in inducing emotional arousal and participants were successful in their efforts to down regulate negative emotions. Additionally, effective regulation strategies were used more frequently than maladaptive strategies. Limitations: Data collected was exclusively self-report and the sample size was small. Conclusion: Adults who report high emotion dysregulation may still have effective emotion regulation strategies in their behavioral repertoire and are more likely to engage in these effective strategies when given an unspecific prompt to regulate negative emotional arousal. Despite reporting problems with emotion regulation, adults with anxiety and depression can successfully downregulate distress when prompted to do so.

Clinical predictors of acute response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in major depression,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuromodulation intervention for poor-responding or refractory depressed patients. However, little is known about predictors of response to this therapy. The present study aimed to analyze clinical predictors of response to tDCS in depressed patients. Methods: Clinical data from 3 independent tDCS trials on 171 depressed patients (including unipolar and bipolar depression), were pooled and analyzed to assess predictors of response. Depression severity and the underlying clinical dimensions were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and after the tDCS treatment. Age, gender and diagnosis (bipolar/unipolar depression) were also investigated as predictors of response. Linear mixed models were fitted in order to ascertain which HDRS factors were associated with response to tDCS. Results: Age, gender and diagnosis did not show any association with response to treatment. The reduction in HDRS scores after tDCS was strongly associated with the baseline values of “Cognitive Disturbances” and “Retardation” factors, whilst the “Anxiety/Somatization” factor showed a mild association with the response. Limitations: Open-label design, the lack of control group, and minor differences in stimulation protocols. Conclusions: No differences in response to tDCS were found between unipolar and bipolar patients, suggesting that tDCS is effective for both conditions. “Cognitive disturbance”, “Retardation”, and “Anxiety/Somatization”, were identified as potential clinical predictors of response to tDCS. These findings point to the pre-selection of the potential responders to tDCS, therefore optimizing the clinical use of this technique and the overall cost-effectiveness of the psychiatric intervention for depressed patients.

Postnatal paternal involvement and maternal emotional disturbances: The effect of maternal employment status,"Background: Recently, studies have begun emphasizing paternal involvement during the perinatal period and its impact on maternal health. However, most studies have assessed maternal perception and focused on adolescents or minority groups in Western countries. Therefore, the current study investigated the association between paternal involvement and maternal postnatal depression and anxiety, along with the effects of maternal job status in the Asian society of Taiwan. Methods: This study recruited pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy as well as their partners on prenatal visits from July 2011 to September 2013 at four selected hospitals in metropolitan areas of Taipei, Taiwan. In total, 593 parental pairs completed the first interview and responded to the follow-up questionnaires until 6 months postpartum. Self-reported data were collected, and multiple logistic regression models were used for analyses. Results: Lower paternal childcare and nursing frequency was independently associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.34–13.98), particularly among unemployed mothers. Furthermore, among unemployed mothers, the risk of postnatal anxiety was 3.14 times higher in couples with fathers spending less time with the child, compared with couples with fathers spending more time (95% CI=1.10–8.98). However, no significant findings were obtained for employed mothers. Conclusions: The high prevalence of maternal postnatal emotional disturbances warrants continual consideration. Higher paternal involvement in childcare arrangements should be emphasized to aid in ameliorating these maternal emotional disturbances, particularly among unemployed mothers.

Antidepressant-induced hypomania/mania in patients with major depression: Evidence from the BRIDGE-II-MIX study,"Background: The issue of antidepressant-induced mood switches to hypomania, mania, or mixed states within the course of mayor depressive disorder (MDD) has been a controversial topic. The present post-hoc analysis of the BRIDGE-II-MIX study focuses on the clinical features of patients with history of antidepressant-induced hypomania/mania (AIHM) in a large international sample of patients with major depressive episode (MDE). Methods: 2811 subjects with major depression were enrolled in this multicentre cross-sectional study. Current mixed symptoms, socio-demographic and other clinical variables were collected and compared among MDD-AIHM, MDD and BD patients. Results: 475 patients out of 2811 had history of AIHM (16.90%). In the MDD-AIHM group, familiarity for BD and rates of atypical features and comorbid anxiety, eating and borderline personality disorders were similar to BD and significantly more frequent compared to MDD group. MDD-AIHM patients had more frequently more than 3 episodes and reported higher rates of treatment resistance, mood lability and irritability following treatment with antidepressants. Frequencies of depression with mixed features and (hypo)manic symptoms were similar in patients of MDD-AIHM and BD groups and significantly higher in both groups than in MDD. Limitations: there were widely varying rates of hospitalized patients across countries and the participating centres were not randomly selected. Conclusions: Our results strongly support the DSM-5 inclusion of MDD patients with AIHM within the rubric of bipolar disorder. Differences with other MDD and BD were also observed suggesting the possibility that MDD-AIHM may represent a specific sub-population, particularly sensitive to exogenous input from antidepressants.

Serum polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of psychiatric disorder after acute coronary syndrome: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Around 20% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) develop depression. Furthermore, some observational studies revealed baseline polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may affect the prognosis of depression after ACS. This prospective cohort study examined the association between psychiatric disorder and PUFAs after ACS. Methods: Subjects were ACS patients admitted to a Tokyo teaching hospital. Psychiatric morbidity as a primary endpoint was measured using structured interview 3 months after admission. At admission, serum n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography and patients were interviewed to evaluate medical information. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals to examine the association between PUFAs at baseline and psychiatric disorder after ACS. Results: Between March 2014 and August 2016, 100 patients completed the follow-up assessment. Eleven patients (11%) showed some form of new-onset psychiatric disorder at 3 months, mainly depressive episode (major, 5; minor, 1) and PTSD (full, 1; partial, 2). Psychiatric disorder was predicted by serum linoleic acid level (OR = 3.96) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score (OR = 1.34) at baseline. No significant associations were seen with other PUFAs. Limitations: The results were obtained from a single hospital and based on a small number of participants. There might be some patients with new-onset psychiatric disorder among the refused patients. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorder incidence in ACS patients might be lower in Japan than in Western countries. Reduced intake of linoleic acid-containing foods might prevent depression or PTSD after ACS.

Performance and psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) in older adults with complicated grief,"Background: Complicated Grief (CG) is a recently recognized bereavement-related mental health disorder. Social support is commonly measured with the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), a 40-item, 4-factor, self-report measure. Though the ISEL has been well-studied, no identified research has examined its psychometric properties or performance in older adults with CG. Methods: We examined the psychometric properties of the ISEL in adults age ≥ 60 who enrolled in a psychotherapy treatment study for CG in New York City. We also examined the association of ISEL scores with CG severity, and with clinical and sociodemographic variables. Results: Internal consistency of the ISEL was high (α = 0.95). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that most of the ISEL items loaded strongly (&gt; 0.45) on the original 4 factors. Mean ISEL score was 68.1, which indicated lower social support than population norms. ISEL scores were significantly but modestly negatively correlated with grief severity. ISEL total scores also varied by sociodemographic and clinical variables; never being married, depression or anxiety diagnosis, and living alone were all associated with lower ISEL scores. Limitations: A clinical help-seeking sample, with low sociodemographic and geographic variability, may limit the generalizability of the findings. Also, analyses were cross-sectional and directionality of associations could not be determined. Conclusions: The 40-item ISEL may be a useful measure for those studying social support in the context of CG. Given the strikingly low levels of social support, intervention strategies for CG should include components addressing social support.

Abnormal sleep duration associated with hastened depressive recurrence in bipolar disorder,"Background: Abnormal sleep duration (ASD, &lt; 6 or ≥ 9h) is common in bipolar disorder (BD), and often persists beyond acute mood episodes. Few longitudinal studies have examined the ASD's impact upon BD illness course. The current study examined the longitudinal impact of ASD upon bipolar depressive recurrence/recovery. Methods: Outpatients referred to the Stanford BD Clinic during 2000–2011 were assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation at baseline, and with the Clinical Monitoring Form at monthly follow-ups for up to two years of naturalistic treatment. Prevalence and clinical correlates of ASD in 93 recovered (euthymic ≥ 8 weeks) and 153 depressed BD patients were assessed. Kaplan-Meier analyses (Log-Rank tests) assessed relationships between baseline ASD and longitudinal depressive severity, with Cox Proportional Hazard analyses assessing potential mediators. Results: ASD was only half as common among recovered versus depressed BD outpatients, but was significantly associated with hastened depressive recurrence (Log-Rank p = 0.007), mediated by lifetime anxiety disorder and attenuated by lifetime history of psychosis, and had only a non-significant tendency towards association with delayed depressive recovery (Log-Rank p = 0.07). In both recovered and depressed BD outpatients, baseline ASD did not have significant association with any baseline BD illness characteristic. Limitations: Self-reported sleep duration. Limited generalizability beyond our predominately white, female, educated, insured American BD specialty clinic sample. Conclusions: Baseline ASD among recovered BD patients may be a risk marker for hastened depressive recurrence, suggesting it could be an important therapeutic target between mood episodes.

Micro-scale environment and mental health in later life: Results from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II (CFAS II),"Background: Poor micro-scale environmental features, such as graffiti and broken windows, have been associated with crime and signs of social disorder with a potential impact on mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between micro-scale environment and mental health problems in later life, including cognitive (cognitive impairment and dementia) and common mental disorders (depressive and anxiety symptoms). Methods: The method of visual image audits was used to collect micro-scale environmental data for 3590 participants in the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II, a population-based multicentre cohort of people aged 65 or above in England. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the associations between the quality of micro-scale environment and mental health problems taking into account urban/rural difference. Results: Poor quality of micro-scale environment was associated with nearly 20% increased odds of depressive (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.44) and anxiety symptoms (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.38) while the direction of association for cognitive disorders differed across urban and rural settings. Although higher odds of cognitive disorders were found in rural settings, living in a poor quality environment was associated with nearly twice higher odds of cognitive impairment (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.97) in urban conurbations but 20% lower odds in rural areas (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.11). Limitations: The causal direction could not be fully determined due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. The visual nature of the environmental assessment tool means it likely does not fully capture features related to the availability of local support services, or opportunities for social participation and interaction. Conclusions: The quality of micro-scale environment appears to be important to mental health in older people. Interventions may incorporate the environmental aspect to reduce cognitive and common mental disorders.

Major depression and non-specific distress following smoking cessation in the Canadian general population,"Background: Outcome data from smoking cessation trials indicate that improvement in mental health occurs after smoking cessation. This suggests that smoking cessation should be a priority for mental health services. However, participants in such trials may not be representative of the general population. This study investigates changes in mental health following smoking cessation in a set of general population samples. Methods: Data from a library of cross-sectional surveys conducted by Statistics Canada between 2001 and 2013 were included in this analysis. Survey estimates were pooled in order to increase precision. Associations between smoking (and smoking cessation), major depressive episodes (MDE) and non-specific distress (assessed using the K-6 scale) were evaluated using meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques. Results: The annual prevalence of major depression was higher in daily (11.0%) than in never smokers (4.4%). The prevalence in former daily smokers was 5.1%. The prevalence of MDE and distress was elevated in those recently quitting but returned to baseline levels within one year. Conclusions: After smoking cessation, indicators of mental health improve over time, especially in the first year. The findings support the idea that smoking cessation should be a part of the management of common mood and anxiety disorders. However, due to its observational nature this study in itself cannot confirm causality, sustained abstinence may be an effect of improved mental health rather than its cause. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the constituent surveys does not allow causal inference. No biological measures (e.g. cotinine) were available.

Affective temperaments in anorexia nervosa: The relevance of depressive and anxious traits,"Background: Affective temperaments have been so far understudied in anorexia nervosa (AN) despite the relevance of personality and both affective and anxious comorbidity with regard to vulnerability, course, and outcome of this deadly disorder. Methods: Ninety-eight female inpatients diagnosed with AN and 131 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study and completed the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) in addition to assessments of eating psychopathology, depression, and anxiety. Results: AN patients and HCs differed in all affective temperaments. The diagnostic subtypes of AN differed as well with binge-purging individuals being more cyclothymic and anxious than those with restricting-type AN. TEMPS-A scores correlated with body mass index and eating psychopathology but not with duration of illness. Concerning comorbidity, grater scores on the depressive and lower scores on the hyperthymic temperaments were found in depressed patients. Those who had either an anxious or irritable temperament were significantly more diagnosed with an anxious disorder than those who did not show this temperament. When logistic regression was performed, high depressive/low hyperthymic and high irritable/anxious traits resulted to be associated with depressive and anxious comorbidity, respectively, independently of confounding factors. Limitations: Cross-sectional design, some patients on medications, few baseline clinical differences between diagnostic subtypes, no other personality assessments. Conclusions: An affective continuum strongly associated with mood and anxious comorbidity emerged in AN. Such an evaluation could have several research and clinical implications given the need of improving treatment individualization and early interventions for such a complex disorder.

Risk of mood disorders in patients with colorectal cancer,"Background: To assess the risk of mood disorders among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a population-based cohort study was performed using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods: The study cohort included 27242 patients diagnosed with CRC between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Four insurants from the general population without CRC were frequency matched to each case by age, sex, and index year/month to create the control group. Cox's proportional hazard regression model with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was conducted to estimate the impact of CRC on the risk of mood disorders. Results: Patients with CRC exhibited a significantly higher risk of developing mood disorders (adjusted HR = 3.05, 95% CI = 2.89–3.20) compared with the control group. This phenomenon was also observed for each type of mood disorder (depression, bipolar disease and anxiety), as well as across different subgroups by patient characteristics. However, a follow-up time longer than 1 year was more likely to have significantly increased risks, and we unexpectedly found that some treatments in CRC patients tended to have a decreased risk of anxiety compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: The findings of this population-based cohort study suggest that patients with CRC are at a higher risk of mood disorders, especially when follow-up time is longer than 1 year, but various treatments may inversely affect this association.

Depression and insomnia as mediators of the relationship between distress and quality of life in cancer patients,"Background: Distress in cancer patients leads to poorer quality of life (QOL) and negatively impacts survival. For efficient management of a patient's disease course, the interrelationships among distress, depression, insomnia, and QOL must be understood. This study aimed to investigate whether depression and insomnia mediate the relationship between distress and QOL in cancer patients. Methods: Cancer patients referred to a specialized psycho-oncology clinic (n= 208) participated in this study. Distress, depression, insomnia, and QOL were measured with the following questionnaires: Distress Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Structural equation modeling and path analysis were performed to analyze the mediating effects of depression and insomnia on the relationship between distress and QOL. Results: Distress exerted nearly equal direct (ß = −0.291, p = 0.002) and indirect (mediated by depression and insomnia) (ß = −0.299, p = 0.003) negative effects on QOL. Depression exhibited the largest direct negative effect on QOL. The indirect effects of distress on QOL through depression alone, through insomnia alone, and through an insomnia to depression pathway were all significant (ß = −0.122, p = 0.011; ß = −0.102, p = 0.002; and ß = −0.075, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Limitations: The cross-sectional analyses limit the measurement of causal relationships between each variable. Conclusions: Depression and insomnia, both individually and as part of an interrelated pathway, partially mediate the relationship between distress and QOL. Appropriate interventions to alleviate insomnia and depression may mitigate the negative impacts of distress on QOL in cancer patients.

Self-report indicators of negative valence constructs within the research domain criteria (RDoC): A critical review,"Background: In 2010, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) created the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a research framework for integrating multiple units of information to explicate basic dimensions of functioning underlying both adaptive and maladaptive behavior. Our goal in this review is to evaluate self-report indicators of negative valence systems constructs within RDoC. Methods: We review the content and correlates of several of the most popular self-report measures currently classified within the negative valence systems in the RDoC matrix, using both our own data and previously published results. We use these data to evaluate whether these measures are appropriately placed; in addition, wherever possible, we recommend better alternatives to assess key RDoC constructs. Results: Our findings indicate that many of the currently listed self-report measures are misplaced. Specifically, our data reveal that some of the purported fear scales are better conceptualized as measures of anxiety and/or anxious arousal. In addition, none of the currently listed measures of frustrative nonreward is a clear, unambiguous indicator of that construct. Limitations: The RDoC matrix currently does not list any specific measures of either loss or sustained threat, which makes it difficult to identify appropriate measures of these constructs. In many cases, the specificity/discriminant validity of proposed measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Researchers wanting to include self-report measures of negative valence constructs currently receive little guidance from the RDoC matrix. Future assessment work should be oriented toward the development of measures that are explicitly designed to assess these RDoC constructs.

Development and properties of a brief scale to assess intimate partner relationship in the postnatal period,"Background: Poor quality intimate partner relationship is associated with postnatal depression and anxiety among women. Existing scales assessing the quality of this relationship are long and measure stable aspects of the relationship rather than specific behaviours which may respond to targeted interventions. The aim was to develop and investigate the properties of a brief, life stage-specific scale to assess potentially modifiable partner behaviours in the postpartum period. Methods: Participants were primiparous women from diverse geographical and socio-economic backgrounds in Victoria, Australia. Seven study-specific items were developed to assess potentially modifiable aspects of the intimate partner relationship at 6 months postpartum. Women's mental health was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Patient Health Questionnaire depression and generalised anxiety modules. Factor analysis was conducted on the 7 items, and associations calculated between factor scores. Factor scores were compared for women with and without mental health problems. Mean inter-item correlations were computed to assess internal consistency. Results: Factor analysis on data from 355 women revealed two factors with good internal consistency: Caring Partner Behaviours and Emotionally Abusive Partner Behaviours. Having mental health problems was associated with lower Caring Partner Behaviours and higher Emotionally Abusive Partner Behaviours scores. Limitations: Interaction between partners was not observed; thus external criterion validity was not assessed. Conclusion: This brief scale is a promising means of assessing potentially modifiable aspects of the intimate partner relationship in the postnatal period.

Perinatal and postnatal risk factors for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder at age 11: 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study,"Background: To date, there have been few studies of DMDD examining the risk factors during gestation and during the first years of life. We assessed the perinatal and postnatal risk factors associated with the occurrence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by 11 years of age. Methods: Prospective longitudinal study. Mothers completed a standardized questionnaire shortly after childbirth. We used the Development and Well-Being Assessment, administered to the mothers or legal guardians, to identify DMDD among the 11-year-old subjects. We also employed logistic regression to perform bivariate and multivariate analyses, using a theoretical model of conceptual analysis. Results: We evaluated data related to 3563 subjects at 11 years of age. The prevalence of DMDD was 2.5% (95% C I = 2.0–3.0). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the early risk factors for the development of DMDD by 11 years of age were maternal mood symptoms during pregnancy, maternal depression during the first years after childbirth, and low maternal level of education. Limitations: We were unable to evaluate the genetic characteristics of the family at the birth of each subject, and there were no data available regarding the prenatal or postnatal mental health of the fathers. Conclusions: The prevalence of DMDD in early adolescence is low and its risk factors are related to potentially modifiable maternal characteristics. Scientific evidence indicates that DMDD is a major predictor of other psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Effective prenatal and postnatal mental health care could prevent mental disorders in offspring.

"Non-suicidal self-injury in Mexican young adults: Prevalence, associations with suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders, and DSM-5 proposed diagnostic criteria","Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) may lead to scarring, infection, accidental death and psychological distress. Little is known about NSSI in the general population of young adults in developing countries like Mexico. The current study examined the prevalence of any NSSI and each type of NSSI, the prevalence of meeting DSM-5 proposed criteria, and finally the association of NSSI with socio-demographic variables, suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders. Methods: This study was conducted in a community sample of 1071 young adults between 19 and 26 years of age residents of Mexico City. Results: The lifetime prevalence of NSSI was 18.56% with females having 87% greater odds. The 12-month prevalence was 3.19%. Only 0.22% of the total sample and 6.96% of those that self-injured in the past 12 months met full criteria proposed by DSM-5, in part due to the lack of reported impairment; 39.99% of those that self-injured reported impairment. Suicidal behavior commonly co-occurred with NSSI. All lifetime anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior and substance use disorders were associated with greater risk for lifetime NSSI whereas only 12-month depression and substance use disorder was associated with greater risk of 12-month NSSI. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes conclusions of causality and directionality and the study excluded institutionalized and homeless young adults. Conclusions: NSSI is a concerning problem in young adults from Mexico City due to the important associations with all types of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. Because many who self-injure do not perceive impairment, they are unlikely to seek treatment.

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale measures a continuum from well-being to depression: Testing two key predictions of positive clinical psychology,"Background: Two core but untested predictions of Positive Clinical Psychology (PCP) are that (1) Many psychiatric problems can be understood as one end of bipolar continua with well-being, and (2) that reducing psychiatric symptoms will provide an equal (near linear) decrease in risk for several other psychiatric variables, irrespective of position on continua. Aims: We test these predictions in relation to a purported well-being/depression continuum, as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D), a popular measure of depressive experiences in research and clinical practice. Method: A large ( N = 4138), diverse sample completed the CES-D, which contains a mixture of negatively worded and positively worded items (e.g., “I felt sad,” “I enjoyed life”). The latter are conventionally reverse scored to compute a total score. We first examined whether purportedly separate well-being and depression CES-D factors can be reconceptualised as a bipolar well-being/depression continuum. We then characterised the (linear or nonlinear) form of the relationship between this continuum and other psychiatric variables. Results: Both predictions were supported. When controlling for shared method bias amongst positively worded items, a single factor well-being/depression continuum underlies the CES-D. Baseline levels on this continuum are found to have near linear relationships with changes in anxiety symptoms, aggression, and substance misuse over time, demonstrating that moving from depression to well-being on the CES-D provides an equal decrease in risk for several other psychological problems irrespective of position on the continuum. Limitations: The CES-D does not measure well-being as comprehensively as established scales of well-being. Conclusions: Results support calls for mental health services to jointly focus on increasing well-being and reducing distress, and point to the value of early intervention and instilling resilience in order to prevent people moving away from high levels of well-being.

Patterns of marijuana use among psychiatry patients with depression and its impact on recovery,"Background: Depression is associated with substance-related problems that worsen depression-related disability. Marijuana is frequently used by those with depression, yet whether its use contributes to significant barriers to recovery in this population has been understudied. Method: Participants were 307 psychiatry outpatients with depression; assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months on symptom (PHQ-9 and GAD-7), functioning (SF-12) and past-month marijuana use for a substance use intervention trial. Longitudinal growth models examined patterns and predictors of marijuana use and its impact on symptom and functional outcomes. Results: A considerable number of (40.7%; n = 125) patients used marijuana within 30-days of baseline. Over 6-months, marijuana use decreased ( B = −1.20, p &lt; .001), but patterns varied by demographic and clinical characteristics. Depression ( B = 0.03, p &lt; .001) symptoms contributed to increased marijuana use over the follow-up, and those aged 50+( B = 0.44, p &lt; .001) increased their marijuana use compared to the youngest age group. Marijuana use worsened depression ( B = 1.24, p &lt; .001) and anxiety ( B = 0.80, p = .025) symptoms; marijuana use led to poorer mental health ( B = −2.03, p = .010) functioning. Medical marijuana (26.8%; n = 33) was associated with poorer physical health ( B = −3.35, p = .044) functioning. Limitations: Participants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Marijuana use is common and associated with poor recovery among psychiatry outpatients with depression. Assessing for marijuana use and considering its use in light of its impact on depression recovery may help improve outcomes.

A systematic review of yoga for major depressive disorder,"Background: The purpose of this review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of yoga interventions in treating patients with major depressive disorder. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were screened through December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to inactive or active comparators in patients with major depressive disorder were eligible. Primary outcomes included remission rates and severity of depression. Anxiety and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Results: Seven RCTs with 240 participants were included. Risk of bias was unclear for most RCTs. Compared to aerobic exercise, no short- or medium-term group differences in depression severity was found. Higher short-term depression severity was found for yoga compared to electro-convulsive therapy; remission rates did not differ between groups. No short-term group differences occurred when yoga was compared to antidepressant medication. Conflicting evidence was found when yoga was compared to attention-control interventions, or when yoga as an add-on to antidepressant medication was compared to medication alone. Only two RCTs assessed adverse events and reported that no treatment-related adverse events were reported. Limitations: Few RCTs with low sample size. Conclusions: This review found some evidence for positive effects beyond placebo and comparable effects compared to evidence-based interventions. However, methodological problems and the unclear risk-benefit ratio preclude definitive recommendations for or against yoga as an adjunct treatment for major depressive disorder. Larger and adequately powered RCTs using non-inferiority designs are needed.

Severity of complicated versus uncomplicated subthreshold depression: New evidence on the “monotonicity thesis” from the national comorbidity survey,"Background: “Complicated” subthreshold depression (CsD) includes at least one of six pathosuggestive “complicated” symptoms: &gt;6 months duration, marked role impairment, sense of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic ideation, and psychomotor retardation. “Uncomplicated” subthreshold depression (UsD) has no complicated features. Whereas studies show that complicated (CMDD) versus uncomplicated (UMDD) major depression differ substantially in severity and prognosis, UsD and CsD severity has not been previously compared. This study evaluates UsD and CsD pathology validator levels and examines whether the complicated/uncomplicated distinction offers incremental concurrent validity over the standard number-of-symptoms dimension as a depression severity measure. Methods: Using nationally representative community data from the National Comorbidity Survey, seven depression lifetime history subgroups were identified: one MDD screener symptom (n = 1432); UsD (n = 430); CsD (n = 611); UMDD (n = 182); and CMDD with 5–6 symptoms (n = 518), 7 symptoms (n = 217), and 8–9 symptoms (n = 291). Severity was evaluated using five concurrent pathology validators: suicide attempt, interference with life, help seeking, hospitalization, and generalized anxiety disorder. Results: CsD validator levels are substantially higher than both UsD and UMDD levels, and similar to mild CMDD, disconfirming the “monotonicity thesis” that severity increase with symptom number. Complicated/uncomplicated status predicts severity, and when complicatedness is controlled, number of symptoms no longer predicts validator levels. Limitations: Diagnoses were based on respondents’ fallible retrospective symptom reports during a lay-administered structured interview, which may not yield diagnoses comparable to clinicians’ assessments. Conclusion: CsD is more severe than UsD and comparable to mild MDD. Complicated status more validly indicates depression severity than the standard number-of-symptoms measure.

Maternal attachment style and psychiatric history as independent predictors of mood symptoms in the immediate postpartum period,"Background: There is evidence that both a past history of psychiatric illness and insecure attachment put women at risk for mood disturbances in the postpartum period. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether maternal insecure attachment is a risk factor for mood symptoms in the immediate postpartum period independently of the confounding effect of maternal psychiatric history. Methods: A convenience sample of 120 mothers was assessed prenatally with the Maternal History of Mood Disturbances (MHMD), the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), and in the first week after delivery with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Mothers with higher scores on the preoccupied and fearful attachment scales had more severe postpartum anxiety and depression symptoms but only fearful attachment remained a significant predictor of postpartum anxiety when the significant effect of maternal history of mood disturbances was included in the model. Limitations: Our diagnostic assessment focused on mood symptoms, not disorders, and we limited psychometric assessment to the immediate postpartum period and did not collect longitudinal data to ascertain whether the relationship between maternal insecure attachment and postpartum mood disturbances changed over time. Conclusions: Our results show the necessity to assess prior psychiatric symptoms in studies of maternal attachment style and postpartum mood disturbances. The finding that a mother's recall of her own psychiatric history emerged as significant predictor of postpartum mood symptoms suggests that antenatal assessment based on maternal self-report can be used in those settings where structured diagnostic interviews are not feasible.

The predictive value of childhood subthreshold manic symptoms for adolescent and adult psychiatric outcomes,"Background: Childhood subthreshold manic symptoms may represent a state of developmental vulnerability to Bipolar Disorder (BD) and may also be associated with other adverse psychiatric outcomes. To test this hypothesis we examined the structure and predictive value of childhood subthreshold manic symptoms for common psychiatric disorders presenting by early adulthood. Methods: Subthreshold manic symptoms at age 11 years and lifetime clinical outcomes by age 19 years were ascertained in the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a prospective Dutch community cohort. We used latent class analysis to identify subthreshold manic symptom profiles at baseline. The association between class membership and subsequent clinical diagnoses of BD (comprising BD-I, BD-II, mania and hypomania), depressive, anxiety and substance abuse disorders was determined using Cox proportional-hazard ratio (HR) models. Results: At age 11 years, we identified a normative (n = 916; 47%), a mildly symptomatic (n = 843; 43%) and a highly symptomatic class (n = 198; 10%). Referenced to the normative class, the sex- and age-adjusted risk of new-onset BD by the age of 19 years was significantly increased in the mildly (HR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.13–3.59) and highly symptomatic classes (HR = 5.02, 95%CI 2.48–10.16). These estimates remained significant after further adjustments for cognitive and family function, parental socioeconomic status, parental psychiatric morbidity, and comorbid disorders at baseline (p-value for linear trend across classes &lt; 0.01). Class membership did not show significant associations with incident depressive, anxiety and substance abuse disorders in the fully adjusted regression models. Limitations: The period of risk for adult-onset BD extends beyond the observational period of the study. Conclusions: Elevated childhood subthreshold manic symptoms are associated with increased risk of BD by early adulthood and are therefore a potentially useful phenotype for the early identification of at-risk individuals.

Face-to-face: The importance of the human factor in the treatment of insomnia,"Comments on an article by Pasquale K. Alvaro et al. (see record 2016-54647-026). Alvaro et al. presented an article which makes a valuable contribution to the topic of the treatment of insomnia and prompted one to raise a further question; how important is face-to-face contact in the treatment of insomnia? The authors concluded that the symptoms of insomnia are bi-directionally related to depressive symptoms, independent of baseline symptoms, in a sample of high school students. The relationship between insomnia and psychopathology is complex, but it is clear that emotional disturbances increase the risk of insomnia symptoms, and vice-versa. Alvaro et al. highlights the importance of early treatment of mental health (especially depression and anxiety) and sleep symptoms (as predictors) in adolescents, and the potential for treatments to be more comprehensive and effective by addressing comorbid symptoms.

Irritability and internalizing symptoms: Modeling the mediating role of emotion regulation,"Background: Irritability and emotion regulation are both important transdiagnostic factors that contribute to the development of internalizing symptoms during adolescence. The current study examined whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms. Methods: To examine this relationship we analysed the indirect effect of irritability (measured using a single item from the Goldberg Mania Questionnaire) on internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) via the mediator, emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale) in 112 adolescent females. Results: Mediation analysis, using bootstrapping, showed a significant indirect effect and suggests that the relationship between irritability and internalizing symptoms is mediated by emotion dysregulation. Limitations: These include measuring irritability using a single item and employing a cross sectional design. Conclusions: These novel findings add to our understanding of the processes and mechanisms by which irritability contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms.

Testing the main prediction of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide in a representative sample of the German general population,"Objective: To evaluate the main prediction of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS): 3-way-interaction of perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and acquired capability (AC) for the prediction of suicidal behavior in a representative population sample. Method: A total of 2513 participants completed measures of suicidal behavior, TB, PB, acquired capability (AC-FAD), and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The two-way-interaction of TB and PB, and the three-way interaction of TB, PB and AC-FAD predict suicidality. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional nature of the data, conclusions on causality should be handled carefully.

Characteristics of new depression diagnoses in patients with and without prior chronic opioid use,"Chronic use (&gt; 90 Days) of opioid analgesics significantly increases the risk of development of new depression episodes (NDE). It is unclear whether depression that develops in this manner is similar to or different from NDE in persons not exposed to opioid analgesic use (OAU). Methods: VA patients were classified into two groups, those who did not receive an opioid and developed depression (non-OAU + NDE, n = 4314) and those that had &gt; 90 days OAU and developed NDE (OAU + NDE, n = 444). OAU + NDE patients were compared to non-OAU + NDE in terms of depression severity (PHQ-9 scores), incidence of PTSD, other anxiety disorders and substance use disorders after NDE, receipt of acute phase antidepressant treatment, dual antidepressant treatment, mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Prior to computing bivariate analysis, the prevalence of pain conditions and average maximum pain scores were equalized between the two groups using propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: Controlling for pain, OAU + NDE patients had more depression symptoms (p = .012), more incident PTSD (p = .04) and opioid abuse/dependence and were more likely to receive 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment (p &lt; .0001). Last, non-OAU + NDE were more likely to have incident diagnoses for any other anxiety disorder (p = .014). Conclusions: Within the limitations of electronic medical record data, results indicate OAU + NDE patients have more depression symptoms, greater treatment adherence and different comorbid psychiatric conditions compared to non-OAU + NDE, independent of pain. Overall OAU related depression is as severe as non-OAU related depression and repeated depression screening in chronic opioid therapy may be warranted for pain patients, regardless of pain severity.

Effects of prenatal childbirth education for partners of pregnant women on paternal postnatal mental health and couple relationship: A systematic review,"Background: Partner education during pregnancy may be able to prevent postnatal mental health problems, and support expectant fathers in their transition to parenthood. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of prenatal childbirth education among partners of pregnant women, particularly regarding paternal postnatal mental health and couple relationship. Methods: We searched Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, and CENTRAL using terms such as “partners of pregnant women,” “education,” and “prenatal support.” Searches were limited to randomized trials. Results: We included 11 trials out of 13 reports that addressed the following topics: childbirth preparation, couple relationship, infants and parenting, postpartum psychosocial issues, and housework sharing. Overall risk of bias was low or unclear. Study outcomes, including parents’ mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, distress), couple relationship, parents’ transition adjustment and parenting stress, and parents’ satisfaction with their experience of childbirth and prenatal childbirth education programs were reported. Limitations: The studies included in this review were very diverse regarding intervention intensity and content, outcome types, measurement tools, and outcome timing. This impeded evaluation of the interventions’ effectiveness. Conclusion: No sufficient evidence was identified that prenatal childbirth education for partners of pregnant women protects against paternal postnatal depression and couple relationship; however, paternal postnatal mental health is important to maternal and perinatal healthcare. The results of this review suggest that further research and intervention are required to provide partners of pregnant women with evidence-based information and support whole families during the perinatal period.

"Temporal trends in antidepressant prescribing to children in UK primary care, 2000–2015","Background: The prevalence of antidepressant prescribing in children and adolescents increased steadily in the United States and parts of Europe between 2005 and 2012 despite regulatory safety warnings. Little is known about the characteristics of those being prescribed antidepressants for the first time. Methods: A longitudinal study of antidepressant prescribing in 3–17 year olds was carried out using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 2000 and 2015. Changes in the incidence of first ever antidepressant prescriptions and the characteristics of those being prescribed them was examined. Results: Incidence of first ever prescriptions nearly doubled between 2006 and 2015 rising from 1.60 (95%CI: 1.51, 1.69) to 3.12 (3.00, 3.25) per 1000 person years. Only 21% of the 1721 patients with incident prescriptions in 2015 could be linked to a depression diagnosis, with an additional 22% of prescriptions linked to alternative indications. The incidence of prescriptions linked to a depression diagnosis increased between 2012 and 2015, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.46 (1.26, 1.70). Antidepressant prescribing for depression and other indications has been increasing most rapidly in 15 to 17 year old females. Limitations: Diagnoses are not directly linked to prescriptions in CPRD, so linkage must be inferred by temporal proximity. Conclusions: Antidepressant prescribing in children increased between 2006 and 2015. This is, at least in part, due to a rise in alternative uses of antidepressants, including the treatment of anxiety, chronic pain and migraines.

International development and psychometric properties of the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS),"Background: Systematic screening is a powerful means by which children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) can be detected. Reliable and valid measures based on current diagnostic criteria are needed. Aim: To investigate the internal consistency and construct validity of the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) in three samples of trauma-exposed children in the US (self-reports: n = 249; caregiver reports: n = 267; pre-school n = 190), in Germany (self-reports: n = 117; caregiver reports: n = 95) and in Norway (self-reports: n = 109; caregiver reports: n = 62). Method: Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach's α. Convergent-discriminant validity was investigated using bivariate correlation coefficients with measures of depression, anxiety and externalizing symptoms. CFA was used to investigate the DSM-5 factor structure. Results: In all three language samples the 20 item symptom score of the self-report and the caregiver report proved good to excellent reliability with α ranging between .88 and .94. The convergent-discriminant validity pattern showed medium to strong correlations with measures of depression ( r = .62–.82) and anxiety ( r = .40–.77) and low to medium correlations with externalizing symptoms ( r = −.15–.43) within informants in all language versions. Using CFA the underlying DSM-5 factor structure with four symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognitions, hyperarousal) was supported (n = 475 for self-report; n = 424 for caregiver reports). Limitations: The external validation of the CATS with a DSM-5 based semi-structured clinical interview and corresponding determination of cut-points is pending. Conclusion: The CATS has satisfactory psychometric properties. Clinicians may consider the CATS as a screening tool and for symptom monitoring.

Clinical use of &lt;i&gt;Hypericum perforatum&lt;/i&gt; (St John's wort) in depression: A meta-analysis,"Introduction: St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy recommended by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners and licensed and widely prescribed for depression in many European countries. However, conflicting data regarding its benefits and risks exist, and the last large meta-analysis on St John's wort use for depression was done in 2008, with no updated meta-analysis available. Methods: Using the keywords [St John's Wort OR Hypericum perforatum OR hypericin OR hyperforin OR johanniskraut OR圣约翰草] AND [depression OR antidepressant OR SSRI], a preliminary search (without language restriction) on the PubMed, Ovid, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group, Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang database yielded 5428 papers between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-May-2016. Results: 27 clinical trials with a total of 3808 patients were reviewed, comparing the use of St John's wort and SSRI. In patients with depression, St John's wort demonstrated comparable response (pooled RR 0.983, 95% CI 0.924–1.042, p &lt; 0.001) and remission (pooled RR 1.013, 95% CI 0.892–1.134, p &lt; 0.001) rate, and significantly lower discontinuation/dropout (pooled OR 0.587, 95% CI 0.478–0.697, p &lt; 0.001) rate compared to standard SSRIs. The pooled SMD from baseline HAM-D scores (pooled SMD −0.068, 95% CI −0.127 to 0.021, p &lt; 0.001) also support its significant clinical efficacy in ameliorating depressive symptoms. Limitations: Evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of St. John's wort is limited as the duration of all available studies ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. It is also unclear if St John's wort would be beneficial for patients with severe depression, high suicidality or suicide risk. Conclusion: For patients with mild-to-moderate depression, St John's wort has comparable efficacy and safety when compared to SSRIs. Follow-up studies carried out over a longer duration should be planned to ascertain its benefits.

Major depressive disorder with subthreshold hypomanic (mixed) features: A real-world assessment of treatment patterns and economic burden,"Background: To compare outcomes for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with or without subthreshold hypomania (mixed features) in naturalistic settings. Methods: Using the Optum Research Database (1/1/2009-10/31/2014), a retrospective analysis of individuals newly diagnosed with MDD was conducted. Continuous enrollment for 12-months before and after the initial MDD diagnosis was required. MDD with subthreshold hypomania (mixed features) (MDD-MF) was defined based on 1 hypomania diagnosis within 30 days after an MDD diagnosis during the one-year follow-up period, in the absence of bipolar I diagnoses. Psychiatric medication use, healthcare utilization, and costs during the one-year follow-up period were compared using multivariate logistic and gamma regressions, controlling for baseline differences. Results: Of 130,626 MDD individuals, 652 (0.5%) met the operational definition of MDD-MF. Compared to the MDD-only group, the MDD-MF group had more suicidality (2.0% vs. 0.5%), anxiety disorders (46.8% vs. 34.0%), and substance use disorders (15.5% vs. 6.1%, all P &lt; 0.001). More individuals with MDD-MF were treated with antidepressants (83.6% vs. 71.6%), mood stabilizers (50.5% vs. 2.7%), atypical antipsychotics (39.0% vs. 5.5%), and polypharmacy with multiple drug classes (72.1% vs. 22.7%, all P &lt; 0.001). Individuals with MDD-MF had higher hospitalizations rates (24.2% vs. 10.5%) and total healthcare costs (mean: $15,660 vs. $10,744, all P &lt; 0.001). Limitations: The commercial claims data used were not collected for research purposes and may over- or under-represent certain populations. No specific claims-based diagnostic code for MDD with mixed features exists. Conclusions: Greater use of mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, polypharmacy, and healthcare resources provides evidence of the complexity and severity of MDD-MF. Identifying optimal treatment regimens for this population represents a major unmet medical need.

Thwarted belongingness as an explanatory link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation: Findings from three samples of military service members and veterans,"Background: Although insomnia has been identified as a robust predictor of suicidal ideation and behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms by which sleep disturbances confer risk for suicide. We investigated thwarted belongingness as an explanatory link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation across three military service member and veteran samples. Methods: Data were collected among United States military service members and veterans ( N ₁ = 937, N ₂ = 3,386, N ₃ = 417) who completed self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, thwarted belongingness, suicidal ideation, and related psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, hopelessness). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation analyses were utilized to examine the indirect effects of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation through thwarted belongingness, controlling for related psychiatric symptoms. Results: Consistent with study hypotheses, thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation across all three samples; however, insomnia symptoms did not significantly account for the relationship between thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation, highlighting the specificity of our findings. Limitations: This study utilized cross-sectional self-report data. Conclusions: Insomnia may confer suicide risk for military service members and veterans, in part, through the pathway of thwarted belongingness. Additional prospective studies are warranted to further delineate this model of risk. Our results offer a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of suicide, via the promotion of belongingness, among service members and veterans experiencing insomnia symptoms.

Psychopathology profiles of acutely suicidal adolescents: Associations with post-discharge suicide attempts and rehospitalization,"Background: Suicidal adolescents are heterogeneous, which can pose difficulties in predicting suicidal behavior. The Youth Self-Report (YSR) psychopathology profiles predict the future onset of psychopathology and suicide-related outcomes. The present study examined the prevalence and correlates of YSR psychopathology profiles among suicidal adolescents and prospective associations with post-discharge rates of suicide attempts and psychiatric rehospitalization. Methods: Participants were acutely suicidal, psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (N = 433 at baseline; n = 355 at follow-up) who were enrolled in a psychosocial intervention trial during hospitalization. Psychopathology profiles were assessed at baseline. Suicide attempts and rehospitalization were assessed for up to 12 months following discharge. Results: Latent profile analysis identified four psychopathology profiles: subclinical, primarily internalizing, and moderately and severely dysregulated. At baseline, profiles differed by history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and multiple suicide attempts (MA) as well as severity of suicide ideation, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, substance abuse, and functional impairment. The dysregulation profiles predicted suicide attempts within 3 months post-discharge. The internalizing profile predicted suicide attempts and rehospitalization at 3 and 12 months. Limitations: This study's participants were enrolled in a randomized trial and were predominantly female, which limit generalizability. Additionally, only a history of NSSI was assessed. Conclusions: The dysregulation profile was overrepresented among suicidal youth and associated with impairment in several domains as well as suicide attempts shortly after discharge. Adolescents with a severe internalizing profile also reported adverse outcomes throughout the study period. Psychopathology profiles warrant further examination in terms of their potential predictive validity in relation to suicide-related outcomes.

Obesity and obstetric complications are associated with rapid-cycling in Italian patients with bipolar disorder,"Background: Rapid cycling (RC) worsens the course of bipolar disorder (BD) being associated with poor response to pharmacotherapy. Previous studies identified clinical variables potentially associated with RCBD: however, in many cases, results were discordant or unreplicated. The present study was aimed to compare clinical variables between RC and non RC bipolar patients and to identify related risk factors. Methods: A sample of 238 bipolar patients was enrolled from 3 different community mental health centers. Descriptive analyses were performed on total sample, and patients were compared in terms of socio-demographic and clinical variables according to the presence of RC by multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs, continuous variables) or χ2 tests (qualitative variables). Binary logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios. Results: Twenty-eight patients (11.8%) had RC. The two groups were not different in terms of age, age at onset, gender distribution, type of family history, type of substance use disorder, history of antidepressant therapy, main antidepressant, psychotic symptoms, comorbid anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, thyroid diseases, diabetes, type of BD, duration of untreated illness, illness duration, duration of antidepressant treatment and GAF scores. In contrast, RC patients had more often a history of obstetric complications (p &lt; 0.05), obesity (p &lt; 0.05) and a trend to hypercholesterolemia (p = 0.08). In addition, RC bipolar patients presented more frequently lifetime MDMA misuse (p &lt; 0.05) than patients without RC. Discussion: Findings from the present study seem to indicate that obesity and obstetric complications are risk factors for the development of RC in BD. In addition, lifetime MDMA misuse may be more frequent in RC bipolar patients.

Alcohol use disorders are associated with increased affective lability in bipolar disorder,"Background: Affective dysregulation is a core feature of bipolar disorder (BD), and inter-episodic affect lability is associated with more severe outcomes including comorbidity. Rates of daily tobacco smoking and substance use disorders in BD are high. Knowledge regarding relationships between affective lability and abuse of the most commonly used substances such as tobacco, alcohol and cannabis in BD is limited. Methods: We investigated whether dimensions of inter-episodic affective lability as measured with the Affective Lability Scale—short form (ALS-SF) were associated with lifetime daily tobacco use or alcohol (AUD) or cannabis use disorders (CUD) in a sample of 372 French and Norwegian patients with BD I and II. Results: ALS-SF total score and all sub-dimensions (anxiety-depression, depression-elation and anger) were significantly associated with AUD, while only the depression-elation sub-dimension was associated with CUD, after controlling for possible confounders such as gender, age at interview, age at illness onset, BD subtype, duration of illness and other substance use disorders. Daily tobacco smoking was not significantly associated with affective lability. Limitations: Data for recent substance use or psychiatric comorbidities such as personality or hyperkinetic disorders were not available, and could have mediated the relationships. Conclusion: AUD is associated with several dimensions of inter-episodic affective lability in BD, while CUD is associated with increased oscillations between depression and elation only. Increased affective lability may partly explain the increased illness severity of patients with BD and AUD or CUD. Affective lability should be treated in order to prevent these comorbidities.

Dealing with difficult days: Functional coping dynamics in self-harm ideation and enactment,"Background: Self-harm affords people a means of coping. However, little is known about how functional coping dynamics differ between stressful situations in which people self-harm (enactment), think about harming (ideation), or experience no self-harmful thoughts or behaviours. Methods: Participants ( N = 1,157) aged 16−49 years ( M = 18.21, SD = 3.24) with a recent history of self-harm (past 3 months) reported how they coped in response to their most significant recent stressor (3 months). Results: Almost 40% of participants, all of whom had self-harmed in the last 3 months, had no self-harm experience (thoughts or behaviours) in response to their most significant stressor in that time frame. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for symptoms of depression and anxiety, reappraisal coping was predictive of self-harm thoughts. Approach, emotion regulation and reappraisal coping were predictive of self-harm behaviour. Emotion regulation coping differentiated self-harm ideation and enactment groups. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study precludes the ability to make inferences regarding causality. Further, there is no agreed definition of ‘recent’ self-harm. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings suggest that functional coping dynamics may be differentially associated with self-harm ideation and enactment. This is important, given that understanding the transitions between ideation and enactment has been identified as a critical frontier in suicide prevention. Further, results indicate that seemingly innocuous events may have a profound impact as tipping points for enaction; this has implications for clinical practice, including the co-production of safety plans.

The effectiveness of group-based behavioral activation in the treatment of depression: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 241 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2018-46262-084). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief of the Journal of Affective Disorders, as the choice of data analyzed was found to be inaccurate after updated data was provided by the authors, and this had a significant impact on the original article data and conclusions.] Background: Depression is a common mental health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Amongst various psychological treatments for depression, individual behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be effective and relatively simple in its delivery by health care providers although its effectiveness as a group based intervention requires further evidence. The objective of this study is to evaluate and update on the effectiveness of group-based BA to relieve symptoms of depression. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed and prospective randomized trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials comparing group-based BA intervention versus usual care or waitlist controls were included. Depressive symptom measured by various validated scales was the primary outcome. As the interventions can be heterogeneous across the included studies, all analyses were performed by random-effects model. Results: Seven randomized control trials were identified from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden and Iran from 2003 to 2013. A total of 240 subjects were randomly assigned to group-based BA, and all participants included met the criteria for moderate to severe depression at baseline with the majority of participants being females. Participants who joined the group-based BA showed lower depressive symptoms (MD of BDI-II: −6.06 (95% CI: −8.28 to −3.85 and MD of HRSD: −2.82 (95% CI: −4.62 to −1.02)) than participants randomized to the control group with usual treatment. The group-based BA also showed significant reduction in anxiety level (MD of BAI: −3.66 (95% CI: −6.11 to −1.22)) but not quality of life according to two studies. Risk of bias was evident amongst the studies as blinding of health providers and patients were not feasible in psychological studies. Conclusions: Group-based behavioral activation remains promising in relieving depressive symptoms for people with moderate to severe depression from this meta-analysis. Future studies should be higher quality research with larger sample size, longer follow-up periods, and synchronized clinical outcome measures. Patient feedback for group-based behavioral activation can also be further evaluated in order to ensure long term satisfaction and usage in health services.

Symptom quality versus quantity in judging prognosis: Using NESARC predictive validators to locate uncomplicated major depression on the number-of-symptoms severity continuum,"Background: Uncomplicated major depressive disorder (UMDD) is defined as MDD that does not include any of six pathosuggestive features: more than six months duration, marked functional impairment, sense of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic ideation, and psychomotor retardation. Complicated MDD (CMDD) includes all episodes containing one or more of these features. UMDD has been shown to be lower than CMDD and indistinguishable from no-MDD-history on predictive pathology validators. This study's purpose is to establish where on the number-of-symptoms depressive continuum UMDD is located, using the criterion of predictive validity. Methods: Using two-wave longitudinal community data, seven baseline depression history subgroups were identified: no MDD symptoms (n = 23,214), one MDD screener symptom (n = 609), subthreshold or “minor” depression (mD; 2–4 MDD symptoms; n = 2,623), UMDD (n = 505), and complicated MDD with 5–6 symptoms (n = 1,106), 7 symptoms (n = 1,200), and 8–9 symptoms (n = 2,408). Predictive validity was evaluated by four follow-up variables: major depressive episode; generalized anxiety disorder; suicide attempt; and manic/hypomanic episode. Results: UMDD predictive pathology validator rates are not significantly different from rates for subthreshold mD but significantly different from those for all other depression categories; UMDD is higher in symptoms but lower in validator levels than 5–6 symptom CMDD. Limitations: Baseline and follow-up diagnoses were based on respondents’ fallible retrospective symptom reports in response to a lay-administered structured questionnaire, which may not yield diagnoses comparable to clinicians’ assessments. Conclusion: Uncomplicated MDD's follow-up outcomes resemble subthreshold depression, not CMDD, even when CMDD has less symptoms. Clinical decisions should reflect the relatively benign prognosis of uncomplicated MDD.

"Neurocognitive performance, psychopathology and social functioning in individuals at high risk for schizophrenia or psychotic bipolar disorder","Introduction: Although cognitive deficits are consistent endophenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, findings in psychotic bipolar disorder (BDP) are inconsistent. In this study we compared adult unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia and BDP patients on cognition, psychopathology, social functioning and quality of life. Methods: Sixty-six unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (SUnR), 36 unaffected first-degree relatives of BDP patients (BDPUnR) and 102 controls participated in the study. Between-group differences were examined and Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) predicted group membership. Results: Visual memory, control inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility and abstract reasoning were linearly impaired in the relatives’ groups. Poorer verbal fluency and processing speed were evident only in the SUnR group. The SUnR group had higher depressive and somatization symptoms while the BDPUnR group had higher anxiety and lower social functioning compared with the controls. Individuals with superior cognition were more likely to be classified as controls; those with higher social functioning, prolonged processing speed and lower anxiety were more likely to be classified as SUnR. Limitations: The relatives’ sample is quite heterogeneous; the effects of genetic or environmental risk-factors were not examined. Conclusions: Cognitive functions mediated by a fronto-parietal network, show linear impairments in unaffected relatives of BDP and schizophrenia patients; processing speed and verbal fluency impairments were evident only in schizophrenia relatives. Self-perceived symptomatology and social functioning also differ between schizophrenia and BDP relatives. The continuum seen in patients in several indices was also seen in the cognitive impairments in unaffected relatives of schizophrenia and BDP patients.

The Future-oriented Repetitive Thought (FoRT) scale: A measure of repetitive thinking about the future,"Background and objectives: Repetitive thinking about the future has been suggested as one way in which individuals may become hopeless about the future. We report on a new scale assessing future-oriented repetitive thinking, termed the Future-Oriented Repetitive Thought (FoRT) Scale. Methods: In Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted with data from 1071 individuals who completed the scale. Study 2 describes a confirmatory factor analysis with a revised version of the scale on a sample of 612 individuals, a subsample of whom ( N = 99) also completed measures of repetitive thought (rumination, worry), hopelessness-related cognitions, and symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder in order to examine evidence for the measure's convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity. Study 3 examined the scale's concurrent validity in distinguishing between individuals with and without a history of suicidal ideation and attempts. Results: A three-factor solution emerged in Study 1, and this solution was confirmed in Study 2. In addition, the FoRT scale demonstrated moderate associations with other measures of repetitive thought (rumination, worry), with hopelessness-related cognitions, and with symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Finally, the FoRT scale distinguished between individuals with and without a history of suicidal ideation and attempts. Limitations: Cross-sectional data limit conclusions that can be drawn about directionality. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the newly developed FoRT scale is a reliable and valid measure of future-oriented repetitive thought.

"Efficacy of curcumin, and a saffron/curcumin combination for the treatment of major depression: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study","Background: Several studies have supported the antidepressant effects of curcumin (from the spice turmeric) and saffron for people with major depressive disorder. However, these studies have been hampered by poor designs, small sample sizes, short treatment duration, and similar intervention dosages. Furthermore, the antidepressant effects of combined curcumin and saffron administration are unknown. Methods: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 123 individuals with major depressive disorder were allocated to one of four treatment conditions, comprising placebo, low-dose curcumin extract (250 mg b.i.d.), high-dose curcumin extract (500mg b.i.d.), or combined low-dose curcumin extract plus saffron (15 mg b.i.d.) for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR₃₀) and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: The active drug treatments (combined) were associated with significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared to placebo (p = .031), and superior improvements in STAI-state (p &lt; .001) and STAI-trait scores (p = .001). Active drug treatments also had greater efficacy in people with atypical depression compared to the remainder of patients (response rates of 65% versus 35% respectively, p = .012). No differences were found between the differing doses of curcumin or the curcumin/saffron combination. Limitations: Investigations with larger sample sizes are required to examine the efficacy of differing doses of curcumin and saffron/curcumin combination. Its effects in people with atypical depression also require examination in larger scale studies. Conclusions: Active drug treatments comprising differing doses of curcumin and combined curcumin/saffron were effective in reducing depressive and anxiolytic symptoms in people with major depressive disorder.

“The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis"" by Qing-Fei Zhao, Lan Tan, Hui-Fu Wang, Teng Jiang, Meng-Shan Tan, Lin Tan, Wei Xu, Jie-Qiong Li, Jun Wang, Te-Jen Lai and Jin-Tai Yu ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2016[Jan][15], Vol 190, 264-271). As these works were done in China, the author asks for removing the Institute of Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA from the previous version. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-57223-039). Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are being increasingly recognized as common serious problems in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, published data on the prevalence of NPS in persons with AD are conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of NPS in persons with AD. Methods: Studies published from 1964 to September 30, 2014, were identified from PubMed and Embase database, reference lists and conference abstracts. We calculated prevalence rates and conducted metaregression analysis with random-effects model, according to study characteristics, population demographics or condition information. Results: We identified 48 eligible articles, which provided data for 12 NPS reported in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The most frequent NPS was apathy, with an overall prevalence of 49% (95% CI 41–57%), followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorder, the pooled prevalence estimates of which were 42% (95% CI 37–46%), 40% (95% CI 33–46%), 39% (95% CI 32–46%) and 39% (95% CI 30–47%), respectively. The less prevalent NPS were irritability (36%, 31–41%), appetite disorder (34%, 27–41%), aberrant motor behavior (32%, 25–38%), delusion (31%, 27–35%), disinhibition (17%, 12–21%) and hallucination (16%, 13–18%). Least common was euphoria, with an overall prevalence of 7% (95% CI 5–9%). Limitations: Several aspects, such as the quality of included studies were not always optimal and there was significant heterogeneity of prevalence estimate across studies. Conclusions: NPS were observed to be highly prevalent in AD patients. Disease duration, age, education level, population origin and the severity of cognitive impairment had influence on the prevalence of some NPS.

Emotion dysregulation as a cross-cutting target for inpatient psychiatric intervention,"Background: This prospective, open effectiveness trial examined trajectories of change in a cross-cutting measure of emotion dysregulation in an intensive multimodal inpatient treatment for adults experiencing serious mental illness (SMI). Methods: Adult inpatients with SMI (N = 994) completed an average of 38.6 days of inpatient treatment. Latent growth curve (LGC) methods were used to model emotion dysregulation trajectories, estimating expected remission based on individual patterns of change. Results: Absolute reductions in experiential avoidance ( d = 1.03, CI 95% [.94, 1.10]) and emotional dysregulation were substantial with large effect size improvements ( d = .98, CI 95% [.90, 1.05]). Initial scores for experiential avoidance and emotion dysregulation were higher for patients with diagnoses of bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders; whereas, male gender was associated with lower initial scores. Substance use diagnoses were associated with rapid improvement in experiential avoidance and specific emotion dysregulation involving goal-directed behavior and impulse control. Presence of a personality disorder predicted rapid improvement in overall emotion dysregulation and clarity of emotional experiences. Conclusions: Adults with SMI demonstrated substantial improvement in experiential avoidance and emotion dysregulation over the course of intensive inpatient treatment, with significant variability in patterns of change. Substance use and personality disorders were associated with rapid improvements in specific aspects of emotion dysregulation.

"Attentional bias in non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers, and abstinent pathological gamblers: An experimental study","Background: Attentional biases have been recognized as factors responsible for the maintenance of gambling problems. To date, no study has ever assessed the attentional biases among problem gamblers that have discontinued gambling (e.g., abstinent gamblers in treatment). Methods: The sample consisted of 75 participants comprising three groups: non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers, and abstinent pathological gamblers undergoing treatment. The groups were discriminated using South Oaks Gambling Screen scores, with the exception of the abstinent pathological gamblers that already had a DSM-5 diagnosis for gambling disorder. Participants carried out a modified Posner Task for the assessment of attentional bias for gambling stimuli and completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Gambling Craving Scale. Results: Abstinent pathological gamblers showed an avoidance bias in the maintenance of attention, whereas problem gamblers exhibited a facilitation in detecting gambling stimuli. No biases were detected in non-problem gamblers. The results also demonstrated that compared to the other groups, abstinent pathological gamblers showed high emotional stress and problem gamblers reported a higher level of craving. Limitations: The sample size limits the generalizability of results. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that attentional biases affect the maintenance and the discontinuation of gambling activities, and that the subjective feeling of craving for gambling may facilitate problem gamblers’ attention towards gambling stimuli.

"Prevalence of comorbid bipolar and substance use disorders in clinical settings, 1990–2015: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Comorbidity between substance use disorders (SUDs) and bipolar disorder (BD) is highly prevalent to the extent it may almost be regarded the norm. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence rates of SUDs in treatment seeking patients diagnosed with BD in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of Medline, EMBASE, psychINFO and CINAHL databases was conducted from 1990 to 2015. Prevalence of co-morbid SUDs and BD were extracted and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. Results: There were 151 articles identified by electronic searches that yielded 22 large, multi-site studies and 56 individual studies describing comorbid rates of SUDs amongst community dwelling, BD inpatients or outpatients. The SUDs with the highest prevalence in BD were alcohol use (42%) followed by cannabis use (20%) and other illicit drug use (17%). Meta-analysis showed males had higher lifetime risks of SUDs compared to females. BD and comorbid SUDS were associated with earlier age of onset and slightly more hospitalisations than non-users. Limitations: The results do not take into account the possibility that individuals may have more than one comorbid disorder, such as having more than one SUD, anxiety disorder, or other combination. Some of the meta-analyses were based on relatively few studies with high rates of heterogeneity. Most included studies were cross-sectional and therefore causality cannot be inferred. Conclusions: This systematic review shows comorbidity between SUDs and bipolar illness is highly prevalent in hospital and community-based samples. The prevalence of SUDs was similar in patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. This study adds to the literature demonstrating that SUDs are common in BD and reinforces the need to provide better interventions and properly conducted treatment trials to reduce the burden conferred by comorbid SUD and BD.

"Are pregnancy planning and pregnancy timing associated with maternal psychiatric illness, psychological distress and support during pregnancy?","Background: Pregnancy planning and timing may be associated with psychiatric illness, psychological distress and support during pregnancy. Methods: We performed secondary analyses of a prospective cohort of 2654 pregnant women evaluating the impact of depression on preterm birth. We used multivariable logistic regression to test associations between pregnancy planning (“Was this pregnancy planned? Yes/No”) and/or timing (“Do you think this is a good time for you to be pregnant?”) with Composite International Diagnostic Interview generated psychiatric diagnoses and measures of psychological distress and support. Results: 37% and 13% of participants reported an unplanned or poorly timed pregnancy, respectively. Unplanned pregnancies were associated with a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.69, 95%CI 1.23–2.32) and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale's (CPSS) highest quartile (aOR 1.74, 95%CI 1.40–2.16). Poorly timed pregnancies were associated with a MDE (aOR 3.47, 95%CI 2.46–4.91) and the CPSS's highest quartile (aOR 5.20, 95%CI 3.93–6.87). Poorly timed pregnancies were also associated with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD; aOR 1.60, 95%CI 1.07–2.40), and the modified Kendler Social Support Inventory's (MKSSI) lowest quartile (aOR 1.64, 95%CI 1.25–2.16). Psychiatric conditions were strongly associated with planned pregnancies that were subsequently deemed poorly timed (MDE = aOR 5.08, 95%CI 2.52–10.25; GAD = aOR 2.28, 95%CI 1.04–5.03); high CPSS = aOR 6.48, 95%CI 3.59–11.69; and low MKSSI = aOR 3.19, 95%CI 1.81–5.62. Limitations: Participant characteristics may limit generalizability of findings. Conclusions: Pregnancy timing was a stronger predictor of maternal psychiatric illness, psychological distress and low social support than pregnancy planning in our cohort.

The impact of somatic symptoms on the course of major depressive disorder,"Objective: Somatic symptoms have been suggested to negatively affect the course of major depressive disorder (MDD). Mechanisms behind this association, however, remain elusive. This study examines the impact of somatic symptoms on MDD prognosis and aims to determine whether this effect can be explained by psychiatric characteristics, somatic diseases, lifestyle factors, and disability. Methods: In 463 MDD patients (mean age = 44.9 years, 69.8% female) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), we examined whether the type and number of somatic symptom clusters predicted the two-year persistence of MDD. Diagnoses of MDD were established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and somatic symptom clusters were assessed with the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) somatization scale. Psychiatric characteristics, somatic diseases, lifestyle factors, and disability were taken into account as factors potentially underlying the association. Results: The cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and general cluster significantly predicted the two-year persistence of MDD, but only when two or more of these clusters were present (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.51–3.57, p = &lt;0.001). Although the association was partly explained by MDD severity, the presence of multiple somatic symptom clusters remained a significant predictor after considering all potentially underlying factors (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.07–2.68, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Somatic symptoms are predictors of a worse prognosis of MDD independent of psychiatric characteristics, somatic diseases, lifestyle factors, and disability. These results stress the importance of considering somatic symptoms in the diagnostic and treatment trajectory of patients with MDD. Future research should focus on identifying treatment modalities targeting depressive as well as somatic symptoms.

Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation modulates amygdala functional connectivity in patients with depression,"Background: The amygdala is a key region in emotion processing, and studies have suggested that amygdala-frontal functional connectivity deficits could be modulated by antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD). Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), a non-invasive, peripheral neuromodulation method at the ear, has shown promising results in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) in several pilot studies. However, the neural mechanism underlying tVNS treatment of depression has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated how tVNS can modulate the amygdala-lateral prefrontal network resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in mild or moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Methods: Forty-nine MDD patients were recruited and received tVNS or sham tVNS (stVNS) treatments for four weeks. Resting state fMRI scans were applied before and after treatments. Results: After 1 month of tVNS treatment, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were reduced significantly in the tVNS group as compared with the sham tVNS group. The rsFC in the tVNS group between the right amygdala and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was increased compared with sham tVNS. All the rsFC increases were also associated with HAMD reduction as well as reductions in the anxiety and retardation HAMD subscales. Conclusions: tVNS can significantly modulate the amygdala-lateral prefrontal rsFC of MDD patients; our results provide insights into the brain mechanism of tVNS treatment for MDD patients.

Tracking medication changes to assess outcomes in comparative effectiveness research: A bipolar CHOICE study,"Background: Comparative effectiveness research uses multiple tools, but lacks outcome measures to assess large electronic medical records and claims data. Aggregate changes in medications in response to clinical need may serve as a surrogate outcome measure. We developed the Medication Recommendation Tracking Form (MRTF) to record the frequency, types, and reasons for medication adjustments in order to calculate Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCAs), medication adjustments to reduce symptoms, maximize treatment response, or address problematic side effects. Methods: The MRTF was completed at every visit for 482 adult patients in Bipolar CHOICE, a 6-month randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Results: Responders had significantly fewer NCAs compared to non-responders. NCAs predicted subsequent response status such that every additional NCA during the previous visit decreased a patient's odds of response by approximately 30%. Patients with more severe symptoms had a greater number of NCAs at the subsequent visit. Patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder demonstrated a significantly higher rate of NCAs per month than those without a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients with greater frequency, intensity, and interference of side effects had higher rates of NCAs. Participants with fewer NCAs reported a higher quality of life and decreased functional impairment. Limitations: The MRTF has not been examined in community clinic settings and did not predict response more efficiently than the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP). Conclusions: The MRTF is a feasible proxy of clinical outcome, with implications for clinical training and decision-making. Analyses of big data could use changes in medications as a surrogate outcome measure.

The Dutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression (DM-TRD): An extension of the Maudsley Staging Method,"Background: Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is common in daily practice. An empirical, widely accepted and applicable measure to quantify TRD is lacking. Previously, the Maudsley Staging Method (MSM) showed good validity. We aimed to improve the MSM by refining and extending its items resulting in the Dutch Measure for quantification of TRD (DM-TRD). Methods: In addition to duration, severity and failed treatments in the current depressive episode, we added items for functional impairment, comorbid anxiety, personality disorders and psychosocial stressors. We extended the augmentation section and added items for failed psychotherapy and intensified treatment. We examined psychometric properties of the DM-TRD and tested prediction of future depressive symptoms and remission after 16 weeks in 274 (DSM-IV) depressed in- and outpatients entering naturalistic treatment. Results: The DM-TRD showed excellent inter-/intra-rater reliability. Higher scores were associated with more symptoms and less remission during follow-up. The DM-TRD outperformed the MSM in prediction of future depressive symptomatology. Remission was predicted equally well by both measures. Longer duration of the current episode, larger functional impairment and larger baseline symptom severity were the strongest predictors of symptomatology at follow-up. Longer duration and larger functional impairment were negatively associated with remission. Limitations: Longer follow-up could have increased predictive power. Addition of items for somatic co-morbidity, childhood adversity and psychotic features must be investigated further. Conclusion: The DM-TRD has excellent psychometric properties and better predictive validity for clinical outcome than other sophisticated measure published to date. Its use in clinical practice and research will improve treatment planning in TRD-patients.

Assessment of abnormal brain structures and networks in major depressive disorder using morphometric and connectome analyses,"Background: It is hypothesized that the phenomenology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is subserved by disturbances in the structure and function of brain circuits; however, findings of structural abnormalities using MRI have been inconsistent. Generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) methodology provides an opportunity to assess the functional integrity of white matter tracts in implicated circuits. Methods: The study population was comprised of 16 outpatients with MDD (mean age 44.81 ± 2.2 years) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age 45.03 ± 1.88 years). We excluded participants with any other primary mental disorder, substance use disorder, or any neurological illnesses. We used T1-weighted 3D MRI with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and vertex-wise shape analysis, and GQI with voxel-based statistical analysis (VBA), graph theoretical analysis (GTA) and network-based statistical (NBS) analysis to evaluate brain structure and connectivity abnormalities in MDD compared to healthy controls correlates with clinical measures of depressive symptom severity, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Using VBM and vertex-wise shape analyses, we found significant volumetric decreases in the hippocampus and amygdala among subjects with MDD ( p &lt; 0.001). Using GQI, we found decreases in diffusion anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and increases in diffusion probability distribution in the frontal lobe among subjects with MDD ( p &lt; 0.01). In GTA and NBS analyses, we found several disruptions in connectivity among subjects with MDD, particularly in the frontal lobes ( p &lt; 0.05). In addition, structural alterations were correlated with depressive symptom severity ( p &lt; 0.01). Limitations: Small sample size; the cross-sectional design did not allow us to observe treatment effects in the MDD participants. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence indicating that MDD may be conceptualized as a brain disorder with abnormal circuit structure and connectivity.

"Efficacy and safety of oral ketamine versus diclofenac to alleviate mild to moderate depression in chronic pain patients: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial","Background: Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist capable of exerting antidepressive effects in single or repeated intravenous infusions. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and the efficacy of oral ketamine vs. diclofenac monotherapy in reducing symptoms of mild to moderate depression among patients with chronic pain. Methods: This study is a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial with two intervention arms (ketamine, fixed daily dosage of 150mg vs. diclofenac, fixed daily dosage of 150mg). Twenty participants in each arm completed the trial program all of whom had two post-baseline measurements at week 3 and week 6. Reduction in depression symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the hospital anxiety and depression subscale for depression (HADS Depression ) scores at baseline and week 3 and week 6 post-intervention. Results: Significantly lower HDRS scores were observed in the ketamine treatment group as early as 6 weeks post-intervention (P = 0.008). By comparison, mean (± standard deviation) HADS depression subscale scores were significantly lower for individuals receiving ketamine compared to diclofenac for both post-baseline measures at week 3 (6.95 ± 1.47 vs. 8.40 ± 1.6, P = 0.005) and week 6 (6.20 ± 1.15 vs. 7.35 ± 1.18, p = 0.003). Limitations: The limitations of the present study were its small sample size and the short-term follow-up period. Conclusions: Oral ketamine appears to be a safe and effective option in improving depressive symptoms of patients with chronic pain with mild-to-moderate depression.

Psychological mediators of chronic tinnitus: The critical role of depression,"Background: Maintenance of chronic tinnitus has been proposed to result from a vicious cycle of hypervigilance occurring when a phantom sound is associated with anxiety and limbic system overactivity. Depression, obsessive-compulsiveness, illness attitudes and coping strategies are known to impact tinnitus, but their relationship with the vicious cycle is unknown. As such, we aimed to identify psychological mediators of the vicious cycle. We also examined the relationship between coping strategies and any identified mediators to facilitate the translation of our research to treatment settings. Methods: We comprehensively assessed a heterogeneous community sample of 81 people with chronic tinnitus who completed measures assessing their tinnitus and psychological wellbeing. Specifically, we examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms, illness attitudes, and obsessive-compulsiveness in the vicious cycle. Results: While the predicted relationship between tinnitus handicap and anxiety was observed, this was fully mediated by depressive symptoms. In addition, we identified avoidant behaviours and self-blame as maladaptive coping strategies in people with chronic tinnitus and depressive symptoms, identifying potential new treatment targets. Limitations: This work requires replication in a clinical cohort of people with chronic tinnitus, and further investigations of the role of coping strategies. Conclusions: These results extend our understanding of the complex role of psychology in the experience of tinnitus, highlighting the importance of depressive symptoms that may be underpinned by functional disruption of specific neurocognitive networks. We have also identified depressive symptoms and maladaptive coping strategies as new treatment targets to improve the health wellbeing of people with chronic tinnitus.

"Social relationships, loneliness, and mental health among older men and women in Ireland: A prospective community-based study","Background: Data is lacking on the association of interpersonal stressors and social isolation with mental disorders and the mediating role of loneliness. Thus, we examined this association prospectively using community-based data. Methods: Data on 6105 adults aged ≥ 50 years from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was analyzed. Mental health outcomes were assessed 2 years after baseline. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were evaluated with validated scales. Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: Higher levels of spousal support, less strain from spouse and better social network integration were protective against depressive symptoms in men. Social support from friends and children was protective against depressive symptoms in both genders. Higher levels of social strain from children were positively associated with depressive symptoms in women. Loneliness was a significant mediator in the majority of these associations. Conclusion: Interventions aimed at increasing relationship quality and strengthening existing social network structures, with a specific focus on reducing feelings of loneliness, may be beneficial in the prevention of depressive symptoms among older adults.

Persistence or recurrence of non-psychotic comorbid mental disorders associated with 6-year poor functional outcomes in patients at ultra high risk for psychosis,"Background: Patients at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR) are a highly heterogeneous group in terms of clinical and functional outcomes. Several non-psychotic mental disorders co-occur together with the UHR state. Little is known about the impact of non-psychotic comorbid mental disorders on clinical and functional outcomes of UHR patients. Methods: The sample included 154 UHR help-seeking patients (identified with the CAARMS, comprehensive assessment of the at-risk mental state), evaluated at baseline on the Ham-D, Ham-A (Hamilton depression/anxiety rating scale), and PANSS (positive and negative syndrome scale). 74 patients completed the 6-year follow-up assessment (mean = 6.19, SD = 1.87). Comorbid disorders at follow-up were assessed with the SCID I and II. Global functioning was rated on the global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale. Results: In the present sample, 6-year risk of psychosis transition was 28.4%. Among non-transitioned UHR patients, 28.3% reported attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) and 45.3% remained functionally impaired at follow-up (GAF &lt; 60). 56.8% patients were affected by at least one comorbid disorder at follow-up. Among UHR patients who presented with some comorbid disorder at baseline, 61.5% had persistent or recurrent course. Incident comorbid disorders emerged in 45.4% of baseline UHR patients. The persistence or recurrence of non-psychotic comorbid mental disorders was associated with poorer global functional outcomes at follow-up. Limitations: A substantial proportion of the initial sample was not available for follow-up interviews and some groups in the analyses had small sample size. Predictors of longitudinal outcomes were not explored. Conclusions: Among UHR patients, persistence or recurrence of non-psychotic comorbid mental disorders, mostly affective disorders, is associated with 6-year poor functional outcomes.

The grass is not as green as you think: Affect evaluation in people with internalizing disorders,"Background: Affect evaluation—how people evaluate their emotion experiences—has important implications for mental health. Methods: We examined how 70 adults diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder or no psychiatric disorders (control group) believe they should feel in the moment (should affect). We repeatedly assessed participants' current affect and should affect over one week using experience sampling. To examine the psychometric properties of should affect, participants rated their level of rumination at each survey and completed trait measures of brooding and ideal affect at the lab. Results and conclusions: Independent of group status, participants reported that they should be feeling more positive affect and less negative affect. Even after accounting for mean affect, the clinical groups' reports were generally more extreme than were those of the control group. We documented good convergent and discriminant validity of should affect. Finally, we describe clinical implications and directions for future research.

Hostile interpretation bias in depression,"Background: Research suggests an important relationship between interpretation bias, hostility and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Extant literature has yet to examine hostile interpretation bias in clinically depressed samples; the current studies sought to fill this gap. Method: Study 1 participants included undergraduates who met criteria for MDD ( n = 36) or no anxiety or mood diagnosis ( n = 35). Each participant completed a structured clinical interview along with measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait hostility. In Study 2, a sample of treatment-seeking individuals with elevated trait anger completed measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait anger. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that, relative to the non-depressed group, individuals with depression displayed greater hostile interpretation bias but comparable levels of trait hostility. In Study 2, greater hostile interpretation bias was associated with greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was independent of co-occurring trait anger. Limitations: The correlational nature of these studies precludes interpretation of causal relationships between constructs. Additionally, replication of these results should be sought in a larger, more diverse sample. Conclusion: Overall, the findings suggest hostile interpretation bias may play a unique role in depression and could be a treatable feature of interpersonal mechanisms maintaining MDD.

Antenatal depression and adversity in urban South Africa,"Background: In low and middle-income countries (LMIC), common mental disorders affecting pregnant women receive low priority, despite their disabling effect on maternal functioning and negative impact on child health and development. We investigated the prevalence of risk factors for antenatal depression among women living in adversity in a low-resource, urban setting in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: The MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI Plus) was used to measure the diagnostic prevalence of depression amongst women attending their first antenatal visit at a primary-level, community-based clinic. Demographic data were collected followed by administration of questionnaires to measure psychosocial risk. Analysis examined the association between diagnosis of depression and psychosocial risk variables, and logistic regression was used to investigate predictors for major depressive episode (MDE). Results: Among 376 women participating, the mean age was 26 years. The MINI-defined prevalence of MDE was 22%, with 50% of depressed women also expressing suicidality. MDE diagnosis was significantly associated with multiple socioeconomic and psychosocial risk factors, including a history of depression or anxiety, food insecurity, experience of threatening life events and perceived support from family. Limitations: The use of self-report measures may have led to recall bias. Retrospective collection of clinical data limited our ability to examine some known risk factors for mental distress. Conclusion: These findings confirm the high prevalence of MDE among pregnant women in LMIC settings. Rates of depression may be increased in settings where women are exposed to multiple risks. These risk factors should be considered when planning maternal mental health interventions.

Functional domains as correlates of suicidality among psychiatric inpatients,"Background: Suicide remains poorly understood and unpredictable. Addressing this challenge, this study examined the independent contributions of several research domain criteria (RDoC) constructs in relation to suicidality in patients hospitalized for acute suicide risk. Specifically, we examined anhedonia, anxiety/entrapment, and attachment disturbances, reflecting disturbances in reward processes, negative valence systems, and social processes, respectively. Methods: Anhedonia, anxiety, entrapment, and fearful attachment, were assessed quantitatively in 135 adults hospitalized for suicidality. Current suicidality and suicidal history were assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Bivariate analyses (with significance threshold of p &lt; .01 to account for multiple comparisons) and multivariate models examined relationships between symptom dimensions and severity of suicidal ideation (SI). We also assessed differences between patients with a history of suicide attempt and those who exhibited only suicidal ideations. Results: Using bivariate analyses all symptoms except for fearful attachment correlated robustly with SI (r = .37–0.50, p &lt; .001). However, when using multivariate analyses, only anhedonia (β = .28, p = .01) and entrapment (β = .19, p = .03) were independently associated with SI across the entire sample. No functional domain measures differed between patients with history of suicide attempt versus ideation only. Limitations: The reliance on self-report data and a cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Disturbances in reward and threat processing may represent independent factors in the development of suicidal ideation in this high suicide risk cohort. Future studies should assess their role as risk factors.

"Lifetime prevalence, sociodemographic correlates, and diagnostic overlaps of bipolar spectrum disorder in the general population of South Korea","Background: Patients with subthreshold bipolar disorder (Sub-BP) experience severe clinical courses and functional impairments which are comparable to those with bipolar I and II disorders (BP-I and -II). Nevertheless, lifetime prevalence, socioeconomic correlates and diagnostic overlaps of bipolar spectrum disorder (BPS) have not yet been estimated in the general population of South Korean adults. Methods: A total of 3013 adults among the 2011 Korean Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey (KECA-2011) completed face-to-face interviews using the Korean versions of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 and Mood Disorder Questionnaire (K-CIDI and K-MDQ). Results: The lifetime prevalence of BPS in the South Korean adults was measured to be 4.3% (95% CI 2.6–6.9). Nearly 80% of the subjects with BPS were co-diagnosed with other DSM-IV non-psychotic mental disorders: 35.4% (95% CI 24.2–48.5) for major depression and dysthymic disorder, 35.1% (95% CI 27.7–43.3) for anxiety disorders, and 51.9% (95% CI 40.5–63.1) for alcohol and nicotine use disorders. Younger age (18–34 years) was the only sociodemographic predictor of BPS positivity ( P = 0.014), and the diagnostic overlap patterns were different between men and women. Limitations: The prevalence of BPS and other mental disorders could have been influenced by recall bias due to the retrospective nature of this study. Conclusions: Positivity for BPS was estimated to be much greater than the prevalence of DSM-IV BP in South Korea. Most of the respondents with BPS were diagnosed with other major mental disorders and this might be related with mis- and/or under-diagnosis of clinically relevant Sub-BP.

Gambling problems in treatment for affective disorders: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"Background: Gambling problems co-occur frequently with other psychiatric difficulties and may complicate treatment for affective disorders. This study evaluated the prevalence and correlates of gambling problems in a U. S. representative sample reporting treatment for mood problems or anxiety. Methods: n = 3007 respondents indicating past-year treatment for affective disorders were derived from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Weighted prevalence estimates were produced and regression analyses examined correlates of gambling problems. Results: Rates of lifetime and past-year problem gambling (3+DSM-IV symptoms) were 3.1% (95% CI = 2.4–4.0%) and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.9–2.1%), respectively, in treatment for any disorder. Rates of lifetime problem gambling ranged from 3.1% (95% CI = 2.3–4.3%) for depression to 5.4% (95% CI = 3.2–9.0%) for social phobia. Past-year conditions ranged from 0.9% (95% CI = 0.4–2.1%) in dysthymia to 2.4% (95% CI = 1.1–5.3%) in social phobia. Higher levels were observed when considering a spectrum of severity (including ‘at-risk’ gambling), with 8.9% (95% CI = 7.7–10.2%) of respondents indicating a history of any gambling problems (1+ DSM-IV symptoms). Lifetime gambling problems predicted interpersonal problems and financial difficulties, and marijuana use, but not alcohol use, mental or physical health, and healthcare utilisation. Limitations: Data were collected in 2001–02 and were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Gambling problems occur at non-trivial rates in treatment for affective disorders and have mainly psychosocial implications. The findings indicate scope for initiatives to identify and respond to gambling problems across a continuum of severity in treatment for affective disorders.

Retrospective age-of-onset and projected lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders among U.S. Army National Guard soldiers,"Background: The study of military-related mental health has been disproportionately focused on current symptomology rather than potentially more informative life course mental health. Indeed, no study has assessed age-of-onset and projected lifetime prevalence of disorders among reservists. Methods: Age-of-onset and projected lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders were assessed in 671 Ohio Army National Guard soldiers aged 17–60 years. Between 2008 and 2012, face-to-face clinical assessments and surveys were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Results: Lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 61%. Alcohol abuse/dependence (44%) and major depressive disorder (23%) were the most common disorders. The majority (64%) of participants reported disorders antedating enlistment. Median age-of-onset varied with anxiety disorders—particularly phobias and OCD—having the earliest (median = 15 years) and mood disorders the latest median age-of-onset (median = 21 years). Limitations: The study was limited by both the retrospective investigation of age-of-onset and the location of our sample. As our sample may not represent the general military population, our findings need to be confirmed in additional samples. Conclusions: Each psychiatric disorder exhibited a distinct age-of-onset pattern, such that phobias and OCD onset earliest, substance use disorders onset during a short interval from late-adolescence to early-adulthood, and mood disorders onset the latest. Our finding that the majority of participants reported disorders antedating enlistment suggests that an assessment of lifetime psychopathology is essential to understanding the mental health burden of both current and former military personnel.

Brexpiprazole as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder with anxious distress: Results from a post-hoc analysis of two randomised controlled trials,"Background: Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in major depressive disorder (MDD) and are associated with greater illness severity, suicidality, impaired functioning and poor response to antidepressant treatment (ADT). The efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole— a serotonin-dopamine activity modulatoras adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD was recently evaluated in two phase 3 studies. We here present a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of adjunctive brexpiprazole in patients with MDD and symptoms of anxious distress, defined using proxies for DSM-5 criteria. Methods: Eligible patients were randomized to 2 mg brexpiprazole + ADT or placebo + ADT (NCT01360645); or 1 mg brexpiprazole + ADT, 3mg brexpiprazole + ADT, or placebo + ADT (NCT01360632), respectively. Patients were defined as having anxious distress if they had ≥ 2 of the symptoms tension (MADRS item 3 score ≥ 3), restlessness (IDS item 24 score ≥ 2), concentration (MADRS item 6 score ≥ 3), or apprehension (HAM-D item 10 score ≥ 3). Primary efficacy endpoint was change in MADRS total score from baseline to Week 6. Results: 55% of the patients had anxious distress at baseline. Adjunctive brexpiprazole showed greater improvement than adjunctive placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint in both patients with (least square mean difference to placebo + ADT: 2 mg + ADT: −2.95, p = 0.0023; 3 mg + ADT: −2.81, p = 0.0027); and without anxious distress (1 mg + ADT: −2.37, p = 0.0093; 3 mg + ADT: −2.23, p = 0.0131). Brexpiprazole in patients with anxious distress was not associated with an increased incidence of activating adverse events (e.g., akathisia). Conclusions: Adjunctive brexpiprazole 2–3 mg may be efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms and is well tolerated, in patients with MDD and anxious distress.

Empirically supported psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder: Current state of the research,"Objectives: Bipolar disorder requires psychiatric medications, but even guideline-concordant treatment fails to bring many patients to remission or keep them euthymic. To address this gap, researchers have developed adjunctive psychotherapies. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of manualized psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder. Methods: We conducted a search of the literature to examine recent (2007-present), randomized controlled studies of the following psychotherapy interventions for bipolar disorder: psychoeducation (PE), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and family therapies such as family focused therapy (FFT). Results: All of the psychotherapy interventions appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Psychoeducation and CBT are associated with increased time to mood episode relapse or recurrence. MBCT has demonstrated a particular effectiveness in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Online psychotherapy interventions, programs combining one or more psychotherapy interventions, and targeted interventions centering on particular symptoms have been the focus of recent, randomized controlled studies in bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Psychotherapy interventions for the treatment of bipolar disorder have substantial evidence for efficacy. The next challenge will to disseminate these psychotherapies into the community.

Clinical features of bipolar spectrum with binge eating behaviour,"Objective: To determine whether bipolar spectrum disorder with binge eating behavior (BE) is an important clinical sub-phenotype. Methods: Prevalence rates and correlates of different levels of BE were assessed in 1114 bipolar spectrum patients participating in a genetic biobank. BE and eating disorders (EDs) were assessed with the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS). Psychiatric illness burden was evaluated with measures of suicidality, psychosis, mood instability, anxiety disorder comorbidity, and substance abuse comorbidity. Medical illness burden was evaluated with body mass index (BMI) and the Cumulative Index Rating Scale (CIRS). Results: Thirty percent of patients had any BE and 27% had BE plus an ED diagnosis. Compared with bipolar spectrum patients without BE, bipolar spectrum patients with BE were younger and more likely to be female; had significantly higher levels of eating psychopathology, suicidality, mood instability, and anxiety disorder comorbidity; had a significantly higher mean BMI and a significantly higher rate of obesity; and had a significantly higher medical illness burden. Bipolar spectrum patients with BE but no ED diagnosis were more similar to bipolar spectrum patients without BE than to those with an ED. Nonetheless, the positive predictive value and specificity of BE predicting an ED was 0.90 and 0.96, respectively. Limitations: As only two patients had co-occurring anorexia nervosa, these results may not generalize to bipolar spectrum patients with restricting EDs. Conclusion: Bipolar spectrum disorder with broadly-defined BE may not be as clinically relevant a sub-phenotype as bipolar spectrum disorder with an ED but may be an adequate proxy for the latter when phenotyping large samples of individuals.

Dysfunction of the cingulo-opercular network in first-episode medication-naive patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder that may be associated with abnormal cognitive control and emotion regulation. Previous studies have found that network disconnection within the cingulo-opercular network (CON) plays an important role in psychiatric disorders and that the CON may be relevant to the psychopathology of MDD. We thus used the resting-state functional connectivity method in patients with MDD and healthy controls to examine CON neural circuit abnormalities in MDD. Methods: Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the resting state functional connectivity of the CON using the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as the seed region of interest. The resulting functional connectivity (FC) correlation maps were employed to investigate between-group differences. Additionally, we examined the association between depression symptom severity and functional connectivity results. The participants were patients with MDD (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 19). Results: Patients with MDD showed abnormalities in the connectivity of the CON. We found abnormal connectivity in MDD patients between the dACC and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left angular gyrus (LAG) and precentral gyrus. Moreover, regression analysis showed that depression symptom severity (measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire scores (ATQ)) was significantly correlated with the FC values of the CON. Limitations: First, our study consisted of a relatively small sample size that may have limited statistical power. Second, the current study design cannot conclusively specify the role of the CON in the neuropathology of depression. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MDD is associated with disrupted FC of the CON, which plays an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD.

Brief group psychoeducation for caregivers of individuals with bipolar disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Bipolar disorder is associated with significant impairment in personal and social functioning for the individual and their caregivers. Psychoeducation for caregivers is beneficial, but interventions have typically required a significant time commitment and have not assessed changes in self-efficacy. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a brief, two-session psychoeducational intervention for caregivers. It was hypothesized that the intervention would reduce caregiver burden and distress, and increase bipolar disorder knowledge and bipolar disorder self-efficacy. Methods: Participants ( N = 32) were randomized to immediate or waitlist control conditions. The intervention involved two, 150-minute group sessions spaced one-week apart. At pre-, post-, and one-month follow-up participants completed the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Burden Assessment Scale, Knowledge of Bipolar Disorder Scale, and a Bipolar Disorder Self-efficacy Scale. Results: Compared to the waitlist control group, the immediate treatment group demonstrated large and significant reductions in caregiver burden, and increases in bipolar disorder knowledge and bipolar disorder self-efficacy. These improvements maintained or increased to follow-up. No significant change was observed on the DASS-21. Limitations: Reliance on self-report and the sample comprised mostly of parents and partners, so it unclear if results generalize to other carer groups. Conclusions: Large and enduring improvements in carer burden, knowledge, and bipolar disorder self-efficacy can be achieved from a very brief, two-session intervention.

White matter microstructural changes are associated with alcohol use in patients with panic disorder,"Background: A close relationship between panic disorder (PD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been suggested. We aimed to investigate alterations in white matter (WM) volume or integrity in patients with PD comorbid with AUD. Methods: Forty-nine patients with PD, free of comorbid AUD (PD−AUD), and 20 patients with PD comorbid with AUD (PD + AUD) were investigated. All subjects were assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), Beck Depression Inventory, and CAGE questionnaire. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used for imaging analysis. Results: Increased fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as decreased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity were observed in multiple WM tracts, including the body and splenium of the corpus callosum and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, in the PD + AUD group compared to the PD–AUD group. CAGE scores in the PD+AUD group and ASI-R scores in the PD−AUD group were significantly correlated with FA values for the corpus callosum. No WM volume differences were found. Limitations: The present study should be considered preliminary due to relatively small sample size. Conclusions: Our findings revealed microstructural changes in multiple WM tracts, including the corpus callosum and internal capsule, suggesting they could be significant neural correlates of AUD in patients with PD.

The role of obesity measures in the development and persistence of major depressive disorder,"Background: The role of obesity with the development of major depressive disorder (MDD) requires conformation and whether obesity contributes to more chronic depression in persons with established (MDD) is unknown. This study examined the longitudinal relationship of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference with the incidence and persistence of MDD over 2-year and 6-year periods. Method: Data were sourced from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. MDD was established with Composite International Diagnostic Interviews. The relationship of BMI and waist circumference with the development of depression two and six years later were estimated in the subsample with no current psychopathology at baseline. Associations with the persistence of depression was estimated in the subsample with current MDD. Results: Higher BMI at baseline, but not waist circumference, slightly increased the odds of the development of MDD after two years (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increase: 1.11; p = 0.03), This relationship was not significant after adjustment for health and lifestyle variables. Conversely, over a 6-year period both BMI and waist circumference moderately increased the odds of developing MDD even after adjustment (OR:1.17; p = 0.05, OR:1.20; p = 0.05). Persistence of MDD in currently depressed subjects, is not related with BMI or waist circumference (adjusted OR:0.93; p = 0.2, OR:0.91; p = 0.15). Limitations: Development of depression may differ in participants lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Over a 6 year period, patients with higher BMI show a slightly increased risk of development of depression. However, in depressed patients there is no relationship between BMI and the persistence of depression.

Attentional biases in problem and non-problem gamblers,"Background: From a cognitive perspective, attentional biases are deemed as factors responsible in the onset and development of gambling disorder. However, knowledge relating to attentional processes in gambling is scarce and studies to date have reported contrasting results. Moreover, no study has ever examined which component and what type of bias are involved in attentional bias in gambling. Methods: In the present study, 108 Italian participants, equally divided into problem and non-problem gamblers, were administered a modified Posner Task, an attentional paradigm in which—through the manipulation of stimuli presentation time—it is possible to measure both initial orienting and maintenance of attention. In addition to the experimental task, participants completed self-report measures involving (i) craving (Gambling Craving Scale), (ii) depression, anxiety and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and (iii) emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale). Results: Analyses revealed facilitation in detecting gambling-related stimuli at the encoding level in problem gamblers but not in non-problem gamblers. Compared to non-problem gamblers, problem gamblers also reported higher levels of craving, emotional dysregulation, and negative mood states. Furthermore, all measures correlated with the gambling severity. Limitations: The use of indirect measure of attentional bias could be less accurate compared to direct measures. Conclusions: The facilitation in detecting gambling-related stimuli in problem gamblers and the correlation between subjective craving and facilitation bias suggests that attentional bias could not be due to a conditioning process but that motivational factors such as craving could induce addicted-related seeking-behaviors.

Characteristics of depressive patients according to family history of affective illness: Findings from a French national cohort,"Background: Literature is scarce about the characteristics of mood disorder patients with a family history (FH) of affective illness. The aim of the current study was to compare the prominent features of depressive patients with a FH of mania (FHM), those of depressive patients with a FH of depression (FHD), and those of depressive patients with no FH of affective illness (FHO). Methods: As part of the EPIDEP National Multisite French Study of 493 consecutive DSM-IV major depressive patients evaluated in at least two semi-structured interviews 1 month apart, 45 (9.1%) were classified as FHM, 210 (42.6%) as FHD, and 238 (48.3%) as FHO. Results: The main characteristics of FHM patients were a cyclothymic temperament, the presence of mixed features and diurnal variations of mood during depression, early sexual behaviour, a high number of mood episodes and hypomanic switches, high rates of suicide attempts and rapid cycling; diagnosis of bipolar disorder was more frequent in this group as well as comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, bulimia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and impulse control disorders. The FHD patients had more depressive temperament, generalized anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa. Compared to FHO, FHM and FHD showed an earlier age at onset, more comorbid anxiety disorders, as well as more psychotic features. Limitations: The following are the limitations of this study: retrospective design, recall bias, and preferential enrolment of bipolar patients with a depressive predominant polarity. Conclusions: In light of genetic studies conducted in affective disorder patients, our findings may support the hypothesis of genetic risks factors common to affective disorders and dimensions of temperament, that may extend to comorbid conditions specifically associated with bipolar or unipolar illness.

Prevalence of ADHD symptoms across clinical stages of major depressive disorder,"Background: Depression and ADHD often co-occur in clinical samples. Depression severity may be linked to ADHD symptomatology. We therefore assessed ADHD symptoms across clinical stages of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: We used 4-year follow-up data of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (September 2008 until April 2011), including healthy controls, groups with remitted and current MDD (N = 2053; age range 21–69 years; 66.8% females). Probable ADHD was defined as having current ADHD symptoms on the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale and a positive score on childhood or early-adolescent ADHD indicators. We examined ADHD symptom rates across (i) those with and without lifetime MDD, (ii) clinical characteristics of MDD including severity, course and outcomes, (iii) clinical stages of MDD. Results: (i) The prevalence of ADHD symptoms was 0.4% in healthy controls, 5.7% in remitted MDD and 22.1% in current MDD (OR = 4.5; 95% CI 3.1–6.5). (ii) ADHD symptom rates and odds were significantly increased among those with more severe depression (29.4%; OR = 6.8; 95% CI 2.9–16.1), chronic depression (21.8%; OR = 3.8; 95% CI 2.5–5.7), earlier age of onset of depressive symptoms (9.9%; OR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.0–2.3), and comorbid anxiety disorders (29.0%; OR = 3.4; 95% CI 2.0–5.7). (iii) ADHD symptom rates increased across clinical stages of MDD, up to 22.5% in chronic MDD. Limitations: We used self-reports on ADHD symptoms. Also, clinical staging models have not yet been validated for mental disorders. Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are very common among MDD patients, especially among those in recurrent and chronic stages of MDD. Considering ADHD may be an important step forward in improving the treatment of depression.

Long-term safety and efficacy of armodafinil in bipolar depression: A 6-month open-label extension study,"Background: Safe/well-tolerated treatments for bipolar I depression remain limited. We assessed safety/tolerability of adjunctive open-label armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent evaluated in 3 acute, controlled efficacy studies with variable efficacy results. Methods: Completers of three 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled adjunctive armodafinil studies (150–200 mg/day added to ongoing stable maintenance doses of 1 or 2 protocol-defined mood stabilizers) in bipolar I depression could enter this 6-month, open-label extension study. Objectives included evaluation of safety/tolerability (primary) and efficacy (secondary). Results: 867 patients enrolled; 863 received ≥1 dose of armodafinil and 506 (58%) completed the 6-month study. Headache, insomnia, and anxiety were the most common adverse events (AEs) reported, whereas akathisia, nausea, sedation/somnolence, and weight increase were uncommon. Mean measures assessing emergence of mania, anxiety, insomnia, or suicidality showed no worsening. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 57 (7%) patients. Serious AEs occurred in 27 (3%) patients and were considered treatment-related in 8 (1%) patients. Depressive symptoms improved over the 6 months, as did patient functioning. Limitations: Lack of placebo control. Conclusions: Adjunctive armodafinil was generally safe and well tolerated over 6 months of open-label treatment at 150–200 mg/day when taken with protocol-defined mood stabilizers for bipolar I depression. This 6-month open-label study suggested that armodafinil augmentation of bipolar maintenance therapies may have a favorable risk profile and may improve depressive symptoms in some patients with bipolar I depression.

Predicting treatment outcome in psychological treatment services by identifying latent profiles of patients,"Background: The outcomes of psychological therapies for anxiety and depression vary across individuals and symptom domains. Being able to predict treatment response from readily available patient data at presentation has potentially important benefits in aiding decisions about the most suitable interventions for a patient. This paper presents a method of identifying subgroups of patients using latent profile analysis, and comparing response to psychological treatments between these profiles. Methods: All outpatients taken into treatment at two psychological treatment services in London, UK and who provided basic demographic information and standardized symptom measures were included in the analysis (n=16636). Results: Latent Profile Analysis was performed on intake data to identify statistically different groups of patients, which were then examined in longitudinal analyses to determine their capacity to predict treatment outcomes. Comparison between profiles showed considerable variation in recovery (74–15%), deterioration rates (5–20%), and levels of attrition (17–40%). Further variation in outcomes was found within the profiles when different intensities of psychological intervention were delivered. Limitations: Latent profiles were identified using data from two services, so generalisability to other services should be considered. Routinely collected patient data was included, additional patient information may further enhance utility of the profiles. Conclusions: These results suggest that intake data can be used to reliably classify patients into profiles that are predictive of outcome to different intensities of psychological treatment in routine care. Algorithms based on these kinds of data could be used to optimize decision-making and aid the appropriate matching of patients to treatment.

Major depression in hospitalized Argentine general medical patients: Prevalence and risk factors,"Background: Depression is not uncommon among medically hospitalized patients, though reported prevalence has varied widely, often in samples involving elderly patients with particular illnesses. Accordingly, we evaluated risk of major depression in three metropolitan general hospitals in Buenos Aires, in subjects with a range of medical disorders and ages, comparing several standard screening methods to expert clinical examinations. Methods: Consecutively hospitalized general medical patients were evaluated over a six-months. Excluded were subjects under age 18 and those unable to participate in assessments because of illness, medication, sensory or speech impairment, or lack of language fluency, or scored &lt;25 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Consenting participants were examined for DSM-IV-TR major depression by psychiatrists guided by MINI examinations, compared with other standard screening methods. Risk factors were assessed by preliminary bivariate analyses followed by multivariate logistic regression modeling. Results: Overall prevalence of major depression in 257 subjects was 27% by psychiatric examination. The rate was most similar (25%) with the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS), and much higher with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI, 44%) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ, 56%). Factors associated independently with depression by multivariate modeling included: prior psychotropic-drug treatment, female sex, more children, and heavy smoking. Depression was associated most with neoplastic, urological, and infectious disorders, least with pulmonary, neurological, and hematologic conditions. Limitations: Modest numbers limited power to test for associations of depression with specific medical conditions. Conclusions: Major depression was identified in over one-quarter of Argentine, general medical inpatients, with marked differences among screening methods. Several risk factors were identified. The findings encourage assertive identification of depression in hospitalized medical patients using valid, reliable, and cost-effective means of improving their care.

Depression is a risk factor for incident coronary heart disease in women: An 18-year longitudinal study,"Background: According to a recent position paper by the American Heart Association, it remains unclear whether depression is a risk factor for incident Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). We assessed whether a depressive disorder independently predicts 18-year incident CHD in women. Method: A prospective longitudinal study of 860 women enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study (1993–2011) was conducted. Participants were derived from an age-stratified, representative sample of women (20–94 years) randomly selected from electoral rolls in South-Eastern Australia. The exposure was a diagnosis of a depressive disorder using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Outcomes data were collected from hospital medical records: (1) Primary outcome: a composite measure of cardiac death, non-fatal Myocardial Infarction or coronary intervention. (2) Secondary outcome: any cardiac event (un/stable angina, cardiac event not otherwise defined) occurring over the study period. Results: Seven participants were excluded based on CHD history. Eighty-three participants (9.6%) recorded ≥ 1 cardiac event over the study period; 47 had a diagnosis that met criteria for inclusion in the primary analysis. Baseline depression predicted 18-year incidence, adjusting for (1) anxiety (adj. OR:2.39; 95% CIs:1.19–4.82), plus (2) typical risk factors (adj. OR:3.22; 95% CIs:1.45–6.93), plus (3) atypical risk factors (adj. OR:3.28; 95% CIs:1.36–7.90). This relationship held when including all cardiac events. No relationship was observed between depression and recurrent cardiac events. Conclusion: The results of this study support the contention that depression is an independent risk factor for CHD incidence in women. Moreover, the strength of association between depression and CHD incidence was of a greater magnitude than any typical and atypical risk factor.

Harm avoidance and persistence are associated with somatoform disorder psychopathology: A study in Taiwan,"Background: Whether personality features affect the development of somatoform disorders and their psychopathologies is an important issue. Aim of this study was to resolve this issue by comparing indicators of psychopathology and personality features in subjects with somatoform disorders and healthy controls. Methods: This study recruited 148 subjects with somatoform disorders and 146 healthy controls. The severity of psychopathology was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), Health Anxiety Questionnaire (HAQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was used to assess personality features. Demographic data, psychopathology indicators, and TPQ scores were compared between groups. Correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to identify the personality dimensions or demographic variables associated with psychopathology. Results: The somatoform group had lower novelty seeking (NS) and reward dependence (RD) and higher harm avoidance (HA) and severity of psychopathologies. Multiple regression analysis revealed that fatigability, persistence, gender, and education level were predictive of PHQ-15; HA, educational level, persistence, and dependence were predictive of HAQ; HA, persistence, education level, and NS were predictive of BDII-II; and fatigability, education level, persistence, and anticipatory worry were predictive of BAI. The development of somatoform disorders was associated with fatigability, age, residence location, education level, and attachment. Limitations: The limitations include heterogeneity of the diagnosis, the high proportion of undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and the cross-sectional study design. Conclusion: HA/fatigability, persistence, and education level are associated with each type of psychopathology. Fatigability is a powerful predictor of somatoform disorder development.

The natural history of depression and trajectories of symptoms long term after stroke: The prospective south London stroke register,"Background: The natural history of depression in stroke patients is complex and the mechanism of change in symptoms over time is not fully understood. We hypothesise that there are different trajectories of symptoms after stroke. Methods: The primary analysis comprised 761 patients who completed 5 years follow up, obtained from the prospective South London Stroke Register (1998–2013). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used to screen patients for depression symptoms at 3 months after stroke, then annually. Trajectories of depression symptoms were detected using group based trajectory modelling (GBTM). Results: Four patterns of symptoms (Groups I–IV) were identified: 6.31% of patients had severe symptoms, improved slightly in early years then worsen (predicted mean HADs score, 15.74 (se = 1.06)); 28.65% had moderate symptoms, a tendency to get worse over time, predicted mean score 7.36 (se = 0.35); 49.54% had mild symptoms and a tendency of getting worse, predicted mean 3.89 (se = 0.30), and 15.51% of the cohort, had no symptoms and remained so over time. The lowest rate of Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) use, over 5 years after stroke was 1.1% for group (I) and highest was 35% for group (IV). Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the findings using several inclusion criteria and findings agreed with the primary results. Limitations: There is loss to follow up of around 20%. Conclusions: The study identified 4 trajectories of depression symptoms, providing useful information for the long term management of stroke patients and for the implementation of cost effective personalized interventions.

The CD44 ligand hyaluronic acid is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of suicide attempters and is associated with increased blood–brain barrier permeability,"Background: The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain. CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that binds to HA in the ECM and is present on astrocytes, microglia and certain neurons. Cell adhesion molecules have been reported to be involved in anxiety and mood disorders. CD44 levels are decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of depressed individuals, and the CD44 gene has been identified in brain GWAS studies as a possible risk gene for suicidal behavior. Method: We measured the CSF levels of HA and the soluble CD44 (sCD44) in suicide attempters (n = 94) and in healthy controls (n = 45) using ELISA and electrochemiluminescence assays. We also investigated other proteins known to interact with CD44, such as osteopontin and the matrix metalloproteinases MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9. Results: The suicide attempters had higher CSF levels of HA ( p = .003) and MMP9 ( p = .004). The CSF levels of HA correlated with BBB-permeability (rho = 0.410, p &lt; .001) and MMP9 correlated with sCD44 levels (rho = 0.260, p = .005). Limitations: Other relevant biological contributors to suicidal behavior is not addressed in parallel to the specific role of CD44-HA signaling. The gender distribution of the patients from whom CSF was analyzed was uneven. Conclusions: Increased BBB-permeability and HA levels might be a results of increased neuroinflammation and can play a role in the pathobiology of suicidal behavior. The CD44 signaling pathway might be considered a novel target for intervention in mood disorders.

Validation of the PHQ-9 in a psychiatric sample,"Background: The PHQ-9 was originally developed as a screener for depression in primary care and is commonly used in medical settings. However, surprisingly little is known about its psychometric properties and utility as a severity measure in psychiatric populations. We examined the full range of psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 in patients with a range of psychiatric disorders (i.e., mood, anxiety, personality, psychotic). Methods: Patients ( n = 1023) completed the PHQ-9 upon admission and discharge from a partial hospital, as well as other self-report measures of depression, anxiety, well-being, and a structured diagnostic interview. Results: Internal consistency was good (α = .87). The PHQ-9 demonstrated a strong correlation with a well-established measure of depression, moderate correlations with related constructs, a weak correlation with a theoretically unrelated construct (i.e., disgust sensitivity), and good sensitivity to change, with a large pre- to post-treatment effect size. Using a cut-off of ≥ 13, the PHQ-9 demonstrated good sensitivity (.83) and specificity (.72). A split-half exploratory factor analysis/confirmatory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution with one factor capturing cognitive and affective symptoms and a second factor reflecting somatic symptoms. Psychometric properties did not differ between male and female participants. Limitations: No clinician-rated measure of improvement, and the sample lacked ethnoracial diversity. Conclusions: This first comprehensive validation of the PHQ-9 in a large, psychiatric sample supported its use as a severity measure and as a measure of treatment outcome. It also performed well as a screener for a current depressive episode using a higher cut-off than previously recommended for primary care samples.

A tool to predict suicidal ideation and behavior in bipolar disorder: The Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report,"Background: Few brief, self-report measures exist that can reliably predict adverse suicidality outcomes in patients with BD. This study utilized the Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report (CHRT) to assess suicidality in patients with BD and examined its psychometric performance, clinical correlates, and prospective value in predicting adverse events related to suicidality. Methods: The CHRT was administered at baseline and follow-up to 482 adult patients in Bipolar CHOICE, a 6-month randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) was used at baseline to assess lifetime history of suicide attempts and related behaviors. Clinician-rated measures of mood (Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale) and bipolar symptoms (Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version) were conducted at baseline and follow-up. Results: The CHRT showed excellent internal consistency and construct validity and was highly correlated with clinician ratings of depression, anxiety, and overall functioning at baseline and throughout the study. Baseline CHRT scores significantly predicted risk of subsequent suicidality-related Serious Adverse Events (sSAEs), after controlling for mood and comorbidity. Specifically, the hazard of a sSAE increased by 76% for every 10-point increase in baseline CHRT score. Past history of suicide attempts and related behaviors, as assessed by the CSSRS, did not predict subsequent sSAEs. Limitations: The CSSRS was used to assess static risk factors in terms of past suicidal behaviors and may have been a more powerful predictor over longer-term follow-up. Conclusions: The CHRT offers a quick and robust self-report tool for assessing suicidal risk and has important implications for future research and clinical practice.

Are manic symptoms that ‘ &lt;i&gt;dip&lt;/i&gt;’ into depression the essence of mixed features?,"Background: Three symptoms of (hypo)mania that clinically represent mood disorders mixed states have been omitted from the DSM-5 mixed features specifier because ‘they fail to discriminate between manic and depressive syndromes’. Therefore, the present study examined the role of distractibility, irritability and psychomotor agitation (DIP) in characterising mixed depressive states. Methods: Fifty in-patients at a specialist mood disorders unit underwent a detailed longitudinal clinical evaluation (3–6 weeks) and were assessed on a range of standardized measures to characterise their illness according to depression subtype, duration of illness and clinical features-including specifically depressive and manic symptoms and the context in which these occur. Results: 49 patients met criteria for major depressive episode, and of these, 34 experienced at least one dip symptom. Patients who endorsed distractibility were more likely to be diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder than Major Depressive Disorder; patients who endorsed irritable mood were more likely to have non-melancholic depression (admixture of depressive and anxiety symptoms), and patients who reported psychomotor agitation experienced a significantly greater number of distinct periods of (hypo)manic symptoms compared with those who did not. Limitations: The present study used a modest sample size and did not control for medication or comorbid illness. Although this is inevitable when examining real-world patients in a naturalistic setting, future research needs to allow for comorbidity and its impact, specifically anxiety. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that all 3 symptoms that have been excluded from DSM-5 may be cardinal features of mixed states, as they ‘ dip ’ into depressive symptoms to create a mixed state.

Deliberately generated and imitated facial expressions of emotions in people with eating disorders,"Background: People with eating disorders have difficulties in socio emotional functioning that could contribute to maintaining the functional consequences of the disorder. This study aimed to explore the ability to deliberately generate (i.e., pose) and imitate facial expressions of emotions in women with anorexia (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods: One hundred and three participants (36 AN, 25 BN, and 42 HC) were asked to pose and imitate facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. Their facial expressions were recorded and coded. Results: Participants with eating disorders (both AN and BN) were less accurate than HC when posing facial expressions of emotions. Participants with AN were less accurate compared to HC imitating facial expressions, whilst BN participants had a middle range performance. All results remained significant after controlling for anxiety, depression and autistic features. Limitations: The relatively small number of BN participants recruited for this study. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that people with eating disorders, particularly those with AN, have difficulties posing and imitating facial expressions of emotions. These difficulties could have an impact in social communication and social functioning. This is the first study to investigate the ability to pose and imitate facial expressions of emotions in people with eating disorders, and the findings suggest this area should be further explored in future studies.

Dimensions of adult attachment are significantly associated with specific affective temperament constellations in a Hungarian university sample,"Background: Related to emotion regulation and mental health, adult attachment and affective temperaments are relevant research topics of contemporary psychiatry and clinical psychology. However, to date, only one study investigated the relationship between these two constructs. Thus, we aimed to further reveal adult attachment's association with affective temperaments. Methods: Affective temperament and adult attachment dimensions of 1469 Hungarian university students were assessed with self-report measures (Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa and San Diego autoquestionnaire and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, respectively). Age and measured variables were compared between genders with ANOVAs. Associations between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments were examined with Pearson's correlations and partial correlations; the moderation effect of age and gender on these relationships was tested with PROCESS macro. Using Fisher r-to-z transformation, we also compared our results with the findings of the previous study. Cohen's ds were used to report effect size and Cronbach's alphas were computed as indices of internal reliability. Results: Significant correlations were found between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments. Correlations were especially robust between attachment anxiety and depressive, cyclothymic and anxious temperaments. Contrasted with the results of the previous study, hyperthymic temperament was negatively related to attachment avoidance and anxious temperament was significantly more strongly correlated with attachment anxiety in our study. Limitations: We used a previous version of the adult attachment measure. Our sample differed from the target sample in several ways. Participants were not screened for mental disorders. Conclusions: Findings highlight that adult attachment dimensions are significantly associated with affective temperaments.

"Childhood maltreatment, maladaptive personality types and level and course of psychological distress: A six-year longitudinal study","Background: Childhood maltreatment and maladaptive personality are both cross-sectionally associated with psychological distress. It is unknown whether childhood maltreatment affects the level and longitudinal course of psychological distress in adults and to what extent this effect is mediated by maladaptive personality. Methods: A sample of 2947 adults aged 18–65, consisting of healthy controls, persons with a prior history or current episode of depressive and/or anxiety disorders according to the Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument were assessed in six waves at baseline (T0) and 1 (T1), 2 (T2), 4 (T4) and 6 years (T6) later. At each wave psychological distress was measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Fear Questionnaire. At T0 childhood maltreatment types were measured with a semi-structured interview (Childhood Trauma Interview) and personality traits with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. Results: Using latent variable analyses, we found that severity of childhood maltreatment (emotional neglect and abuse in particular) predicted higher initial levels of psychological distress and that this effect was mediated by maladaptive personality types. Differences in trajectories of distress between persons with varying levels of childhood maltreatment remained significant and stable over time. Limitations: Childhood maltreatment was assessed retrospectively and maladaptive personality types and level of psychological distress at study entry were assessed concurrently. Conclusions: Routine assessment of maladaptive personality types and possible childhood emotional maltreatment in persons with severe and prolonged psychological distress seems warranted to identify persons who may need a different or more intensive treatment.

Prevalence and correlates of DSM-5 eating disorders in patients with bipolar disorder,"Objective: To determine prevalence rates and clinical correlates of current DSM-5 eating disorders in patients with bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: Prevalence rates of current DSM-5- and DSM-IV-defined binge eating disorder (BED), bulimia nervosa (BN), and anorexia nervosa (AN) were assessed with the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS) in 1092 patients with BP. Psychiatric illness burden was evaluated with five proxy measures of BP illness severity. Medical illness burden was evaluated with the Cumulative Index Rating Scale (CIRS). Results: Twenty-seven percent of patients had a current DSM-5 eating disorder: 12% had BED, 15% had BN, and 0.2% had AN. Rates of DSM-5-defined BED and BN were higher than clinical diagnosis rates and rates of DSM-IV-defined BED and BN. Compared with BP patients without an eating disorder, BP patients with a DSM-5 eating disorder were younger and more likely to be women; had an earlier age of onset of BP; had higher EDDS composite scores and higher degrees of suicidality, mood instability, and anxiety disorder comorbidity; and had a higher mean BMI, higher rate of obesity, and higher CIRS total scores. In a logistic regression model controlling for previously identified correlates of an eating disorder, younger age, female gender, and higher BMI remained significantly associated with an eating disorder. Limitations: The EDDS has not been validated in BP patients. Conclusion: DSM-5-defined BED and BN are common in BP patients, possibly more common than DSM-IV-defined BED and BN, and associated with greater psychiatric and general medical illness burden. Further studies assessing DSM-5 eating disorders in people with BP are greatly needed.

The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 206 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2016-53187-003). As these works were done in China, the author asks for removing the Institute of Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA from the previous version.] Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are being increasingly recognized as common serious problems in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, published data on the prevalence of NPS in persons with AD are conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of NPS in persons with AD. Methods: Studies published from 1964 to September 30, 2014, were identified from PubMed and Embase database, reference lists and conference abstracts. We calculated prevalence rates and conducted metaregression analysis with random-effects model, according to study characteristics, population demographics or condition information. Results: We identified 48 eligible articles, which provided data for 12 NPS reported in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The most frequent NPS was apathy, with an overall prevalence of 49% (95% CI 41–57%), followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorder, the pooled prevalence estimates of which were 42% (95% CI 37–46%), 40% (95% CI 33–46%), 39% (95% CI 32–46%) and 39% (95% CI 30–47%), respectively. The less prevalent NPS were irritability (36%, 31–41%), appetite disorder (34%, 27–41%), aberrant motor behavior (32%, 25–38%), delusion (31%, 27–35%), disinhibition (17%, 12–21%) and hallucination (16%, 13–18%). Least common was euphoria, with an overall prevalence of 7% (95% CI 5–9%). Limitations: Several aspects, such as the quality of included studies were not always optimal and there was significant heterogeneity of prevalence estimate across studies. Conclusions: NPS were observed to be highly prevalent in AD patients. Disease duration, age, education level, population origin and the severity of cognitive impairment had influence on the prevalence of some NPS.

5-HTTLPR and gender differences in affective disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) variants have been extensively studied in psychiatric disorders. Although gender effects have been reported, they have not been comprehensively reviewed. The aim of our study was to summarize literature findings on 5-HTTLPR and gender differences in affective disorders. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, ISIWeb of Knowledge, and PsycINFO databases was performed for dates until January 2015. The included articles ( n = 78) analyzed the association between 5-HTTLPR and affective spectrum disorders, taking into account gender. The quality of each study was assessed through STROBE and CONSORT. Results: 5-HTTLPR modulation of affective disorders varied by gender. The S allele (or SS genotype) seemed to be differently associated with an increased risk of depression, depressive symptoms, anxiety traits and symptoms, and symptoms of internalizing behavior among women and an increased risk of aggressiveness, conduct disorder and symptom counts of externalizing behavior among men. Moreover, the presence of stressful life events reinforced the association. Interestingly, these differences seemed to begin with adolescence and were not consistent among the elderly, suggesting a plausible role of hormonal fluctuations. Limitations: The review is limited by the small number of included papers, due to the paucity of information in the literature regarding 5-HTTLPR and gender. Conclusions: 5-HTTLPR variants may exert a differential modulation on a number of features depending on gender. Further studies are needed to more deeply investigate the effect of 5-HTTLPR × gender on the modulation of affective disorders.

Positive mental health in outpatients with affective disorders: Associations with life satisfaction and general functioning,"Background: Positive mental health (PMH) is an integral and essential component of health that encompasses emotional, psychological and social well-being. The Keyes' two continua model of mental health and illness posits that mental health status is not merely the absence of mental health problems, and it can be enhanced regardless of a diagnosis of mental illness. The present study hypothesized that mentally ill patients with higher levels of PMH would be associated with better life satisfaction and general functioning. Methods: 218 outpatients with affective disorders at a tertiary psychiatric hospital were recruited and administered the multidimensional Positive Mental Health instrument, which was validated and developed in Singapore to measure PMH. Depression and anxiety severity were also assessed. Associations of positive mental health with life satisfaction and general functioning were investigated in linear regression models. Results: PMH scores varied largely within patients with depressive and anxiety disorders but did not differ statistically across the two diagnoses, except for emotional support. PMH was associated with both life satisfaction and general functioning with little evidence of confounding by sociodemographic and clinical status. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study could not examine causal relationships. Findings may be restrictive to treatment-seeking population with specific affective disorders. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence to support the notion that a good mental health state is not simply the absence of a mental disorder. Mentally ill patients can also have high levels of PMH that possibly have a moderating or mediating effect on the relationship between patients' clinical symptoms and life satisfaction or general functioning.

Childhood motor coordination and adult psychopathology in extremely low birth weight survivors,"Objective: To determine if childhood motor coordination is associated with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), current generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood, and to examine if extremely low birth weight (ELBW; &lt; 1000 g) status moderates the strength of these associations. Method: Prospective study of a cohort of normal birth weight (NBW) controls and ELBW survivors. Participants completed the short form Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP-SF) at age 8. At age 29–36, participants completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to diagnose the psychiatric disorders of interest. Results: Birth weight status significantly influenced the strength and direction of associations between childhood motor coordination and adult psychiatric outcomes such that the odds of MDD ( P interaction = .02) and GAD ( P interaction = .01) increased with worsening motor scores in NBW adults but not ELBW survivors. Stratified analyses indicated that in NBW adults, for each one-point decrease in BOTMPSF score, the odds of lifetime MDD increased by 10% (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.20). Limitations: Participant attrition reduced sample size and that may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant results for some of our analyses. Conclusion: Poorer motor coordination in early life has a negative long-term impact on the development of MDD and GAD of individuals born at NBW. The long-term mental health risks of childhood motor coordination problems are significant and highlight the importance of recognizing motor deficits in all children, so that associated psychological difficulties can be identified and treated at an early age.

Prognosis of depressive disorders in the general population– results from the longitudinal Finnish Health 2011 Study,"Background: Depressive disorders are among the most pressing public health challenges worldwide. Yet, not enough is known about their long-term outcomes. This study examines the course and predictors of different outcomes of depressive disorders in an eleven-year follow-up of a general population sample. Methods: In a nationally representative sample of Finns aged 30 and over (BRIF8901), major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia were diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) in 2000. The participants were followed up in 2011 ( n = 5733). Outcome measures were diagnostic status, mortality, depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life. Multiple imputation (MI) was used to account for nonresponse. Results: At follow-up, 33.8% of persons with baseline MDD and 42.6% with baseline dysthymia received a diagnosis of depressive, anxiety or alcohol use disorder. Baseline severity of disorder, measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, predicted both persistence of depressive disorder and increased mortality risk. In addition, being never-married, separated or widowed predicted persistence of depressive disorders, whereas somatic and psychiatric comorbidity, childhood adversities and lower social capital did not. Those who received no psychiatric diagnosis at follow-up still had residual symptoms and lower quality of life. Limitations: We only had one follow-up point at eleven years, and did not collect information on the subjects’ health during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Depressive disorders in the general population are associated with multiple negative outcomes. Severity of index episode is the strongest predictor of negative outcomes. More emphasis should be placed on addressing the long-term consequences of depression.

Personality and social support as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression,"Background: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with high personal and public health consequences, partly due to a high risk of recurrence. This longitudinal study examines personality traits, structural and subjective social support dimensions as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression in initially non-depressed subjects. Methods: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). 1085 respondents without a current depression or anxiety diagnosis were included. 437 respondents had a prior history of depression, 648 did not . Personality dimensions were measured with the NEO-FFI, network size, partner-status, negative and positive emotional support were measured with the Close Person Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses ( unadjusted and adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic variables ) examined whether these psychosocial variables predict a new episode of depression at two year follow up and whether this differed among persons with or without a history of depression. Results: In the unadjusted analyses high extraversion (OR:.93, 95% CI (.91–.96), P &lt; .001), agreeableness (OR:.94, 95% CI (.90–.97), P &lt; .001), conscientiousness (OR:.93, 95% CI (.90–.96), P &lt; .001) and a larger network size (OR:.76, 95% CI (.64–.90), P = .001) significantly reduced the risk of a new episode of depression. Only neuroticism predicted a new episode of depression in both the unadjusted (OR:1.13, 95% CI (1.10–1.15), P &lt; .001) and adjusted analyses (OR:1.06, 95% CI (1.03–1.10), P &lt; .001). None of the predictors predicted first or recurrent episodes of depression differently. Limitations: we used a relatively short follow up period and broad personality dimensions. Conclusions: Neuroticism seems to predict both first and recurrent episodes of depression and may be suitable for screening for preventive interventions.

Relationship of the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) genotype and serotonin transporter binding to neural processing of negative emotional stimuli,"Background: The lower-expressing (S′) alleles of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) are linked to mood and anxiety related psychopathology. However, the specific neural mechanism through which these alleles may influence emotional and cognitive processing remains unknown. We examined the relationship between both 5-HTTLPR genotype and in vivo 5-HTT binding quantified via PET with amygdala reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli. We hypothesized that 5-HTT binding in both raphe nuclei (RN) and amygdala would be inversely correlated with amygdala reactivity, and that number of S′ alleles would correlate positively with amygdala reactivity. Methods: In medication-free patients with current major depressive disorder (MDD; N = 21), we determined 5-HTTLPR genotype, employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli, and used positron emission tomography with [¹¹C]DASB to examine 5-HTT binding. Results: [¹¹C]DASB binding in RN and amygdala was inversely correlated with amygdala response to negative stimuli. 5-HTTLPR S′ alleles were not associated with amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli. Limitations: Primary limitations are small sample size and lack of control group. Conclusions: Consistent with findings in healthy volunteers, 5-HTT binding is associated with amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli in MDD. 5-HTT binding may be a stronger predictor of emotional processing in MDD as compared with 5-HTTLPR genotype.

Positive imagery cognitive bias modification (CBM) and internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT): A randomized controlled trial,"Reports an error in ""Positive imagery cognitive bias modification (CBM) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT): A randomized controlled trial"" by Alishia D. Williams, Kathleen O’Moore, Simon E. Blackwell, Jessica Smith, Emily A. Holmes and Gavin Andrews ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2015[Jun][1], Vol 178, 131-141). In the original article, There was an error in Section 3.6. The published text reports the percentages for clinically reliable change, not clinically reliable and significant change as defined in Section 2.6. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-17618-020). Background: Accruing evidence suggests that positive imagery-based cognitive bias modification (CBM) could have potential as a standalone targeted intervention for depressive symptoms or as an adjunct to existing treatments. We sought to establish the benefit of this form of CBM when delivered prior to Internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 1-week Internet-delivered positive CBM vs. an active control condition for participants ( N =75, 69% female, mean age=42) meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression; followed by a 10-week iCBT program for both groups. Results: Modified intent-to-treat marginal and mixed effect models demonstrated no significant difference between conditions following the CBM intervention or the iCBT program. In both conditions there were significant reductions (Cohen's d .57–1.58, 95% CI=.12–2.07) in primary measures of depression and interpretation bias (PHQ9, BDI-II, AST-D). Large effect size reductions (Cohen's d .81–1.32, 95% CI=.31–1.79) were observed for secondary measures of distress, disability, anxiety and repetitive negative thinking (K10, WHODAS, STAI, RTQ). Per protocol analyses conducted in the sample of participants who completed all seven sessions of CBM indicated between-group superiority of the positive over control group on depression symptoms (PHQ9, BDI-II) and psychological distress (K10) following CBM (Hedges g .55–.88, 95% CI=−.03–1.46) and following iCBT (PHQ9, K10). The majority (&gt;70%) no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression at 3-month follow-up. Limitations: The control condition contained many active components and therefore may have represented a smaller ‘dose’ of the positive condition. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support for the successful integration of imagery-based CBM into an existing Internet-based treatment for depression.

"Tracing the associations between sex, the atypical and the combined atypical-melancholic depression subtypes: A path analysis","Background: Numerous studies have examined determinants leading to preponderance of women in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is particularly accentuated for the atypical depression subtype. It is thus of interest to explore the specific indirect effects influencing the association between sex and established depression subtypes. Methods: The data of 1624 subjects with a lifetime diagnosis of MDD derived from the population-based PsyCoLaus data were used. An atypical ( n = 256), a melancholic ( n = 422), a combined atypical and melancholic features subtype ( n = 198), and an unspecified MDD group ( n = 748) were constructed according to the DSM-IV specifiers. Path models with direct and indirect effects were applied to the data. Results: Partial mediation of the female-related atypical and combined atypical-melancholic depression subtypes was found. Early anxiety disorders and high emotion-orientated coping acted as mediating variables between sex and the atypical depression subtype. In contrast, high Body Mass Index (BMI) served as a suppression variable, also concerning the association between sex and the combined atypical- melancholic subtype. The latter association was additionally mediated by an early age of MDD onset and early/late anxiety disorders. Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data does not allow causal conclusions. Conclusions: This is the first study that provides evidence for a differentiation of the general mechanisms explaining sex differences of overall MDD by depression subtypes. Determinants affecting the pathways begin early in life. Since some of them are primarily of behavioral nature, the present findings could be a valuable target in mental health care.

Daily minority stress and affect among gay and bisexual men: A 30-day diary study,"Background: This study examined the time-variant association between daily minority stress and daily affect among gay and bisexual men. Tests of time-lagged associations allow for a stronger causal examination of minority stress-affect associations compared with static assessments. Multilevel modeling allows for comparison of associations between minority stress and daily affect when minority stress is modeled as a between-person factor and a within-person time-fluctuating state. Methods: 371 gay and bisexual men in New York City completed a 30-day daily diary, recording daily experiences of minority stress and positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and anxious affect (AA). Multilevel analyses examined associations between minority stress and affect in both same-day and time-lagged analyses, with minority stress assessed as both a between-person factor and a within-person state. Results: Daily minority stress, modeled as both a between-person and within-person construct, significantly predicted lower PA and higher NA and AA. Daily minority stress also predicted lower subsequent- day PA and higher subsequent-day NA and AA. Limitations: Self-report assessments and the unique sample may limit generalizability of this study. Conclusions: The time-variant association between sexual minority stress and affect found here substantiates the basic tenet of minority stress theory with a fine-grained analysis of gay and bisexual men's daily experience. Time-lagged effects suggest a potentially causal pathway between minority stress as a social determinant of mood and anxiety disorder symptoms among gay and bisexual men. When modeled as both a between-person factor and within-person state, minority stress demonstrated expected patterns with affect.

Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among veterans in primary care referred for a mental health evaluation,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration has made concerted efforts to increase mental health services offered in primary care. However, few studies have evaluated correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in veterans in primary care-mental health integration (PCMHI). The purpose of the present study is to examine associations between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts as dependent variables and demographic and clinical factors as the independent variables. Methods: Veterans ( n = 3004) referred from primary care to PCMHI were contacted for further assessment, which included past-year severity of suicidal thoughts (none, low, high) and attempts using the Paykel Suicide Scale, mental health disorders, and illicit drug use. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Results: Thoughts of taking one's life was endorsed by 24% of participants and suicide attempts were reported in 2%. In adjusted models, depression, psychosis, mania, PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder were associated with high severity suicidal ideation, but not suicide attempt. Illicit drug use was not associated with suicidal ideation, but was the only variable associated with suicide attempt. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, focused on one clinical setting, and the suicide attempt analyses had limited power. Conclusions: PCMHI is a critical setting to assess suicidal ideation and suicide attempt and researchers and clinicians should be aware that the differential correlates of these suicide-related factors. Future research is needed to identify prospective risk factors and assess the utility of follow-up care in preventing suicide.

Validation of the self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ 20) in British Pakistani and White European population in the United Kingdom,"Background: The incidence of depression is difficult to determine because of low clinical depression detection rates in the primary care setting. This low level of detection is a significantly greater problem in people from ethnic minority communities. The availability of culturally validated screening questionnaires might help to improve the detection and treatment of depression. Method: The aim of the study was to assess the validity of the self-reporting questionnaire SRQ 20, (English and Urdu versions) in white Europeans and British Pakistanis and to determine the optimum cut-off scores for detecting depression. Validation of the English and Urdu versions of the SRQ was conducted with a sample of white Europeans and British Pakistani participants. The semi-structured Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) was used as the gold standard diagnostic interview, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate SRQ test performance. Results: The SRQ was completed by 1856 participants out of whom 651 completed the SCAN interview. The SRQ sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values versus SCAN indicated a cut-off score of 7 as optimum for white Europeans and a cut-off score of 6 for British Pakistanis. Limitations: This study focused on depression alone and did not take into consideration comorbid conditions such as anxiety which might have affected the way respondents answered the questions and contributed to comparatively lower optimum cut-off scores in British Pakistanis. Conclusions: The findings of this validation study provide evidence for high sensitivity and specificity of SRQ amongst both white Europeans and British Pakistanis. The SRQ can be used as a routine screening questionnaire for depression in English and Urdu speaking populations in the UK.

Clinical and course characteristics of depression and all-cause mortality: A prospective population-based study,"Background: Given the large heterogeneity of depressive disorders (DD), studying depression characteristics according to clinical manifestations and course is a more promising approach than studying depression as a whole. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between clinical and course characteristics of DD and incident all-cause mortality. Methods: CoLaus|PsyCoLaus is a prospective cohort study (mean follow-up duration = 5.2 years) including 35–66 year-old randomly selected residents of an urban area in Switzerland. A total of 3668 subjects (mean age 50.9 years, 53.0% women) underwent physical and psychiatric baseline evaluations and had a known vital status at follow-up (98.8% of the baseline sample). Clinical (diagnostic severity, atypical features) and course characteristics (recency, recurrence, duration, onset) of DD according to the DSM-5 were elicited using a semi-structured interview. Results: Compared to participants who had never experienced DD, participants with current but not remitted DD were more than three times as likely to die (Hazard Ratio: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1–10.0) after adjustment for socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, comorbid anxiety disorders, antidepressant use, and cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. There was no evidence for associations between other depression characteristics and all-cause mortality. Limitations: The small proportion of deceased subjects impeded statistical analyses of cause-specific mortality. Conclusions: A current but not remitted DD is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, independently of cardiovascular or lifestyle factors, which suggests that the effect of depression on mortality diminishes after remission and further emphasizes the need to adequately treat current depressive episodes.

What are 'good' depression symptoms? Comparing the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms of depression in a network analysis,"Background: The symptoms for Major Depression (MD) defined in the DSM-5 differ markedly from symptoms assessed in common rating scales, and the empirical question about core depression symptoms is unresolved. Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes. Methods: We constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) in 3,463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS-30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms. Results: A network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e.g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e.g., anxiety) were among the most central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms. Limitations: Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions which may have affected symptom presentation. Conclusion: The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are of higher clinical relevance than non-DSM depression symptoms. The findings suggest the value of research focusing on especially central symptoms to increase the accuracy of predicting outcomes such as the course of illness, probability of relapse, and treatment response.

The association between latent depression subtypes and remission after treatment with citalopram: A latent class analysis with distal outcome,"Background: The objectives were to characterize latent depression subtypes by symptoms, evaluate sex differences in and examine correlates of these subtypes, and examine the association between subtype and symptom remission after citalopram treatment. Methods: Latent class analysis was applied to baseline data from 2772 participants in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial. Indicators were from the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Separate multinomial logistic models identified correlates of subtypes and the association between subtype and the distal outcome of remission. Results: Four latent subtypes were identified: Mild (men: 37%, women: 27%), Moderate (men: 24%, women: 21%), Severe with Increased Appetite (men: 13%, women: 22%), and Severe with Insomnia (men: 26%, women: 31%). Generalized anxiety disorder, bulimia, and social phobia were correlated with Severe with Increased Appetite and generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social phobia with Severe with Insomnia. Relative to those with the Mild subtype, those with Severe with Increased Appetite (odds ratiomen (OR): 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25–0.92; OR women : 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.86) and those with Severe Depression with Insomnia (OR men : 0.65; 95% CI: 0.41–1.02; OR women : 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32–0.64) were less likely to achieve remission. Limitations: The sample size limited exploration of higher order interactions. Conclusions: Insomnia and increased appetite distinguished latent subtypes. Sex and psychiatric comorbidities differed between the subtypes. Remission was less likely for those with the severe depression subtypes. Sleep disturbances, appetite changes, and other mental disorders may play a role in the etiology and treatment of depression.

Association of human microRNAs miR-22 and miR-491 polymorphisms with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in a Korean population,"Background: The possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNA) in psychiatric disorders has been recently recognized. Several miRNA polymorphisms have been found to be associated with panic disorder (PD) in European populations. However, the association of miRNA polymorphisms on PD has not been reported in Asian populations. We evaluated the effect of miR-22 and miR-491 polymorphisms on susceptibility to PD in a Korean population. Methods: Genotyping for four polymorphic variants of the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) regions of miR-22 (rs8076112 and rs6502892) and miR-491 (rs4977831 and rs2039391) was performed using blood samples of 341 Korean patients with PD and 229 healthy control subjects. To evaluate PD phenotypes, the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R) were administered. Results: Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with PD: rs8076112 miR-22 and rs4977831 and miR-491 rs2039391. The rs8076112C/rs6502892C haplotypes of miR-22 and rs4977831G/rs2039391G and rs4977831A/rs2039391A haplotypes of miR-491 were significantly overrepresented in patients with PD than in healthy control subjects. In combination analysis, miR-22 rs8076112AC/rs6502892CC and rs8076112CC/rs6502892CC and miR-491 rs4977831AG/rs2039391AA were more frequent in patients with PD. Among the phenotype assessments, ASI-R scores were significantly associated with miR-22 rs6502892 in the subgroup with the agoraphobic phenotype. Limitations: The results should be considered preliminary due to the relatively small sample size and the selection of only four SNPs. Conclusions: This is the first report to show possible associations of miR-22 and miR-491 with genetic susceptibility to PD in a Korean population.

"American tertiary clinic-referred bipolar II disorder compared to bipolar I disorder: More severe in multiple ways, but less severe in a few other ways","Background: Prevalence and relative severity of bipolar II disorder (BDII) vs. bipolar I disorder (BDI) are controversial. Methods: Prevalence, demographics, and illness characteristics were compared among 260 BDII and 243 BDI outpatients referred to the Stanford University BD Clinic and assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder Affective Disorders Evaluation. Results: BDII vs. BDI outpatients had statistically similar prevalence (51.7% vs. 48.3%), and in multiple ways had more severe illness, having significantly more often: lifetime comorbid anxiety (70.8% vs. 58.4%) and personality (15.4% vs. 7.4%) disorders, first-degree relative with mood disorder (62.3% vs. 52.3%), at least 10 prior mood episodes (80.0% vs. 50.9%), current syndromal/subsyndromal depression (52.3% vs. 38.4%), current antidepressant use (47.3% vs. 31.3%), prior year rapid cycling (33.6% vs. 13.4%), childhood onset (26.2% vs. 16.0%), as well as earlier onset age (17.0 ± 8.6 vs. 18.9 ± 8.1 years), longer illness duration (19.0 ± 13.0 vs. 16.1 ± 13.0), and higher current Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Overall Severity (4.1 ± 1.4 vs. 3.7 ± 1.5). However, BDII vs. BDI patients significantly less often had prior psychosis (14.2% vs. 64.2%), psychiatric hospitalization (10.0% vs. 67.9%), and current prescription psychotropic use, (81.5% vs. 93.0%), and had a statistically similar rate of prior suicide attempt (29.5% vs. 32.1%). Limitations: American tertiary bipolar disorder clinic referral sample, cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Further studies are warranted to determine the extent to which BDII, compared to BDI, can be more severe in multiple ways but less severe in a few other ways, and contributors to occurrence of more severe forms of BDII.

Screening for bipolar disorders: Clinical utilization of the Mood Disorders Questionnaire on an inpatient mood disorders unit,"Background: The Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) is a widely used screening instrument for bipolar disorders. The MDQ has seldom been used in the inpatient setting, and we report a clinical, real-world inpatient validation. Methods: Between April 2011 and August 2013, patients admitted to the inpatient Mood Disorders Unit completed an MDQ as part of their admission process. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar disorders were included. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each number of questionnaire items checked positive, as well as the symptoms clustered around the same time and with moderate impairment in functioning. Results: A total of 1330 patient MDQ’s were identified, and after excluding incomplete MDQ’s and non-unipolar or bipolar diagnoses (e.g. anxiety, adjustment, or schizoaffective diagnoses), 860 MDQ’s remained. One hundred fifty four patients (18%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and 706 (82%) with unipolar depressive disorder. The average length of stay was 7.6 days. The optimal cutoff score was 8, resulting in a sensitivity/specificity of 86%/71%, compared to 92%/64% with a cutoff of 7. Limitations: Retrospective study using clinical diagnoses instead of research instrument diagnoses. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the MDQ in an inpatient mood disorders setting was higher than an outpatient psychiatric population, but the specificity was lower. A cutoff of 8 instead of the recommended outpatient cutoff of 7 was optimal. In today's busy clinical practices, a screening instrument for bipolar disorder is still useful, and the MDQ can be effectively utilized on an inpatient psychiatry mood disorders unit.

Maternal response to child affect: Role of maternal depression and relationship quality,"Background: Maternal depression is associated with negative outcomes for offspring, including increased incidence of child psychopathology. Quality of mother–child relationships can be compromised among affectively ill dyads, such as those characterized by maternal depression and child psychopathology, and negatively impact outcomes bidirectionally. Little is known about the neural mechanisms that may modulate depressed mothers' responses to their psychiatrically ill children during middle childhood and adolescence, partially because of a need for ecologically valid personally relevant fMRI tasks that might most effectively elicit these neural mechanisms. Methods: The current project evaluated maternal response to child positive and negative affective video clips in 19 depressed mothers with psychiatrically ill offspring using a novel fMRI task. Results: The task elicited activation in the ventral striatum when mothers viewed positive clips and insula when mothers viewed negative clips of their own (versus unfamiliar) children. Both types of clips elicited activation in regions associated with affect regulation and self-related and social processing. Greater lifetime number of depressive episodes, comorbid anxiety, and poor mother–child relationship quality all emerged as predictors of maternal response to child affect. Limitations: Findings may be specific to dyads with psychiatrically ill children. Conclusions: Altered neural response to child affect may be an important characteristic of chronic maternal depression and may impact mother–child relationships negatively. Existing interventions for depression may be improved by helping mothers respond to their children's affect more adaptively.

Depression and hypomania symptoms are associated with high dose corticosteroids treatment for MS relapses,"Background: Psychiatric side effects are known to occur with low dose corticosteroids. Standard of care for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapses is high dose corticosteroids (HDC), at least 1g/day for 3–5 days, and yet the relationship between this treatment and mood is not known. We sought to determine the frequency and potential predictors of (hypo)manic and depressive symptoms with HDC treatment for MS relapses. Methods: Consecutive MS subjects requiring HDC treatment were identified. The Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDIFS) were administered for (hypo)manic and depressive symptoms, respectively, prior to HDC, 3 days and one month post-HDC. Results: Eighty eight subjects completed the study. At relapse diagnosis, the mean BDIFS score was 4.2 (SD 3.1); the mean number of (hypo)manic symptoms endorsed on the MDQ was 4.3 (SD 3.5). Three days after completing HDC, 22.5% had an increase on the BDIFS and 38.2% endorsed more symptoms on the MDQ. A history of depression ( p = 0.006) and low reported quality of life ( p = 0.029) predicted an increase on the MDQ; the odds of an increase in (hypo)manic symptoms was 5.6 times higher with a history of any psychiatric disease/substance abuse ( p = 0.005). No predictors for worsening on the BDIFS were found. Limitations: Self-reported measures were used, anxiety was not evaluated and 17 subjects were lost to follow up. Conclusion: Depressive and hypo(manic) symptoms are commonly associated with HDC for MS relapses. It is important for clinicians and MS patients to be aware of this risk.

Intranetwork and internetwork functional connectivity alterations in post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: A large number of previous neuroimaging studies have explored the functional alterations of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, abnormalities in the functional architecture of resting-state networks in PTSD were rarely elucidated. Methods: This study used independent component analysis to explore the resting-state intranetwork and internetwork functional connectivity differences between 20 PTSD patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs). Results: Selective alterations of intranetwork and internetwork intrinsic functional connectivities were found in the PTSD patients. Compared with HCs, the PTSD patients exhibited significantly decreased network connectivity within the anterior default mode network, posterior default mode network (pDMN), salience network (SN), sensory-motor network, and auditory network. Furthermore, the PTSD patients exhibited increased internetwork connectivity between SN and pDMN. Limitations: This study lacked recruitment of trauma-exposed HCs, which limits our ability to determine whether the alterations are caused by PTSD or trauma exposure. Conclusion: The findings suggested that the PTSD patients exhibited abnormal functional connectivity at the brain network level. Notably, the enhanced internetwork connectivity between SN and pDMN in the PTSD patients may be associated with hyperarousal and heightened anxiety in PTSD.

Decreased platelet 5-hydroxytryptamin (5-HT) levels: a response to antidepressants,"Background: Platelet 5-hydroxytryptamin (serotonin, 5-HT) has been examined for its use as a peripheral biomarker for depression or other mental disorders; however, it remains unclear whether blood 5-HT levels can reflect the brain's levels of serotonin. Methods: Platelet 5-HT levels in 45 drug-naïve, 32 citalopram-treated patients with major depression and 32 healthy control were assayed, Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were assessed. We then measured 5-HT in platelet, in platelet-poor plasma and in the nuclei of brain tissues obtained from chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats with or without citalopram treatment, and from the controls rats that were treated with vehicle. Toward this end, we analyzed whether correlations exist between platelet and brain. Results: No differences were observed among drug-naïve patients, citalopram-treated patients and health control according to gender and age ( p &gt; 0.05). Drug-naïve depressed patients had highest scores in HAMD and HAMA among the three groups ( F = 223.3, p &lt; 0.01; F = 70.7, p &lt; 0.01, respectively) Citalopram-treated patients had significantly lower platelet 5-HT levels,compared to control subjects (Mean 58.1 ± 36.8 ng/10⁹ versus 558.0 ± 199.4 ng/10⁹, p &lt; 0.01) and compared to drug-naïve patients (Mean 58.1 ± 36.8 ng/10⁹ versus 646.4 ± 259.0 ng/10⁹, p &lt; 0.01), while drug-naïve patients had similar 5-HT platelet concentrations as controls( p &gt; 0.05). Consistent with clinical results, in comparison with control (1473.4 ± 391.0 ng/10⁹) and drug-naive CUMS rats (1559.0 ± 424.4 ng/10⁹), the citalopram-treated CUMS rats (684.2 ± 335.6 ng/10⁹) demonstrated a significant reduction in platelet 5-HT levels ( p &lt; 0.01), but there were no difference among the three groups in platelet-poor plasma 5-HT( F = 0.11, p &gt; 0.05). Hippocampal 5-HT levels were higher among CUMS rats treated with saline (98.2 ± 59.0 ng/g) than vehicle animals (31.9 ± 18.3 ng/g, p &lt; 0.01) or citalopram-treated rats (42.1 ± 33.9 ng/g, p &lt; 0.05); however, 5-HT concentrations in prefrontal cortex and Raphe Nuclei were consistent among citalopram-treated or saline-treated CUMS rats( p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of platelet 5-HT did not correlate with neuronal 5-HT levels ( p &gt; 0.05). Limitations: Dosages was fix for citalopram-treat rats, and the citalopram-treated vehicle arm did not set up. Conclusions: Our study suggests that platelet 5-HT levels might respond to SSRI treatment, but this peripheral index is not a direct reflector of central 5-HT levels.

Correlates of benzodiazepine use in major depressive disorder: The effect of anhedonia,"Background: Current treatment guidelines emphasize the limited role of benzodiazepines in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), mainly due to the absence of long-term data, risk of abuse and potential adverse effects. However, benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed for long-term use in a significant number of patients. This study sought to evaluate benzodiazepine use in a large sample of MDD patients seen at a tertiary care clinic, and determine whether use is related to illness severity or complexity, as well as to identify the clinical predictors of benzodiazepine use. Methods: This was a naturalistic cross-sectional study conducted in MDD patients seen at the Mood Disorders Pyschopharmacology Unit at the University Health Network ( N = 326). Detailed information on current medication regimens was collected. A structured diagnostic interview, in addition to measures of symptom severity, quality of life, and personality were administered. Participants were grouped according to the presence or absence of prescribed benzodiazepines for daily use. Results: The prevalence of regular benzodiazepine use was 25%. Benzodiazepine users were more likely to be female, unemployed, have a history of child abuse, and have comorbid panic disorder. Depression and anxiety scores were not significantly different between groups, although anhedonia was greater in the benzodiazepine group. A logistic regression revealed anhedonia was the strongest predictor of regular benzodiazepine use. Conclusion: The groups were similar in clinical profile suggesting benzodiazepine use is not necessarily linked to greater illness complexity or severity. Benzodiazepine use appears to be associated with specific diagnostic and symptom characteristics, possibly providing insight into the potential pharmacodynamic and neurobiological effects of frequent use.

Screening for depression in pregnant women from Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana: Psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9,"Background: Major depression in antepartum women is a considerable health problem. This article aims at exploring the psychometric properties of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in West African pregnant women. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, the PHQ-9 was administered to n = 639 Ivorian and n = 389 Ghanaian women in their last trimester of pregnancy (gestational age range: 28–40 weeks) in 2010–11. Statistical analysis applied methods from both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Results: Internal consistency was Cronbach's α = .65 in Côte d'Ivoire and α = .68 in Ghana. Investigation of factorial validity by confirmatory factor analyses showed that unidimensionality of the PHQ-9 was sufficient. Rasch analyses resulted in excellent item infit and outfit measures. Yet, unidimensionality was questionable in residual principal component analyses. IRT analyses suggested that the response categories were not utilized as intended. Analysis of differential item functioning revealed interviewer-related item bias for several items in both samples. Item-person-fit was not ideal because the PHQ-9 items showed a low discriminability in the region of the latent trait where the majority of the women from the general population were located. Convergent validity was demonstrated by correlations between the PHQ-9 and two measures assessing anxiety and perceived disability. Limitations: Both samples were quite homogenous regarding residence in urban areas and gestational age. Conclusions: In our samples of African pregnant women, depression measured with the PHQ-9 does not appear as an entirely homogenous construct. However, the use of the sum score of the PHQ-9 is appropriate for depression screening purposes.

Child behavior checklist dysregulation profile in children with disruptive behavior disorders: A longitudinal study,"Background: A Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) profile defined as Dysregulation Profile (DP) (scores 2 standard deviations or more in anxiety/depression, aggression, attention subscales) has been correlated to poor emotional and behavioral self-regulation. The clinical meaning and the prognostic implications of CBCL-DP are still debated, although it seems associated with severe psychopathology and poor adjustment. Method: In the present study, we used the CBCL-DP score to examine the adolescent outcomes (psychiatric diagnosis, substance use, psychiatric hospitalization) in 80 referred children with disruptive behavior disorders—DBD- (Oppositional Defiant Disorder or conduct disorder), aged 8–9 years, 72 males (90%) and 8 females (10%), followed-up until the age of 14–15 years. Results: Children with higher score on the CBCL-DP profile were at increased risk for presenting ADHD and mood disorders in adolescence. While ADHD in adolescence was predicted also by an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, CBCL-DP score was the only significant predictor of a mood disorder at 14–15 years. On the contrary, CBCL-DP score was not associated with a higher risk of conduct disorder, substance use and hospitalizations in adolescence. A cost-effective and reliable diagnostic measure such as the CBCL may be a part of the diagnostic procedure aimed to capture these at-risk children, to monitor their natural history up to adolescence, and to prevent the risk of a full-blown mood disorder. Limitations: The small sample size and a selection bias of severe patients with DBD limit the generalization of the findings.

Core belief content examined in a large sample of patients using online cognitive behaviour therapy,"Background: Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy provides a unique opportunity to collect and analyse data regarding the idiosyncratic content of people’s core beliefs about the self, others and the world. Methods: ‘Beating the Blues' users recorded a core belief derived through the downward arrow technique. Core beliefs from 1813 mental health patients were coded into 10 categories. Results: The most common were global self-evaluation, attachment, and competence. Women were more likely, and men were less likely (than chance), to provide an attachment-related core belief; and men were more likely, and women less likely, to provide a self-competence-related core belief. This may be linked to gender differences in sources of self-esteem. Those who were suffering from anxiety were more likely to provide power- and control-themed core beliefs and less likely to provide attachment core beliefs than chance. Finally, those who had thoughts of suicide in the preceding week reported less competence themed core beliefs and more global self-evaluation (e.g., ‘I am useless’) core beliefs than chance. Limitations: Concurrent symptom level was not available. The sample was not nationally representative, and featured programme completers only. Conclusions: Men and women may focus on different core beliefs in the context of CBT. Those suffering anxiety may need a therapeutic focus on power and control. A complete rejection of the self (not just within one domain, such as competence) may be linked to thoughts of suicide. Future research should examine how individual differences and symptom severity influence core beliefs.

The Chinese Version of the Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS): Mokken scaling,"Objective: Invariant item ordering (IIO) is defined as the extent to which items have the same order for each respondent who completes a scale. IIO is crucial for establishing a scale hierarchy that is replicable across samples; however, no research has demonstrated IIO in the Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS). The aim of this study was to determine if an IIO hierarchy of depressive symptoms existed in a clinical sample of men who completed the GMDS. Methods: A convenience sample of 231 men (age: mean (SD) = 46.1 (11.0) yrs) who visited a men's health polyclinic in Taiwan and completed the GMDS. Mokken scale analysis was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the GMDS. Results: All items on the GMDS formed a strong uni-dimensional scale ( H = 0.592). Except for item #9 (alcohol/drug abuse, or hyperactivity), IIO was found for the remaining 12 items ( H T = 0.366). These symptoms reflected the following hierarchy: positive family history (#13), complaining (#12), anxiety (#8), loss of vitality (#10), depressed mood (#11), indecisiveness (#6), aggression (#2), irritability (#5), stress (#1), burn-out (#3), fatigue (#4), and sleep problems (#7). Conclusion: The GMDS is a psychometrically sound measure of depressive symptoms in Taiwanese male outpatients. The GMDS has both cumulative and hierarchical properties.

"Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of severe insomnia in psychotropic drug-free, Asian outpatients with major depressive disorder","Background: Little has been known regarding the correlates of severe insomnia in major depressive disorder (MDD). This post-hoc analysis aimed to examine the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of severe insomnia in psychotropic drug-free, Asian adult outpatients with MDD. Methods: Participants were psychotropic drug-free patients with MDD, aged 18–65 years. By using the Symptom Checklist-90 Items, Revised (SCL-90-R), a score of 4 (severe distress) on any one of three insomnia items was defined as severe insomnia. Other measures included the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the nine psychopathology subscales of SCL-90-R, the Physical and Mental Component Summaries of Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 PCS and SF-36 MCS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results: Of 528 participants, their mean age being 39.5 (SD = 13.26) years, 64.2% were females, and 239 (45.3%) had severe insomnia. The logistic regression model revealed that low educational qualifications (less than secondary school completion), high SCL-90-R Depression scores, high SCL-90-R Anxiety scores, and low SF-36 PCS scores were independently correlated with severe insomnia ( p 's &lt; .05). Limitations: Insomnia was determined only by the patient's distress. Middle insomnia was not assessed. Psychotropic drug-free patients with MDD are not commonly seen in psychiatric practice. Conclusion: Severe insomnia is common in patients with MDD. It is closely related with low educational qualification, subjective depression and anxiety severity, and poor physical health. These findings may implicate the treatment of comorbid MDD and severe insomnia, for example, sleep hygiene education, pharmacological treatment.

Identifying differences between depressed adolescent suicide ideators and attempters,"Background: Adolescent depression and suicide are pressing public health concerns, and identifying key differences among suicide ideators and attempters is critical. The goal of the current study is to test whether depressed adolescent suicide attempters report greater anhedonia severity and exhibit aberrant effort–cost computations in the face of uncertainty. Methods: Depressed adolescents ( n = 101) ages 13–19 years were administered structured clinical interviews to assess current mental health disorders and a history of suicidality (suicide ideators = 55, suicide attempters = 46). Then, participants completed self-report instruments assessing symptoms of suicidal ideation, depression, anhedonia, and anxiety as well as a computerized effort–cost computation task. Results: Compared with depressed adolescent suicide ideators, attempters report greater anhedonia severity, even after concurrently controlling for symptoms of suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, when completing the effort–cost computation task, suicide attempters are less likely to pursue the difficult, high value option when outcomes are uncertain. Follow-up, trial-level analyses of effort–cost computations suggest that receipt of reward does not influence future decision-making among suicide attempters, however, suicide ideators exhibit a win–stay approach when receiving rewards on previous trials. Limitations: Findings should be considered in light of limitations including a modest sample size, which limits generalizability, and the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Depressed adolescent suicide attempters are characterized by greater anhedonia severity, which may impair the ability to integrate previous rewarding experiences to inform future decisions. Taken together, this may generate a feeling of powerlessness that contributes to increased suicidality and a needless loss of life.

The prevalence and predictors of comorbid bipolar disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Although some authors have recently investigated the co-occurrence of anxiety and bipolar disorders, the topic remains insufficiently studied. Defining the prevalence and predictors of BD–OCD comorbidity has important nosological, clinical and therapeutic implications. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the prevalence and predictors of comorbid BD–OCD. Relevant papers published through March 30th, 2015 were identified searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Results: 46 articles met inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of OCD in BD was 17.0% (95% CI 12.7–22.4%), which was comparable to the results reported by the pooled prevalence of BD in OCD (18.35%, 95% CI 13.2–24.8%). With regard to OCD–BD predictors, a higher mean age predicted a lower prevalence of OCD in BD patients. Sub group meta-analyses reported higher OCD prevalence rates in BD children and adolescents (24.2%, compared to 13.5% in adults), in BD-I patients (24.6%, compared to 13.6% in mixed BD patients), and among population-based studies (22.2%, compared to 13.2% in hospital-based studies). Limitations: Most studies use retrospective assessment scales with low sensitivity in discriminating true ego-dystonic obsessions from depressive ruminations that may bias results towards an overestimation of obsessive symptom prevalence. Conclusions: This first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and predictors of comorbid BD–OCD confirms that BD–OCD comorbidity is a common condition in psychiatry with children and adolescents and BD-I patients as the most affected subgroups.

"Fear extinction memory performance in a sample of stable, euthymic patients with bipolar disorder","Objectives: Affective dysregulation is a core feature of bipolar disorder (BD). Abnormalities in neural circuits underlying affect regulation have been observed in BD, specifically in the structure and function of the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Fear extinction is an automatic affect regulatory process relying on neural circuits that are abnormal in BD. Thus, fear extinction might be useful in probing automatic affect regulation deficits in BD. We tested the hypothesis that BD is associated with reduced ability to extinguish fear responses. Methods: We examined fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction memory recall in a sample of stable, euthymic participants with BD ( n = 19) vs. healthy comparison participants ( n = 32). A limited number of subjects (BD: n = 12; healthy comparison: n = 11) underwent structural MRI scanning to examine cortical size associations with extinction recall. Results: Both healthy comparison and BD participants were successful in acquiring a fear response, but BD participants responded with greater startle to both threat and safety cues. Both groups showed significant extinction. The BD group showed superior extinction recall. Extinction recall was associated with right rostral middle frontal cortex thickness across groups, whereas right OFC surface area was associated with recall only in healthy comparisons. Limitations: Limitations include use of a stable, highly screened sample and a relatively small number of participants available for MRI analysis. Conclusions: Increased fear reactivity may be related to a “trait” disruption in BD patients similar to that previously described in anxiety disorders. This task may be useful for probing automatic affect regulatory processes in BD, and understanding treatment response.

Psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire–Trauma Specific (AAQ-TS): A study with Portuguese Colonial War Veterans,"Background: The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Trauma Specific (AAQ-TS) is a self-report measure designed to assess-trauma-related psychological (in)flexibility, as conceptualized in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. However, there are no studies to date regarding its psychometric properties. This study explores such properties in the Portuguese version of the AAQ-TS, in Portuguese Colonial War Veterans. Method: A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted in a sample from the general population of war Veterans ( N = 371). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) as well as reliability and convergent validity studies were performed in a different sample from the same population ( N = 312). For the discriminant validity a clinical sample with a war-related PTSD ( N = 42) and a non-clinical sample without PTSD ( N = 44) were used. Results: The CFA suggested a re-specified 15-item model with good global adjustment and factorial validity. The AAQ-TS showed internal consistency, a good temporal reliability, convergent validity with psychopathological symptoms (related to PTSD, anxiety, depression and stress) and peritraumatic dissociation (altered awareness and depersonalization/derealization). The questionnaire also discriminates between war Veterans with and without a PTSD diagnosis. Limitations: The major limitation relates to the samples' characteristics and sampling methods, which can limit the generalization of results. Conclusion: The Portuguese version of the AAQ-TS is a reliable and valid measure to assess experiential avoidance related to trauma in Portuguese Colonial War Veterans.

PTSD after childbirth: A predictive ethological model for symptom development,"Background: Childbirth can be a traumatic experience occasionally leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to assess childbirth-related PTSD risk-factors using an etiological model inspired by the transactional model of stress and coping. Methods: 348 out of 505 (70%) Dutch women completed questionnaires during pregnancy, one week postpartum, and three months postpartum. A further 284 (56%) also completed questionnaires ten months postpartum. The model was tested using path analysis. Results: Antenatal depressive symptoms (β = .15, p &lt; .05), state anxiety (β = .17, p &lt; .01), and perinatal psychoform (β = .17, p &lt; .01) and somatoform (β = .17, p &lt; .01) dissociation were identified as PTSD symptom risk factors three months postpartum. Antenatal depressive symptoms (β = .31, p &lt; .001) and perinatal somatoform dissociation (β = .14, p &lt; .05) predicted symptoms ten months postpartum. Limitations: Almost a third of our sample was lost at three months postpartum, and 44% at ten months. The sample size was relatively small. The present study did not control for prior PTSD. The PTSD A criterion was not considered an exclusion criteria for model testing, and the fit index of the ten months model was just below suggested cut-off values. Conclusions: Screening for high risk pregnant women should focus on antenatal depression, anxiety and dissociative tendencies. Hospital staff and midwives are advised to be vigilant for perinatal dissociation after intense negative emotions. To help regulate perinatal negative emotional responses, hospital staff and midwifes are recommended to provide information about birth procedures and be attentive to women's birth-related needs.

Corrigendum to: “Intensive short-term dynamic residential treatment program for patients with treatment-resistant disorders”,"Reports an error in ""Intensive short-term dynamic residential treatment program for patients with treatment-resistant disorders"" by Ole André Solbakken and Allan Abbass ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2015[Aug][1], Vol 181, 67-77). The authors regret that one of the institutional affiliations of the first author was omitted in the published paper. The affiliation that also should be credited is Drammen District Psychiatric Centre, Division for Mental Health and Addiction, Vestre Viken Health Trust, Norway. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-23341-010). Background: The study investigated the effectiveness of an Intensive Short-Term Dynamic (ISTDP) residential treatment program for patients with treatment resistant anxiety- and/or depressive disorders, with and without comorbid personality disorders. Method: A non-randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an eight week intensive residential treatment program based on principles from ISTDP. Patients ( N = 60), who had repeated prior treatment failure for current mental disorder, sufficient dysfunction to warrant hospitalization, and evidencing capacity to take an intrapsychic perspective on own problems, were included. Outcome variables included measures of target complaints (depression/anxiety, social role dysfunction, and interpersonal distress), general symptom distress, and interpersonal functioning. Measures were administered throughout and after treatment. Change was assessed by multilevel growth curve modeling. Changes during and after treatment were compared to those reported by a sub-sample of wait-list controls taking treatment as usual ( N = 30). Results: The treatment group evidenced significant improvements on all measures. By contrast, receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list did not yield significant changes. Effect sizes in the treatment group were consistently large at both termination and follow-up. Fourteen months after treatment 50.0% of patients had recovered in terms of target complaints. Approximately 53.3% and 48.3%, respectively, had recovered in terms of general symptom distress and interpersonal functioning. Limitations: Limitations included a relatively small sample size, inability to discern the effectiveness of separate components of the treatment program, and lack of randomization of patients to wait-list and treatment. Conclusion: ISTDP-based residential treatment with an eight-week time-limit appears to be effective for alleviating common and severe, treatment resistant mental disorders. The treatment program was superior to receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list. Participation in the program quickly reduced target complaints, symptoms and interpersonal problems for patients who, based on previous treatment experiences, were expected to fare poorly in treatment. Gains were consistently maintained or improved further at follow-up. Results are promising for patients with chronic debilitating problems who often do not profit from traditional psychiatric treatment.

Separating depressive comorbidity from panic disorder: A combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning approach,"Background: Depression is frequent in panic disorder (PD); yet, little is known about its influence on the neural substrates of PD. Difficulties in fear inhibition during safety signal processing have been reported as a pathophysiological feature of PD that is attenuated by depression. We investigated the impact of comorbid depression in PD with agoraphobia (AG) on the neural correlates of fear conditioning and the potential of machine learning to predict comorbidity status on the individual patient level based on neural characteristics. Methods: Fifty-nine PD/AG patients including 26 (44%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG + DEP) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Comorbidity status was predicted using a random undersampling tree ensemble in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Results: PD/AG−DEP patients showed altered neural activation during safety signal processing, while +DEP patients exhibited generally decreased dorsolateral prefrontal and insular activation. Comorbidity status was correctly predicted in 79% of patients (sensitivity: 73%; specificity: 85%) based on brain activation during fear conditioning (corrected for potential confounders: accuracy: 73%; sensitivity: 77%; specificity: 70%). Limitations: No primary depressed patients were available; only medication-free patients were included. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed (power considerations). Conclusions: Neurofunctional activation during safety signal processing differed between patients with or without comorbid depression, a finding which may explain heterogeneous results across previous studies. These findings demonstrate the relevance of comorbidity when investigating neurofunctional substrates of anxiety disorders. Predicting individual comorbidity status may translate neurofunctional data into clinically relevant information which might aid in planning individualized treatment.

Distinguishing between emotional distress and psychiatric disorder in primary care attenders: A cross sectional study of the four-dimensional symptom questionnaire (4DSQ),"Background: Detection of psychiatric disorder in primary care is a complex issue. Distinctions between ‘normal’ emotional distress and psychiatric disorder depend on how disorder is conceptualized. Our aim was to explore two different conceptualizations by examining patients' scores on one-dimensional depression measures and scores on the Four Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ), a measure that uniquely has separate dimensions for general distress and depressive disorder. Methods: This was a cross sectional study of 487 primary care patients attending general clinics in Hampshire, UK. Patients completed the 4DSQ, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) whilst in the waiting room. Results: The 4DSQ classified 26% (126/485) of patients as having heightened distress levels and 8% (38/468) as possible cases of depressive disorder. Casesness was consistently higher across the one-dimensional measures (PHQ-9: 16%, GHQ-12: 28%, HADS-D: 13%). Of those patients deemed possible cases by the PHQ-9 (≥ 10), the 4DSQ classified 91% (71/78) as having heightened distress and 44% (32/72) as possible cases of depressive disorder. Limitations: The sample was predominately older and white, which may limit generalizability of the findings to more diverse patient groups. There are limits to self-report measures in the assessment of complex diagnostic issues. Conclusions: Inclusion of a distinct general distress dimension alongside a dimension focusing on specific depression symptomatology lowered the number of primary care patients classified as possible cases of disorder. This view of symptoms may have implications for the targeting of existing treatments, and may be useful in guiding the development of novel self-management interventions.

Anhedonia in melancholic and non-melancholic depressive disorders,"Background: Anhedonia represents a core symptom of major depression and may be a potential marker for melancholia. However, current understanding of this construct in depressive sub-types is limited. Method: Participants were recruited from the Black Dog Institute (Sydney) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston). Diagnostic groups were derived on the basis of agreement between clinician and DSM-IV diagnosis from structured interviews. Currently depressed unipolar melancholic, non-melancholic and healthy control participants were administered a probabilistic reward task (PRT) to assess a behavioural correlate of anhedonia-blunted reward-based learning. Self-reported measures of anhedonia, approach and avoidance motivation were completed by the Sydney sample. Results: Relative to healthy controls and non-melancholic participants, melancholic depressed participants had reduced response bias, highlighting blunted reward learning. Moreover, although non-melancholic participants were characterized by a delayed response bias, melancholic depressed participants failed to develop a bias throughout blocks. Response bias showed no associations with self-report measures of hedonic tone in depressed participants. Positive associations were observed between response bias, approach and avoidance motivation in non-melancholic participants only. Limitations: Possible medication, fatigue and anxiety effects were not controlled; small sample sizes; inclusion criteria may have excluded those with severe melancholia and led to underestimation of group differences. Conclusions: Melancholia is characterised by a reduced ability to modulate behaviour as a function of reward, and the motivational salience of rewarding stimuli may differ across depressive sub-types. Results support the view that melancholia is a distinct sub-type. Further exploration of reward system functioning in depressive sub-types is warranted.

Adherence to medication is associated with non-planning impulsivity in euthymic bipolar disorder patients,"Background: Adherence to medication is a major issue in bipolar disorder. Non-planning impulsivity, defined as a lack of future orientation, has been demonstrated to be the main impulsivity domain altered during euthymia in bipolar disorder patients. It was associated with comorbidities. Methods: To investigate relationship between adherence to medication and non-planning impulsivity, we included 260 euthymic bipolar patients. Adherence to medication was evaluated by Medication Adherence Rating Scale and non-planning impulsivity by Barrat Impulsiveness Scale. Univariate analyses and linear regression were used. We conducted also a path analysis to examine whether non-planning impulsivity had direct or indirect effect on adherence, mediated by comorbidities. Results: Adherence to medication was correlated with non-planning impulsivity, even after controlling for potential confounding factors in linear regression analysis (Beta standardized coefficient = 0.156; p = 0.015). Path analysis demonstrated only a direct effect of non-planning impulsivity on adherence to medication, and none indirect effect via substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. Limitations: Our study is limited by its cross-sectional design and adherence to medication was assessed only by self-questionnaire. Conclusions: Higher non-planning impulsivity is associated with low medication adherence, without an indirect effect via comorbidities.

Suicides following inpatient psychiatric hospitalization: A nationwide case control study,"Background: Research shows the elevated risk of suicide associated with current or recent inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. However, it is unclear whether this applies in the area of post-communist Central and Eastern Europe where mental health care has not been deinstitutionalized yet. The present study aims to examine the rates of suicides among psychiatric patients during and shortly after discharge from inpatient hospitalization in the Czech Republic. Methods: All inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and all suicides committed between 2008 and 2012 have been merged on an individual data basis. The time horizon between the admission and two months after the discharge from inpatient psychiatric facility was utilized and multiple logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds of committing suicide. Results: A total of 137,290 inpatients were hospitalized in Czech psychiatric facilities between 2008 and 2012, and 402 of the inpatients committed suicide during the hospitalization or within the 2 months after the discharge. Highly elevated risks of suicides were found to be associated with being a male, having a history of multiple hospitalizations, and having a diagnosis of affective, anxiety, or personality disorder. Limitations: Limitations are related to the design of the study, and its reliance on routinely collected data. Also, it was not possible to assess the odds of suicide associated with inpatient psychiatric hospitalization against the odds of suicide in general population. Conclusions: During psychiatric treatment and recovery, suicial behavior and idealiation is increased. In psychiatry, hospitalization may be a risky period for suicide behavior. Suicide rates during and soon after the psychiatric hospitalization identified in this study from Central and Eastern Europe are similar to the findings from Western Europe. Preventive strategies should be tailored accordingly.

Cyclothymia reloaded: A reappraisal of the most misconceived affective disorder,"Data emerging from both academic centers and from public and private outpatient facilities indicate that from 20% to 50% of all subjects that seek help for mood, anxiety, impulsive and addictive disorders turn out, after careful screening, to be affected by cyclothymia. The proportion of patients who can be classified as cyclothymic rises significantly if the diagnostic rules proposed by the DSM-5 are reconsidered and a broader approach is adopted. Unlike the DSM-5 definition based on the recurrence of low-grade hypomanic and depressive symptoms, cyclothymia is best identified as an exaggeration of cyclothymic temperament (basic mood and emotional instability) with early onset and extreme mood reactivity linked with interpersonal and separation sensitivity, frequent mixed features during depressive states, the dark side of hypomanic symptoms, multiple comorbidities, and a high risk of impulsive and suicidal behavior. Epidemiological and clinical research have shown the high prevalence of cyclothymia and the validity of the concept that it should be seen as a distinct form of bipolarity, not simply as a softer form. Misdiagnosis and consequent mistreatment are associated with a high risk of transforming cyclothymia into severe complex borderline-like bipolarity, especially with chronic and repetitive exposure to antidepressants and sedatives. The early detection and treatment of cyclothymia can guarantee a significant change in the long-term prognosis, when appropriate mood-stabilizing pharmacotherapy and specific psychological approaches and psychoeducation are adopted. The authors present and discuss clinical research in the field and their own expertise in the understanding and medical management of cyclothymia and its complex comorbidities.

Examination of the relations between obsessive–compulsive symptom dimensions and fear and distress disorder symptoms,"Background: Whereas prior work has established fear and distress clusters underlying unipolar mood and anxiety disorders, the optimal placement of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) within this model is unclear. One likely contributor to this ambiguity is the heterogeneous nature of OCD. There is increasing evidence for distinct symptom dimensions that are more homogenous than the broad OCD phenotype. Using structural equation modeling, the current study examined the relations between various OCD symptom dimensions and symptoms associated with fear/distress disorders. Methods: Participants included 526 individuals recruited from an online crowdsourcing marketplace. Results: Results revealed that the symmetry obsessions/arranging compulsions, harm obsessions/checking compulsions, and unacceptable thoughts/neutralizing compulsions were related to both fear and distress disorder symptoms, whereas the contamination obsessions/washing compulsions dimension of OCD was specifically related to fear disorder symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include the use of self-report questionnaires to measure all constructs of interest. Conclusions: These findings add to a growing body of literature attesting to the multidimensional nature of OCD and progress our understanding of the etiological underpinnings of this severe and debilitating condition.

Prospective progression from high-prevalence disorders to bipolar disorder: Exploring characteristics of pre-illness stages,"Background: Identification of risk factors within precursor syndromes, such as depression, anxiety or substance use disorders (SUD), might help to pinpoint high-risk stages where preventive interventions for Bipolar Disorder (BD) could be evaluated. Methods: We examined baseline demographic, clinical, quality of life, and temperament measures along with risk clusters among 52 young people seeking help for depression, anxiety or SUDs without psychosis or BD. The risk clusters included Bipolar At-Risk (BAR) and the Bipolarity Index as measures of bipolarity and the Ultra-High Risk assessment for psychosis. The participants were followed up for 12 months to identify conversion to BD. Those who converted and did not convert to BD were compared using Chi-Square and Mann Whitney U tests. Results: The sample was predominantly female (85%) and a majority had prior treatment (64%). Four participants converted to BD over the 1-year follow up period. Having an alcohol use disorder at baseline (75% vs 8%, χ² = 14.1, p &lt; 0.001) or a family history of SUD (67% vs 12.5%, χ² = 6.0, p = 0.01) were associated with development of BD. The sub-threshold mania subgroup of BAR criteria was also associated with 12-month BD outcomes. The severity of depressive symptoms and cannabis use had high effects sizes of association with BD outcomes, without statistical significance. Conclusions and limitations: The small number of conversions limited the power of the study to identify associations with risk factors that have previously been reported to predict BD. However, subthreshold affective symptoms and SUDs might predict the onset of BD among help-seeking young people with high-prevalence disorders.

"Cognitive reactivity, self-depressed associations, and the recurrence of depression","Background: Mixed evidence exists regarding the role of cognitive reactivity (CR; cognitive responsivity to a negative mood) as a risk factor for recurrences of depression. One explanation for the mixed evidence may lie in the number of previous depressive episodes. Heightened CR may be especially relevant as a risk factor for the development of multiple depressive episodes and less so for a single depressive episode. In addition, it is theoretically plausible but not yet tested that the relationship between CR and number of episodes is moderated by the strength of automatic depression-related self-associations. Aim: To investigate (i) the strength of CR in remitted depressed individuals with a history of a single vs. multiple episodes, and (ii) the potentially moderating role of automatic negative self-associations in the relationship between the number of episodes and CR. Method: Cross-sectional analysis of data obtained in a cohort study (Study 1) and during baseline assessments in two clinical trials (Study 2). Study 1 used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and compared never-depressed participants (n = 901) with remitted participants with either a single (n = 336) or at least 2 previous episodes ( n = 273). Study 2 included only remitted participants with at least two previous episodes ( n = 273). The Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity Revised (LEIDS-R) was used to index CR and an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit self-associations. Results: In Study 1, remitted depressed participants with multiple episodes had significantly higher CR than those with a single or no previous episode. The remitted individuals with multiple episodes of Study 2 had even higher CR scores than those of Study 1. Within the group of individuals with multiple episodes, CR was not heightened as a function of the number of episodes, even if individual differences in automatic negative self-associations were taken into account. Limitations: The study employed a cross-sectional design, which precludes a firm conclusion with regard to the direction of this relationship. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with the view that high CR puts people at risk for recurrent depression and is less relevant for the development of an incidental depressive episode. This suggests that CR is an important target for interventions that aim to prevent the recurrence of depression.

Guidelines concordance of maintenance treatment in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder: Data from the national bipolar mania pathway survey (BIPAS) in mainland China,"Background: Although the treatment guidelines of bipolar disorders (BPD) have spread more than a decade, the concordance with evidence-based guidelines was typically low in routine clinical practice. This study is to present the data on the maintenance treatment of BPD in mainland China. Methods: One thousand and twenty-three patients who had experienced a euthymia were eligible for entry into this survey on the maintenance treatment of BPD. Guidelines disconcordance was determined by comparing the medication(s) that patients were prescribed with the recommendations in the guidelines of the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. Results: Three hundred and sixty-four patients (35.6%) had not been prescribed with the maintenance treatment as guidelines recommendations, and 208 patients (20.3%) were prescribed with the antidepressants. A longer duration of BPD, a depressive episode at first onset, and a recent depressive or mixed episode significantly increased the risk for guidelines disconcordance and prescribing antidepressant. In contrast, a hospitalization history due to manic episode was associated with a significant decrease in the risk for guidelines disconcordance and prescribing antidepressant. Limitation: This study was a cross-sectional and retrospective investigation based on medical records. Conclusions: Considering the potentially hazardous effects of inappropriate treatment, individualized psychoeducational strategies for subjects with BPD are necessary to enhance treatment adherence and close the gap between guidelines and clinical practice in mainland China.

Predominant polarity in bipolar disorders: Further evidence for the role of affective temperaments,"Background: Literature suggests bipolars may differ in several features according to predominant polarity, but the role of temperaments remains controversial. Methods: The EPIDEP study was designed to identify bipolar patients among a large sample of major depressives. Only bipolars were included in the current study. Patients were subtyped as predominantly depressive (PD) and predominantly manic and hypomanic (PM) according to a broad (more episodes of a given polarity) and a narrow (2/3 of episodes of one polarity over the other) definition, and compared on their characteristics. Results: Among 278 bipolars, 182 (79.8%) could be subtyped as PD and 46 (20.2%) as PM (broad definition); the respective proportions were of 111 (81.6%) and 25 (18.4%) using narrow definition. Expanding the definition added little in detecting differences between groups. Compared to PDs, PMs showed more psychosis, rapid cycling, stressors at onset, family history of affective illness, and manic first episode polarity; they also received more antipsychotics and lithium. The PDs showed more chronic depression, comorbid anxiety, and received more antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. The following independent variables were associated with manic/hypomanic predominant polarity: cyclothymic temperament, first hospitalization ≤25 years, hyperthymic temperament, and alcohol use (only for broad definition). Limitation: Cross-sectional design, recall bias. Conclusions: Study findings are in accord with literature except for suicidality and mixicity which were related to predominant mania, and explained by higher levels of cyclothymic and hyperthymic temperaments. Temperaments may play a key role in the subtyping of bipolar patients according to predominant polarity, which warrants confirmation in prospective studies.

Intensive short-term dynamic residential treatment program for patients with treatment-resistant disorders,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 184 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2015-34966-012). The authors regret that one of the institutional affiliations of the first author was omitted in the published paper. The affiliation that also should be credited is Drammen District Psychiatric Centre, Division for Mental Health and Addiction, Vestre Viken Health Trust, Norway.] Background: The study investigated the effectiveness of an Intensive Short-Term Dynamic (ISTDP) residential treatment program for patients with treatment resistant anxiety- and/or depressive disorders, with and without comorbid personality disorders. Method: A non-randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an eight week intensive residential treatment program based on principles from ISTDP. Patients ( N = 60), who had repeated prior treatment failure for current mental disorder, sufficient dysfunction to warrant hospitalization, and evidencing capacity to take an intrapsychic perspective on own problems, were included. Outcome variables included measures of target complaints (depression/anxiety, social role dysfunction, and interpersonal distress), general symptom distress, and interpersonal functioning. Measures were administered throughout and after treatment. Change was assessed by multilevel growth curve modeling. Changes during and after treatment were compared to those reported by a sub-sample of wait-list controls taking treatment as usual ( N = 30). Results: The treatment group evidenced significant improvements on all measures. By contrast, receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list did not yield significant changes. Effect sizes in the treatment group were consistently large at both termination and follow-up. Fourteen months after treatment 50.0% of patients had recovered in terms of target complaints.

Mental health self-management questionnaire: Development and psychometric properties,"Background: Through self-management, people living with depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders can play an active role in their recovery. However, absence of a validated questionnaire limits empirical research on self-management. The study aimed to develop a French instrument, the Mental Health Self-Management Questionnaire (MHSQ), and to investigate its psychometric properties Methods: A pool of 86 items was created based on a qualitative study with 50 people in recovery from depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders. The 64 most pertinent items were identified following ratings from 14 experts. A sample of 149 people in recovery completed these items and criterion-related measures (specific aspects of self-management, clinical and personal recovery, social desirability), and 93 participants also completed MHSQ two weeks later Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses show that MHSQ is composed of three subscales: Clinical (getting help and using resources), Empowerment (building upon strengths and positive self-concept to gain control) and Vitality (active and healthy lifestyle). These subscales had satisfying consistency and test–retest reliability, and were mostly unrelated to social desirability. Correlations with criterion variables support convergent and concurrent validity, especially for Empowerment and Vitality. Comparison of structural models provides evidence of the distinct nature of MHSQ in comparison to the constructs of clinical and personal recovery Limitations: Longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to explore the validity of MHSQ for predicting recovery over time Conclusion: MHSQ is a psychometrically-sound instrument, useful for establishing the role of self-management in recovery and monitoring the efficacy of self-management support programs.

Multiple risk factors predict recurrence of major depressive disorder in women,"Background: It is difficult to predict recurrence of depressive episodes in patients with major depression (MD): evidence for many risk factors is inconsistent and general prediction algorithms are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for recurrence of depressive episodes in women using improved methodology. Methods: We used prospective data from a general population sample of female twins with a last-year MD episode ( n = 194). A rich set of baseline predictors was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression subject to elastic net regularization to find a model predicting recurrence of depressive episodes. Prediction accuracy of the model was assessed in an independent test sample ( n = 133), which was limited by the unavailability of a number of key predictors. Results: A wide variety of risk factors predicted recurrence of depressive episodes in women: depressive and anxiety symptoms during the index episode, the level of symptoms at the moment of interview, psychiatric and family history, early and recent adverse life events, being unmarried, and problems with friends and finances. Kaplan Meier estimated survival curves showed that the model differentiated between patients at higher and lower risk for recurrence; estimated areas under the curve were in the range of 0.61–0.79. Limitations: Despite our rich set of predictors, certain potentially relevant variables were not available, such as biological measures, chronic somatic diseases, and treatment status. Conclusions: Recurrence of episodes of MD in women is highly multifactorial. Future studies should take this into account for the development of clinically useful prediction algorithms.

Short-term cost-effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy in social anxiety disorder: Results from the SOPHO-NET trial,"Background: To investigate the short-term cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to waiting list (WL). Methods: The analysis was conducted alongside the SOPHO-NET multi-center efficacy trial. Patients were randomly assigned to CBT ( n = 209), PDT ( n = 207), or WL ( n = 79). Resource use was assessed prior and during treatment to determine direct and absenteeism costs. Unadjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on remission and response rates. To visualize statistical uncertainty, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed based on adjusted net-benefit regression. Different values for the society's willingness to pay (WTP) were assumed. Results: Both interventions were more efficacious than WL but were associated with increased direct costs besides intervention costs. Unadjusted ICERs per responder were €3615 for CBT and €4958 for PDT. Unadjusted ICERs per remitted patient were €5788 and €10,733. CEACs revealed a high degree of uncertainty: applying the 97.5% probability threshold, CBT proved cost-effective at a WTP ≥ €16,100 per responder and ≥ €26,605 per remitted patient. Regarding PDT cost-effectiveness only was certain for response at a WTP ≥ €27,290. Limitations: The WL condition is assumed to represent untreated patients, although the expectation to start treatment in the near future probably affects symptom severity and health care utilization. Conclusions: At the end of treatment cost-effectiveness of CBT and PDT compared to WL is uncertain and depends on the societal WTP. The interventions may induce a more adequate utilization of other health care services – involving increased costs. Development of costs and effects in the long-run should be considered.

Ventromedial prefrontal cortex thinning in preschool-onset depression,"Background: The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is a key center of affect regulation and processing, fundamental aspects of emotional competence which are disrupted in mood disorders. Structural alterations of VMPFC have consistently been observed in adult major depression and are associated with depression severity, yet it is unknown whether young children with depression demonstrate similar abnormalities. We investigated cortical thickness differences in the VMPFC of children with a history of preschool-onset depression (PO-MDD). Methods: Participants in a longitudinal study of PO-MDD underwent structural brain imaging between the ages of 7 and 12 years. Using local cortical distance metrics, cortical thickness of the VMPFC was compared in children with and without a history of PO-MDD. Results: Children previously diagnosed with PO-MDD ( n = 34) had significantly thinner right VMPFC vs. children without a history of PO-MDD [( n = 95); F (1,126) = 5.97, ( p = .016)]. This effect was specific to children with a history of PO-MDD vs. other psychiatric conditions and was independent of comorbid anxiety or externalizing disorders. Decreases in right VMPFC thickness were predicted by preschool depressive symptoms independent of depressive symptoms in school age. Limitations: Results are cross-sectional and cannot distinguish whether thinner right VMPFC represents a vulnerability marker of MDD, consequence of MDD, or marker of remitted MDD. Longitudinal imaging is needed to contextualize how this difference relates to normative VMPFC structural development. Conclusions: Onset of depression at preschool age was associated with decreased cortical thickness of right VMPFC. This finding implicates the VMPFC in depression from very early stages of brain development.

Data-driven atypical profiles of depressive symptoms: Identification and validation in a large cohort,"Background: Atypical response behavior on depression questionnaires may invalidate depression severity measurements. This study aimed to identify and investigate atypical profiles of depressive symptoms using a data-driven approach based on the item response theory (IRT). Methods: A large cohort of participants completed the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (IDS-SR) at baseline ( n = 2329) and two-year follow-up ( n = 1971). Person-fit statistics were used to quantify how strongly each patient's observed symptom profile deviated from the expected profile given the group-based IRT model. Identified atypical profiles were investigated in terms of reported symptoms, external correlates and temporal consistency. Results: Compared to others, atypical responders (6.8%) showed different symptom profiles, with higher ‘mood reactivity’ and ‘suicidal ideation’ and lower levels of mild symptoms like ‘sad mood’. Atypical responding was associated with more medication use (especially tricyclic antidepressants: OR = 1.5), less somatization (OR = 0.8), anxiety severity (OR = 0.8) and anxiety diagnoses (OR = 0.8–0.9), and was shown relatively stable (29.0%) over time. Limitations: This is a methodological proof-of-principal based on the IDS-SR in outpatients. Implementation studies are needed. Conclusion: Person-fit statistics can be used to identify patients who report atypical patterns of depressive symptoms. In research and clinical practice, the extra diagnostic information provided by person-fit statistics could help determine if respondents' depression severity scores are interpretable or should be augmented with additional information.

Childhood-compared to adolescent-onset bipolar disorder has more statistically significant clinical correlates,"Background: The strengths and limitations of considering childhood-and adolescent-onset bipolar disorder (BD) separately versus together remain to be established. We assessed this issue. Methods: BD patients referred to the Stanford Bipolar Disorder Clinic during 2000–2011 were assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD Affective Disorders Evaluation. Patients with childhood- and adolescent-onset were compared to those with adult-onset for 7 unfavorable bipolar illness characteristics with replicated associations with early-onset patients. Results: Among 502 BD outpatients, those with childhood- (&lt; 13 years, N = 110) and adolescent- (13–18 years, N = 218) onset had significantly higher rates for 4/7 unfavorable illness characteristics, including lifetime comorbid anxiety disorder, at least ten lifetime mood episodes, lifetime alcohol use disorder, and prior suicide attempt, than those with adult-onset (&gt; 18 years, N = 174). Childhood- but not adolescent-onset BD patients also had significantly higher rates of first-degree relative with mood disorder, lifetime substance use disorder, and rapid cycling in the prior year. Patients with pooled childhood/adolescent – compared to adult-onset had significantly higher rates for 5/7 of these unfavorable illness characteristics, while patients with childhood- compared to adolescent-onset had significantly higher rates for 4/7 of these unfavorable illness characteristics. Limitations: Caucasian, insured, suburban, low substance abuse, American specialty clinic-referred sample limits generalizability. Onset age is based on retrospective recall. Conclusions: Childhood- compared to adolescent-onset BD was more robustly related to unfavorable bipolar illness characteristics, so pooling these groups attenuated such relationships.

Mortality of subjects with mood disorders in the lundby community cohort: A follow-up over 50 years,"Aims: To compare causes of death and mortality among subjects with and without mood disorder in the Lundby Cohort and to analyse additional mental disorders as risk factors for mortality in subjects with mood disorders. Background: The Lundby study is a longitudinal study that investigated mental health in an unselected population. The study commenced in 1947; the population was further investigated in 1957, 1972, and 1997. Methods: Experienced psychiatrists performed semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and best estimate consensus diagnoses of mental disorders were assessed at each field investigation. Subjects with mood disorder (n=508, 195 males, 313 females) were identified until 1997. Causes and dates of death between 1947 and 2011 were obtained from the Swedish cause of death register and were compared between subjects diagnosed with mood disorder and other participants. Mortality was compared between those with mood disorders and the remaining cohort with Cox regression analyses. Other mental disorders were considered as risk factors for death for subjects with mood disorders. Results: The hazard ratio for mortality in mood disorders was HR=1.18. However, the mortality was elevated only for males, HR=1.5. Comorbid anxiety disorders, organic disorders, dementia and psychotic disorders were significant risk factors for death. A total of 6.3% of the participants with mood disorder and 1.2% of the remaining participants committed suicide. Conclusions: As expected, the suicide rate was higher among participants with mood disorders. Only males with mood disorders had elevated mortality. The impact on mortality from other mental disorders seems to vary between the genders.

"The bipolar II disorder personality traits, a true syndrome?","Background: The author was struck by the similarities and commonality of complaints, aside from mood swings, made by Bipolar II patients and started registrating these complaints. This registrational work eventually led to the development of The Bipolar II Syndome Checklist. The aim of this work was to understand how widely the Bipolar II disorder affects the personality, and what disturbing personality traits are the most common? Deliberately, no attempt was made to diagnose psychiatric comorbidities, in the hope that one would get a clearer view of what symptoms, if any, could be considered a natural part of the Bipolar II Disorder. As far as the author knows this is a novel approach. Method: 105 Bipolar II patients completed the Bipolar II Syndrome Checklist. The answers to the 44 questions on the list are presented in tables. Results: Symptoms like anxiety, low self esteem, paranoia, extreme hurtfulness, migraine, Post Partum Depression, obsessive traits, alcoholism in the family are amongst the findings which will be presented in greater detail. Limitations: No control group. Bipolar I patients excluded. The Bipolar II Syndrome Checklist has not been systematically validated. Conclusions: The results show that Bipolar II Disorder causes multiple symptoms so commonly that it may be justified to describe it as a syndrome, The Bipolar II Syndrome. Also these disturbances commonly lie in families of Bipolar II patients and are in all likelihood, greatly underdiagnosed. The clinical relevance of this study lies in increasing our knowledge and understanding of the nature of the Bipolar II Disorder, which in all probability will increase the diagnostic and treatment accuracy, since clinicians are more likely to scan for other symptoms needing treatment.

Positive imagery cognitive bias modification (CBM) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT): A randomized controlled trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 190 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2015-57223-121). In the original article, There was an error in Section 3.6. The published text reports the percentages for clinically reliable change, not clinically reliable and significant change as defined in Section 2.6. The corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Accruing evidence suggests that positive imagery-based cognitive bias modification (CBM) could have potential as a standalone targeted intervention for depressive symptoms or as an adjunct to existing treatments. We sought to establish the benefit of this form of CBM when delivered prior to Internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 1-week Internet-delivered positive CBM vs. an active control condition for participants ( N =75, 69% female, mean age=42) meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression; followed by a 10-week iCBT program for both groups. Results: Modified intent-to-treat marginal and mixed effect models demonstrated no significant difference between conditions following the CBM intervention or the iCBT program. In both conditions there were significant reductions (Cohen's d .57–1.58, 95% CI=.12–2.07) in primary measures of depression and interpretation bias (PHQ9, BDI-II, AST-D). Large effect size reductions (Cohen's d .81–1.32, 95% CI=.31–1.79) were observed for secondary measures of distress, disability, anxiety and repetitive negative thinking (K10, WHODAS, STAI, RTQ). Per protocol analyses conducted in the sample of participants who completed all seven sessions of CBM indicated between-group superiority of the positive over control group on depression symptoms (PHQ9, BDI-II) and psychological distress (K10) following CBM (Hedges g .55–.88, 95% CI=−.03–1.46) and following iCBT (PHQ9, K10). The majority (&gt;70%) no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression at 3-month follow-up. Limitations: The control condition contained many active components and therefore may have represented a smaller ‘dose’ of the positive condition. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support for the successful integration of imagery-based CBM into an existing Internet-based treatment for depression.

Online mindfulness-based intervention for late-stage bipolar disorder: Pilot evidence for feasibility and effectiveness,"Objectives: People in the late stage of bipolar disorder (BD) experience elevated relapse rates and poorer quality of life (QoL) compared with those in the early stages. Existing psychological interventions also appear less effective in this group. To address this need, we developed a new online mindfulness-based intervention targeting quality of life (QoL) in late stage BD. Here, we report on an open pilot trial of ORBIT (online, recovery-focused, bipolar individual therapy). Methods: Inclusion criteria were: self-reported primary diagnosis of BD, six or more episodes of BD, under the care of a medical practitioner, access to the internet, proficient in English, 18–65 years of age. Primary outcome was change (baseline—post-treatment) on the Brief QoL.BD (Michalak and Murray, 2010). Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress measured on the DASS scales (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1993). Results: Twenty-six people consented to participate (Age M =46.6 years, SD =12.9, and 75% female). Ten participants were lost to follow-up (38.5% attrition). Statistically significant improvement in QoL was found for the completers, t (15)=2.88, 95% CI:.89–5.98, p =.011, (Cohen's d z =.72, partial η² =.36), and the intent-to-treat sample t (25)=2.65, 95% CI:.47–3.76, (Cohen's d z =.52; partial η² =.22). A non-significant trend towards improvement was found on the DASS anxiety scale ( p =.06) in both completer and intent-to-treat samples, but change on depression and stress did not approach significance. Limitations: This was an open trial with no comparison group, so measured improvements may not be due to specific elements of the intervention. Structured diagnostic assessments were not conducted, and interpretation of effectiveness was limited by substantial attrition. Conclusion: Online delivery of mindfulness-based psychological therapy for late stage BD appears feasible and effective, and ORBIT warrants full development. Modifications suggested by the pilot study include increasing the 3 weeks duration of the intervention, adding cautions about the impact of extended meditations, and addition of coaching support/monitoring to optimise engagement.

Can unipolar and bipolar pediatric major depression be differentiated from each other? A systematic review of cross-sectional studies examining differences in unipolar and bipolar depression,"Introduction: While pediatric mania and depression can be distinguished from each other, differentiating between unipolar major depressive disorder (unipolar MDD) and bipolar major depression (bipolar MDD) poses unique clinical and therapeutic challenges. Our aim was to examine the current body of knowledge on whether unipolar MDD and bipolar MDD in youth could be distinguished from one another in terms of clinical features and correlates. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on studies assessing the clinical characteristics and correlates of unipolar MDD and bipolar MDD in youth. Results: Four scientific papers that met our priori inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. These papers reported that bipolar MDD is distinct from unipolar MDD in its higher levels of depression severity, associated impairment, psychiatric co-morbidity with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and anxiety disorders, and family history of mood and disruptive behavior disorders in first-degree relatives. Limitations: Though we examined a sizeable and diverse sample, we were only able to identify four cross sectional informative studies in our review. Therefore, our conclusions should be viewed as preliminary. Conclusions: These findings can aid clinicians in differentiating the two forms of MDD in youth.

Why are suicidal thoughts less prevalent in older age groups? Age differences in the correlates of suicidal thoughts in the English Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007,"Background: Suicidal ideation is more strongly associated with suicidal intent in later life, so risk factors may also differ by age. We investigated whether the relationship between suicidal ideation and established correlates varied by age in a representative population. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of England to assess the relationship between age and suicidal thoughts across 20-year age bands, using logistic regression, adjusted for survey weights. We used mediation analyses to assess the extent to which other factors mediate the relationship between suicidal thoughts and age. Results: Reports of previous-year suicidal thoughts decreased with age. This was partly explained by (1) lower rates of reported child abuse (in those aged 75+), of depression, and of anxiety symptoms (in those aged 55+), factors all strongly associated with suicidal thoughts, and (2) higher rates of protective factors in people aged 35+, specifically homeownership and cohabitation. Rates of phobias, irritability and compulsions also decreased with age, and the association of these symptoms with suicidal thoughts was particularly strong in the youngest (16–34) age group. People who reported experiencing childhood abuse in all age groups reported more suicidal thoughts, suggesting abuse has lifelong negative effects on suicidal ideation. Limitations: The response rate was 57%. Older people may be less likely to recall childhood abuse. Conclusions: Sexual and physical abuse in childhood are associated with suicidal ideas throughout the lifespan, so screening for suicidal ideas in younger and older people should be routine and vigorous, and cover experiences in early life: management may require appropriate psychological interventions.

The patterns of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in depression patients: The dissociation between temporal regions and fronto-parietal regions,"Objective: This study surveyed the characteristics of the indicator for the fluctuations of default brain activity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), in patients with pure major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Forty-four patients with MDD and 27 normal controls were enrolled in our study. All the participants received the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, which were pre-processed by the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data analysis toolbox). The group-related differences of the fALFF between patients and controls were explored by performing comparisons of the fALFF values obtained from rs-fMRI data. The fALFF outputs of patients and controls were compared with global brain volume, age and gender as covariates. In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables (such as depression severity, anxiety severity, illness duration) and fALFF values were also estimated in each group and across both groups. Results: The patients with MDD had significantly higher fALFF values than the controls, for the left temporal subgyral region. In the contrary, the patients had lower values of fALFF than controls, for the right frontal subcallosal gyrus and right parietal postcentral gyrus. In addition, the fALFF values were negatively correlated with the depression severity in the left temporal subgyral region. Conclusion: MDD patients had dissociable alterations in the fALFF values of the fronto-parietal and temporal regions. The pattern of fALFF alterations might be unique for depression patients with later onset-age of young adult phase.

Associations between self-reported symptoms of prenatal maternal infection and post-traumatic stress disorder in offspring: Evidence from a prospective birth cohort study,"Objective: Consistent evidence has linked a range of prenatal maternal infections with psychotic disorders in later life. However, the potential for this exposure to impact more common disorders requires further investigation. Methods: Participants came from the Mater University Study of pregnancy, a longitudinal, pre-birth cohort study which recruited pregnant mothers from a Brisbane hospital between 1981 and 1984. At age 21, 2439 offspring completed the CIDI-Auto. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate associations of self-reported symptoms of prenatal infection with a range of DSM-IV anxiety and affective diagnoses, while also testing for gender interactions. Results: In multivariate analyses, self-reported symptoms of prenatal genital infection predicted Post-traumatic stress disorders (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.14, 4.95) and social phobias (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.61), in addition to evidence for a gender interaction by which males (OR = 6.04, 95% CI: 2.00, 18.30) but not females were at greater risk for PTSD. Further analyses among those with PTSD revealed the relationship to be stronger when excluding those not exposed to trauma (OR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.72). Limitations: We were unable to clinically or serologically verify the presence and the type of prenatal genital infection. Conclusion: This is the first study to show an association between self-reported symptoms of prenatal genital infections and two highly prevalent anxiety disorders among adult offspring. The relationship with PTSD was particularly strong and suggested that the exposure may primarily impact PTSD in males. Further research with the capacity to assess a fuller-range of specific prenatal infections is warranted to evaluate the potential of reducing the prevalence of these disorders.

Bipolar disorder subtypes in children and adolescents: Demographic and clinical characteristics from an Australian sample,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) phenomenology in children and adolescents remains contentious. The study investigated Australian children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II), or BD not otherwise specified (BD-NOS). Methods: Index episode demographics, symptomatology, functioning and diagnostic data were compared for 88 participants (63 female) aged 8–18 years ( M = 14.8, SD = 2.5) meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for BD-I ( n = 24), BD-II ( n = 13) or BD-NOS ( n = 51). Results: BD-I had higher rates of previous episodes, psychotropic medication (compared to BD-II but not BD-NOS), rates of inpatient admissions (compared to BD-NOS), and number of inpatient admissions (compared to BD-II). BD-II had lower rates of lifetime depression and anxiety disorders, higher frequency of hypomania, shorter duration of illness, and fewer previous episodes. BD-NOS had younger age of onset, chronic course, irritability and mixed presentation. All BD subtypes had high rates of self-harm (69.3%), suicidal ideation (73.9%), suicide attempts (36.4%), psychiatric admission (55.7%), and psychosis (36.4%). Limitations: There were relatively small numbers of BD-I and BD-II. Diagnoses were based on retrospective recall. Conclusions: All BD subtypes had high levels of acuity and clinical risk. In accord with previous results, BD-I and BD-II participants’ phenomenology was consistent with classical descriptions of these subtypes. BD-NOS participants were younger, with less euphoric mania but otherwise phenomenologically on a continuum with BD-I, suggesting that child and adolescent BD-NOS may be an early and less differentiated phase of illness of BD-I or BD-II and hence a target for early intervention.

Analysis of hair cortisol level in first-episodic and recurrent female patients with depression compared to healthy controls,"Background: Although accumulating evidence has shown increased cortisol levels in serum, saliva, or 24-h urine samples in depression, a number of studies did not find the association between cortisol levels and depression. Hair cortisol levels reflect long-term and historical information of cortisol and hair cortisol analysis has been applied in the research of psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the hair cortisol levels between patients with depression and healthy controls. Methods: Hair cortisol levels of 22 first-episodic and 13 recurrent female patients with depression and 30 healthy controls were measured and compared using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The relationship between hair cortisol levels and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) or Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) scores were also examined. Results: Before disease episode, no significant differences were observed among healthy controls, first-episodic patients and recurrent patients. In disease episode, the hair cortisol level in first-episodic patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls or recurrent patients, while no significant difference was observed between recurrent patients and healthy controls. No significant correlation was found between HAMD or HAMA scores and hair cortisol levels in patients. Limitations: First, long-term effects of antidepressants on the results cannot be excluded without detailed medication information of the recurrent patients. Second, sample sizes might be relatively small. Conclusions: Our results indicate that hair cortisol levels increased in disease episode in first-episodic, but not recurrent patients with depression, which may suggest that episodes of disease have influence on cortisol levels.

Magnitude and risk factors for postpartum symptoms: A literature review,"Background: The prevalence of postpartum depression worldwide varies from 0.5% to 60.8% in the first 12 months postpartum using self-reported questionnaire. This review aims to update the current magnitude of postpartum depression based on self-reported questionnaire and clinical interview and explore its associated factors in developed and developing countries. Methods: A literature search conducted between 2005 and 2014 identified 203 studies, of which 191 used self-reported questionnaire in 42 countries and 21 used structured clinical interview in 15 countries. Nine studies used a combination of self-reported questionnaire and clinical interview. Result: The prevalence of postpartum depression varies from 1.9% to 82.1% in developing countries and from 5.2% to 74.0% in developed countries using self-reported questionnaire. Structured clinical interview shows a much lower prevalence range from 0.1% in Finland to 26.3% in India. Antenatal depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric illness, poor marital relationship, stressful life events, negative attitude towards pregnancy, and lack of social support are significant contributors to postpartum depression. Limitation: All studies are included irrespective of the methodological quality, such as small sample size and their inclusion could affect the generalizability of the results. Conclusion: The current prevalence of postpartum depression is much higher than that previously reported, and similar risk factors are documented. A culturally sensitive cut-off score with adequate psychometric properties of the screening instruments should be available. In future studies, examining the physical, biological, and cultural factors in qualitative studies and in those with adequate methodological qualities is recommended.

"""Somatic and cognitive symptoms as indicators of potential endophenotypes in bipolar spectrum disorders: An exploratory and proof-of-concept study comparing bipolar ii disorder with recurrent brief depression and healthy controls"": Erratum","Reports an error in ""Somatic and cognitive symptoms as indicators of potential endophenotypes in bipolar spectrum disorders: An exploratory and proof-of-concept study comparing bipolar II disorder with recurrent brief depression and healthy controls"" by H. Lovdahl, E. Bøen, E. A. Malt and U. F. Malt ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2014[Sep], Vol 166, 59-70). In the original article there is an error. The correction is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-28694-010). Background: We examined whether somatic symptoms reported by patients with bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD), in this study defined as bipolar II (BD-2) or recurrent brief depression with (RBD-H) or without (RBD-O) a history of hypomanic symptoms might point to the possible underlying disease markers (endophenotypes). We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more prevalent among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the severity of current mental status (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases. Methods: Sixty-one patients (BD-2: n = 21; RBD-H: n = 19; RBD-O: n = 21) were compared with 21 healthy controls. Assessments included a 123-item somatic symptom checklist; assessments for neuroticism, anxiety and depression. Candidate somatic symptoms were selected using a 4-step inclusion/exclusion procedure. Results: Seven symptoms survived in all three groups: general (fatigue, feeling exhausted); sensory (leaden sensation in legs, pain in the body, impaired sense of smell); cognitive (loss of memory) and autonomic (excessive perspiration). In addition 15 symptoms survived in one or two groups (examples: impaired hearing, hypersensitivity to sound, inability to find words). Limitations: Possible selection bias and small sample size precludes firm conclusions with regards to specific symptoms. Conclusion: Our approach identified symptoms for which an association with BSDs has been suggested previously, as well as symptoms not commonly associated with BSDs. The findings support the feasibility and validity of using assessment of somatic symptoms as an approach to identify potential endophenotypes in BSDs.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-19966-001). Background: The aim of the study was to examine the link between maternal depression and the infant's HPA axis functioning in relation to a sequence of emotional challenges at 12 months postpartum, while controlling for maternal anxiety disorder and general sociodemographic risk. Method: Two hundred and fifty-seven infants whose mothers had been interviewed in pregnancy, as part of a prospective longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of U.K. families, were individually tested in the laboratory and then observed during a simulated birthday party scenario. Three cortisol samples were taken over the course of 1½ h of afternoon testing. Results: The cortisol levels of infants whose mothers had no history of depression decreased significantly after individual testing, and rose again significantly in response to the birthday party challenge. In contrast, infants whose mothers had been diagnosed with depression before conception, during pregnancy or in the first 6 months postpartum showed no decrease from the initially elevated levels at entry to the laboratory and a less marked increase in response to the party. Limitations: The study does not employ a traditional stress paradigm; instead it introduces a novel design to assess HPA axis functioning in relation to everyday emotional challenges. Conclusions: The findings suggest that altered responses to mildly challenging events in infancy may be a marker for infants’ familial risk for depressive illness.

Attachment insecurity and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder among inpatients with serious mental illness,"Background: Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is characterized by traits such as extreme rigidity, perfectionism, and controlling behavior, all of which have a negative impact on interpersonal functioning. Attachment theory provides a useful framework to elucidate the interpersonal dysfunction characteristic of OCPD; yet, there is a dearth of attachment research on OCPD in the context of severe mental illness. Methods: Attachment security and personality disorders were assessed in adult inpatients with severe mental illness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to match OCPD and control subjects on age, gender, number of psychiatric disorders, and number of criteria endorsed for borderline personality disorder. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, the OCPD group ( n = 61) showed greater attachment avoidance than controls ( n = 61), and the avoidance was manifested in a predominance of the most insecure attachment style, fearful attachment. Correlations between attachment anxiety/avoidance with specific OCPD diagnostic criteria revealed that attachment avoidance was correlated with four of eight OCPD criteria across the full sample. Within the subset of OCPD patients, attachment avoidance was significantly correlated with OCPD criterion 3 (is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships). Limitations: The use of self-report measure of attachment and the high burden of illness in the SMI population may not generalize to interview based assessment or outpatients, respectively. Conclusions: Findings attest to the severity of impairment in interpersonal functioning and attachment avoidance, in particular, is characteristic of OCPD patients. These results suggest that viable treatment targets include interpersonal functioning along with more classical features of OCPD such as perfectionism and obsessiveness in task performance.

"Crocin, the main active saffron constituent, as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial","Objective: Herbal remedies play an important role in treatment of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of crocin, the main active constituent of saffron, as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial. It was carried out during 4 weeks in two groups (placebo and treatment) on 40 MDD patients between 24 and 50 years old in Ibn-e-Sina psychiatric hospital, Mashhad, Iran, from March 2013 to December 2013. The crocin group ( n = 20) was given one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug (fluoxetine 20mg/day or sertraline 50 mg/day or citalopram 20 mg/day) plus crocin tablets (30 mg/day; 15 mg BID) and placebo group ( n = 20) was administered one SSRI (fluoxetine 20 mg/day or sertraline 50 mg/day or citalopram 20 mg/day) plus placebo (two placebo tablets per day) for 4 weeks. Both groups filled beck depression inventory (BDI), beck anxiety inventory (BAI), general health questionnaire (GHQ), the mood disorder questionnaire (MDQ), side effect evaluation questionnaire, and demographic questionnaire before and after one month intervention. Results: The crocin group showed significantly improved scores on BDI, BAI and GHQ compared to placebo group ( P value &lt; 0.0001). The averages of decrease in BDI, BAI and GHQ scores in placebo group were 6.15, 2.6 and 10.3 respectively, whereas the values in crocin group were 17.6, 12.7 and 17.2 after 4 weeks trial. Limitations: Poor patient compliance with medications and short trial period, small sample size and self-report assessments were the major limitations of this study. Conclusion: These results demonstrated the effect of crocin in depression and could be administered in treatment of MDD patients.

"Hiv, violence and women: Unmet mental health care needs","Background: HIV-infected (HIV+) women have high rates of Gender Based Violence (GBV). Studies of GBV find that approximately 50–90% of survivors develop mood and anxiety disorders. Given that women in sub-Saharan African constitute the largest population of HIV+ individuals in the world and the region's high GBV prevalence, mental health research with HIV+ women affected by GBV (HIV+GBV+) in this region is urgently needed. Methods: Qualitative methods were used to evaluate the mental health care needs of HIV+GBV+ female patients at an HIV clinic in the Kisumu County, Kenya. Thirty in-depth interviews and four focus groups were conducted with patients, healthcare providers and community leaders. Interviews were transcribed, translated and analyzed using qualitative data software. Results: Respondents stated that physical, sexual and emotional violence against HIV+ women was widely prevalent and perpetrated primarily by untested husbands accusing a wife of marital infidelity following her positive HIV test result. Mental health problems among HIV+GBV+ women included depressive, anxiety, traumatic stress symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Participants opined that emotional distress from GBV not only caused HIV treatment default, but also led to poor HIV health even if adherent. Respondents agreed that mental health treatment was needed for HIV+GBV+ women; most agreed that the best treatment modality was individual counseling delivered weekly at the HIV clinic. Limitations: Emotional distress may be higher and/or more varied among HIV+GBV+ women who are not engaged in HIV care. Conclusions: Mental health care is needed and desired by HIV+GBV+ women in Kisumu County, Kenya.

Pre-treatment insomnia as a predictor of single and combination antidepressant outcomes: A CO-MED report,"Background: Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) report clinically significant sleep problems. Pre-treatment insomnia has been associated with poorer treatment outcomes in some antidepressant trials, leading to suggestions that combined treatment regimens may be more successful in this subgroup. This study investigated this question using data from the CO-MED trial. Methods: Adult outpatients with chronic and/or recurrent MDD were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to 28 weeks of single-blind, placebo-controlled antidepressant treatment with (1) escitalopram+placebo, (2) bupropion-sustained-release+escitalopram, or (3) venlafaxine-extended-release+mirtazapine. We compared baseline characteristics, tolerability, and treatment outcomes at 12 and 28 weeks for patients with and without pre-treatment insomnia. Results: Of the 665 evaluable patients, the majority (88.3%) reported significant pre-treatment insomnia. Those with pre-treatment insomnia were more likely to be female (69.3% vs. 57.7%) and African-American (29.1% vs. 11.8%). Those with pre-treatment insomnia symptoms reported higher rates of concurrent anxiety disorders, lower rates of alcohol and substance use disorders, and greater impairment in psychosocial functioning. The two groups did not differ in either tolerability or treatment outcomes among the three antidepressant treatments. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms, while common in patients with chronic/recurrent MDD were not predictive of response, remission, or tolerability with either single or combined antidepressant medications.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between panic attacks, minority status, and nativity by focusing on the effects of health lifestyle behaviors and discrimination. Methods: Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, which was used to estimate the probability of meeting the criteria for panic attacks ( n = 17,249). Results: Demographic and socioeconomic variables had significant associations; females had over 2.4 times higher odds than males of meeting the criteria for panic attacks. The more frequently respondents were treated as dishonest, less smart, with disrespect, threatened, or called names, the more likely they met the criteria for panic attacks. Additionally, smoking and alcohol abuse were significant predictors of panic attacks. Those who abused alcohol have over 2 times the odds of having panic attacks. Similarly, smokers had 52% higher odds of panic attacks than non-smokers. Limitations: The primary limitation of this project was the lack of a true acculturation measure with a secondary limitation being the inability to determine respondents' legal status. Conclusions: Key findings were that health lifestyle choices and exposure to discrimination significantly affected the chance of having panic attacks. Nativity was protective; however, its effect was ameliorated by exposure to discrimination or engagement in smoking behavior or alcohol abuse. Thus, this study offers insight into contextual factors for clinicians caring for racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with panic attacks.

Comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder in patients with bipolar-I disorder,"Background: Limited numbers of studies have examined the prevalence of OCD systematically in consecutively sampled adult bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) patients. We examined the frequency of OCD in a large number ( n = 396) of consecutively hospitalized patients with BD-I and identified socio-demographic and clinical correlates of BD-I with and without OCD. Method: BD-I patients ( n = 396) were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Bipolar Disorder Studies, the Structured clinical interview for (Axis II) DSM-IV, the Family interview for genetic studies, the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Clinical Global Impression scale. Patients with and without OCD were compared in terms of various socio-demographic and clinical variables. Results: Thirty (7.6%) of the 396 inpatients studied had OCD and 15 (3.8%) had subclinical OCD. BD–OCD group had significantly lower GAF scores, higher rates of unemployment, and lower incidence of psychotic symptoms. In addition, BD–OCD group had higher rates of comorbid social anxiety and anxious avoidant personality disorder (AAPD) and OCD in first-degree relatives. Those with clinical and subclinical OCD did not differ on functioning and severity measures. Limitations: Retrospective design and recruitment of patients from inpatient services of a tertiary psychiatric hospital. Conclusion: OCD is not an uncommon comorbid disorder in BD-I and appears to be associated with greater functional disability. BD-I with comorbid OCD is associated with greater family history of OCD, comorbidities of social phobia and AAPD and less of psychotic symptoms.

Do patients' illness beliefs predict depression measures at six months in primary care; a longitudinal study,"Background: Depressive disorders are prevalent and costly but there is a lack of evidence on how best to select treatments for mild to moderate depression in primary care. Illness beliefs have been shown to affect the outcome from physical illness, but there is limited information on the beliefs of patients who are depressed. Aims: To measure patients' beliefs about depression at baseline and determine whether these relate to depression severity at six months. Methods: Primary care patients with a recently diagnosed episode of depression completed the Beliefs about Depression Questionnaire and depression severity scores at baseline. The primary outcome was the change in depression severity score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale after six months. Results: 227/292 (78%) participants completed follow-up questionnaires. Initial severity of depression at baseline, and particular beliefs about the causes, consequences and timeline of depression predicted poorer outcomes, whereas a belief in using exercise or keeping busy to treat depression predicted improved outcomes. Prescription of antidepressants did not appear to mediate these relationships. Limitations: This was an initial study using a new validated questionnaire and it cannot be predicted whether these results are representative or would be reproduced in other populations. Although participants were primary care patients whose GP (General Practitioner) had coded as having a new incident episode of depression in the preceding six months, 43% of participants stated they had been depressed for more than a year. Sufficient participants were recruited to ensure the study was adequately powered but participation rate was 30%, raising the possibility of response bias. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Illness beliefs may help to predict outcomes in depression and therefore assessing and addressing patients' beliefs about their depression may enhance treatment.

Clinical significance of decreased protein expression of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the development of depression: A meta-analysis,"Background: Previous evidence has shown that adrenal androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEAS) have significant functions related to the control of mood, affect, and anxiety. Changes in their expression levels are reportedly related to several psychiatric disorders. The objective of this meta-analysis was to explore the role of DHEAS protein expression in patients with depression. Method: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CISCOM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, China BioMedicine (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were electronically searched. Only those studies that analyzing DHEAS expression in depression patients were considered eligible for inclusion. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were pooled with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in accordance with the random-effects model. Results: Ten clinical case-control studies, consisting of 4496 subjects (493 patients with depression and 4003 healthy controls) were incorporated for analysis. Results revealed a lower DHEAS protein expression level in patients with depression than in normal controls (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06–0.27, P = 0.002). Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that lower levels of DHEAS expression in depression patients were not observed in Caucasians or Asians (both P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Elevated DHEAS protein expression may be correlated with the biological pathophysiology of depression, indicating that checking DHEAS levels and administration of DHEAS could contribute to the effective treatment of depression.

Clinical characteristics and temperament influences on ‘happy’ euphoric and ‘snappy’ irritable bipolar hypo/manic mood states,"Background: While mood elevation and euphoria are the most commonly described phenotypic descriptors of hypo/mania, irritability and anger may dominate. This study was designed to pursue possible determinants of such differing states. Methods: Patients with bipolar I or II disorder were assigned to an ‘irritable/snappy’ or ‘euphoric/happy’ sub-set on the basis of their dominant hypo/manic symptoms. Group differences were examined across clinical, personality, lifestyle and illness impact measures. Results: The two sub-sets did not differ on age of depression onset, family history of mood disorders, or depression severity and impairment. The snappy sub-set reported higher levels of irritability in depressed phases and were more likely to have a comorbid anxiety disorder. Their hypo/manic episodes were shorter and they were more likely to be hospitalized at such times. On a temperament measure they scored as more irritable and self-focussed and as less cooperative and effective—indicative of higher levels of disordered personality functioning. Limitations: Some comparison analyses were undertaken on a reduced sample size, giving rise to power issues. Our bipolar I and II diagnoses deviated to some extent from DSM-5 criteria in not imposing duration criteria for hypo/manic episodes. Conclusions: Findings support a spectrum model for the bipolar disorders linking temperament to bipolar symptomatic state and which may have treatment implications.

What is important in being cured from: Does discordance between physicians and patients matter? (2),"Aims: The influence of discordance in what is important in being cured from depression on clinical outcome at 6 months, assessed with a divergence index. Methods: 304 outpatients treated for depression by general practitioners or by psychiatrists and completing a 6-month treatment period: a divergence index (divergence between physician and patient view on what is important in being cured from depression) was calculated for each physician–patient pair. The relation between this index and outcome at 6 months was analyzed (including depressive, anxious and somatic symptom severity, positive effect, functional impairment and quality of life (psychological and social relations). Results: Response rates (50% improvement) were 65.9% for depressive symptomatology and 46.2% for anxious symptomatology. The subgroup with a poor physician–patient agreement (highest quartile) on expectations had a worse clinical outcome than the subgroup with an excellent physician–patient agreement (lowest quartile): differences in response rate between these groups ranged from 9% to 27%; this difference reached statistical significance for 3 outcome variables (anxiety, positive effect and social relationships). Conclusions: The study shows that outcomes with standard antidepressant drugs are still suboptimal and that discordance between what patients' and physicians' consider important in the definition of cure from depression significantly influences clinical outcomes at 6 months.

The association of affective temperaments with smoking initiation and maintenance in adult primary care patients,"Background: Smoking behaviour and its course is influenced by personality factors. Affective temperaments could allow a more specific framework of the role trait affectivity plays in this seriously harmful health-behaviour. The aim of our study was to investigate if such an association exists in an ageing population with a special emphasis on gender differences. Methods: 459 primary care patients completed the TEMPS-A, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Subjects were characterized according to their smoking behaviour as current, former or never smokers. Univariate analysis ANOVA and logistic regression were performed to analyse differences in the three smoking subgroups to predict smoking initiation and maintenance. Results: Current smokers were younger and less educated than former or never smokers. Males were more likely to try tobacco during their lifetime and were more successful in cessation. Depressive, cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores showed significant differences between the three smoking subgroups. Irritable temperament was a predictor of smoking initiation in females whereas depressive temperament predicted smoking maintenance in males with a small, opposite effect of HAM-A scores independent of age, education, lifetime depression and BDI scores. Whereas smoking initiation was exclusively predicted by a higher BDI score in males, smoking maintenance was predicted by younger age and lower education in females. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study design may lead to selective survival bias and hinder drawing causal relationships. Conclusions: Affective temperaments contribute to smoking initiation and maintenance independently of age, education, and depression. The significant contribution of depressive temperament in males and irritable temperament in females may highlight the role of gender-discordant temperaments in vulnerable subgroups.

The utilization of unified protocols in behavioral cognitive therapy in transdiagnostic group subjects: A clinical trial,"Background: The practicing of protocols based on behavioral cognitive therapy (CBT) have been frequently used in the last decades and adapted to better manage the necessities of patients and providers. Objectives: The goal is to build a treatment that is evidence-based—for that reason the unified protocol for multiple emotional disorders (transdiagnostics) have been utilized to simplify treatment—without losing scientific traits. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the unified protocol in groups of patients with depression and anxiety disorders. Materials and methods: In a pool of 48 subjects, divided in two groups, one was submitted to 12 intervention sessions of the unified protocol while the other was solely given medication. MINI, BAI and BDI were the instruments used at the beginning and at the end of treatment. Results: The results were highly significant ( p &lt; 0.001) in as much as with the improvement of anxiety and depressive disorders as it was in the group which was treated with the unified protocol compared with the group which was only given medication Limitations: Limitations of this study were the number of sample participants and the non-randomization of subjects in both groups. Conclusion: Group therapy has not been largely implemented though it is deemed very useful for treatments when the unified protocol is used in transdiagnostic patients. Not only does it allow for emotional stabilizing and socialization but it also enables subjects with an altruistic feeling amongst themselves.

Diagnostic stability in pediatric bipolar disorder,"Background: The diagnostic stability of pediatric bipolar disorder has not been investigated previously. The aim was to investigate the diagnostic stability of the ICD-10 diagnosis of pediatric mania/bipolar disorder. Methods: All patients below 19 years of age who got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once in a period from 1994 to 2012 at psychiatric inpatient or outpatient contact in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register. Results: Totally, 354 children and adolescents got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once; a minority, 144 patients (40.7%) got the diagnosis at the first contact whereas the remaining patients (210; 59.3%) got the diagnosis at later contacts before age 19. For the latter patients, the median time elapsed from first treatment contact with the psychiatric service system to the first diagnosis with a manic episode/bipolar disorder was nearly 1 year and for 25% of those patients it took more than 2½ years before the diagnosis was made. The most prevalent other diagnoses than bipolar disorder at first contact were depressive disorder (21.4%), acute and transient psychotic disorders or other non-organic psychosis (19.2%), reaction to stress or adjustment disorder (14.8%) and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (10.9%). Prevalence rates of schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorder or hyperkinetic disorders (ADHD) were low. Limitations: Data concern patients who get contact to hospital psychiatry only. Conclusions: Clinicians should be more observant on manic symptoms in children and adolescents who at first glance present with transient psychosis, reaction to stress/adjustment disorder or with behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (F90–98) and follow these patients more closely over time identifying putable hypomanic and manic symptoms as early as possible.

"Dissociation, shame, complex PTSD, child maltreatment and intimate relationship self-concept in dissociative disorder, chronic PTSD and mixed psychiatric groups","Background: Whilst a growing body of research has examined dissociation and other psychiatric symptoms in severe dissociative disorders (DDs), there has been no systematic examination of shame and sense of self in relationships in DDs. Chronic child abuse often associated with severe DDs, like dissociative identity disorder, is likely to heighten shame and relationship concerns. This study investigated complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), borderline and Schneiderian symptoms, dissociation, shame, child abuse, and various markers of self in relationships (e.g., relationship esteem, relationship depression, fear of relationships). Methods: Participants were assessed via clinical interview with psychometrically sound questionnaires. They fell into three diagnostic groups, dissociative disorder ( n = 39; primarily dissociative identity disorder), chronic PTSD (Chr-PTSD; n = 13) or mixed psychiatric presentations (MP; n = 21; primarily mood and anxiety disorders). All participants had a history of child abuse and/or neglect, and the groups did not differ on age and gender. Results: The DD group was higher on nearly all measured variables than the MP group, and had more severe dissociative, borderline and Schneiderian symptoms than the Chr-PTSD sample. Shame and complex PTSD symptoms fell marginally short of predicting reductions in relationship esteem, pathological dissociative symptoms predicted increased relationship depression, and complex PTSD symptoms predicted fear of relationships. Limitations: The representativeness of the samples was unknown. Conclusion: Severe psychiatric symptoms differentiate DDs from chronic PTSD, while dissociation and shame have a meaningful impact on specific markers of relationship functioning in psychiatric patients with a history of child abuse and neglect.

Hypoesthesia of the malleolus as a soft sign in depression,"Background: Physical signs often are present in many psychiatric conditions, making up a fundamental part of them and accompanying the psychiatric manifestations themselves. Identifying minor neurological signs is especially of interest due to they are easily accessible through simple neurological examination and could be a useful if underused tool for the diagnostic process and patient therapy. Method: A group of depressed patients ( n = 85) and group of healthy individuals ( n = 101) that served as control were examined using the Wartenberg wheel, a medical device for neurological use, in order to determine the presence of hypoesthesia on both sides of their ankles. Results: The data revealed: i) patients with depression are generally more likely to present malleolar hypoesthesia than healthy participants; and ii) participants who presented malleolar hypoesthesia presented greater depressive symptomatology as well as greater anxiety symptomatology at the time of assessment. Limitations: Although all patients in this study were taking psychotropic medication, anxiolytics and antidepressants are not associated with skin sensitivity. As is usual, the categorization of hypoesthesia is based on participant subjectivity. However, this subjectivity cannot explain the differences between depressed patients and healthy individuals. Conclusions: The present findings corroborate that localized tactile sensitivity is altered in depression and correlates with anxiety-depressive symptomatology, even on a subclinical level. The observation of neurological soft signs such as the detection of malleolar hypoesthesia in patients with depressive symptomatology is easily accessible using a simple neurological examination, and it could became a powerful tool that could provide objective information on affective disorders.

How does the ICD-10 symptom rating (ISR) with four items assess depression compared to the BDI-II? A validation study,"Objective: The “ICD-10 Symptom-Rating” (ISR) is a novel 29-item self-rating questionnaire with scales for the assessment of depression, anxiety, OCD, somatisation and eating disorders and additional items. This study aims at the validation of the depression subscale. Methods: Based on a sample of 1844 depressed inpatients, the ISR was correlated with the Beck-Depression-Inventory-II (BDI-II). To estimate the sensitivity to change, the effect sizes were also calculated. Results: The correlation between ISR and BDI-II was r = 0.79. The sensitivity to change for the BDI-II was d = 1.44, for the ISR-depression scale d = 1.64. Limitations: The studied sample shows a higher psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, a lower mean age and a higher level of education than comparable samples from other psychiatric or psychosomatic studies. Although we cannot find any effects of these differences on our results, they cannot be fully dismissed without further study. Conclusion: The ISR-depression scale correlates highly with the BDI-II. Being more sensitive to change than the BDI-II, the ISR is a useful tool to diagnose and measure the severity and course of depression.

Features preceding diagnosis of bipolar versus major depressive disorders,"Background: Better and earlier predictive differentiation of bipolar (BD) vs. unipolar major depressive disorder (UD) diagnoses should improve long-term clinical planning. Methods: We reviewed randomly selected clinical records of 334 adults diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR BD-I ( n = 109), BD-II ( n = 106), and UD ( n = 119) and compared features preceding major affective episodes or diagnoses, using bivariate, multivariate, and Bayesian methods. Results: We identified antecedents selectively associated with later BD vs. UD in 52.6% vs. 31.1% of subjects in childhood, starting at age 7.4 years, and 60.0% vs. 32.8% in adolescence, with far more features in BD than UD cases (10.3 vs. 4.64/100 person-years; p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate modeling, BD-selective factors were: younger at first clinical event &gt; male sex &gt; family BD-history &gt; cyclothymic or hyperthymic temperament &gt; antecedents/person-year. Nonaffective (anxiety, eating, or substance-use) disorders preceded BD vs. UD in 41.4% vs. 28.6% of subjects ( p = 0.02). By ROC analysis, differential prediction of BD vs. UD was optimal with any ≥ 3 factors/person. Limitations: The validity and timing of antecedent events and factors identified retrospectively from clinical records could not be verified independently, but information was recorded systematically and consistently by a single mood-disorder expert prior to diagnosis, and extracted by two independent observers. Comment: Early clinical features distinguished later BD from UD, often by years. Such prediction should improve treatment-planning and limit risk of mood-switching.

Validity of Gotland Male Depression Scale for male depression in a community study: The Sudurnesjamenn study,"Background: Several studies suggest a “male depressive syndrome”, where not only the standard symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) but also symptoms of anxiety, anger, irritability and antisocial behaviour are prominent. Method: In a community study, 534 males were screened for possible depression by the Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS) and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI). For comparison psychiatrists examined a sub-sample of healthy and depressive males ( n = 137). The validity of the GMDS was compared both with the BDI and MDD diagnosis according to DSM-IV. Results: GMDS was as good as BDI for screening males. ROC-curve analysis gave AUC 0.945 (95% CI 0.923–0.968) for GMDS when tested against BDI. Second, when both scales were tested by ROC-curves against DSM-IV, the GMDS had AUC = 0.861 (95% CI 0.800–0.921) and BDI had AUC = 0.822 (95% CI 0.751–0.893). The estimated prevalence was 14–15%. Limitations: Low participation rate (25%) in the screening phase. Conclusion: GMDS is a valid screening tool for detecting male depression (MDD). Furthermore it is a short self-rating scale, easy to use in daily practice to screen for depression. Our results support recent reports of high prevalence of depressions in the community which supports active screening of males in clinical practice.

The effectiveness of short- and long-term psychotherapy on personality functioning during a 5-year follow-up,"Background: Only few randomized trials comparing sustained effects of short- and long-term psychotherapies in personality functioning are available. In this study we compared the effects of two short-term therapies and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy on patients’ personality functioning during a 5-year follow-up. Methods: Altogether 326 patients of the Helsinki Psychotherapy Study, with anxiety or mood disorder, were randomly assigned to either short-term psychotherapy of about six months (solution-focused therapy (SFT, n = 97) or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP, n = 101)), or to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP, n = 128), lasting on average three years. Outcomes in personality functioning (i.e., self-concept, defense style, interpersonal problems, and level of personality organization) were assessed five to seven times using, respectively, questionnaires (SASB, DSQ, IIP) and interview (LPO) during the 5-year follow-up from randomization. Results: Personality functioning improved in all therapy groups. Both short-term therapies fared better than LPP during the first year of follow-up, by faster improvement in self-concept and decrease in immature defense style. SFT also showed more early reduction of interpersonal problems. However, LPP thereafter showed larger and more sustained benefits than SFT and SPP, through greater changes in self-concept. Additionally, LPP outperformed SFT at the end of the follow-up in IIP and LPO, after adjustment for auxiliary treatment. No differences were noted between the short-term therapies at any measurement point. Limitations: Auxiliary treatment was used relatively widely which limits generalization to exclusive use of short- or long-term therapy. Conclusions: LPP seems to be somewhat more effective than short-term therapies in facilitating longterm changes in personality functioning.

Long-term trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and their antenatal predictors,"Background: Depressive symptoms, often long-term or recurrent, are common among mothers of young children and a well-known risk for child well-being. We aimed to explore the antecedents of the long-term trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and to define the antenatal factors predicting the high-symptom trajectories. Methods: The sample comprised 329 mothers from maternity centers. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) antenatally and at two months, six months, 4–5 years, 8–9 years and 16–17 years after delivery. Maternal expectations concerning the baby were assessed with the Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI). Background information was gathered with questionnaires. Results: A model including four symptom trajectories (very low, low-stable, high-stable and intermittent) was selected to describe the symptom patterns over time. The high-stable and the intermittent trajectory were both predicted pairwise by a high antenatal EPDS sum score as well as high EPDS anxiety and depression subscores but the other predictors were specific for each trajectory. In multivariate analyses, the high-stable trajectory was predicted by a high antenatal EPDS sum score, a high EPDS anxiety subscore, diminished life satisfaction, loneliness and more negative expectations of babies on average. The intermittent trajectory was predicted by a high antenatal EPDS sum score, a poor relationship with own mother and urgent desire to conceive. Limitations: Only self-report questionnaires were used. The sample size was rather small. Conclusions: The results suggest a heterogeneous course and background of maternal depressive symptoms. This should be considered in intervention planning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2015
Significance of borderline personality-spectrum symptoms among adolescents with bipolar disorder,"Background: Little is known regarding correlates of borderline personality-spectrum symptoms (BPSS) among adolescents with bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: Participants were 90 adolescents, 13–19 years of age, who fulfilled DSM-IV-TR criteria for BP using semi-structured diagnostic interviews. BPSS status was ascertained using the Life Problems Inventory which assessed identity confusion, interpersonal problems, impulsivity, and emotional lability. Analyses compared adolescents with “high” versus “low” BPSS based on a median split. Results: Participants with high, relative to low, BPSS were younger, and had greater current and past depressive episode severity, greater current hypo/manic episode severity, younger age of depression onset, and reduced global functioning. High BPSS participants were more likely to have BP-II, and had higher rates of social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, homicidal ideation, assault of others, non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, and physical abuse. Despite greater illness burden, high BPSS participants reported lower rates of lithium use. The most robust independent predictors of high BPSS, identified in multivariate analyses, included lifetime social phobia, non-suicidal self-injury, reduced global functioning, and conduct and/or oppositional defiant disorder. Limitations: The study design is cross-sectional and cannot determine causality. Conclusions: High BPSS were associated with greater mood symptom burden and functional impairment. Presence of high BPSS among BP adolescents may suggest the need to modify clinical monitoring and treatment practices. Future prospective studies are needed to examine the direction of observed associations, the effect of treatment on BPSS, and the effect of BPSS as a moderator or predictor of treatment response.

"Corrigendum to ""Treatment adherence towards prescribed medications in bipolar-II acute depressed patients: Relationship with cyclothymic temperament and “therapeutic sensation seeking” in response towards subjective intolerance to pain""","Reports an error in ""Treatment adherence towards prescribed medications in bipolar-II acute depressed patients: Relationship with cyclothymic temperament and “therapeutic sensation seeking” in response towards subjective intolerance to pain"" by Michele Fornaro, Domenico De Berardis, Felice Iasevoli, Maria Luisa Pistorio, Emanuela D'Angelo, Sergio Mungo, Matteo Martino, Antonio Ventriglio, Carlo Ignazio Cattaneo, Ettore Favaretto, Alessandro del Debbio, Anna Romano, Giovanni Ciampa, Mai Elassy, Giulio Perugi and Concetta de Pasquale ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2013[Nov], Vol 151[2], 596-604). In the original article, there were some errors, the corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-27614-001). Background: Treatment adherence (TA) is crucial during almost any phase of bipolar disorder (BD), including type-II (BD-II) acute depression. While a number of issues have been traditionally accounted on the matter, additional factors should be likewise involved, including affective temperaments and some clinically suggestive psychopathological traits whose systematic assessment represents the aim of this study. Methods: Two hundred and twenty BD-II acute depressed outpatients were consecutively evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interviews for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Axis-I and II Disorders, Hamilton scales for Depression and Anxiety, Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis Pisa Paris San Diego-Auto-questionnaire-110-item, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Zuckerman's Sensation-Seeking Scale-Form-V (SSS-V), Barratt's Impulsivity Scale-11-item, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory modules, Severity module of the Clinical Global Impression Scale for BD, Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and the Clinician Rating Scale (CRS). Patients were divided into non-adherent vs. treatment-adherent cases depending on MMAS-8+CRS scores. Results: In the TA − group, higher VAS and cyclothymic temperament scores were highly correlated ( r = .699; p ≤ .001). Those latter scores, along with SSS-V scores and the occurrence of lifetime addiction to painkiller and/or homeopathic medications available over the counter defined a “ therapeutic sensation seeking ” pattern allowing to correctly classify as much as 93.9% [Exp(B) = 3.490; p ≤ .001] of TA − cases (49/220). Limits: Lack of objective TA measures and systematic pharmacological record; recall bias on some diagnoses; and relatively small sample size. Conclusions: Stating the burden of TA in BD, additional studies on this regard are aimed, ideally contributing to enhance the management of BD itself.

Treatment and outcomes for patients with depression who are partial responders to ssri treatment: Post-hoc analysis findings from the FINDER European Observational Study,"Background: Remission is the goal in depression, but in practice many patients only experience a partial response to treatment. We sought to determine the prevalence, management and subsequent outcomes of partial responder patients. Methods: Patients enrolled in the naturalistic Factors Influencing Depression Endpoints Research (FINDER) study with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale (HADS-D) score &gt;10 at baseline who received only SSRI(s) between 0 and 3 months comprised the study cohort (n=1147). Patients were categorized as remitters, partial responders or non-responders at 3 months and then followed up at 6 months. Results: At 3 months, 29.4% of the study population were considered non-responders, 27.6% were partial responders, and 39.3% were remitters. Most partial responders at 3 months remained on the same SSRI for the next 3 months. Of the 247 partial responders at 3 months and remained on the same SSRI(s) between 3 and 6 months, 10.9% met criteria for non-response at 6 months, 32.4% remained partial responders, and 56.3% achieved remission. Quality of life outcomes for the partial responders were significantly worse than those in remission (p&lt;0.05). Limitations: FINDER was an observational study; the current analysis was conducted post-hoc. Multivariable methods were not applied and findings are primarily descriptive and exploratory. Conclusions: Partial response is common and patients in partial response have a poorer quality of life than those achieving remission. Despite this, the majority of partial responders continue to take the same SSRI. Our findings underscore the importance of continuing to strive for remission.

"Temperamental differences between bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Some implications for their diagnostic validity","Background: The relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder (BD), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires further elucidation. Methods: Seventy-four adult psychiatric in- and out-patients, each of them having received one of these diagnoses on clinical assessment, were interviewed and compared in terms of diagnostic overlap, age and sex distribution, comorbid substance, anxiety and eating disorders, and affective temperament. Results: Diagnostic overlap within the three disorders was 54%. Comorbidity patterns and gender ratio did not differ. The disorders showed very similar levels of cyclothymia. Limitations: Sample size was small and only a limited number of validators were tested. Conclusions: The similar extent of cyclothymic temperament suggests mood lability as a common denominator of BPD, BD, and ADHD.

Thalamocortical abnormalities in auditory brainstem response patterns distinguish DSM-IV bipolar disorder type I from schizophrenia,"Background: Bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) belongs to a spectrum of affective disorders that are expressed in many different ways and therefore can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions, especially unipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia (SZ), but also anxiety and personality disorders. Since early diagnosis and treatment have shown to improve the long-term prognosis, complementary specific biomarkers are of great value. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) has previously been applied successfully to identify specific abnormal ABR patterns in SZ and Asperger syndrome. Methods: The current study investigated the early auditory processing of complex sound stimuli e.g. forward masking, in BP-I compared to SZ patients. The ABR curves of BP-I patients ( n =23) and SZ patients ( n =20) were analyzed in terms of peak amplitudes and correlation with an ABR norm curve based on a non-psychiatric control group ( n =20). Results: BP-I patients had significantly higher wave III ( p =0.0062) and wave VII ( p =0.0472) amplitudes compared with SZ patients. Furthermore, BP-I patients, and to a lesser extent SZ patients, showed low correlation with the norm ABR curve in the part of the curve comprising waves VI–VII. Limitations: Sample size was relatively small and study groups were not matched for age and gender. Conclusions: BP-I patients showed specific aberrances, specifically in the latter part of the ABR curve, implicating abnormalities in thalamocortical circuitry. The abnormal ABR wave patterns significantly separated BP-I patients from SZ patients suggesting that ABR might serve as a biomarker for BP-I.

Does help-seeking alter the risk for incident psychopathology in adolescents and young adults with and without fearful spells or panic attacks? Findings from a 10-year prospective-longitudinal community study,"Background: Although fearful spells (FS) and panic attacks (PA) increase the risk for various mental disorders, few studies have examined whether help-seeking in those with FS/PA attenuates the risk for incident psychopathology. Methods: A community sample of adolescents and young adults (N=2978, aged 14–24 at baseline) was followed up in up to 3 assessment waves over 10 years. FS, PA, psychopathology, and help-seeking were assessed using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. Logistic regressions with interaction terms (adjusted for sex and age) were used to test interactions between FS/PA and help-seeking at baseline on predicting incident psychopathology at follow-up. Cases with panic disorder (PD) at baseline were excluded from all analyses. Results: FS/PA at baseline predicted the onset of any disorder, any anxiety disorder, PD, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and depression at follow-up (Odds Ratios, OR 1.62–5.80). FS/PA and help-seeking at baseline interacted on predicting incident PD (OR=0.09) and depression (OR=0.22) at follow-up in a way that FS/PA only predicted the respective disorders in individuals not seeking help at baseline. In those with FS/PA, a higher number of panic symptoms interacted with help-seeking on predicting incident PD (OR=0.63) in a way that a higher number of panic symptoms only increased the risk for PD in those without help-seeking at baseline. Limitations: Help-seeking at baseline was not restricted to panic-specific interventions, but included treatment due to other psychological problems as well. Conclusions: Findings suggest that early help-seeking might modify psychopathology trajectories and prevent incident disorders in high-risk individuals with FS/PA.

Clinical course of the bipolar II disorder in a Japanese sample,"Background: The bipolar II disorder has been recognized a mental disorder distinctive from the bipolar I disorder, showing the stability of diagnosis in prospective studies. However, the characterization of the bipolar II disorder still remains under investigation. Methods: The present study was conducted on consecutively admitted bipolar II inpatients diagnosed by DSM-IV-TR to delineate the clinical features. Results: The types of initial mood disorders of the bipolar II inpatients were divided into four groups, i.e., major depressive episode (MDE), hypomanic episode (HME), and dysthymic and cyclothymic disorders. Seventy-one percent of all the patients belonged to the MDE group, a half of which underwent the first HME following the first MDE. The number of patients that exhibited the HME within one year after the first MDE was the highest in a widely distributed interval of years between the first MDE and the first HME. The cyclothymic disorder group was relatively young at the onset and was more prone to attempt suicide. Moreover, there might be a complex connection with other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, in the longitudinal course of the bipolar disorder. Limitation: The present study was carried out on a limited number of patients admitted to one hospital. The data are partly based on the retrospective information from the patients and their relatives. The generalization of the results requires further studies. Conclusion: The bipolar II disorder could be divided into heterogeneous groups in the longitudinal course. Hence, paying attention to the heterogeneity in clinical practice and a study of the disorder are required.

Shared clinical associations between obesity and impulsivity in rapid cycling bipolar disorder: A systematic review,"Background: Obesity seems to show a two-way relationship with bipolar disorder (BD), representing not only a possible vulnerability factor but also a consequence of chronic mood dysregulation associated with an overall poor prognosis. Increased impulsivity has been described across all stages and phases of BD as being also associated with a worse prognosis. Although obesity and impulsivity are common features among rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RC-BD) patients, there is a lack of understanding about the clinical implications of these conditions combined in BD. Methods: To explore and integrate available evidence on shared clinical associations between obesity and impulsivity in RC-BD a systematic search of the literature in the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) has been conducted. Results: One hundred and fourteen articles were included in our systematic review. Among RC-BD patients, substance abuse disorders (SUDs), anxiety disorders (ADs), predominantly depressive polarity, chronic exposure to antidepressants, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and comorbid medical conditions are strongly associated with both obesity and impulsivity. Limitations: Heterogeneity of published data, inconsistent measurements of both obesity and impulsivity in RC-BD and an absence of control for RC-BD in epidemiological surveys. Consequently, their combined impact on the severity of RC-BD is yet to be recognized and remains to be poorly understood. Conclusion: In RC-BD patients the co-occurrence of obesity and impulsivity is associated with an unfavorable course of illness, specific shared clinical correlates, negative psychosocial impact, and overall worse prognosis. There is a need to examine obesity and impulsivity as modulating factors and markers of severity in RC-BD.

Exercise or basic body awareness therapy as add-on treatment for major depression: A controlled study,"Background: While physical exercise as adjunctive treatment for major depression has received considerable attention in recent years, the evidence is conflicting. This study evaluates the effects of two different add-on treatments: exercise and basic body awareness therapy. Methods: Randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups and one control, including 62 adults on antidepressant medication, who fulfilled criteria for current major depression as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Interventions (10 weeks) were aerobic exercise or basic body awareness therapy (BBAT), compared to a single consultation with advice on physical activity. Primary outcome was depression severity, rated by a blinded assessor using the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes were global function, cardiovascular fitness, self-rated depression, anxiety and body awareness. Results: Improvements in MADRS score (mean change=−10.3, 95% CI (−13.5 to −7.1), p = 0.038) and cardiovascular fitness (mean change=2.4ml oxygen/kg/min, 95% CI (1.5 to 3.3), p = 0.017) were observed in the exercise group. Per-protocol analysis confirmed the effects of exercise, and indicated that BBAT has an effect on self-rated depression. Limitations: The small sample size and the challenge of missing data. Participants' positive expectations regarding the exercise intervention need to be considered. Conclusions: Exercise in a physical therapy setting seems to have effect on depression severity and fitness, in major depression. Our findings suggest that physical therapy can be a viable clinical strategy to inspire and guide persons with major depression to exercise. More research is needed to clarify the effects of basic body awareness therapy.

Childhood trauma associates with clinical features of bipolar disorder in a sample of Chinese patients,"Objectives: Childhood trauma is a major public health problem which has a long-term consequence, a few studies have examined the relationship between childhood trauma and clinical features of bipolar disorder, most in western culture, with no such studies done in Chinese culture. Methods: The CTQ-SF was administered to 132 Chinese patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Participants also completed the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA.Q), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The CTQ-SF cut-off scores for exposure were used to calculate the prevalence of trauma. The relationship between childhood trauma and clinical features of bipolar disorder were examined. Results: The internal consistency of CTQ-SF was good (Cronbach's α=0.826) and four week test–retest reliability was high ( r =0.755). 61.4% of this sample reported physical neglect (PN) in childhood, followed by emotional neglect (EN, 49.6%), sexual abuse (SA, 40.5%), emotional abuse (EA, 26.0%) and physical abuse (PA,13.1%). Significant negative correlations existed between age of onset and EA and EN score ( r =−0.178~–0.183, p &lt;0.05). Significant positive correlations were observed between EA, CTQ-SF total score and intrusion and hyper-arousal scores of IES-R (r=0.223~0.309, p &lt;0.05). Similarly, significant positive correlations were found between EN, PN, CTQ-SF total and STAI score (r=0.222~0.425, p &lt;0.05). Limitations: Data on childhood trauma were derived from a retrospective self-report questionnaire without independent corroboration. A number of potential patients (more severe or chronic patients) was excluded because they were either refused to participate or inappropriate to participate in research. Conclusions: Significant number of subjects in patients with BD reported experience of childhood abuse and neglect. Exposure to childhood trauma is associated with age of onset of illness, co morbid PTSD and anxiety symptoms. To study the pathogenesis of childhood trauma on bipolar disorder and explanation the interaction between childhood trauma and susceptibility genes are proposed.

Bipolar disorder in adults with Asperger's Syndrome: A systematic review,"Background: Asperger's Syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder included in the Autism Spectrum (ASD). The current literature shows growing evidence of a high rate of comorbidity between AS and other psychiatric disorders, particularly Bipolar Disorder (BD). We reviewed available epidemiological and clinical data on BD–AS comorbidity and its diagnostic and therapeutic implications Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted through PubMed, Scopus and Psych-Info using combinations of the following search terms: Asperger's Syndrome, Bipolar Disorder, depression, mood disorder, psychiatric comorbidity, treatment, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Results: BD prevalence in adults with AS ranges from 6% to 21.4% of the cases. Relatives of patients with AS showed a doubled risk of being affected by BD and a BD prevalence near to 10%. When comorbid with AS, BD assumes peculiar features which might shape its under-recognition or misdiagnosis (especially schizophrenia when psychotic symptoms are prominent). Although controlled data on pharmacological treatments in BD–AS comorbidity are substantially lacking, information is derived by open observations, case series and chart reviews. Mood stabilizers should be considered the first choice, and antipsychotics, especially second generation drugs (SGA) with 5-HT2a antagonism, have been shown useful in controlling psychotic and behavioral symptoms and improving social withdrawal. Some evidence of efficacy for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depression is reported for SSRI antidepressants. The use of these drugs should be carefully monitored, because activation with hypomanic or manic switches is reported up to 54% of the treated subjects. Conclusion: BD in AS patients is frequent, usually it onsets during adolescence and is often characterized by atypical presentation, making its correct identification particularly difficult. A correct diagnosis of BD in AS individuals has relevant implications on the choice of adequate psychopharmacological, psycho-social and rehabilitative treatments.

Coping strategies as mediators of the effect of the START (Strategies for RelaTives) intervention on psychological morbidity for family carers of people with dementia in a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Family carers of people with dementia frequently become depressed or anxious. In observational studies, more emotion-focused and less dysfunctional coping predict fewer psychological symptoms, but no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has directly investigated emotion-focused coping as mediator of effectiveness of a successful psychological intervention. We hypothesised that emotion-focused coping would mediate the START psychological intervention's effects in an RCT. We tested whether mediated effects were moderated by severity of baseline symptoms. Methods: 260 family carers from NHS dementia services were randomised to START (manualised coping skills intervention), or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Blinded raters administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-T) and Brief COPE inventory at baseline, 4 and 8 months. HADS-T improved in the intervention group when compared to TAU at all levels of psychological distress. We tested whether coping was a mediator and for moderated mediation, and (post-hoc) subgroup treatment effects on coping. Results: Data were available for 187 carers (71.9%) for the mediation analysis. The reduced HADS-T score in the intervention group was mediated by increased emotion-focused coping only among carers with higher (16+) baseline HADS-T scores (mediated effect=−0.63 [−1.11, −0.15]; proportion of overall effect=33% [3%, 64%]). Limitations: We did not measure plausible psychosocial treatment mechanisms other than coping. Conclusions: START benefited family carers both in preventing and treating psychological morbidity, through different mechanisms of action. The most psychologically distressed carers increased their emotion-focused coping and did not decrease their dysfunctional coping, while others benefited but not through this mechanism.

Comorbidity between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder in a specialized mood disorders outpatient clinic,"Background: Comorbidity between ADHD and Bipolar Disorder (BD) is associated with greater severity of BD. The current study aims at investigating, in a specialized mood disorders clinic, the percentage of comorbid ADHD–BD subjects and assessing the impact of ADHD on the severity of BD. Methods: Out of 539 mood disorders subjects, the medical records of 138 BD subjects were scrutinized in terms of their clinical and demographic characteristics, and their scores at the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist were logged. Those positively scoring at the ASRS-v1.1 underwent clinical assessment by a senior psychiatrist specialized in ADHD. Comorbid ADHD–BD subjects were then compared with BD sufferers without ADHD. Results: Sixty-three (45.65%) of the participants were screened positive at the ASRS-v1.1. 49 were clinically assessed for the presence of ADHD. Only 27 (55%) received a diagnosis of ADHD. Comorbid ADHD–BD subjects were found to be younger at the onset of BD, showed higher numbers of depressive episodes, more anxiety and substance use disorders, more borderline personality traits and greater cyclothymic temperament. Comorbid BD–ADHD subjects reported more childhood emotional abuse. Limitations: Some subjects were unreachable and thus not clinically assessed for ADHD. Conclusions: More than 20% of BD subjects were suffering from ADHD. The comorbidity of the two disorders was associated with worse outcomes, possibly resulting from stressful early-life events. More than 40% of the subjects who scored positively at the ASRS-v1.1 did not suffer from ADHD, which suggests that this scale should be used with caution in BD subjects.

Differences in risk factors for self-harm with and without suicidal intent: Findings from the ALSPAC cohort,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether self-harm with suicidal intent differs in aetiology and prognosis from non-suicidal self-harm, and whether they should be considered as different diagnostic categories. Method: Participants were 4799 members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK population-based birth cohort who completed a postal questionnaire on self-harm with and without suicidal intent at age 16 years. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences in the risk factor profiles of individuals who self-harmed with and without suicidal intent. Results: Many risk factors were common to both behaviours, but associations were generally stronger in relation to suicidal self-harm. This was particularly true for mental health problems; compared to those with non-suicidal self-harm, those who had harmed with suicidal intent had an increased risk of depression (OR 3.50[95% CI 1.64, 7.43]) and anxiety disorder (OR 3.50[95% CI 1.72, 7.13]). Higher IQ and maternal education were risk factors for non-suicidal self-harm but not suicidal self-harm. Risk factors that appeared specific to suicidal self-harm included lower IQ and socioeconomic position, physical cruelty to children in the household and parental self-harm. Limitations: i) There was some loss to follow-up, ii) difficulty in measuring suicidal intent, iii) we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causation for some exposure variables, iv) we were unable to identify the subgroup that had only ever harmed with suicidal intent. Conclusion: Self-harm with and without suicidal intent are overlapping behaviours but with some distinct characteristics, indicating the importance of fully exploring vulnerability factors, motivations, and intentions in adolescents who self harm.

An fMRI study of emotional face processing in adolescent major depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) often begins during adolescence when the brain is still maturing. To better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of MDD early in development, this study examined brain function in response to emotional faces in adolescents with MDD and healthy (HC) adolescents using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Method: Thirty-two unmedicated adolescents with MDD and 23 healthy age- and gender-matched controls completed an fMRI task viewing happy and fearful faces. Fronto-limbic regions of interest (ROI; bilateral amygdala, insula, subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortices) and whole-brain analyses were conducted to examine between-group differences in brain function. Results: ROI analyses revealed that patients had greater bilateral amygdala activity than HC in response to viewing fearful versus happy faces, which remained significant when controlling for comorbid anxiety. Whole-brain analyses revealed that adolescents with MDD had lower activation compared to HC in a right hemisphere cluster comprised of the insula, superior/middle temporal gyrus, and Heschl's gyrus when viewing fearful faces. Brain activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex was inversely correlated with depression severity. Limitations: Limitations include a cross-sectional design with a modest sample size and use of a limited range of emotional stimuli. Conclusions: Results replicate previous studies that suggest emotion processing in adolescent MDD is associated with abnormalities within fronto-limbic brain regions. Findings implicate elevated amygdalar arousal to negative stimuli in adolescents with depression and provide new evidence for a deficit in functioning of the saliency network, which may be a future target for early intervention and MDD treatment.

The chronic impact of work on suicides and under-utilization of psychiatric and psychosocial services,"Background: Work-related stress appears to be a contributing factor in the lives of employed people who kill themselves, particularly during economic downturns. However, few studies have compared them with working community controls who may be experiencing similar strains, in order to explore the role of mental disorders in these deaths and the implication of such strains on their service use pattern. We hypothesized that both work stress and mental illness were associated with suicides, and that mental illness served as the mediator between work stress and suicide. Based on the Behavioral Model, we also assumed work stress associated with their use of services. Methods: A sample of 175 employed individuals (suicides=63; controls=112) drawn from a psychological autopsy (PA) dataset was examined based on demographics and socioeconomic factors, psychiatric diagnoses and use of services, psychosocial factors, and life events. A mediator analysis was conducted to examine the impact of work on suicides. Results: Suicides generally had depression and anxiety, debts, higher impulsivity and poorer social support in comparison to controls. Chronic impact from work, which was fully mediated by psychiatric illness, was found higher among those suicides that did not seek contact with clinical service providers. Limitations: PA is a post-hoc cross-sectional comparison method which does not allow causal analyses. Conclusion: It is important to develop new approaches for engaging vulnerable individuals in the workplace before they become suicidal, as their depression and social isolation can serve to cut them off from help when they are most in need. Occupational mental health programs should be made available for employees and their families.

"""Intact anger recognition in depression despite aberrant visual facial information usage"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Intact anger recognition in depression despite aberrant visual facial information usage"" by Cameron M. Clark, Carina G. Chiu, Ruth L. Diaz and Vina M. Goghari ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2014[Aug][20], Vol 165, 196-202). In the original article, the figure caption accompanying figure 1 incorrectly labeled the color maps for row C. The corrected figure caption is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-23424-032). Background: Previous literature has indicated abnormalities in facial emotion recognition abilities, as well as deficits in basic visual processes in major depression. However, the literature is unclear on a number of important factors including whether or not these abnormalities represent deficient or enhanced emotion recognition abilities compared to control populations, and the degree to which basic visual deficits might impact this process. Methods: The present study investigated emotion recognition abilities for angry versus neutral facial expressions in a sample of undergraduate students with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores indicative of moderate depression (i.e. ≥ 20), compared to matched low-BDI-II score (i.e. ≤ 2) controls via the Bubbles Facial Emotion Perception Task. Results: Results indicated unimpaired behavioural performance in discriminating angry from neutral expressions in the high depressive symptoms group relative to the minimal depressive symptoms group, despite evidence of an abnormal pattern of visual facial information usage. Limitations: The generalizability of the current findings is limited by the highly structured nature of the facial emotion recognition task used, as well as the use of an analog sample undergraduates scoring high in self-rated symptoms of depression rather than a clinical sample. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that basic visual processes are involved in emotion recognition abnormalities in depression, demonstrating consistency with the emotion recognition literature in other psychopathologies (e.g. schizophrenia, autism, social anxiety). Future research should seek to replicate these findings in clinical populations with major depression, and assess the association between aberrant face gaze behaviours and symptom severity and social functioning.

Gender differences in a cohort of major depressive patients: Further evidence for the male depression syndrome hypothesis,"Background: Previous studies have shown that major depressive patients may differ in several features according to gender, but the existence of a specific male depressive syndrome remains controversial. Methods: As part of the EPIDEP National Multisite French Study of 493 consecutive DSM-IV major depressive patients evaluated in at least two semi-structured interviews 1 month apart, 125 (27.7%) were of male gender, whereas 317 (72.3%) were female, after exclusion of bipolar I patients. Results: Compared to women, men were more often married, had more associated mixed features, with more bipolar disorder NOS, more hyperthymic temperaments, and less depressive temperaments. Women had an earlier age at onset of depression, more depressive episodes and suicide attempts. A higher family loading was shown in men for bipolar disorder, alcohol use disorder, impulse control disorders and suicide, whereas their family loading for major depressive disorder was lower. Men displayed more comorbidities with alcohol use, impulse control, and cardiovascular disorders, with lower comorbidities with eating, anxiety and endocrine/metabolic disorders. The following independent variables were associated with male gender: hyperthymic temperament (+), alcohol use disorder (+), impulse control disorders (+), and depressive temperament (−). Limitations: The retrospective design and the lack of specific tools to assess the male depressive syndrome. Conclusion: Study findings may lend support to the male depression syndrome concept and draw attention to the role of hyperthymic temperament, soft bipolarity as well as comorbidities as determinants of this syndrome. The latter could help recognize an entity which is probably underdiagnosed, but conveys a high risk of suicide and cardiovascular morbidity.

"""Effect of adjunctive benzodiazepines on clinical outcomes in lithium- or quetiapine-treated outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder: Results from the Bipolar CHOICE trial"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Effect of adjunctive benzodiazepines on clinical outcomes in lithium- or quetiapine-treated outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder: Results from the Bipolar CHOICE trial"" by William V. Bobo, Noreen A. Reilly-Harrington, Terence A. Ketter, Benjamin D. Brody, Gustavo Kinrys, David E. Kemp, Richard C. Shelton, Susan L. McElroy, Louisa G. Sylvia, James H. Kocsis, Melvin G. McInnis, Edward S. Friedman, Vivek Singh, Mauricio Tohen, Charles L. Bowden, Thilo Deckersbach, Joseph R. Calabrese, Michael E. Thase, Andrew A. Nierenberg, Dustin J. Rabideau, David A. Schoenfeld, Stephen V. Faraone and Masoud Kamali ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2014[Jun][1], Vol 161, 30-35). An error occurred when constructing the “complex polypharmacy” variable for our inverse probability weighted analysis of clinical outcome conditional on benzodiazepine use in the Bipolar CHOICE sample. The error resulted in an over-inclusion of individuals classified as having been treated with complex polypharmacy. This misclassification occurred in both benzodiazepine initiators and non-initiators and did not affect our results or conclusions. Nevertheless, we believe that it is our responsibility to report the error and updated results. Following correction of this error, a higher proportion of benzodiazepine users were still treated with complex polypharmacy than benzodiazepine non-users, with differences occurring at the level of strong statistical trend (5.8% vs. 2.3%, p¼0.05). An updated Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-15135-007). Background: Little is known about the longer-term effects of adjunctive benzodiazepines on symptom response during treatment in patients with bipolar disorders. Methods: The study sample consisted of 482 patients with bipolar I or II disorder enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, multi-site comparison of lithium- and quetiapine-based treatment. Changes in clinical measures (BISS total and subscales, CGI-BP, and CGI-Efficacy Index) were compared between participants who did and did not receive benzodiazepine treatment at baseline or during follow-up. Selected outcomes were also compared between patients who did and did not initiate benzodiazepines during follow-up using stabilized inverse probability weighted analyses. Results: Significant improvement in all outcome measures occurred within each benzodiazepine exposure group. Benzodiazepine users (at baseline or during follow-up) experienced significantly less improvement in BISS total, BISS irritability, and CGI-BP scores than did benzodiazepine non-users. There were no significant differences in these measures between patients who did and did not initiate benzodiazepines during follow-up in the weighted analyses. There was no significant effect of benzodiazepine use on any outcome measure in patients with comorbid anxiety or substance use disorders. Limitations: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized effectiveness trial that was not designed to address differential treatment response according to benzodiazepine use. Conclusions: Adjunctive benzodiazepines may not significantly affect clinical outcome in lithium- or quetiapine-treated patients with bipolar I or II disorder over 6 months, after controlling for potential confounding factors.

"Curcumin for the treatment of major depression: A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study","Background: Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those associated with monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and neuroprogression. We hypothesised that curcumin would be effective for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder. Methods: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 56 individuals with major depressive disorder were treated with curcumin (500mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary measure was the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR₃₀). Secondary outcomes included IDS-SR₃₀ factor scores and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: From baseline to week 4, both curcumin and placebo were associated with improvements in IDS-SR₃₀ total score and most secondary outcome measures. From weeks 4 to 8, curcumin was significantly more effective than placebo in improving several mood-related symptoms, demonstrated by a significant group x time interaction for IDS-SR₃₀ total score ( F 1, 53 = 4.22, p = .045) and IDS-SR30 mood score ( F 1, 53 = 6.51, p = .014), and a non-significant trend for STAI trait score ( F 1, 48 = 2.86, p = .097). Greater efficacy from curcumin treatment was identified in a subgroup of individuals with atypical depression. Conclusions: Partial support is provided for the antidepressant effects of curcumin in people with major depressive disorder, evidenced by benefits occurring 4 to 8 weeks after treatment. Limitations: Investigations with larger sample sizes, over extended treatment periods, and with varying curcumin dosages are required.

Adaptation and validation of the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) in Spanish clinical and nonclinical samples,"Background: The short form of the Metacognitions Questionnaire is a brief multidimensional measure of a range of metacognitive processes and metacognitive beliefs about worry and cognition relevant to vulnerability to and maintenance of emotional disorders. The aim of the study was adapt and validate a Spanish version of the short form of the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) and to evaluate its psychometric properties in clinical and nonclinical samples. Method: The MCQ-30 was administered to a sample of 316 patients with psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression, and eating disorders) and to a sample of 169 individuals belonging to the general population. Instrument reliability (internal consistency), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis [CFA], convergent validity, known groups) and responsiveness were measured. Results: The clinical sample scored the highest on all factors when compared to nonclinical sample. The exploratory factor analysis supported the MCQ's original five-factor solution. The CFA suggested a good fit of the model. Correlation with measure of worry demonstrated convergent validity. Known-groups validity was supported by significant differences in the MCQ-30 mean scores according to certain variables, such as educational level and employment status. Limitations: This study did not assess the test–retest reliability. Conclusions: The MCQ-30 has good psychometric properties and can be used to evaluate several dimensions of metacognition in both clinical and nonclinical samples.

Prevalence and correlates of DSM-5 bipolar and related disorders and hyperthymic personality in the community,"Background: To 1) establish the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-5 bipolar and related disorders including the new algorithmically defined conditions grouped within Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorders (OSBARD) as well as hyperthymic personality in a randomly selected community sample, and 2) determine the clinical relevance of the OSBARD category in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, course, comorbidity and treatment patterns by comparing the subjects of this category to those with bipolar-I (BP-I), bipolar-II (BP-II), major depressive disorder (MDD), and those with no history of mood disorders. Methods: The semi-structured Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies was administered by masterslevel psychologists to a random sample of an urban area ( n = 3′719). Results: The lifetime prevalence was 1.0% for BP-I, 0.8% for BP-II, 1.0% for OSBARD and 3% for hyperthymic personality. Subjects with OSBARD were more severely affected than subjects without a history of mood disorders regarding almost all clinical correlates. Compared to those with MDD, they also revealed an elevated risk of suicidal attempts, lower global functioning, more treatment seeking and more lifetime comorbidity including anxiety, substance use and impulse-control disorders. However, they did not differ from subjects with BP-II. Limitations: Small sample sizes for bipolar and related disorders and potential inaccurate recall of symptoms. Conclusions: The modifications of diagnostic criteria for manic/hypomanic episodes according to the DSM-5 only marginally affect the prevalence estimates for BP-I and BP-II. The new DSM-5 OSBARD category is associated with significant clinical burden, is hardly distinct from BP-II with respect to clinical correlates and deserves similar clinical attention.

Somatic and cognitive symptoms as indicators of potential endophenotypes in bipolar spectrum disorders: An exploratory and proof-of-concept study comparing bipolar II disorder with recurrent brief depression and healthy controls,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 175 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2015-10068-027). In the original article there is an error. The correction is present in the erratum.] Background: We examined whether somatic symptoms reported by patients with bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD), in this study defined as bipolar II (BD-2) or recurrent brief depression with (RBD-H) or without (RBD-O) a history of hypomanic symptoms might point to the possible underlying disease markers (endophenotypes). We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more prevalent among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the severity of current mental status (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases. Methods: Sixty-one patients (BD-2: n = 21; RBD-H: n = 19; RBD-O: n = 21) were compared with 21 healthy controls. Assessments included a 123-item somatic symptom checklist; assessments for neuroticism, anxiety and depression. Candidate somatic symptoms were selected using a 4-step inclusion/exclusion procedure. Results: Seven symptoms survived in all three groups: general (fatigue, feeling exhausted); sensory (leaden sensation in legs, pain in the body, impaired sense of smell); cognitive (loss of memory) and autonomic (excessive perspiration). In addition 15 symptoms survived in one or two groups (examples: impaired hearing, hypersensitivity to sound, inability to find words). Limitations: Possible selection bias and small sample size precludes firm conclusions with regards to specific symptoms. Conclusion: Our approach identified symptoms for which an association with BSDs has been suggested previously, as well as symptoms not commonly associated with BSDs. The findings support the feasibility and validity of using assessment of somatic symptoms as an approach to identify potential endophenotypes in BSDs.

Long-term symptomatic and functional outcome following an intensive inpatient multidisciplinary intervention for treatment-resistant affective disorders,"Background: The natural history of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is poor, with high rates of chronicity and recurrence. We describe longer-term symptomatic and functional outcome following multimodal intensive inpatient treatment for TRD. Methods: Symptomatic and functional outcomes were assessed in 71 participants (unipolar, n = 51; bipolar, n = 20) with severe TRD previously treated at a specialist inpatient unit a median of 34 months (IQR 19-52) post discharge. We looked at outcomes in defined subgroups (unipolar, bipolar and psychotic) and at symptom clusters to see whether certain aspects of depression were more resistant to treatment than others. Results: Symptomatic improvement during the admission was maintained at follow up: HDRS21 scores fell from admission (median 22; IQR 19-25) to discharge (median 12; IQR 7-16) and follow-up (median 10; IQR 4-18). Overall, two-thirds of patients were judged to have a good long-term outcome, while half remained in full remission at follow-up. Outcomes were more favourable in bipolar patients, patients without a history of psychosis and patients who were discharged in remission, although a minority of responders at discharge no longer met response criteria at follow up, and conversely some patients discharged as non-responders did subsequently respond. Non-remitting depression was characterised by three main factors; anxiety, cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbance. Those who remitted had better functional outcomes as did those who had experienced a more sustained response to treatment whilst inpatients. Quality of life was poor for those who did not respond to the treatment package. Limitations: Variable follow-up length. Conclusions: This difficult-to-treat population gained long-term benefits from multidisciplinary inpatient treatment. Treatment to remission was associated with more favourable outcomes. Non-responsive depression was characterised by specific symptom clusters that might be amenable to more targeted treatments.

Characterization of patients with mood disorders for their prevalent temperament and level of hopelessness,"Background: Mood disorders (MD) are disabling conditions throughout the world associated with significant psychosocial impairment. Affective temperaments, as well as hopelessness, may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of MD. The present study was designed to characterize patients with MD for their prevalent affective temperament and level of hopelessness. Methods: Five hundred fifty-nine (253 men and 306 women) consecutive adult inpatients were assessed using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire version (TEMPS-A), the Gotland Scale for Male Depression (GSMD), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: Higher cyclothymia and irritable temperaments were found in bipolar disorder-I (BD-I) patients compared to those with other Axis I diagnoses. Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients had lower hyperthymia than BD-I and BD-II patients and higher anxiety than patients with other Axis I diagnoses. Severe “male” depression was more common in BD-II patients compared to BD-I and MDD patients. BD-I patients and those with other axis I diagnoses reported lower BHS ≥ 9 scores than those with BD-II and MDD. Limitations: The study had the limitations of all naturalistic designs, that is, potentially relevant variables were not addressed. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the study did not allow conclusions about causation, and the use of self-report measures could be potentially biased by social desirability. Conclusion: MDD patients were more likely to have higher anxious temperament, higher hopelessness and lower hyperthymic temperament scores, while BD-I patients more often had cyclothymic and irritable temperaments than patients with other Axis I diagnoses. The implications of the present results were discussed.

Is the Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale a useful diagnostic tool?: The CRESCEND study,"Background: The Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) has been validated as a method of assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of psychotic depression (PD). We aimed to compare the results of the PDAS in PD and non-psychotic depression (non-PD) patients and validate the PDAS as a diagnostic tool for PD. Methods: We included 53 patients with PD and 441 with non-PD who participated in the Clinical Research Center for Depression study in South Korea. In addition to the PDAS, psychometric tools including the HAMD₁₇, HAMA, BPRS, CGI-S, SOFAS, SSI-Beck, WHOQOL-BREF, AUDIT, and FTND were used to assess, respectively, depression, anxiety, overall symptoms, global severity, social functioning, suicidal ideation, quality of life, alcohol use, and nicotine use. Results: After adjusting for age and total HAMD₁₇ score, PD patients had higher scores for depressive mood, hallucinations, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, blunted affect, and emotional withdrawal on the PDAS and higher total scores on the SSI-Beck than non-PD patients. Binary logistic regression identified hallucinatory behavior and emotional withdrawal as predictors of PD. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that emotional withdrawal could be used to differentiate psychotic from non-psychotic depression. Limitations: The inter-rater reliability for psychometric assessments was not evaluated. Conclusions: In addition to assessing the severity and treatment outcomes of PD, PDAS can help in the diagnosis of PD.

Negative affectivity as a transdiagnostic factor in patients with common mental disorders,"Background: Screening and monitoring systems are increasingly used in psychotherapy, but it has been questioned whether outcome measurement using multiple questionnaires is warranted. Arguably, type and number of assessment instruments should be determined by empirical research. This study investigated the latent factor structure of a multi-dimensional outcome measurement strategy used in English services aligned to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Methods: Factor analyses and structural equation models were performed on 11,939 intake assessments of outpatients accessing an IAPT service between 2008 and 2010. We examined whether three routinely employed instruments (PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, WSAS for functional impairment) assess empirically different dimensions. Results: The instruments were found to assess mainly one general dimension and only some items of the GAD-7 and WSAS assess unique variance beyond this general dimension. In a structural equation model the disorder-specific factor scores were predicted by patients' diagnostic categories. Limitations: Since a large naturalistic data base was used, missing data for diagnoses and scale items were encountered. Diagnoses were obtained with brief case-finding measures rather than structured diagnostic interviews. Conclusion: Although the items seem to address mostly one dimension, some variance is due to differences between individuals in anxiety and impairment. While this generally supports multi-dimensional assessment in a primary care population, the clinical upshot of the study is to concentrate attention on transdiagnostic factors as a target for treatment.

Profile of depressive symptoms in women in the perinatal and outside the perinatal period: Similar or not?,"Purposes: To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period. Methods: 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age = 29.42 ± 7.159 years) also filled in the questionnaires. Results: Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension. Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes. Limitations: Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age. Conclusion: In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression.

Correlates of psychiatric co-morbidity in a sample of egyptian patients with bipolar disorder,"Background and objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex, chronic mood disorder involving repeated episodes of depression and mania/hypomania. Two thirds of patients with bipolar disorder have a comorbid psychiatric condition. This study aims to assess the prevalence of Axis I diagnosis with its socio-demographic and clinical correlates among a sample of Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: Out of the 400 patients who were enrolled in the study from number of governmental and private psychiatric hospitals in Cairo, Egypt, 350 patients diagnosed with bipolar affective disorders (157 females and 193 males) with age ranging from 18 to 55years were selected. Patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorder (Research Version) (SCID-I). Results: Prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity among BD patients was 20.3% (71 patients) among which 63 patients (18%) had comorbid substance abuse and 8 patients (2.3%) had comorbid anxiety disorders. Limitations: The study was limited by its cross sectional design with some patients having florid symptoms during assessment, not having a well representative community sample. This might have decreased the reliability and prevalence of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity due to uncooperativeness or memory bias. The study group was composed of bipolar patients attending tertiary care service which limits the possibility of generalizing these results on different treatment settings. Conclusions: Substance abuse followed by anxiety disorders was found to be the most common psychiatric comorbidity. Family history of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse as well as current psychotic features were highly correlated with comorbidity.

Characteristics of initial fearful spells and their associations with DSM-IV panic attacks and panic disorder in adolescents and young adults from the community,"Background: Few studies examined characteristics of initial fearful spells (FS) or panic attacks (PA) and their relation to DSM-IV PA and panic disorder (PD). Methods: A community sample of adolescents and young adults ( N = 3021) was followed up in 4 waves (T0–T3) over up to 10 years. FS, PA, and PD were assessed at each wave using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. Characteristics of the initial FS/PA including perceived reasons/triggers, appraisal, duration, and behavioral/emotional consequences of the initial FS/PA were retrospectively assessed at T1 and T2 in those reporting the experience of lifetime FS or PA at these waves ( N = 363). Multinomial logistic regressions adjusted for sex and age were used to reveal associations of initial FS/PA characteristics (aggregated data from T1 and T2) with PA only ( N = 88) and PD ( N = 62; lifetime incidences cumulated across assessment waves) (reference group: No PA/PD). Results: Alcohol consumption, drugs/medication, and physical illness as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA were associated with PA-only (OR 2.46-5.44), while feelings of depression, feelings of anxiety, and having always been anxious/nervous as perceived reasons for the initial FS/PA, appraising the initial FS/PA as terrible and long-term irritating/burdensome, subsequent feelings of depression, subsequent avoidance, and subsequent consumption of medication, alcohol, or drugs were associated with PD (OR 2.64-4.15). A longer duration until “feeling okay again” was associated with both PA-only (OR = 1.29 per category) and PD (OR = 1.63). Limitations: Initial FS/PA characteristics were necessarily assessed retrospectively by self-report only. Thus, our data might be subject to recall/evaluation biases. Aggregated data were used and strictly prospective-longitudinal studies are necessary that replicate our findings. Conclusion: Assessing initial FS/PA characteristics might be useful to identify individuals at increased risk for more severe panic pathology.

Childhood maltreatment and the course of bipolar disorders among adults: Epidemiologic evidence of dose-response effects,"Background: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is highly prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorders (BP); however few studies have examined its potential role in the course and outcome of individuals with BP. We aim to examine the dose response relationship between the number of types of CM and the course of individuals with BP. Methods: As part of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, 1600 adults who met lifetime DSM-IV criteria for BP-I ( n = 1172) and BP-II ( n = 428) were included. Individuals were evaluated using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule- DMS-IV Version and data was analyzed lifetime and from Waves 1 and 2, approximately 3 years apart. Results: Around half of individuals with BP had a history of at least one type of CM. Overall, there was a clear dose-response relationship between number of CM and severity of BP across several domains, including clinical characteristics, probability of treatment, lifetime prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity, incidence of anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and nicotine dependence, and level of psychosocial functioning. Limitations: The interviews were conducted by lay professional interviewers rather than clinicians, use of retrospective report to determine CM in individuals with BP, and not all respondents from Wave 1 were able to be interviewed in Wave 2. Conclusions: The number of types of CM confers developmental differences in the course of BP with a worse course and outcome of BP. Early identification and treatment of CM are warranted to improve the course and outcome of individuals with BP.

Intact anger recognition in depression despite aberrant visual facial information usage,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 168 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2014-40023-011). In the original article, the figure caption accompanying figure 1 incorrectly labeled the color maps for row C. The corrected figure caption is present in the erratum.] Background: Previous literature has indicated abnormalities in facial emotion recognition abilities, as well as deficits in basic visual processes in major depression. However, the literature is unclear on a number of important factors including whether or not these abnormalities represent deficient or enhanced emotion recognition abilities compared to control populations, and the degree to which basic visual deficits might impact this process. Methods: The present study investigated emotion recognition abilities for angry versus neutral facial expressions in a sample of undergraduate students with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores indicative of moderate depression (i.e. ≥ 20), compared to matched low-BDI-II score (i.e. ≤ 2) controls via the Bubbles Facial Emotion Perception Task. Results: Results indicated unimpaired behavioural performance in discriminating angry from neutral expressions in the high depressive symptoms group relative to the minimal depressive symptoms group, despite evidence of an abnormal pattern of visual facial information usage. Limitations: The generalizability of the current findings is limited by the highly structured nature of the facial emotion recognition task used, as well as the use of an analog sample undergraduates scoring high in self-rated symptoms of depression rather than a clinical sample. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that basic visual processes are involved in emotion recognition abnormalities in depression, demonstrating consistency with the emotion recognition literature in other psychopathologies (e.g. schizophrenia, autism, social anxiety). Future research should seek to replicate these findings in clinical populations with major depression, and assess the association between aberrant face gaze behaviours and symptom severity and social functioning.

Further evidence that severe scores in the aggression/anxiety-depression/attention subscales of child behavior checklist (severe dysregulation profile) can screen for bipolar disorder symptomatology: A conditional probability analysis,"Background: Previous work shows that children with high scores (2SD, combined score ≥ 210) on the Attention Problems, Aggressive Behavior, and Anxious-Depressed (A-A-A) subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) are more likely than other children to meet criteria for bipolar (BP)-I disorder. However, the utility of this profile as a screening tool has remained unclear. Methods: We compared 140 patients with pediatric BP-I disorder, 83 with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 114 control subjects. We defined the CBCL-Severe Dysregulation profile as an aggregate cutoff score of ≥ 210 on the A-A-A scales. Patients were assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and functional measures. Results: Patients with BP-I disorder were significantly more likely than both control subjects (Odds Ratio [OR]: 173.2; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 21.2 to 1413.8; P &lt; 0.001) and those with ADHD (OR: 14.6; 95% CI, 6.2 to 34.3; P &lt; 0.001) to have a positive CBCL-Severe Dysregulation profile. Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses showed that the area under the curve for this profile comparing children with BP-I disorder against control subjects and those with ADHD was 99% and 85%, respectively. The corresponding positive predictive values for this profile were 99% and 92% with false positive rates ofo0.2% and 8% for the comparisons with control subjects and patients with ADHD, respectively. Limitations: Non-clinician raters administered structured diagnostic interviews, and the sample was referred and largely Caucasian. Conclusions: The CBCL-Severe Dysregulation profile can be useful as a screen for BP-I disorder in children in clinical practice.

Antenatal and postnatal maternal mood symptoms and psychiatric disorders in pre-school children from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort,"Background: Maternal mood symptoms have been associated with psychiatric disorders in children. This study aimed to assess critical periods when maternal symptoms would be more deleterious. Methods: Cohort of 4231 births followed-up in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Mood symptoms during pregnancy were self-reported by mothers at perinatal interview; and at 3-months postpartum, mothers answered the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Psychiatric disorders in 6-year-old children were evaluated through the Development and Well-Being Assessment instrument. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Results: Prevalence of mood symptoms in pregnancy was 24.6% (23.2–26.0%) and at three months postpartum 22.5% (21.1–23.9%). Prevalence of mental disorders in children was 13.3% (12.2–14.4%). After adjustment for confounders children of mothers with mood symptoms during pregnancy were 82% more likely of presenting psychiatric disorders than children of mothers that did not (1.82; 1.48–2.25); and the chance of having mental disorders among children whose mothers had positive SRQ-20 at three months postpartum was 87% greater than the observed among children whose mothers had it negative (1.87; 1.50–2.33). Limitations: Because maternal anxiety/depression may interfere with interpretation of the child behavior, child's mental health being obtained by interviewing the mother is a limitation of this study. Lack of information on other risk factors may have lead to residual confounding on the effect of maternal mood symptoms at three months postpartum. Conclusions: Children of mothers presenting mood symptoms during pregnancy and in the first months postpartum are more likely to present psychiatric disorders at 6 years of age.

Affective temperament profiles and clinical correlates in patients with epilepsy: A link from mood disorders,"Background: The current study sought to investigate the affective temperaments of patients with epilepsy and possible relationships between disease characteristics and temperament profiles. Methods: A total of 70 adults with epilepsy and 70 healthy volunteers completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego (TEMPS-A). Results: Patients with epilepsy had higher scores on these three scales than healthy controls. With respect to temperaments, irritable temperament alone was significantly higher in patients than controls. Irritable temperament also had a significant positive correlation with psychiatric history, whereas depressive temperament had a significant positive correlation with illness and treatment duration. Patients who had suffered simple partial and complex partial seizures had higher anxious temperament scores than patients with generalized epilepsy. Limitations: Because the study group was recruited through consecutive patients seen in a single neurology clinic, our findings may not be representative of PWE in general. Conclusions: Because irritability is one of the key symptoms of interictal dysphoric disorder and because TEMPS-A irritable temperament and BDI scores were found to be significantly related, the high rate of irritable temperament in our patient sample may be associated with depressive mood. We may suggest that at least some of the affective symptoms in patients with epilepsy and the historical concept of “epileptic personality” may be explained by affective temperaments.

"Reliability, validity and preliminary hypothesis tests for the English version of the Psychological Strain Scales (PSS)","Background: The original Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) was published with data from a sample of Chinese population, which consisted of four strain scales: value strain, aspiration strain, deprivation strain, and coping strain. This study aims to validate and develop the English version of the PSS instrument. Method: Together with the PSS, Moos's Coping Response Inventory (CRI), Spielberger Trait-Anxiety scale, CES-D depression scale, and the NCS suicidal behavior scales were administered in a survey to a sample ( N = 280) of American college students. Item-total statistics, Cronbach's Alpha, Guttman Split-Half coefficient, factor analyses, correlation analysis and t tests were applied to test the reliability and validity of the English version of the PSS. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were operated to know how extent the PSS predicts psychopathology such as anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviors. Results: Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of PSS was 0.936. The Split-Half coefficient of PSS was 0.839. The reliability of the PSS was excellent. The factor analysis results demonstrated strong construct validity of each scale. The criterion validity and the discriminant validity were both excellent for the English version of PSS instrument. Conclusions: With the excellent scores on both reliability and validity, the English version of the PSS scales can be an excellent measurement for estimating the psychological strain levels of American college students as well as predicting their psychopathology. The PSS can be applicable for research to evaluate and predict suicidal behaviors and mental disorders.

Factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempts in Spain for different age groups. Prevalence before and after the onset of the economic crisis,"Background: Little is known about whether the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts has changed in the wake of the economic crisis. The aim of this study was to estimate current prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the general population in Spain, to compare it with the prevalence found before the economic crisis, and to analyse the factors associated with suicidality in different age groups. Methods: A total of 4583 non-institutionalised adults were interviewed in a cross-sectional household survey of a nationally representative sample in Spain. Several modules of an adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to the participants, and logistic regression models were employed in each age group. Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in Spain were respectively, 3.67% and 1.46%. Mental disorders presented the highest significant effects on lifetime suicidal ideation. Marital status, heavy alcohol consumption, and occupational status were associated with lifetime suicidal ideation in people aged 18–49, whereas loneliness was associated with the 50–64 group, and financial problems with the 65+ group. A younger age, poor health status and the presence of depression were all associated with lifetime suicide attempts. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study represents a methodological limitation. Conclusions: The current prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in Spain is similar to the one found ten years ago, before the recent economic crisis. The factors associated with suicidality vary among age groups. Suicide prevention programmes should focus on early detection and prevention for depression and anxiety disorders.

"Emotional traits and affective temperaments in alcohol users, abusers and dependents in a national sample","Background: It is unclear how temperament is related to alcohol-related behavior in large population studies. We have used the Affective and Emotional Composite Temperament Scale (AFECTS) model to evaluate how emotional traits and affective temperaments are associated with alcohol use, abuse, and dependence in the general population. Methods: Data from 10,603 subjects (mean age = 28.0 ± 7.8 years, 70.3% females) was collected anonymously by the Internet in Brazil using the AFECTS model and the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Alcohol use was stratified into control, low use, abuse, and dependence groups. Results: The analysis of dimensional traits showed that Volition and Coping were lower, and Sensitivity was higher, in the abuse and dependence groups, with no differences between the Control and the Low Use groups. Alcohol consumption was also associated with lower Control, Stability, and Caution, and higher with Anger, Anxiety, and Desire, with significant differences between all groups. Regarding affective temperament types, alcohol abuse and dependence were associated with euphoric and cyclothymic temperaments in both genders, which was mirrored by a lower frequency of both euthymic and hyperthymic types. Only hyperthymics were overrepresented in the Control group for both genders. Limitations: Data was collected by Internet only. Conclusions: A global dysfunction of emotional traits and a predominance of cyclothymic and euphoric temperaments were associated with alcohol-related behavior. Prevention and treatment strategies may be developed more effectively if these traits are taken into account.

Age-related differences in the influence of major mental disorders on suicidality: A Korean nationwide community sample,"Background: We compared the influence of major mental disorders on suicidality according to age, adjusting for suicide-related correlates. Methods: This study was based on the Korean national epidemiological survey of mental disorders including community-dwelling adults between 18 and 74 years of age ( n = 6022). Subjects were classified into three age groups; young (18–39), middle-aged (40–59), and late adulthood (60–74). Face-to-face interviews were conducted using the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. According to age groups, the influence of major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder on risk for suicidality were investigated by multiple logistic regression models adjusting for sex, years of education, marital status, income, employment, presence of chronic medical illness, and lifetime history of suicide attempt. Results: After including MDD as a covariate, anxiety disorder remained a risk factor only in the middle-aged group (adjusted OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.54–5.22), and alcohol use disorder was a risk factor for suicidality only in the young group (adjusted OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.06–7.43). Conversely, MDD was the only mental disorder that significantly increased suicidality in all age groups. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study and did not include subjects over 75 years of age. Conclusion: This study showed that the contribution of psychiatric disorders to risk for suicidality varied according to age group. Therefore, strategies for suicide prevention should be specifically designed for different age groups.

Polysomnographic sleep characteristics of generally-anxious and healthy children assessed in the home environment,"Background: Using laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) we recently provided evidence of significantly prolonged sleep onset latency (SOL) and reduced latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep among non-depressed children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared to healthy age-matched controls. In the current study we conducted unattended ambulatory PSG in a new sample of children with GAD and controls in order to examine sleeping characteristics in the home environment. Method: Thirty-two children (ages of 7–11 years) including 16 children with primary GAD and 16 controls receiving no psychotropic medications were studied. The anxious group had a primary diagnosis of GAD without secondary mood disorders and controls were free of any medical or psychiatric diagnoses. All participants underwent structured diagnostic assessments and completed one night of home-based polysomnography (PSG). Results: Children with GAD exhibited significantly higher sleep efficiency (SE) and fewer rapid eye movement (REM) sleep periods compared to controls. Self-reported somatic arousal during the pre-sleep period was negatively correlated with the percentage of total REM sleep among controls, but positively correlated with REM sleep percentage in the GAD group. Limitations: A small sample size and one night of PSG only. Conclusions: Home-based PSG recording do not provide evidence of disrupted sleep patterns in children with GAD. Contextual factors that better elucidate differences between laboratory and home-based sleep findings are suggested as important directions for future research.

Effect of adjunctive benzodiazepines on clinical outcomes in lithium- or quetiapine-treated outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder: Results from the Bipolar CHOICE trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 167 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2014-32537-041). In the original article, there were some errors the corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Little is known about the longer-term effects of adjunctive benzodiazepines on symptom response during treatment in patients with bipolar disorders. Methods: The study sample consisted of 482 patients with bipolar I or II disorder enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, multi-site comparison of lithium- and quetiapine-based treatment. Changes in clinical measures (BISS total and subscales, CGI-BP, and CGI-Efficacy Index) were compared between participants who did and did not receive benzodiazepine treatment at baseline or during follow-up. Selected outcomes were also compared between patients who did and did not initiate benzodiazepines during follow-up using stabilized inverse probability weighted analyses. Results: Significant improvement in all outcome measures occurred within each benzodiazepine exposure group. Benzodiazepine users (at baseline or during follow-up) experienced significantly less improvement in BISS total, BISS irritability, and CGI-BP scores than did benzodiazepine non-users. There were no significant differences in these measures between patients who did and did not initiate benzodiazepines during follow-up in the weighted analyses. There was no significant effect of benzodiazepine use on any outcome measure in patients with comorbid anxiety or substance use disorders. Limitations: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized effectiveness trial that was not designed to address differential treatment response according to benzodiazepine use. Conclusions: Adjunctive benzodiazepines may not significantly affect clinical outcome in lithium- or quetiapine-treated patients with bipolar I or II disorder over 6 months, after controlling for potential confounding factors.

Beyond a single index of mania symptoms: Structure and validity of subdimensions,"Background: DSM-5 portrays mania as unitary despite evidence of distinct symptom clusters. Studies investigating the structure of mania have been inconsistent, in part because many relied on instruments not designed for this question. The present work used a clinical interview designed for structural analysis in order to identify and validate subdimensions specific to mania symptoms. Methods: Psychiatric outpatients ( N = 422) and undergraduates with a history of mental health treatment ( N = 306) were interviewed with a comprehensive measure of mood and anxiety that included 24 manic symptoms. Patients completed additional measures of symptoms and functioning, and a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Results: A 4-factor model of mania replicated across independent samples and was superior in fit to competing models, including the unidimensional model implied whenever researchers or clinicians use only a total score for mania. The factors were only moderately correlated, and three of the four (""Irritability"" was the exception) showed a strong criterion, convergent and discriminant validity, suggesting they are specific to mania. Subdimensions showed distinct and meaningful associations with functioning. Limitations: Symptoms of psychosis and depression are important features of manic episodes, but were not included in the present study since they lack specificity to mania. Conclusions: Mania is multifaceted. At least three subdimensions specific to mania were identified (""Euphoric Activation,"" ""Hyperactive Cognition"" and ""Reckless Overconfidence""). Use of subdimensions, in addition to overall mania severity, may enhance the ability of studies to detect meaningful biological correlates of bipolar disorder. Moreover, their different associations with functioning suggest assessing subdimensions has clinical utility as well.

Web-based depression treatment: Associations of clients' word use with adherence and outcome,"Background: The growing number of web-based psychological treatments, based on textual communication, generates a wealth of data that can contribute to knowledge of online and face-to-face treatments. We investigated whether clients' language use predicted treatment outcomes and adherence in Master Your Mood (MYM), an online group course for young adults with depressive symptoms. Methods: Among 234 participants from a randomised controlled trial of MYM, we tested whether their word use on course application forms predicted baseline levels of depression, anxiety and mastery, or subsequent treatment adherence. We then analysed chat session transcripts of course completers ( n = 67) to investigate whether word use changes predicted changes in treatment outcomes. Results: Depression improvement was predicted by increasing use of ‘discrepancy words’ during treatment (e.g. should ). At baseline, more discrepancy words predicted higher mastery level. Adherence was predicted by more words used at application, more social words and fewer discrepancy words. Limitations: Many variables were included, increasing the chance of coincidental results. This risk was constrained by examining only those word categories that have been investigated in relation to depression or adherence. Conclusions: This is the first study to link word use during treatment to outcomes of treatment that has proven to be effective in an RCT. The results suggest that paying attention to the length of problem articulation at application and to ‘discrepancy words’ may be wise, as these seem to be psychological markers. To expand knowledge of word use as psychological marker, research on web-based treatment should include text analysis.

Disentangling sense of coherence and resilience in case of multiple traumas,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) are a major public health problem. Trauma endured during childhood is known to increase the risk of DAD in adulthood. We investigate the hypothesis that Sense of Coherence (SOC) is a mediator between childhood trauma and depressive and anxious symptoms (DAD) in adulthood. We also explore the nature (personality trait or aptitude) of SOC and attempt to disentangle the concepts of resilience and SOC. Method: Former hidden children (FHC), the Jewish youths who spent World War II in various hideaway shelters across Nazi-occupied Europe, were compared with a control group. In each group we measured the presence of multiple traumas, the resilience with the Resilience Scale for Adults, the DAD with the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist and the SOC with the SOC-13 self-report questionnaire. We tested a mediated moderation model with childhood Trauma as the predictor; Adulthood trauma as the moderator; SOC as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable. Results: Results were consistent with a sensitization model of DAD partially mediated by SOC. A first component of SOC was similar to an aptitude and another part of SOC was more similar to a personality trait. Limitations: We are unable to differentiate if the sensitization process is a consequence of the nature of the trauma endured by FHC (long-standing exposure to extreme external events) or a consequence of the fact that this first trauma occurred during childhood. Conclusion: Our results could account for the controversial debate regarding the life time stability of SOC.

More pernicious course of bipolar disorder in the United States than in many European countries: Implications for policy and treatment,"Background: There is some controversy but growing evidence that childhood onset bipolar disorder may be more prevalent and run a more difficult course in the United States than some European countries. Methods: We update and synthesize course of illness data from more than 960 outpatients with bipolar disorder (average age 40) from 4 sites in the U.S. and 3 sites in Netherlands and Germany. After giving informed consent, patients reported on parental history, childhood and lifetime stressors, comorbidities, and illness characteristics. Results: Almost all aspects of bipolar disorder were more adverse in patients from the US compared with Europe, including a significantly higher prevalence of: bipolar disorder in one parent and a mood disorder in both parents; childhood verbal, physical, or sexual abuse; stressors in the year prior to illness onset and the last episode; childhood onsets of bipolar illness; delay to first treatment; anxiety disorder, substance abuse, and medical comorbidity; mood episodes and rapid cycling; and nonresponse to prospective naturalistic treatment. Limitations: Selection bias in the recruit of patients cannot be ruled out, but convergent data in the literature suggest that this does not account for the findings. Potential mechanisms for the early onset and more adverse course in the U.S. have not been adequately delineated and require further investigation. Conclusions: The data suggest the need for earlier and more effective long-term treatment intervention in an attempt to ameliorate this adverse course and its associated heavy burden of psychiatric and medical morbidity.

Adolescent self-harm: A school-based study in Northern Ireland,"Background: The prevalence of adolescent self-harm in Northern Ireland (NI) and its associated factors are unknown. Given the established relationship between conflict and mental health, and NI's recent history of conflict, it is important to investigate the factors associated with self-harm in NI. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of self-harm in NI adolescents and the factors associated with it, including exposure to the NI conflict. Methods: Observational study of 3596 school pupils employing an anonymous self-report survey. Information was obtained on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, life events and problems, exposure to the NI conflict, social and internet influences, and psychological variables. Results: Self-harm was reported by 10% of respondents. In univariate analyses, exposure to the NI conflict was associated with self-harm alongside established risk factors. In multivariate analyses, bullying and exposure to self-harm were associated with lifetime self-harm in both girls and boys. Alcohol use, drug use, physical and sexual abuse, and self-esteem were also associated with self-harm in girls. In boys, absence of exercise, sexual orientation concerns, anxiety and impulsivity were additional risk factors. The internet/social media and the self-harm of others were also key influences. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study. Conclusions: The rate of self-harm was lower than elsewhere in the UK/Ireland. The study highlights the factors which should be considered in terms of risk assessment. In addition to established risk factors, the findings suggest that more research on the legacy of the NI conflict as well as the influence of new technologies warrant urgent attention.

Under-reporting bipolar disorder in large-scale epidemiologic studies,"Background: To investigate if the prevalence of bipolar disorder in epidemiologic studies is an underestimate, as suggested by clinical studies. Methods: We analyzed data from 8 countries that participated in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative ( n = 47,552). We identified 6.8% and 18.9% of the sample who we think were screened out inappropriately (SCI) from the euphoric and irritable bipolar sections respectively. We compared them to those who were allowed to continue the section (CONT, 2.6% of the sample for euphoric; 1.0% for irritable) and to the reference group (REF, 69.5% of the sample). Results: The SCI group had consistently higher rates of major depression (29.1% vs. 6.4%), earlier age of onset (24.3y vs. 32.4y), more suicide attempts (13.3% vs. 5.9%), and more episodes (4.2 vs. 2.7) than the REF for the euphoric group. Similar findings exist for the irritable group. Also, comorbidity with anxiety, disruptive behavior disorders and substance use were much higher than the REF. Limitations: As with all epidemiologic studies, recall bias cannot be ruled out. Conclusions: The findings above suggest that a number of the SCI subjects belong to the bipolar group. A revision of instruments used in epidemiologic research will probably prove what clinical studies have been showing that bipolar disorder is more common than has been reported.

Feeling connected again: Interventions that increase social identification reduce depression symptoms in community and clinical settings,"Background: Clinical depression is often preceded by social withdrawal, however, limited research has examined whether depressive symptoms are alleviated by interventions that increase social contact. In particular, no research has investigated whether social identification (the sense of being part of a group) moderates the impact of social interventions. Method: We test this in two longitudinal intervention studies. In Study 1 ( N = 52), participants at risk of depression joined a community recreation group; in Study 2 ( N = 92) adults with diagnosed depression joined a clinical psychotherapy group. Results: In both the studies, social identification predicted recovery from depression after controlling for initial depression severity, frequency of attendance, and group type. In Study 2, benefits of social identification were larger for depression symptoms than for anxiety symptoms or quality of life. Limitation: Social identification is subjective and psychological, and therefore participants could not be randomly assigned to high and low social identification conditions. Conclusions: Findings have implications for health practitioners in clinical and community settings, suggesting that facilitating social participation is effective and cost-effective in treating depression.

Emotion regulation strategies in bipolar II disorder and borderline personality disorder: Differences and relationships with perceived parental style,"Background: Bipolar II disorder (BP II) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) share common features and can be difficult to differentiate, contributing to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Research contrasting phenomenological features of both conditions is limited. The current study sought to identify differences in emotion regulation strategies in BP II and BPD in addition to examining relationships with perceived parental style. Method: Participants were recruited from a variety of outpatient and community settings. Eligible participants required a clinical diagnosis of BP II or BPD, subsequently confirmed via structured diagnostic interviews assessing DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed a series of self-reported questionnaires assessing emotion regulation strategies and perceived parental style. Results: The sample comprised 48 ( n = 24 BP II and n = 24 BPD) age and gender-matched participants. Those with BPD were significantly more likely to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, less likely to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and scored significantly higher on the majority of (perceived) dysfunctional parenting sub-scales than participants with BP II. Dysfunctional parenting experiences were related to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in participants with BP II and BPD, however differential associations were observed across groups. Limitations: Relatively small sample sizes; lack of a healthy control comparator group; lack of statistical control for differing sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, medication and psychological treatments; no assessment of state or trait anxiety; over-representation of females in both groups limiting generalisability of results; and reliance on self-report measures. Conclusions: Differences in emotion regulation strategies and perceived parental style provide some support for the validity of distinguishing BP II and BPD. Development of intervention strategies targeting the differing forms of emotion regulatory pathology in these groups may be warranted.

"The relationship between interpersonal problems, therapeutic alliance, and outcomes following group and individual cognitive behaviour therapy","Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is efficacious, but there remains individual variability in outcomes. Patient's interpersonal problems may affect treatment outcomes, either directly or through a relationship mediated by helping alliance. Interpersonal problems may affect alliance and outcomes differentially in individual and group (CBGT) treatments. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between interpersonal problems, alliance, dropout and outcomes for a clinical sample receiving either individual or group CBT for anxiety or depression in a community clinic. Methods: Patients receiving individual CBT ( N = 84) or CBGT ( N = 115) completed measures of interpersonal problems, alliance, and disorder specific symptoms at the commencement and completion of CBT. Results: In CBGT higher pre-treatment interpersonal problems were associated with increased risk of dropout and poorer outcomes. This relationship was not mediated by alliance. In individual CBT those who reported higher alliance were more likely to complete treatment, although alliance was not associated with symptom change, and interpersonal problems were not related to attrition or outcome. Limitations: Allocation to group and individual therapy was non-random, so selection bias may have influenced these results. Some analyses were only powered to detect large effects. Helping alliance ratings were high, so range restriction may have obscured the relationship between helping alliance, attrition and outcomes. Conclusions: Pre-treatment interpersonal problems increase risk of dropout and predict poorer outcomes in CBGT, but not in individual CBT, and this relationship is not mediated by helping alliance. Stronger alliance is associated with treatment completion in individual, but not group CBT.

Phenomenology of manic episodes according to the presence or absence of depressive features as defined in &lt;i&gt;DSM-5&lt;/i&gt;: Results from the IMPACT self-reported online survey,"Background: The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenology of mania and depression in bipolar patients experiencing a manic episode with mixed features as defined in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) . Methods: In this multicenter, international on-line survey (the IMPACT study), 700 participants completed a 54-item questionnaire on demographics, diagnosis, symptomatology, communication of the disease, impact on life, and treatment received. Patients with a manic episode with or without DSM-5 criteria for mixed features were compared using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Patients with more than 3 depressive symptoms were more likely to have had a delay in diagnosis, more likely to have experienced shorter symptom-free periods, and were characterized by a marked lower prevalence of typical manic manifestations. All questionnaire items exploring depressive symptomatology, including the DSM-5 criteria defining a manic episode as “with mixed features”, were significantly over-represented in the group of patients with depressive symptoms. Anxiety associated with irritability/agitation was also more frequent among patients with mixed features. Limitations: Retrospective cross-sectional design, sensitive to recall bias. Two of the 6 DSM-5 required criteria for the specifier “with mixed features” were not explored: suicidality and psychomotor retardation. Conclusions: Bipolar disorder patients with at least 3 depressive symptoms during a manic episode self-reported typical symptomatology. Anxiety with irritability/agitation differentiated patients with depressive symptoms during mania from those with “pure” manic episodes. The results support the use of DSM-5 mixed features specifier and its value in research and clinical practice.

The use of symptom dimensions to investigate the longitudinal effects of life events on depressive and anxiety symptomatology,"Background: Findings on the association between life events and depression have been quite inconsistent. This could be due to the heterogeneity of traditionally used depression outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific symptom dimensions can be used as an alternative to detect more specific life event effects. Methods: Participants with/without psychiatric diagnoses were included ( n = 2252). Dimensions of the tripartite model (General Distress [GD], Anhedonic Depression [AD] and Anxious Arousal [AA]) were assessed at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Life events occurring between measurements were assessed retrospectively. Longitudinal associations between life events and dimensional scores were analysed with Linear Mixed Models. Results: Occurrence of negative life events was associated with increasing GD and AA, and less with AD. Positive life events were associated with decreasing GD and AD, but not with AA. The association between negative life events and AD was larger in the absence of previous psychiatric problems, lending support to a dimension-specific ‘kindling’ effect. Also, the negative association between negative life events and GD was stronger in those with high neuroticism. Multivariable analyses with individual life events showed that a few strong independent effects remained for each dimension. Limitations: Life event reports were retrospective; only three outcome dimensions were used. Conclusions: These results show that the effects of life events and modifying factors depend, to an extent, on the symptom domain that is considered as outcome, illustrating the need to account for symptom heterogeneity in etiological life event research.

Symptom-based subtypes of depression and their psychosocial correlates: A person-centered approach focusing on the influence of sex,"Background: Reducing the complexity of major depressive disorder by symptom-based subtypes constitutes the basis of more specific treatments. To date, few studies have empirically derived symptom subtypes separated by sex, although the impact of sex has been widely accepted in depression research. Methods: The community-based sample included 373 males and 443 females from the Zurich Program for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services (ZInEP) manifesting depressive symptoms in the past 12 months. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was performed separately by sex to extract sex-related depression subtypes. The subtypes were characterized by psychosocial characteristics. Results: Three similar subtypes were found in both sexes: a severe typical subtype (males: 22.8%; females: 35.7%), a severe atypical subtype (males: 17.4%; females: 22.6%), and a moderate subtype (males: 25.2%; females: 41.8%). In males, two additional subgroups were identified: a severe irritable/angry-rejection sensitive (IARS) subtype (30%) comprising the largest group, and a small psychomotor retarded subtype (4%). Males belonging to the severe typical subtype exhibited the lowest masculine gender role orientation, while females of the typical subtype showed more anxiety disorders. The severe atypical subtype was associated with eating disorders in both sexes and with alcohol/drug abuse/dependence in females. In contrast, alcohol/drug abuse/dependence was associated with the severe IARS subtype in males. Limitations: The study had a cross-sectional design, allowing for no causal inferences. Conclusions: This study contributes to a better understanding of sex-related depression subtypes, which can be well distinguished on the basis of symptom profiles. This provides the base for future research investigating the etiopathogenesis and effective treatment of the heterogeneous depression disorder.

Persistence and resolution of suicidal ideation during treatment of depression in patients with significant suicidality at the beginning of treatment: The CRESCEND study,"Background: The appropriate length of time for patients who visit clinics with significant suicidal ideation to be closely monitored is a critical issue for clinicians. We evaluated the course of suicidal ideation and associated factors for persistent suicidality in patients who entered treatment for depression with significant suicidal ideation. Methods: A total of 565 patients who had both moderate to severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score ≥14) and significant suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI-B) score ≥6) were recruited from 18 hospitals in South Korea. Participants were assessed using the SSI-B, HAMD, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale-severity during a 12-week naturalistic treatment with antidepressant intervention. Participants were classified into resolved suicidality or persistent suicidality groups according to whether their suicidal ideation improved to SSI-B scores &lt;6 and were sustained for 12 weeks. Results: During the 12-week treatment, 206 (36.4%) patients were classified in the resolved suicidality group. Persistent suicidality was associated with intervention with SSRIs, higher SSI-B baseline score, and no HAMD or HAMA remission. The proportions of participants who had persistent suicidal ideation even with HAMD remission or response were 0.25 and 0.34, respectively. Limitations: This study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: A considerable number of patients had persistent suicidal ideation despite 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Close monitoring for suicidal ideation may be needed beyond the initial weeks of treatment and even after a response to antidepressants is observed.

Type D personality in never-depressed patients and the development of major and minor depression after acute coronary syndrome,"Background: Type D personality (TDP) has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, contrasting findings emerged about its predicting power on the onset of depression, since an overlap between TDP and depressive symptoms has been proposed. The present study was aimed to verify whether TDP predicts the development of a depressive disorder in the 6 months after the discharge from hospital. Methods: Two hundred fifty consecutive patients were recruited, at the Coronary Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital of Parma, who were both presenting their first ACS and had no history of depression. The presence and the severity of major (MD) and minor (md) depression were evaluated with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) respectively. Type D Personality was assessed with the DS14, both at baseline and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 month follow ups. Results: Out of 250 subjects (81.2% males), MD was diagnosed in 12 patients (4.8%) and md in 18 patients (7.2%). At baseline risk factors for a post-ACS depressive disorder were HADS depression scores, whereas TDP, or its subscales, did not showed any effect. Limitation: The small amount of patients with incidence of depression, due to highly selective inclusion criteria, tempers the reliability of our results. Conclusion: Our data suggests that TDP does not predict the development of depressive disorders in never-depressed patients at their first ACS, when the baseline depression severity was controlled.

Borderline personality disorder among primary care depressive patients: A five-year study,"Background: Studies of depressive disorders with concurrent borderline personality disorder (BPD) in primary health care are scarce and methodologically weak. Limited epidemiological evidence suggests BPD may be common among users of primary care services. Prevalence, characteristics and outcome of primary care depressive patients with co-morbid BPD are unknown. Methods: The Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study is a prospective five-year cohort study. A stratified random sample of 1119 patients aged 20 to 69 years was screened for depression using the Prime-MD. SCID-I/P and SCID-II interviews were used to diagnose depressive all co-morbid axis I and II disorders. Of the 137 depressive patients at baseline, 82% completed the five-year follow-up. Characteristics and outcome of patients with or without concurrent BPD were compared. Results: BPD cases accounted for 26% at baseline and 19% at follow-up. At baseline, BPD patients had a two-fold prevalence of anxiety and previous depressive episodes; a three-fold prevalence of substance use disorders, suicidal ideation and severe economic difficulties, and a four-fold prevalence of preceding suicide attempts or unemployment compared to those without BPD. By follow-up, patients with BPD had spent more time depressed, achieved full remission slower and a higher proportion were chronically depressed. Limitations: Diagnostic reliability of depressive disorders was excellent, but of BPD not tested. Generalizability to other primary care settings remains unknown. Conclusions: Concurrent BPD may be relatively common among depressed primary care patients. These patients have specific, adverse characteristics and poor long-term outcome, which should be considered when developing treatments for depression in primary care.

Does obesity predict bipolarity in major depressive patients?,"Background: Differential association of obesity in bipolar and unipolar Major Depressive Episode (MDE) has not been systematically studied. We explore the relationships between obesity and history of manic and hypomanic symptoms in a large national clinical sample of MDE patients. Method: The sample comprised 571 consecutive patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDE enrolled in a 7 months period. The study involved 30 psychiatric facilities for outpatients, distributed throughout Italy. Diagnosis was formulated by psychiatrists with extensive clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. In all patients height (meters) and weight (kilograms) were systematically measured at the moment of the clinical evaluation. The severity of depressive and anxious symptomatology was self-evaluated by the means of Zung's questionnaires for depression and anxiety. For the evaluation of lifetime manic or hypomanic features, Hypomania Check List-32 was also administered. Obese and Non-Obese subgroups were identified on the basis of a &gt;30 BMI cut off point. Results: BMI ≤30 was observed in 86 (15.1%) of our MDE patients. The Obese and Non-Obese subgroups did not report differences as regards to age and gender distribution. Obese patients reported a lower number of years of education in comparison with Non-Obese patients. As regards to marital status, Obese patients were more frequently married in comparison with the Non-Obese patients. Obese patients were more frequently belonging to the bipolar group than Non-Obese patients. Obese subjects also reported more frequently than Non-Obese an HCL total score &gt;14. The effect of educational level, marital status and bipolar–unipolar distinction on the probability of Obese group membership was analyzed by stepwise logistic regression. Bipolar subtype resulted to be the strongest predictor of Obesity. Limitations: Pharmacological treatments and co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders are not explored and accounted for in our analyses. Conclusions: Obesity in our national sample of patients with MDE is associated with bipolar subtype and (hypo)manic symptoms. These findings suggest the possibility that the presence of obesity in patients with MDE might be related to bipolarity. A common impulsive-addictive diathesis is proposed as mediating mechanism. Further longitudinal studies in clinical and non-clinical populations are necessary to better define the burden and the role of the association between obesity and bipolarity.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and suicidality in a treatment naïve sample of children and adolescents,"Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidality. Methods: Using a structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid), the authors examined 418 treatment naïve children/adolescents (aged: 3–18 years). Suicidality was defined by the M.I.N.I. Kid as having any current suicidal ideations and/or suicide attempts. Results: Two hundred and eleven children/adolescents fulfilled the DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD and a further 105 showed symptoms of ADHD in subthreshold level. Multiple mediation analyses resulted in a moderated meditational model in which the relationship between symptoms of ADHD and current suicidality was fully mediated by the symptoms of comorbid conditions, but this was moderated by age. In children under 12 years, significant mediators were the symptoms of specific anxiety disorders, while in the adolescent group symptoms of major depressive episode and dysthymia and symptoms of substance abuse/dependence approved as significant mediators. Limitations: As the study was cross-sectional, it did not reveal any causal relationship among the investigated factors. Furthermore, as the study population included a treatment naïve clinical sample, we can assume that adolescents, who and/or whose family seek for help at the first time in this age belonged to the less sever end of the spectrum. Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are associated with an increased risk of suicidality in treatment naïve children/adolescents. The mechanisms of this relationship can be understood only when developmental factors are considered. Our findings suggest that clinicians should screen suicidality and comorbid symptoms routinely in patients with ADHD.

"Characteristics, symptomatology and naturalistic treatment in individuals at-risk for bipolar disorders: Baseline results in the first 180 help-seeking individuals assessed at the dresden high-risk project","Background: Considering results from the early recognition and intervention in psychosis, identification and treatment of individuals with at-risk states for the development of bipolar disorders (BD) could improve the course and severity of illness and prevent long-term consequences. Different approaches to define risk factors and groups have recently been published, data on treatment options are still missing. Methods: Help-seeking persons at the early recognition center in Dresden, Germany, were assessed with a standardized diagnostic procedure including following risk factors for BD: familial risk, increasing mood swings, subsyndromal (hypo)manic symptoms, specific sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, anxiety/fearfulness, affective disorder, decreased psychosocial functioning, increasing periodic substance use, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Based on symptomatology and current and/or life-time psychiatric diagnosis, subjects with an at-risk state were offered individual treatment options. Results: Out of 180 referred and screened persons, 29 (16%) met criteria for at-risk state for BD. Altogether, 27 (93%) at-risk individuals fulfilled criteria for a current and/or life-time mental illness other than BD; 14 (48%) had received pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment in the past. Treatments recommended included psychoeducation (100%), psychotherapy alone (62%), pharmacotherapy alone (17%), and psychotherapy+pharmacotherapy (14%). Conclusions: To identify at-risk states for BD, a multifactorial approach including all known risk markers should be used. As most at-risk patients meet criteria for other mental disorders, the short- and long-term impact of different treatment strategies on symptomatic, functional and diagnostic outcomes requires detailed investigation. Limitations: Small sample size of at-risk individuals, lack of sufficient prospective data and control groups.

Unipolar mania: A distinct entity?,"Background: Whether or not unipolar mania is a separate nosological entity remains a subject of dispute. This review discusses that question in light of recent data. Methods: Unipolar mania studies in the PUBMED database and relevant publications and cross-references were searched. Results: There seems to be a bipolar subgroup with a stable, unipolar recurrent manic course, and that 15–20% of bipolar patients may be unipolar manic. Unipolar mania may be more common in females. It seems to have a slightly earlier age of illness onset, more grandiosity, psychotic symptoms, hyperthymic temperament, but less rapid-cycling, suicidality and comorbid anxiety disorders. It seems to have a better course of illness with better social and professional adjustment. However, its response to lithium prophylaxis seems to be worse, although its response to valproate is the same when compared to that of classical bipolar. Limitations: The few studies on the subject are mainly retrospective, and the primary methodological criticism is the uncertainty of the diagnostic criteria for unipolar mania. Conclusions: The results indicate that unipolar mania displays some different clinical characteristics from those of classical bipolar disorder. However, whether or not it is a separate nosological entity has not been determined due to the insufficiency of relevant data. Further studies with standardized diagnostic criteria are needed. Considering unipolar mania as a course specifier of bipolar disorder could be an important step in this respect.

Lifetime major depression and comorbid disorders among current-era women veterans,"Background: Most research on women veterans' mental health has focused on postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or reactions to military sexual trauma. Although depression is also a frequent diagnosis among women veterans, little is known about its characteristics, including comorbid conditions and patterns of disorder onset. We investigated lifetime diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid conditions in a primarily treatment-seeking research sample of male and female veterans to determine frequency of lifetime MDD, comorbid disorders and their temporal onset. Method: The 1700 veterans (346 women; 1354 men) completed diagnostic interviews as participants in a research registry. Rates of and gender differences in lifetime MDD and comorbid conditions (PTSD, other anxiety disorders, substance use and eating disorders) were calculated. We assessed the percentage of cases in which MDD preceded the comorbid condition (primary onset MDD). Results: Lifetime MDD was frequent in this sample, and significantly more common in women (46.5%) than in men (36.3%). Gender differences in comorbidity were found for anxiety and eating disorders (more common in women); and for alcohol and nicotine use disorders (more common in men). However, primary onset MDD was no more common among women than among men, and was in neither case the predominant pattern of comorbid lifetime disorder onset. Limitations: The sample is not representative of all veterans, and lifetime diagnoses were based on retrospective recall. Conclusions: MDD usually follows the onset of other comorbid disorders among women veterans, indicating the need to assess for earlier lifetime disorders in veterans with MDD.

Changes in well-being and quality of life in a randomized trial comparing dynamic psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a decrease in quality of life (QOL) and well-being. Therefore, researchers are increasingly complementing traditional symptom measurements with QOL and well-being assessments in order to broaden the evaluation of treatment outcomes. The current prospective study investigated the effectiveness of supportive–expressive therapy (SET), antidepressant medication (MED) and placebo (PBO) in improving QOL and well-being in patients with MDD. Methods: Data from a randomized controlled trial (trial registration: NCT00043550) comparing SET, MED and PBO for the treatment of depression ( N = 156) were analyzed. Outcome measures addressed patients' QOL and physical and mental well-being. Changes in outcomes were assessed across and between treatments using linear mixed models. Results: Across treatments, patients showed significant improvement in QOL and mental and physical health measures, as well as a reduction in interpersonal distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms ( p ≤ .002 for all measures). Those changes were not only the products of a decrease in depressive symptoms, but also predicted subsequent reduction in symptoms. No significant differences were found between the three treatment conditions. Limitations: The limitation is the study's moderate sample size. Conclusions: Current treatments for depression significantly improve patients' QOL and well-being. No significant differences were found between the three conditions examined in this study. The current study highlights the role of well-being in predicting subsequent symptomatic change.

Development and psychometrics of the five item daily index in a psychiatric sample,"Background: Effective treatment of affective disorders requires the ability to reliably monitor patient progress and outcome. The current study aimed to establish the Daily Index-5 (DI-5) as a psychometrically sound and clinically valid measure of treatment response in psychiatric care for use as a companion measure with the WHO Wellbeing Index (WHO-5; Bech et al., 1996. Psychother. Psychosom. 65, 183–190.). Method: Eight hundred and ninety four consecutive inpatients and day-patients at a psychiatric facility completed the DI-5, WHO-5, SF-36 (Ware et al., 1993. SF-36 Health Survey: Manual and Interpretation Guide. The Health Institute, New England Medical Centre, Boston, MA.) and DASS-21 (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995b. Manual for the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Psychology Foundation, Sydney, Australia.; Ware et al., 1993. SF-36 Health Survey: Manual and Interpretation Guide. The Health Institute, New England Medical Centre, Boston, MA.) routinely during treatment. Results: The DI-5 was shown to be a measure with high reliability and validity. In addition criteria for clinically significant recovery are presented with an example implementation of a Clinical Significance Monitoring system. Finally, the latent structure of the DI-5 is established as a uni-dimensional index of affective disorder. Limitations: The results may be generalized to samples with primary diagnoses of depressive and/or anxiety disorders though assessment of the DI-5 as a measure of treatment response is warranted in patients with other primary diagnoses. Conclusions: The current study indicates that the DI-5 is a quick to administer and interpret, reliable and valid measure for assessing patient outcome that is appropriate for use in monitoring patient change.

Severity alone should no longer determine therapeutic choice in the management of depression in primary care: Findings from a survey of general practitioners,"Background: The treatment of depression in primary care remains suboptimal for reasons that are complex and multifactorial. Typically GPs have to make difficult decisions in limited time and therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the management of depression of varying severity and the factors associated with treatment choices. Method: Nested within a primary care educational initiative we conducted a survey of 1760 GPs. The GPs each identified four patients with clinical depression whom they had treated recently and then answered questions regarding their diagnosis and management of each patient. Results: Comorbid anxiety, sadness and decreased concentration appeared to direct the management of depression toward psychological therapy, whereas comorbid pain and a patient's overall functioning, such as the ability to do simple everyday activities, directed the initiation of pharmacological treatment. The use of antidepressants with a broader spectrum of actions (acting on multiple neurotransmitters) increased from mild to severe depression, whereas this did not occur with the more selective agents. SSRIs were prescribed more frequently compared with all other antidepressants, irrespective of depression severity. Limitations: GPs chose the RADAR programme and therefore they were potentially more likely to have an interest in mental health compared to GPs who did not participate. Conclusions: GPs do not appear to be determining pharmacological treatment based on depression subtype and specificity, but rather on the basis of the total number of symptoms and overall severity. While acknowledging important differences between primary care and specialist practice, it is suggested that guidelines to assist GPs in matching treatment to depression subtype may be of practical assistance in decision-making, and the delivery of more effective treatments.

Childhood cognitive ability and its relationship with anxiety and depression in adolescence,"Background: Childhood cognitive ability may have protective effects against internalizing symptoms in adolescence, although this may depend on the time of symptom assessment and child gender. Also, the effects of childhood stressors on adolescent internalizing symptoms may be moderated by childhood cognitive ability. Methods: The sample included 4405 individuals from the Canadian National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Between ages 4–5 and 10–11, children completed a test of verbal ability and scholastic aptitude and a series of mathematics computation tests. Internalizing symptoms were assessed via self-reports at ages 12–13 and 14–15. Results: Greater cognitive ability was generally associated with decreased odds of internalizing symptoms at age 12–13. However, greater cognitive ability generally increased, or had no effect on, the odds of internalizing symptoms at age 14–15. Some of the effects of childhood cognitive ability varied with child gender. Also, childhood cognitive ability attenuated the effects of family dysfunction and chronic illness throughout childhood on subsequent internalizing symptoms. Limitations: These data are largely subject to some degree of reporting bias, the tests of cognitive ability are limited and may not represent overall cognitive ability, and there may be intermediary variables that account for the relationship between childhood cognitive ability and adolescent internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Results suggest that programs attempting to increase early cognitive skills may be particularly beneficial for girls. Also, an increased focus on cognitive skills may attenuate the negative effects of some stressors on subsequent anxious and depressive symptoms, regardless of child gender.

Prevalence of minor depression in elderly persons with and without mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review,"Background: Minor depression (MinD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are common disorders in late life that often coexist. The aim of the present review is to demonstrate prevalence rates of minor depression in older patients with and without MCI. Methods: Electronic database searches were performed through Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Psycinfo, and Cochrane library. Two independent reviewers extracted the original studies based on inclusion criteria: representative study population aged 55 and older, diagnostics of MinD according to DSM. Data on prevalence rates, risk factors, comorbidity and health care usage were analyzed. Results: Point prevalence for MinD is higher in medical settings (median 14.4%) than in the community-based settings (median 10.4%) and primary care patients (median 7.7%). Although minor depression is rarely investigated in elderly persons with MCI, nearly 20% of patients with MCI seem to suffer from MinD. No data was found on the prevalence of MCI in patients with MinD. Risk factors associated with MinD include female gender, history of cerebrovascular diseases, generalized anxiety disorder, loneliness, and long-term institutional care. Limitations: Methodological differences of included studies resulted in a broad range of prevalence rates. No data is shown regarding the prevalence of MCI in MinD group due to insufficient evidence. Conclusions: Our review indicates that MinD is frequent in elderly population. MCI among those subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Future studies based on clinical structured interviews should be performed in longitudinal design in order to differentiate late-life depression from progressive MCI or early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.

Self-concept and quality of object relations as predictors of outcome in short- and long-term psychotherapy,"Background: Quality of object relations and self-concept reflect clinically relevant aspects of personality functioning, but their prediction as suitability factors for psychotherapies of different lengths has not been compared. This study compared their prediction on psychiatric symptoms and work ability in short-and long-term psychotherapy. Methods: Altogether 326 patients, 20–46 years of age, with mood and/or anxiety disorder, were randomized to short-term (solution-focused or short-term psychodynamic) psychotherapy and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. The Quality of Object Relations Scale (QORS) and the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) self-concept questionnaire were measured at baseline, and their prediction on outcome during the 3-year follow-up was assessed by the Symptom Check List Global Severity Index and the Anxiety Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and by the Work Ability Index, Social Adjustment Scale work subscale and the Perceived Psychological Functioning scale. Results: Negative self-concept strongly and self-controlling characteristics modestly predicted better 3-year outcomes in long-term therapy, after faster early gains in short-term therapy. Patients with a more positive or self-emancipating self-concept, or more mature object relations, experienced more extensive benefits after long-term psychotherapy. Limitations: The importance of length vs. long-term therapy technique on the differences found is not known. Conclusions: Patients with mild to moderate personality pathology, indicated by poor self-concept, seem to benefit more from long-term than short-term psychotherapy, in reducing risk of depression. Long-term therapy may also be indicated for patients with relatively good psychological functioning. More research is needed on the relative importance of these characteristics in comparison with other patient-related factors.

Internet-based versus face-to-face cognitive-behavioral intervention for depression: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial,"Background and aims: In the past decade, a large body of research has demonstrated that internet-based interventions can have beneficial effects on depression. However, only a few clinical trials have compared internet-based depression therapy with an equivalent face-to-face treatment. The primary aim of this study was to compare treatment outcomes of an internet-based intervention with a face-to-face intervention for depression in a randomized non-inferiority trial. Method: A total of 62 participants suffering from depression were randomly assigned to the therapist-supported internet-based intervention group ( n = 32) and to the face-to-face intervention ( n = 30). The 8 week interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles. Patients in both groups received the same treatment modules in the same chronological order and time-frame. Primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); secondary outcome variables were suicidal ideation, anxiety, hopelessness and automatic thoughts. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis yielded no significant between-group difference (online vs. face-to-face group) for any of the pre- to post-treatment measurements. At post-treatment both treatment conditions revealed significant symptom changes compared to before the intervention. Within group effect sizes for depression in the online group ( d = 1.27) and the face–to-face group ( d = 1.37) can be considered large. At 3-month follow-up, results in the online group remained stable. In contrast to this, participants in the face-to-face group showed significantly worsened depressive symptoms three months after termination of treatment ( t = −2.05, df = 19, p &lt; .05). Limitations: Due to the small sample size, it will be important to evaluate these outcomes in adequately-powered trials. Conclusions: This study shows that an internet-based intervention for depression is equally beneficial to regular face-to-face therapy. However, more long term efficacy, indicated by continued symptom reduction three months after treatment, could be only be found for the online group.

Psychometric properties of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) original and short forms in an African American community sample,"Background: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) has been widely used as a self-report measure of affect in community and clinical contexts. However, evaluations of the psychometric properties of PANAS scores have been limited in diverse ethnic groups. Several short forms of the PANAS have also been proposed, but very little is known about the psychometric properties of these versions. Methods: The present study investigated the psychometric properties, including the factor structure of the original PANAS and two short forms in an African American community sample (N=239). Descriptive, internal consistency reliability, factorial validity, and measurement invariance analyses were conducted. Results: All PANAS subscales from the original and short forms had adequate internal consistency. For the original PANAS, the model specifying three correlated factors (Positive Affect, Afraid, Upset) with correlated uniquenesses from redundant items provided the best fit to the data. However, the two-factor model (Positive Affect, Negative Affect) with correlated uniquenesses was also supported. For both short forms, the two-factor model with correlated uniquenesses fit the data best. Factors from all forms were generally invariant across age and gender, although there was some minor invariance at the item level. Limitations: Participants were from a limited geographic area and one ethnic group. Indicators of anxiety, depression, and cultural characteristics were not measured. Conclusion: The factor structure was replicated, suggesting no immediate concerns regarding the valid interpretation of PANAS scores. The results support the reliability and validity of the PANAS and its short forms for use among African Americans.

Psychiatric disorders in patients presenting to hospital following self-harm: A systematic review,"Background: Psychiatric disorders occur in approximately 90% of individuals dying by suicide. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in people who engage in non-fatal self-harm has received less attention. Method: Systematic review using electronic databases (Embase, PsycINFO and Medline) for English language publications of studies in which psychiatric disorders have been assessed using research or clinical diagnostic schedules in self-harm patients of all ages presenting to general hospitals, followed by meta-analyses using random effects methods. Results: A total of 50 studies from 24 countries were identified. Psychiatric (Axis I) disorders were identified in 83.9% (95% CI 74.7–91.3%) of adults and 81.2% (95% CI 60.9–95.5%) of adolescents and young persons. The most frequent disorders were depression, anxiety and alcohol misuse, and additionally attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder in younger patients. Personality (Axis II) disorders were found in 27.5% (95% CI 17.6–38.7%) of adult patients. Psychiatric disorders were somewhat more common in patients in Western (89.6%, 95% CI 83.0–94.7%) than non-Western countries (70.6%, 95% CI 50.1–87.6%). Limitations: Heterogeneity between study results was generally high. There were differences between studies in identification of study participants and diagnostic procedures. Conclusions: Most self-harm patients have psychiatric disorders, as found in people dying by suicide. Depression and anxiety disorders are particularly common, together with ADHD and conduct disorder in adolescents. Psychosocial assessment and aftercare of self-harm patients should include careful screening for such disorders and appropriate therapeutic interventions. Longitudinal studies of the progress of these disorders are required.

Risks associated with gender differences in bipolar I disorder,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that bipolar patients may differ in several features according to gender, but a number of the differences found remain controversial. Methods: The demographic, illness course, clinical, comorbidity and temperament characteristics of a total of 1090 consecutive DSM-IV bipolar I manic inpatients were compared according to gender. Results: Bipolar illness in women was characterised by the predominance of depression, as indicated by a depressive polarity at onset, higher rates of mixed mania, more suicidal behaviour, and a greater number of temperaments with depressive propensities. In contrast, the manic component was found to predominate in men. Men also had an earlier onset of their illness. Women displayed more comorbidities with eating, anxiety, and endocrine/metabolic disorders, whereas men were more comorbid with alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse, neurological, and cancer disorders. The following independent variables were associated with male gender: being single (+), depressive temperament (-), excessive alcohol use (+), cyclothymic temperament (-), excessive other substance use (+), mood congruent psychotic features (+), and manic polarity at onset (+). Limitations: The retrospective design and the sample being potentially not representative of the bipolar disorder population are limitations. Conclusions: Findings from this study tend to confirm most of the differences previously observed among bipolar men and women. Furthermore, these results draw attention to the risks that may be specifically linked to gender differences in bipolar I patients.

"Attachment, affective temperament, and personality disorders: A study of their relationships in psychiatric outpatients","Background: As the result of extensive translational and cross-disciplinary research, attachment theory is now a construct with significant neuropsychiatric traction. The correlation of attachment with other influential conceptual models (i.e. temperament and personality) is therefore of interest. Consequently, we explored how two attachment dimensions (attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) correlated with measures of temperament and personality in 357 psychiatric outpatients. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of four questionnaires (the Experiences in Close Relationship scale (ECR-R), Temperament and Character inventory (TCI), Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego questionnaire (TEMPS-A), and Personality Self-Portrait Questionnaire (PSQ)). Frequency measures and correlations were examined, as was the predictive value of attachment security for a personality disorder (PD). Results: Significant, robust correlations were found between attachment anxiety and (1) several negative affective temperaments (dysthymic and cyclothymic); (2) several indices of personality pathology (low self-directedness (TCI), DSM-IV paranoid, borderline, histrionic, avoidant and dependent personality traits). Attachment avoidance had fewer large correlations. In an exploratory model, the negative predictive value of attachment security for a PD was 86%. Limitations: Subjects were a relatively homogeneous subset of ambulatory psychiatric outpatients. PD diagnoses were via self-report. Conclusions: Clinically, these findings highlight the significant overlap between attachment, affective temperament, and personality and support the value of attachment as a screen for PDs. More broadly, given our growing understanding of the neurobiology of attachment (i.e. links with the oxytocin system), these results raise interesting questions about underlying biological systems and psychiatric treatment.

Randomised controlled non-inferiority trial with 3-year follow-up of internet-delivered versus face-to-face group cognitive behavioural therapy for depression,"Background: Guided internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) has been found to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, but there have been no direct comparisons with the more established group-based CBT with a long-term follow-up. Method: Participants with mild to moderate depression were recruited from the general population and randomized to either guided ICBT ( n = 33) or to live group treatment ( n = 36). Measures were completed before and after the intervention to assess depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Follow-ups were conducted at one-year and three-year after the treatment had ended. Results: Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects regression analysis. Results on the self-rated version of the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Scale showed significant improvements in both groups across time indicating non-inferiority of guided ICBT, and there was even a tendency for the guided ICBT group to be superior to group-based CBT at three year follow-up. Within-group effect sizes for the ICBT condition at post-treatment showed a Cohen′s d = 1.46, with a similar large effect at 3-year follow-up, d = 1.78. For the group CBT the corresponding within-group effects were d = 0.99 and d = 1.34, respectively. Limitations: The study was small with two active treatments and there was no placebo or credible control condition. Conclusions: Guided ICBT is at least as effective as group-based CBT and long-term effects can be sustained up to 3 years after treatment.

Higher cortisol levels at diurnal trough predict greater attentional bias towards threat in healthy young adults,"Background: Attentional bias (AB), selective information processing towards threat, can exacerbate anxiety and depression. Despite growing interest, physiological determinants of AB are yet to be understood. We examined whether stress hormone cortisol and its diurnal variation pattern contribute to AB. Methods: Eighty-seven healthy young adults underwent assessments for AB, anxious personality traits, depressive symptoms, and attentional function. Salivary cortisol was collected at three time points daily (at awakening, 30 min after awakening, and bedtime) for 2 consecutive days. We performed: (1) multiple regression analysis to examine the relationships between AB and the other measures and (2) analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups with different cortisol variation patterns for the other measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that higher cortisol levels at bedtime ( p &lt; 0.001), an anxious personality trait ( p = 0.011), and years of education ( p = 0.036) were included in the optimal model to predict AB ( adjusted R² = 0.234, p &lt; 0.001). ANOVA further demonstrated significant mean differences in AB and depressive symptoms; individuals with blunted cortisol variation exhibited significantly greater AB and depression than those with moderate variation ( p = 0.037 and p = 0.009, respectively). Limitations: Neuropsychological assessment focused on attention and cortisol measurement at three time points daily. Conclusions: We showed that higher cortisol levels at bedtime and blunted cortisol variation are associated with greater AB. Individuals who have higher cortisol levels at diurnal trough might be at risk of clinical anxiety or depression but could also derive more benefits from the attentional-bias-modification program.

War-related trauma exposure and multiple risk behaviors among school-going adolescents in Northern Uganda: The mediating role of depression symptoms,"Background: The relationship between war-related trauma exposure, depressive symptoms and multiple risk behaviors among adolescents is less clear in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We analyzed data collected from a sample of school-going adolescents four years postwar. Participants completed interviews assessing various risk behaviors defined by the Youth Self Report (YSR) and a sexual risk behavior survey, and were screened for post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms based on the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IESR) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Adolescents (HSCL-37A) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors independently associated with multiple risk behaviors. The logistic regression model of Baron and Kenny (1986) was used to evaluate the mediating role of depression in the relationship between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors. Results: Of 551 participants, 139 (25%) reported multiple (three or more) risk behaviors in the past year. In the multivariate analyses, depression symptoms remained uniquely associated with multiple risk behavior after adjusting for potential confounders including socio-demographic characteristics, war-related trauma exposure variables, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In mediation analysis, depression symptoms mediated the associations between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors. Limitations: The psychometric properties of the questionnaires used in this study are not well established in war affected African samples thus ethno cultural variation may decrease the validity of our measures. Conclusions: Adolescents with depression may be at a greater risk of increased engagement in multiple risk behaviors. Culturally sensitive and integrated interventions to treat and prevent depression among adolescents in post-conflict settings are urgently needed.

High rate of suicide attempt and associated psychological traits in an isolated tribal population of North-East India,"Background: Cases of suicide documented earlier all over the world reflect the presence of suicide behavior in primitive world at a higher rate compared to general urban population. The cause of such behavior is thought to be different among tribes and mental health was rarely presumed to be associated. In India, several ethnographic narratives described instances of suicides among several tribes, but evaluation of psychological traits were lacking. The present study on Idu Mishmi is an attempt to further validate earlier report of high rate of suicides among them and to evaluate psychological traits. Methods: Interview and administration of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) on 218 individuals comprised the data. Bivariate analyses and linear multiple regression were done to evaluate psychological traits in suicide behavior. Results: In the Idu Mishmi Population suicide attempt (14.22%) was higher than urban population in general (0.4–4.2%) and females were at higher risk. Depression (8.26%) was comparable with earlier reports, whereas anxiety syndrome (6.42%), alcohol abuse (36.24%) and eating disorder like Binge eating (6.42%), Bulimia nervosa (1.38%) were also recorded in the population. Limitations: Absence of psychiatry clinic and mechanism of recording suicide occurrences in remote tribal area is the basic limitation of the study. Conclusion: Depression and gender turned out to be significant determinants of suicide attempt in the studied population, whereas alcohol abuse was not a significant factor.

BDNF promoter methylation and suicidal behavior in depressive patients,"Introduction: Suicide is a major health problem, and depression is a major psychiatric cause of suicide. Suicide is influenced by the multifactorial interaction of many risk factors. Therefore, epigenetic research may lead to understandings that are applicable to suicide. This study investigated whether epigenetic changes are associated with suicidal behavior and evaluated the treatment outcome of suicidal ideation in depressive patients. Methods: In 108 patients with major depression, the promoter methylation of the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was measured. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics including a history of previous depressive episodes, age at onset, duration of illnesses, family history of depression, and number of stressful life events as well as subjective perception of stress and assessment scales for depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), function (SOFAS), disability (WHODAS-12), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) were evaluated at baseline. Suicidal behavior was ascertained using a semistructured clinical interview with questions about severity and intent. Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) was administered during 12 weeks of treatment with antidepressants. Results: A higher BDNF promoter methylation status was significantly associated with a previous suicidal attempt history, suicidal ideation during treatment, and suicidal ideation at last evaluation as well as with higher BSS scores and poor treatment outcomes for suicidal ideation. Limitations: Methylation status was investigated with limited area of the BDNF gene and sample size was relatively small. Conclusions: BDNF methylation status could be a proxy marker for previous suicidal attempts and a clinical biomarker for poor treatment outcomes of suicidal ideation in depression.

The structure of emotional symptoms in the postpartum period: Is it unique?,"Background: In perinatal mental health there is a lack of consensus as to whether postpartum emotional disorders are unique in their aetiology and clinical presentation. If the clinical presentation is unique, then the factor structure should be different in a postpartum sample. Methods: Admission and discharge scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995b) scores were collected for 527 inpatients admitted to a Psychiatric Mother and Baby Unit. Reliability and validity of the DASS were examined, and confirmatory factor analysis evaluated the fit of a series of models of the DASS. Results: The DASS had sound reliability and validity in the postpartum inpatient sample. The optimal fitting factor solution for the DASS was a revised three-factor model previously supported in studies of other clinical and non-clinical populations. The factor structure was invariant across admission and discharge. Limitations: The sample consisted of postpartum inpatients and the generalisability of results to other postpartum samples is not known. Conclusions: Postpartum emotional symptoms have the same factor structure previously observed in non-postpartum populations, consistent with the hypothesis that postpartum emotional disorders are similar to those occurring at other times. The present study provides support for the reliability and validity of the DASS in the postpartum period.

"Symptoms, comorbidity, and clinical course of depression in immigrants: Putting psychopathology in context","Background: Migration is considered a depression risk factor when associated with psychosocial adversity, but its impact on depression's clinical characteristics has not been specifically studied. We compared 85 migrants to 34 controls, examining depression's severity, symptomatology, comorbidity profile and clinical course. Method: A MINI interview modified to assess course characteristics was used to assign DSM-IV axis I diagnoses; medical files were used for Somatoform Disorders. Severity was assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg scale. Wherever possible, we adjusted comparisons for age and gender using logistic and linear regressions. Results: Depression in migrants was characterized by higher comorbidity (mostly somatoform and anxiety disorders), higher severity, and a non-recurrent, chronic course. Limitations: Our sample comes from a single center, and should be replicated in other health care facilities and other countries. Somatoform disorder diagnoses were solely based on file-content. Conclusion: Depression in migrants presented as a complex, chronic clinical picture. Most of our migrant patients experienced significant psychosocial adversity before and after migration: beyond cultural issues, our results suggest that psychosocial adversity impacts on the clinical expression of depression. Our study also suggests that migration associated with psychosocial adversity might play a specific etiological role, resulting in a distinct clinical picture, questioning the DSM-IV unitarian model of depression. The chronic course might indicate a resistance to standard therapeutic regimen and hints at the necessity of developing specific treatment strategies, adapted to the individual patients and their specific context.

Treatment adherence towards prescribed medications in bipolar-II acute depressed patients: Relationship with cyclothymic temperament and “therapeutic sensation seeking” in response towards subjective intolerance to pain,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 170 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2014-45677-005). In the original article, there were some errors, the corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Treatment adherence (TA) is crucial during almost any phase of bipolar disorder (BD), including type-II (BD-II) acute depression. While a number of issues have been traditionally accounted on the matter, additional factors should be likewise involved, including affective temperaments and some clinically suggestive psychopathological traits whose systematic assessment represents the aim of this study. Methods: Two hundred and twenty BD-II acute depressed outpatients were consecutively evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interviews for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition Axis-I and II Disorders, Hamilton scales for Depression and Anxiety, Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis Pisa Paris San Diego-Auto-questionnaire-110-item, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Zuckerman's Sensation-Seeking Scale-Form-V (SSS-V), Barratt's Impulsivity Scale-11-item, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory modules, Severity module of the Clinical Global Impression Scale for BD, Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and the Clinician Rating Scale (CRS). Patients were divided into non-adherent vs. treatment-adherent cases depending on MMAS-8+CRS scores. Results: In the TA − group, higher VAS and cyclothymic temperament scores were highly correlated ( r = .699; p ≤ .001). Those latter scores, along with SSS-V scores and the occurrence of lifetime addiction to painkiller and/or homeopathic medications available over the counter defined a “ therapeutic sensation seeking ” pattern allowing to correctly classify as much as 93.9% [Exp(B) = 3.490; p ≤ .001] of TA − cases (49/220). Limits: Lack of objective TA measures and systematic pharmacological record; recall bias on some diagnoses; and relatively small sample size. Conclusions: Stating the burden of TA in BD, additional studies on this regard are aimed, ideally contributing to enhance the management of BD itself.

"Affective temperaments are associated with specific clusters of symptoms and psychopathology: A cross-sectional study on bipolar disorder inpatients in acute manic, mixed, or depressive relapse","Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether different affective temperaments could be related to a specific mood disorder diagnosis and/or to different therapeutic choices in inpatients admitted for an acute relapse of their primary mood disorder. Method: Hundred and twenty-nine inpatients were consecutively assessed by means of the Structured and Clinical Interview for axis-I disorders/Patient edition and by the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego auto-questionnaire, Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Scale for Depression and for Anxiety, Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, Clinical Global impression, Drug Attitude Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and Symptoms Checklist-90 items version, along with records of clinical and demographic data. Results: The following prevalence rates for axis-I mood diagnoses were detected: bipolar disorder type I (BD-I, 28%), type II (31%), type not otherwise specified (BD-NOS, 33%), major depressive disorder (4%), and schizoaffective disorder (4%). Mean scores on the hyperthymic temperament scale were significantly higher in BD-I and BD-NOS, and in mixed and manic acute states. Hyperthymic temperament was significantly more frequent in BD-I and BD-NOS patients, whereas depressive temperament in BD-II ones. Hyperthymic and irritable temperaments were found more frequently in mixed episodes, while patients with depressive and mixed episodes more frequently exhibited anxious and depressive temperaments. Affective temperaments were associated with specific symptom and psychopathology clusters, with an orthogonal subdivision between hyperthymic temperament and anxious/cyclothymic/depressive/irritable temperaments. Therapeutic choices were often poorly differentiated among temperaments and mood states. Limits: Cross-sectional design; sample size. Conclusions: Although replication studies are needed, current results suggest that temperament-specific clusters of symptoms severity and psychopathology domains could be described.

Hierarchical screening for multiple mental disorders,"Background: There is a need for brief, accurate screening when assessing multiple mental disorders. Two-stage hierarchical screening, consisting of brief pre-screening followed by a battery of disorder-specific scales for those who meet diagnostic criteria, may increase the efficiency of screening without sacrificing precision. This study tested whether more efficient screening could be gained using two-stage hierarchical screening than by administering multiple separate tests. Method: Two Australian adult samples ( N = 1990) with high rates of psychopathology were recruited using Facebook advertising to examine four methods of hierarchical screening for four mental disorders: major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Results: Using K6 scores to determine whether full screening was required did not increase screening efficiency. However, pre-screening based on two decision tree approaches or item gating led to considerable reductions in the mean number of items presented per disorder screened, with estimated item reductions of up to 54%. The sensitivity of these hierarchical methods approached 100% relative to the full screening battery. Limitations: Further testing of the hierarchical screening approach based on clinical criteria and in other samples is warranted. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a two-phase hierarchical approach to screening multiple mental disorders leads to considerable increases efficiency gains without reducing accuracy. Screening programs should take advantage of prescreeners based on gating items or decision trees to reduce the burden on respondents.

Patterns of benzodiazepine and antidepressant use among middle-aged adults. The Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil),"Background: Antidepressant and benzodiazepine medicines are widely prescribed in high-income countries. Our aim was to investigate and describe clinical and demographic characteristics of their use in a large cohort from a middle-income country. Methods: Participants ( n = 15,105) from the Brazilian Health Longitudinal Study (ELSA-Brasil), a civil servant cohort from six different sites in Brazil were asked about antidepressant and benzodiazepine use. The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised was used for psychiatric assessment. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Results: Current use of antidepressant and benzodiazepine medicines was respectively reported by 6.87% and 3.88% of participants. These numbers were higher in major depression—MDD (16.5% and 13.9%), generalized anxiety disorder—GAD (14% and 9.5%) and any mental disorder (11.7% and 7.8%). The use of antidepressant and benzodiazepine was directly associated with clinical comorbidities and psychiatry diagnosis. In addition, older age was associated with benzodiazepine use and more years of schooling, with antidepressant use. Finally, the use of these medicines was strongly associated (odds ratio = 8.48, p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: Our cohort does not include younger adults (18–34 years), although it includes older (65–75 years) participants. Discussion: Antidepressant and benzodiazepine use in Brazil is lower than in high-income countries. We found that factors such as age and education level were associated with the use of these medicines, whereas MDD and GAD were poor predictors of psychopharmacotherapy use, suggesting misuse/overuse of psychopharmacotherapy among individuals without psychiatric illness and underuse among those with psychiatric conditions in Brazil.

Predictors and moderators of response to internet-delivered interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy for depression,"Background: By identifying which predictors and moderators lead to beneficial outcomes, accurate selection of the best initial treatment will have significant benefits for depressed individuals. Method: An automated, fully self-guided randomized controlled internet-delivered noninferiority trial was conducted comparing two new interventions (Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT; n = 620] and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT; n = 610]) to an active control intervention (MoodGYM; n = 613) over a period of 4 weeks to spontaneous visitors of an internet-delivered therapy website (e-couch). A range of putative predictors and moderators (socio-demographic characteristics [age, gender, marital status, education level], clinical characteristics [depression/anxiety symptoms, disability, quality of life, medication use], skills [mastery and dysfunctional attitudes] and treatment preference) were assessed using internet-delivered self-report measures at baseline and immediately following treatment and at six months follow-up. Analyses were conducted using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM). Results: Female gender, lower mastery and lower dysfunctional attitudes predicted better outcome at post-test and/or follow-up regardless of intervention. No overall differential effects for condition on depression as a function of outcome were found. However, based on time-specific estimates, a significant interaction effect of age was found. For younger people, internet-delivered IPT may be the preferred treatment choice, whereas older participants derive more benefits from internet-delivered CBT programs. Limitations: Although the sample of participants was large, power to detect moderator effects was still lacking. Conclusions: Different e-mental health programs may be more beneficial for specific age groups. The findings raise important possibilities for increasing depression treatment effectiveness and improving clinical practice guidelines for depression treatment of different age groups.

Suicidal ideation in a European Huntington's disease population,"Background: Previous studies indicate increased prevalences of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide in Huntington's disease (HD) compared with the general population. This study investigates correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation in HD. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 2106 HD mutation carriers, all participating in the REGISTRY study of the European Huntington's Disease Network. Of the 1937 participants without suicidal ideation at baseline, 945 had one or more follow-up measurements. Participants were assessed for suicidal ideation by the behavioural subscale of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Correlates of suicidal ideation were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and predictors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Results: At baseline, 169 (8.0%) mutation carriers endorsed suicidal ideation. Disease duration (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9–1.0), anxiety (OR = 2.14; 95%CI: 1.4–3.3), aggression (OR = 2.41; 95%CI: 1.5–3.8), a previous suicide attempt (OR = 3.95; 95%CI: 2.4–6.6), and a depressed mood (OR = 13.71; 95%CI: 6.7–28.0) were independently correlated to suicidal ideation at baseline. The 4-year cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation was 9.9%. Longitudinally, the presence of a depressed mood (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.05; 95%CI: 1.1–4.0) and use of benzodiazepines (HR = 2.44; 95%CI: 1.2–5.0) at baseline were independent predictors of incident suicidal ideation, whereas a previous suicide attempt was not predictive. Limitations: As suicidal ideation was assessed by only one item, and participants were a selection of all HD mutation carriers, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was likely underestimated. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation in HD frequently occurs. Assessment of suicidal ideation is a priority in mutation carriers with a depressed mood and in those using benzodiazepines.

Course sequences in bipolar disorder: Depressions preceding or following manias or hypomanias,"Background: Inferior response to lithium treatment has been reported in bipolar disorder (BD) patients with mania or hypomania following episodes of major depression (DMI) versus preceding depression (MDI), with intervening euthymic periods. However, additional characteristics of BD course-patterns require further assessment. Methods: We reviewed computerized clinical records and life-charts of 855 DSM-IV-TR BD-I or -II patients assessed and followed at mood-disorder centers in Cagliari or Rome to characterize their predominant course-sequences. Results: Morbidity over an average of 9.5 cycles in 18 years was characterized for sequencing of illness-episodes and euthymic intervals. Prevalent sequences included: major depression–hypomania (15.0%), mania–major depression (14.6%), major depression–mania (11.6%), and rapid-cycling (9.6%). Among subjects grouped by course-sequences (based on mania, mixed-states, or hypomania and major or minor depression), depression-before-[hypo]mania (DMI) cases were more likely to be women, diagnosed BD-II, have first-episodes of depressive or anxiety disorder, spend more time ill in depression, and benefit less with long-term mood-stabilizing treatments than with the opposite pattern (MDI). MDI patients were more likely to have substance-abuse and receive long-term mood-stabilizer treatments. Meta-analysis of 5 previous reports plus present findings found inferior treatment-response in DMI vs. MDI cases at a pooled risk-difference of 29% [CI: 18–40%] ( p &lt; 0.0001). Limitations: Some data were retrospective and subject to recall bias, and treatment was clinical (nonrandomized). Conclusions: The DMI course was strongly associated with first-episode depression or anxiety, excess depressive morbidity, and inferior treatment response, especially for depression.

What happens to depressed adolescents? A follow-up study into early adulthood,"Background : This study describes the mental illness and psychosocial outcomes of adolescents who experienced a depressive disorder and identifies predictors of full remission and recurrence. Methods: 140 adolescents with major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or depressive disorder NOS were offered psychosocial and/or antidepressant treatment across two clinical trials. Three to nine years later (mean 5.7 years), 111 adolescents and young adults completed self-, parent- and clinician-reported measures of psychopathology and psychosocial functioning in a naturalistic follow-up study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders was used to determine the presence or absence of depressive disorder as well as other Axis 1 Disorders. Results : By the follow-up assessment, most adolescents made a full remission from their index depressive disorder (92.6%). Recurrence of depressive disorder (52.4%) during the follow-up period was common, as was the experience of other disorders including anxiety, substance abuse and eating disorders. Time to full remission and recurrence did not vary between baseline types of depressive disorder. Self-reported depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were associated with failure to achieve full remission while socio-economic status, self-reported self-efficacy and depressive symptoms were associated with recurrence of depressive disorder. Limitations : Due to different treatment starting times, the length of the follow up period varied by up to 5.2 years. Conclusions : Adolescents who experience depressive disorder are at high risk of ongoing mental illness and psychosocial impairment. Predictors of the course of depressive disorder may be of use in determining which adolescents may require more intensive intervention.

The relationship between positive and negative automatic thought and activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortices: A multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study,"Background: Recently, neurobiological studies of the cognitive model of depression have become vastly more important, and a growing number of such studies are being reported. However, the relationship between the proportion of positive and negative automatic thought and activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortices has not yet been explored. We examined the relationship between brain activity and the proportion of positive and negative automatic thought in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods: We recruited 75 individuals with MDD (36 females; mean age = 39.23 ± 12.49). They completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Revised, Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Brain activation was measured by 52-channel NIRS. Results: We found that activation in the vicinity of the right superior temporal gyrus is related to a deviation to negative of the proportion of positive and negative thoughts in individuals with MDD. Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity was higher in the group with comparatively frequent positive thought. Limitations: Our participants were patients taking antidepressant medication, which is known to influence brain activity. Second, the poor spatial resolution of NIRS increases the difficulty of identifying the measurement position. Conclusions: We found that activation of the prefrontal and temporal cortices is related to the proportion of automatic thoughts in the cognitive model of depression.

Behavioral Activation System (BAS) differences in bipolar I and II disorder,"Background: A growing body of evidence supports the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) dyresgulation model of bipolar disorder, however its application to bipolar II disorder is limited. The current study examines its potential relevance to bipolar I and II disorders. We specifically sought to determine whether bipolar sub-types would differ in terms of BAS sensitivity, and examined for differential prospective relationships between BAS sensitivity and bipolar I and II symptom expression. Method: Participants were recruited from the Sydney-based Black Dog Institute. Diagnostic groups were derived on the basis of agreement between clinician and DSM-IV diagnoses from structured interviews. Baseline measures of BAS sensitivity, mood symptoms and anxiety were completed. Self-rated mood was assessed over a 6-month period. Clinician-rated mood status was re-assessed at follow-up to determine the predictive utility of BAS scores. Results: The sample comprised 151 bipolar participants (69 bipolar I, 82 bipolar II). BAS-Drive and Reward Responsiveness scores were significantly higher in bipolar I disorder participants. BAS sub-scale scores were uniquely positively associated with mood variability in bipolar I and II disorder. BAS-Drive and Reward Responsiveness scores were positively associated with bipolar I hypo(mania), and with the former also positively associated with bipolar II depression. BAS scores did not predict bipolar I or II mood episode status at 6-month follow-up. Limitations: BAS sensitivity was self-reported; inability to establish independence of BAS scores from residual symptoms; lack of controlling for medication effects; inability to determine the influence of life events; length of follow-up period may have not been sufficient to evaluate the predictive utility of BAS sensitivity for mood episodes or detect course of illness differences across bipolar sub-types. Conclusions: Differences in BAS sensitivity and associations with mood variability were quantified in bipolar I and II disorder, suggesting the need for tailored treatments for these separate conditions. Further investigation of the role of the BAS in bipolar sub-types is warranted.

Cognitive vulnerability differentially predicts symptom dimensions of depression,"Background: We examined the association of cognitive vulnerability to depression with changes in homogeneous measures of depressive symptoms. Methods: Baseline and 1-year follow-up data were obtained from 2981 participants of the Netherlands study of depression and anxiety. Multivariate regression analyses were carried out on cognitive reactivity, locus of control and implicit and explicit self-depressive associations in combination with negative life events. The purpose of this analysis was to predict changes on the mood/cognition and anxiety/arousal subscales of the inventory of depressive symptomatology—self report. Results: Cognitive reactivity, locus of control and explicit self-depressive associations were independently associated with changes in depressive symptoms after adjustment for covariates and baseline severity (all p &lt; 0.01). Negative life-events interacted with cognitive vulnerability to depression to predict depressive symptoms. Locus of control ( b ₁ = 0.16, SE = 0.02, η² = 0.01; b ₂ = 0.10, SE = 0.02, η² = 0.004, F = 8.69, p &lt; 0.01) and explicit self-depressive associations ( b ₁ = 0.10, SE = 0.03, η² = 0.02; b 2 = 0.02, SE = 0.04, F = 7.50, p &lt; 0.01) were more strongly associated with the cognitive ( b ₁) than the somatic ( b ₂) symptom dimension of depression. Limitations: The study sample is over-inclusive of depressed patients. Therefore it might be problematic generalizing the findings to the general population. Conclusion: Cognitive etiological factors may play a role in a “cognitive” subtype of depression. The findings strengthen the notion that homogeneous measures of depressive symptoms enable a greater degree of discrimination between subtypes than a multidimensional conception of depression.

Clinical relevance of comorbidity in obsessive compulsive disorder: The Netherlands OCD Association study,"Background: This study describes lifetime and current rates of comorbidity, its onset and its consequences in a large clinical sample of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). A wide range of risk factors and clinical characteristics were also examined to determine whether pure OCD is different from OCD with current comorbidity. Finally, the temporal sequencing of the disorders was examined. Method: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association (NOCDA) study. A sample of 382 participants with current OCD (during the past month) was evaluated. Results: Current comorbidity occurred in 55% of patients with OCD, while 78% suffered from lifetime comorbidity. Comorbidity is associated with more severe OCD, anxiety and depressive symptoms and more negative consequences on daily life. Multiple comorbid disorders often precede OCD and influence both its course and severity. Childhood trauma and neuroticism are vulnerability factors for the development of multiple comorbid disorders in OCD. Limitations: It should be noted that causal inferences about the association between risk factors and OCD are precluded since our results were based on cross-sectional data. Conclusion: (Multiple) comorbidity in OCD is clinically relevant since it is associated with a specific pattern of vulnerability, with greater chronicity, with more severe OCD and more negative consequences on daily life. This indicates that the diagnosis and treatment of all comorbid disorders is clinically relevant, and clinicians should be especially aware of multiple disorders in cases of childhood trauma and high levels of neuroticism. Primary OCD has a different developmental and comorbidity pattern compared to secondary OCD.

Oxidative stress and lowered total antioxidant status are associated with a history of suicide attempts,"Background: There is evidence that depression is accompanied by inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&amp;NS) and metabolic disorders. However links between oxidative stress and suicide attempts in depressed patients are poorly understood. This study examines whether a history of suicide attempts is associated with inflammation, O&amp;NS and metabolic disorders. Methods: Blood specimens were collected from study participants aged 18–60 ( N = 342) recruited at the State University of Londrina, Brazil, and measured for oxidative stress biomarkers: nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products and plasma total antioxidant potential (TRAP); inflammatory biomarkers: fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; and metabolic variables. Subjects were divided into those with ( n = 141) and without ( n = 201) a history of suicidal attempts. Results: Individuals with a history of suicide attempts had significantly higher levels of NOx and lipid hydroperoxides and lowered TRAP as compared to individuals without suicide attempts. There were no significant associations between a history of suicide attempts and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers and metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression showed that both unipolar and bipolar disorder, female gender, smoking behavior and lipid hydroperoxides were significantly associated with a history of suicide attempts. The combined effects of oxidative stress, smoking, depression, female gender were independent from classical risk factors, including marital status, years of education and anxiety. Conclusions: O&amp;NS as well as lowered antioxidant levels may play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior independently from the effects of depression and smoking, both of which are associated with increased O&amp;NS, and classical suicide predictors, such as years of education and marital status.

Smoking and suicidality in subjects with major depressive disorder: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"Background: Detailed characteristics of depressive smokers and its association with suicidality were still less investigated. The aim of this study was to delineate characteristics of smokers with major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine the relationship between these characteristics and suicidality using an epidemiologic database, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Methods: A total of 5695 subjects with MDD, defined by the DSM-IV criteria, were included in our analysis. Current smokers, former smokers, and lifetime nonsmokers were compared in terms of demographic, clinical characteristics, and functional level. Suicidality, evaluated by history of suicide ideation and attempts while in a low mood was evaluated and compared among the groups. Results: Current smokers with MDD showed a greater number of DSM-IV symptoms while in acute episodes, a higher rate of alcohol and drug-use disorders, and poorer functional levels than nonsmokers. Previous smokers displayed intermediate characteristics between current smokers and nonsmokers. The logistic regression analysis revealed that both current and former smoking status predicted the risk of having a history of attempted suicide (current smokers: odds ratio 1.62, 95% C.I. 1.42–1.86; former smokers: odds ratio 1.37, 95% C.I. 1.13–1.66) after adjusting for demographic data, a history of subthreshold hypomania, and a lifetime axis II/anxiety/alcohol use/substance-use disorder. Limitations: Retrospective, cross-sectional evaluation; suicidality assessed only in the most severe depressive episode. Conclusions: The present study corroborates that smokers with MDD showed distinct clinical characteristics, and cigarette smoking can predict attempted suicide in a community representative sample of people with MDD.

Social adjustment among treatment responder patients with mood disorders,"Background: Patients with major depression (MD) show reduced social adjustment when compared with healthy controls. However, even among treatment responders, significant differences in social adjustment occur. The main aim of the present work is to study several socio-demographic and clinical variables possibly influencing social adjustment in MD patients who responded to treatment. Methods: Two hundred and eleven MD patients experiencing a depressive episode who responded to their current treatment were recruited within the context of a large European multicentre project. Our primary outcome measure was the association between 19 socio-demographic and clinical variables and total social adjustment scores, as measured with the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS). Secondary outcome measures included the associations between the same variables and SAS sub-scales, and the associations between these variables and self-esteem, as measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results: A co-morbidity with anxiety disorders and the severity of residual depression symptoms were the strongest independent factors associated with poorer social adjustment, in terms of total and most sub-areas' SAS scores. Other variables associated with total and sub-areas' SAS scores were identified as well, although some variations across different areas were observed. Limitations: The cross-sectional design, the retrospective assessment of data and the lack of a placebo control group. Conclusions: Our results confirm that a co-morbidity with anxiety disorders and higher residual depression symptoms could reduce social adjustment among responder MD patients. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.

Clinical phenotype of bipolar disorder with comorbid binge eating disorder,"Background: To explore the relationship between binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity in patients with bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: 717 patients participating in the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Biobank completed structured diagnostic interviews and questionnaires for demographic and illness-related variables. They also had weight and height measured to determine body mass index (BMI). The effects of BED and obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m²), as well as their interaction, were assessed on one measure of general medical burden and six proxies of psychiatric illness burden. Results: 9.5% of patients received a clinical diagnosis of BED and 42.8% were obese. BED was associated with a significantly elevated BMI. Both BED and obesity were associated with greater psychiatric and general illness burden, but illness burden profiles differed. After controlling for obesity, BED was associated with suicidality, psychosis, mood instability, anxiety disorder comorbidity, and substance abuse comorbidity. After controlling for BED status, obesity was associated with greater general medical comorbidity, but lower substance abuse comorbidity. There were no significant interaction effects between obesity and BED, or BMI and BED, on any illness burden outcome. Limitations: There may have been insufficient power to detect interactions between BED and obesity. Conclusions: Among patients with BP, BED and obesity are highly prevalent and correlated, but associated with different profiles of enhanced illness burden. As the association of BED with greater psychiatric illness burden remained significant even after accounting for the effect of obesity, BP with BED may represent a clinically important sub-phenotype.

Infants at familial risk for depression show a distinct pattern of cortisol response to experimental challenge,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 175 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2015-10068-021). A typographical error was there in the heading for Table 1. It has been corrected as ""Descriptive statistics. Mean and standard deviations of the social risk index and salivary cortisol levels (ng/ml) at each collection point.""] Background: The aim of the study was to examine the link between maternal depression and the infant's HPA axis functioning in relation to a sequence of emotional challenges at 12 months postpartum, while controlling for maternal anxiety disorder and general sociodemographic risk. Method: Two hundred and fifty-seven infants whose mothers had been interviewed in pregnancy, as part of a prospective longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of U.K. families, were individually tested in the laboratory and then observed during a simulated birthday party scenario. Three cortisol samples were taken over the course of 1½ h of afternoon testing. Results: The cortisol levels of infants whose mothers had no history of depression decreased significantly after individual testing, and rose again significantly in response to the birthday party challenge. In contrast, infants whose mothers had been diagnosed with depression before conception, during pregnancy or in the first 6 months postpartum showed no decrease from the initially elevated levels at entry to the laboratory and a less marked increase in response to the party. Limitations: The study does not employ a traditional stress paradigm; instead it introduces a novel design to assess HPA axis functioning in relation to everyday emotional challenges. Conclusions: The findings suggest that altered responses to mildly challenging events in infancy may be a marker for infants’ familial risk for depressive illness.

Psychometric properties of the List of Threatening Experiences—LTE and its association with psychosocial factors and mental disorders according to different scoring methods,"Background: The List of Threatening Experiences (LTE) questionnaire is frequently used to assess stressful events; however, studies of its psychometric properties are scarce. We examined the LTE's reliability, factorial structure, construct validity and explored the association between LTE scores and psychosocial variables and mental disorders. Method: This study involved interviewing 5442 primary care attendees from Spain. Associations between four different methods of quantifying LTE scores, psychosocial factors, major depression (CIDI), anxiety disorders (PRIME-MD), alcohol misuse and dependence (AUDIT) were measured. Results: The LTE showed high test–retest reliability (Kappa range = 0.61–0.87) and low internal consistency (α = 0.44). Tetrachoric factorial analysis yielded four factors (spousal and relational problems; employment and financial problems; personal problems; illness and bereavement in close persons). Logistic multilevel regression found a strong association between greater social support and a lower occurrence of stressful events (OR range = 0.36–0.79). The association between religious–spiritual beliefs and the LTE, was weaker. The association between mental disorders and LTE scores was greater for depression (OR range = 1.64–2.57) than anxiety (OR range = 1.35–1.97), though the highest ORs were obtained with alcohol dependence (OR range = 2.86–4.80). The ordinal score (ordinal regression) was more sensitive to detect the strength of association with mental disorders. Limitations: We are unable to distinguish the direction of the association between stressful events, psychosocial factors and mental disorders, due to our cross-sectional design of the study. Conclusions: The LTE is a valid and reliable measure of stress in mental health, and the strength of association with mental disorders depends on the method of quantifying LTE scores.

Cooperation and depressive symptoms,"Background: Deficits in pro-social cooperation are common in many individuals with mental illnesses such as depression. For decades, researchers have used economic game paradigms to compare cross-cultural cooperative behavior. However, research using economic games to assess cooperative behavior in clinical populations is in the early stages. We hypothesized that individuals with greater depressive symptoms would struggle to maintain reciprocity in iterative games, but not in single-iteration games measuring personal values. Methods: Participants ( n = 41) played four computer-based economic games (prisoner's dilemma, the public goods game, the ultimatum game, and the trust game) measuring different aspects of cooperation. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and other measures of personality and demographics. Analyses assessed the relationships between game performance and psychological distress as measured by the DASS. Results: Significant correlations were found between game performance and depressive symptoms, but not symptoms of anxiety or stress. Performance in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game was significantly related to depression in a linear regression even when known associations with depressive affect such as age, gender, race, education, marital status, and neuroticism were controlled for. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were associated with an inability to sustain reciprocal cooperation. Participants showed the predicted deficits in cooperation in these economic games. Economic games show the potential for assessing the social deficits associated with depressive symptoms.

Late-life depressive symptoms: Prediction models of change,"Background: Depression is a well-recognised problem in the elderly. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with predictors of change in depressive symptoms, both in subjects with and without baseline significant depressive symptoms. Methods: Longitudinal study of community-dwelling elderly people (&gt; 60 years or older), baseline evaluations, and two additional evaluations were reported. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 30-item geriatric depression scale, and a score of 11 was used as cut-off point for significant depressive symptoms in order to stratify the analyses in two groups: with significant depressive symptoms and without significant depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic data, social support, anxiety, cognition, positive affect, control locus, activities of daily living, recent traumatic life events, physical activity, comorbidities, and quality of life were evaluated. Multi-level generalised estimating equation model was used to assess the impact on the trajectory of depressive symptoms. Results: A number of 7882 subjects were assessed, with 29.42% attrition. At baseline assessment, mean age was 70.96 years, 61.15% were women. Trajectories of depressive symptoms had a decreasing trend. Stronger associations in those with significant depressive symptoms, were social support (OR.971, p &lt; .001), chronic pain (OR 2.277, p &lt; .001) and higher locus of control (OR.581, p &lt; .001). In contrast for those without baseline significant depressive symptoms anxiety and a higher locus of control were the strongest associations. Conclusions: New insights into late-life depression are provided, with special emphasis in differentiated factors influencing the trajectory when stratifying regarding basal status of significant depressive symptoms. Limitations: The study has not included clinical evaluations and nutritional assessments.

Impulsive responses to emotion as a transdiagnostic vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing symptoms,"Introduction: This study explored the hypothesis that impulsive reactions to heightened emotion may reflect a transdiagnostic vulnerability to both externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Methods: A sample of undergraduates completed self-report measures of aggression, borderline personality disorder symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and alcohol problems, and a subset completed interviews that assessed suicidality. All participants also completed self-report measures relating to impulsivity. We predicted that emotion-reactive impulsivity, but not other aspects of impulsivity, would be related to the set of psychopathology symptoms. Results: Multiple regression analyses found that emotion-reactive impulsivity was uniquely related to each of the psychopathology scales, whereas non-emotion-relevant impulsivity was uniquely related only to alcohol problems. Conclusion: Discussion focuses on limitations and clinical implications.

University Student Depression Inventory (USDI): Confirmatory factor analysis and review of psychometric properties,"Background: The 30-item USDI is a self-report measure that assesses depressive symptoms among university students. It consists of three correlated three factors: lethargy, cognitive–emotional and academic motivation. The current research used confirmatory factor analysis to asses construct validity and determine whether the original factor structure would be replicated in a different sample. Psychometric properties were also examined. Method: Participants were 1148 students (mean age 22.84 years, SD = 6.85) across all faculties from a large Australian metropolitan university. Students completed a questionnaire comprising of the USDI, the depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) and Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS). Results: The three correlated factor model was shown to be an acceptable fit to the data, indicating sound construct validity. Internal consistency of the scale was also demonstrated to be sound, with high Cronbach alpha values. Temporal stability of the scale was also shown to be strong through test-retest analysis. Finally, concurrent and discriminant validity was examined with correlations between the USDI and DASS subscales as well as the LSS, with sound results further supporting the construct validity of the scale. Cut-off points were also developed to aid total score interpretation. Limitations: Response rates are unclear. In addition, the representativeness of the sample could be improved potentially through targeted recruitment (i.e. reviewing the online sample statistics during data collection, examining the representativeness trends and addressing particular faculties within the university that were underrepresented). Conclusions: The USDI provides a valid and reliable method of assessing depressive symptoms found among university students.

"The societal cost of depression: Evidence from 10,000 Swedish patients in psychiatric care","Objective: Depression cost studies have mainly taken a primary care perspective and should be completed with cost estimates from psychiatric care. The objectives of this study were to estimate the societal per-patient cost of depression in specialized psychiatric care in Sweden, and to relate costs to disease severity, depressive episodes, hospitalization, and patient functioning. Methods: Retrospective resource use data in inpatient and outpatient care for 2006–2008, as well as ICD-10 diagnoses and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), were obtained from the Northern Stockholm psychiatric clinic (covering half of Stockholm's population aged 18 years and above). As a complement, data from national registers on pharmaceuticals and sick leave were used in order to estimate the societal cost of depression. Results: Based on 10,430 patients (63% women), the mean annual per-patient cost was €17,279 in 2008. The largest cost item was indirect costs due to productivity losses (88%), followed by outpatient care (6%). Patients with mild and severe depression had average costs of €14,200 and €21,500, respectively. Total costs were substantially higher during depressive episodes, among patients with co-morbid psychosis or anxiety, for hospitalized patients, and for patients with poor functioning. Limitations: Primary care costs and costs for reduced productivity at work were not included. Conclusions: The main cost item among depression patients in psychiatric care was indirect costs. Costs were higher than previously reported for primary care, and strongly related to hospitalization, depressive episodes, and low functioning. This suggests that effective treatment that avoids depressive episodes and hospitalization may reduce society's costs for depression.

Difference in remission in a Chinese population with anxious versus nonanxious treatment-resistant depression: A report of OPERATION study,"Background: A secondary analysis was conducted to compare treatment outcomes for anxious depression and nonanxious depression in previous published OPERATION trials of a variety of antidepressants and augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: A total of 375 patients that met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the stage 2 TRD criteria (described by Thase &amp; Rush) were enrolled. Anxious depression was defined as MDD with a HRSD-17 anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7. Data were derived from an earlier study, designed to compare efficacy and tolerability of fixed dosage of extended-release venlafaxine, mitazapine, paroxetine, and risperidone, sodium valproate, buspirone, trazodone or thyroid hormone augmenting to paroxetine in those patients. Treatment outcomes were compared between patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD. Results: Nearly 70% of participants had anxious depression. Remission rates were significantly lower and ratings of adverse event frequency were significantly greater in patients with anxious TRD than in those with nonanxious TRD. Presence of anxious depression predicted worse outcomes. Limitations: Lack of a placebo control arm prevents us from ruling out placebo effects. The two groups were non-randomly allocated to medications. Only patients with stage 2 TRD were enrolled, which may limit generalizablity to patients without a history of resistance. Comorbid anxiety disorders that might confound the specific treatment effects were not addressed. Conclusions: The findings support and extend the hypothesis that anxious depression is associated with poorer outcomes. It suggests a dimensional assessment of co-occurring anxious features of MDD patients may be clinically feasible for countries like China where difficulties in making comorbidity diagnosis exist.

Using multiple methods to characterize the phenotype of individuals with a family history of major depressive disorder,"Background: Unaffected relatives (URs) of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are biologically more vulnerable to depression. We compare healthy URs and controls at the level of phenotype (symptoms and functioning) and endophenotype (negative emotion bias), and further investigate the interrelation between these and the contribution of environmental early life stress. Methods: URs ( n = 101), identified using Family History Screen interview methods and matched controls completed written and interview questions assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety, negative cognitive style, life functioning and early life stress. Biases in emotion processing were measured using a facial expression of emotion identification paradigm. Results: Compared to controls, URs reported higher levels of depression and anxiety, a stronger negative cognitive bias, and poorer functioning and lower satisfaction with life. URs were slower to correctly identify fear and sad facial expressions. A slower response time to identify sad faces was correlated with lower quality of life in the social domain. Early life stress (ELS) did not contribute significantly to any outcome. Limitations: The methodology relies on accurate reporting of participants' own psychiatric history and that of their family members. The degree of vulnerability varies among URs. Conclusions: A family history of depression accounts for subtle differences in symptom levels and functioning without a necessary role of ELS. A negative emotion bias in processing emotion may be one vulnerability marker for MDD. Biological markers may affect functioning measures before symptoms at the level of experience.

Japanese dietary pattern consistently relates to low depressive symptoms and it is modified by job strain and worksite supports,"Background: This study examined the association between traditional Japanese dietary pattern and depressive symptoms in Japanese workers, employing large-scale samples, considering socioeconomic status (SES) and job stress factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 2266 Japanese employees aged 21–65 years from all areas of Japan was conducted as part of the Japanese Study of Health, Occupation and Psychosocial factors related Equity (J-HOPE). Habitual diet was assessed by FFQ (BDHQ). The depression degree and job stress factors (job demand, job control, and worksite support) were measured by K6 and Job Content Questionnaire. Results: Participants with high scores for the balanced Japanese dietary pattern were significantly less likely to show probable mood/anxiety disorders (K6 ≥ 9) with multivariate adjustment including SES and job stress factors (odds ratio = 0.66 [0.51–0.86], trend P = 0.002). Other dietary patterns were not associated with depressive symptoms. Even after stratification by job stress factors, the Japanese dietary pattern was consistently protective against depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a highly significant difference between the first and third tertiles of the dietary pattern was observed in participants with active strain (high demand and high control) with low worksite supports (8.5 vs. 5.2, P = 0.011). Limitations: Female participant sample was relatively small. Conclusions: Japanese dietary pattern consistently related to low depressive symptoms in this large-scale cohort of Japanese workers, even after adjusting for SES and job stress factors. The protective impact is especially strong for workers with active strain and low support. Making better use of traditional dietary patterns may facilitate reducing social disparities in mental health.

Presentation and prevalence of PTSD in a bipolar disorder population: A STEP-BD examination,"Background: Co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses have a negative impact on quality of life and change the presentation and prognosis of bipolar disorder (BD). To date, comorbidity research on patients with BD has primarily focused on co-occurring anxiety disorders and trauma history; only recently has there been a specific focus on co-occurring PTSD and BD. Although rates of trauma and PTSD are higher in those with bipolar disorder than in the general population, little is known about differences across bipolar subtypes. Methods: Using the NIMH STEP-BD dataset ( N = 3158), this study evaluated whether there were baseline differences in the prevalence of PTSD between participants with bipolar disorder I (BDI) and bipolar disorder II (BDII), using the MINI and the Davidson Trauma Scale. Differences in PTSD symptom clusters between patients with BDI and BDII were also evaluated. Results: A significantly greater proportion of participants with BDI had co-occurring PTSD at time of study entry ( Χ ²(1)=12.6; p &lt; .001). BDI and BDII subgroups did not significantly differ in re-experiencing, avoidance, or arousal symptoms. Limitations: The analysis may suggest a correlational relationship between PTSD and BD, not a causal one. Further, it is possible this population seeks treatment more often than individuals with PTSD alone. Finally, due to the episodic nature of BD and symptom overlap between the two disorders, misdiagnosis is possible. Conclusions: PTSD may be more prevalent in patients with BDI. However, the symptom presentation of PTSD appears similar across BD subtypes. Individuals should be thoroughly assessed for co-occurring diagnoses in an effort to provide appropriate treatment.

"Differential impact of isolated psychotic symptoms on treatment outcome of major depressive disorder in the STAR*D cohort of Whites, Blacks and Latinos","Objective: To determine whether isolated psychotic symptoms are more likely to be endorsed by depressed Latinos as opposed to other ethnic–racial groups; whether these symptoms affect Latinos similarly to other ethnic–racial groups in terms of treatment response; and whether they are more likely to be associated with anxiety disorders in depressed Latinos. Methods: We analyzed data from STAR⁎D subjects who self identified as White, Black, or Latino. Rates of isolated psychotic symptoms were assessed by the self-rated Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) and compared between ethnic–racial groups. Depressive remission outcomes were compared within each ethnic–racial group between subjects who endorsed psychotic symptoms versus no psychotic symptoms. Associations between isolated psychotic symptoms and anxiety disorders were also examined. Results: Among 2597 eligible subjects with at least one post-baseline assessment and available PDSQ data excluding first-rank symptoms, the prevalence of auditory–visual hallucination was 2.5% in Whites ( n =49/1928), 11.3% in Blacks ( n =45/398) 6.3% in Latinos ( n =17/270) ( χ ²=64.9; df=2; p &lt;0.001). Prevalence of paranoid ideation was 15.5% in Whites ( n =299/1927), 31.5% in Blacks ( n =126/400), and 21.1% in Latinos ( n =57/270) ( χ ²=57.3; df=2; p &lt;0.001). Among Whites and Blacks but not Latinos, depressive remission rates were worse in subjects with auditory–visual hallucinations compared to those without them. Paranoid ideation had a significant negative impact on remission in Whites only. In all ethnic–racial groups, a significant association was found between auditory–visual hallucinations and PTSD and panic disorder. Limitations: The STAR*D study did not include any structured clinician-based assessment of psychotic symptoms. Conclusion: Latinos do not appear to have worse outcomes when treated for MDD with auditory–visual hallucinations, differently from Whites and Blacks.

Age-dependent symptomatology of depression in hospitalized patients and its implications for DSM-5,"Background: We investigated effects of current age and age at onset on symptomatology of depression with reference to proposed revisions in DSM-5. Methods: The study entailed medical records of 326 inpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, including 520 depressive episodes, with 113 first episodes lifetime. Subjects were divided into three groups: young-adults, middle-aged adults and older adults. Results: In young-adults, active suicidal ideation, lifetime suicidal attempts, irritability, anhedonia and persistent depressive symptoms between the episodes were more frequent than in the other groups. Among older adults, depression was associated with insomnia, hypochondriasis, somatization, decreased appetite, weight loss, memory impairment and decreased activity. The older age was not associated with higher number of previous episodes of depression, bigger severity or duration of a single episode or a different degree of remission. Early-onset depression was associated with more suicidal attempts. Limitations: The study was retrospective and the sample may be treated only as representative for hospitalized depressed patients. Conclusions: Age and age at onset are important factors influencing the course and symptomatology of a depressive episode. Depressive episodes with anxiety and with suicide risk severity are important specifiers that vary with the age at onset and/or age of the patient and should be considered for inclusion in the DSM-5 revision.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for depression: Analysis of response using a three-factor structure of the Montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale,"Background: There is growing evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective treatment for depression. However, no study to date has profiled the antidepressant effects of tDCS using items or factors on depression symptom severity rating scales. This could potentially provide information about the mechanisms by which tDCS achieves its antidepressant effects and also identify clinical predictors of response. Methods: The present study analysed scores on the Montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS) from a randomised, sham-controlled trial of tDCS (Loo et al., 2012. British Journal of Psychiatry. 200, 52–59) using a three-factor model of MADRS items (Suzuki et al., 2005. Depression and Anxiety. 21, 95–97) encompassing dysphoria, retardation and vegetative symptoms. Results: Participants in the active tDCS treatment group showed significant improvement in dysphoria while participants in the sham treatment group did not. While both groups showed improvement in retardation symptoms, improvement was significantly greater in the active tDCS group. Both groups also showed improvement in vegetative symptoms but there were no between-group differences. Limitations: Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to investigate the generalisability of results and whether the MADRS factor structure may change as a result of the specific treatment used. Conclusions: tDCS appears to be particularly effective in treating dysphoria and retardation, but not vegetative symptoms of depression. This may have implications for selection of types of depression most likely to respond to this treatment.

Associations between depression severity and purinergic receptor P2RX7 gene polymorphisms,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) have significant genetic predisposition. The P2RX7 gene (coding for P2X7 purinergic receptor) has been suggested as a susceptibility gene for both MDD and BPD. In the current study the genetic effects of rs2230912 (Gln460Arg) and rs1653625 (located in the 3' untranslated region of the P2RX7 gene) were explored in mood disorders. Methods: Genotype frequencies were established in 315 patients (195 with MDD and 120 with BPD diagnosis) and in 373 controls. Depression severity was assessed by the clinician-rated Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and by the self-report Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In the case-control analysis we did not find any significant differences between genotype frequencies of either BPD or MDD cases and controls. However, BPD patients carrying at least one rs2230912 G-allele scored higher on both MADRS and HADS-depression scale (nominal p-value was 0.028 and 0.003, respectively). The rs1653625 AA genotype was also associated with higher depression scores in the BPD group (nominal p-value of MADRS: 0.019, HADS-depression: 0.017). After correction for multiple testing, the association between rs2230912 and HADS-depression score remained significant in the BPD group ( p &lt; 0.006); this genetic effect explained 9% of the variance (partial η² = 0.09). In the MDD group we did not find any significant genetic effect. Limitations: The relatively small number of BPD patients warrants for a replication study. Conclusions: Our genetic association study supports the association between P2RX7 gene and severity of depressive symptoms in BPD patients.

Subjective sleep quality in relation to inhibition and heart rate variability in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Patients with panic disorder (PD) are known to report impaired sleep quality and symptoms of insomnia. PD is an anxiety disorder characterised by deficient physiological regulation as measured by heart rate variability (HRV), and reduced HRV, PD and insomnia have all been related to impaired inhibitory ability. The present study aimed to investigate the interrelationships between subjectively reported sleep impairment, cognitive inhibition and vagally mediated HRV in a sample characterised by variability on measures of all these constructs. Methods: Thirty-six patients with PD with or without agoraphobia were included. Cognitive inhibition was assessed with the Color–Word Interference Test from the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), HRV was measured using high frequency (HF) power (ms²), and subjectively reported sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Cognitive inhibition was related to both Sleep latency and Sleep disturbances, whereas HRV was only related to Sleep disturbances. These relationships were significant also after controlling for depression. Limitations: Correlational design. Conclusion: Cognitive inhibition is related to key insomnia symptoms: sleep initiation and sleep maintenance. The data supports the psychobiological inhibition model of insomnia, and extends previous findings. Possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Self-reported major depressive symptoms at baseline impact abstinence prognosis in smoking cessation program. A one-year prospective study,"Objective: The association between major depressive symptoms and smoking has been extensively documented. However, previous studies report conflicting findings about the impact of depression on lapse of smoking cessation. We hypothesize that smokers with self-reported major depressive symptoms at baseline are at higher risk of a lapse. Methods: One thousand and twenty participants aged, 18 years and over, were recruited in a smoking-cessation unit. All participants were assessed for their smoking status six times during one year of follow-up. Participants were classified as ""euthymic"", presenting ""minor depressive symptomatology"" or ""major depressive symptomatology"" according to their baseline score on the Hospitalization Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Using Cox’s proportional hazard regression modeling, adjusted for potential confounding factors (nicotine dependence, number of cigarettes/day, previous cessation attempt, alcohol misuse, sociodemographic variables), it was shown that lapse is associated with major depressive symptoms (Hazard Ratio: HR = 1.23 [1.02;1.47]; p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our results suggest the importance for clinicians to deal with depression and to discriminate minor from major depressive symptoms at preliminary smoking cessation consultations.

Factor structure and clinical utility of BDI-II factor scores in postpartum women,"Background: The purpose of the current study was to examine the factorial dimensions underlying Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in a large ethnically and economically diverse sample of postpartum women and to assess their relative contribution in differentiating clinical diagnoses in a subsample of depressed women. Methods: We administered the BDI-II to 953 women between 4 and 20 weeks postpartum. Women who had low (1–7) and high (&gt;12) BDI-II total scores were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). Results: Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed three factors, Cognitive, Somatic, and Affective, that accounted for 49.09% of the overall variance of items. Logistic regression analyses showed that somatic and affective factors contributed to diagnosis of major depression, while the somatic factor alone contributed to the diagnosis of depression with comorbid anxiety. The cognitive factor differentiated women with major depression from women who were never depressed. Limitations: Our definition of clinical depression included episodes of depression during the child’s lifetime, and depressive symptoms were not necessarily current at the time of the assessment, which may impact the relative contribution of BDI-II factors to clinical diagnosis. Conclusion: Conceptualizing the structure of the BDI-II using these three factors could contribute to refining the measurement and scoring of depressive symptomatology and severity in postpartum women. Although somatic symptoms of depression may be difficult to differentiate from the physiological changes of normative postpartum adjustment, our results support the inclusion of somatic symptoms of depression in the calculation of a BDI-II total score.

"Exposure to interpersonal trauma, attachment insecurity, and depression severity","Background: Exposure to traumatic events is a nonspecific risk factor for psychiatric symptoms including depression. The trauma–depression link finds support in numerous studies; however, explanatory mechanisms linking past trauma to current depressive symptoms are poorly understood. This study examines the role that attachment insecurity plays in mediating the relationship between prior exposure to trauma and current expression of depression severity. Methods: Past trauma and attachment anxiety and avoidance were assessed at baseline in a large cohort ( N = 705) of adults admitted to a specialized adult psychiatric hospital with typical lengths of stay ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. Depression severity was assessed at day 14 of treatment using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results: Interpersonal trauma (e.g., assaults, abuse) was correlated with depression severity, whereas exposure to impersonal trauma (e.g., natural disasters, accidents) was not. Adult attachment partially mediated the relationship between past interpersonal trauma and depression severity at day 14 among psychiatric inpatients. Limitations: Measure of trauma exposure did not systematically differentiate the age of exposure or relationship to the perpetrator. Individuals scoring high on the self-report attachment measure may be prone to over-report interpersonal traumas. Conclusions: Treatment of depression in traumatized patients should include an assessment of attachment insecurity and may be fruitful target for intervention.

Economic evaluation of audio based resilience training for depression in primary care,"Background: Although there is some evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated. Methods: The cost-effectiveness of an audio based resilience training (Positive Mental Training, PosMT) was examined using a decision model. Patient level cost and effectiveness data from a trial comparing a CCBT treatment and usual care and effectiveness data from a study on PosMT were used to inform this. Results: Net benefits of CCBT and PosMT were approximately equal in individuals with ‘moderate’ depression at baseline and markedly in favour of PosMT for the ‘severe’ depression subgroup. With only four observations in the ‘mild’ depression category for PosMT, the existing evidence base remains unaltered. Limitations: Efficacy data for the PosMT arm was derived from a study using a partially randomised preference design and the model structure contains simplifications due to lack of data availability. Conclusion: PosMT may represent good value for money in treatment of depression for certain groups of patients. More research in this area may be warranted.

"Affective temperament, history of suicide attempt and family history of suicide in general practice patients","Background: Untreated major affective disorders are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour; however, clinical, psychological and psycho-social risk factors also play a contributory role. Personal history and family history of suicide are also important predictors of suicidal behaviours, and are also a powerful marker of current major depressive episode in general practice patients. Affective temperaments, which can be considered the subaffective manifestations of major mood disorders also show a specific pattern of association with suicidal behaviour. In the present study our aim was to investigate the association between affective temperaments, personal history of suicide attempts and family history of completed suicide in primary practice patients. Methods: Five hundred and nine patients from 6 primary care practices completed the TEMPS-A, and were assessed concerning self-reported history of personal or family suicide. Results: We found that among those answering questions concerning suicide, 9.1% reported a family history of suicide in first and second degree relatives and 4.8% had at least one prior suicide attempt. Among those giving a positive answer to both questions, those who had a positive family history had significantly more frequent suicide attempts (15.4% vs. 4.0%). Patients with prior suicide attempts had a significantly higher score on the cyclothymic and depressive, and those with positive family history of suicide had on cyclothymic and anxious subscales. Limitations: In the present study, personal and family history of suicide was assessed retrospectively and in a self-report way. The cross-sectional nature of this study and the facts that no current psychiatric morbidity has been investigated and only the documented history of depressive and anxiety disorders have been detected limit the generalisability of this study. Discussion: We found a significant relationship between depressive and cyclothymic affective temperament and personal history of suicide attempts, and between cyclothymic and anxious temperament and family history of completed suicide in first and second degree relatives. This is in line with previous findings showing a strong relationship between these affective temperaments and major mood episodes and that these temperaments are overrepresented among suicide attempters. Our findings also suggest that the presence of cyclothymic (and to lesser extent depressive) affective temperament in a patient with family history of completed suicide indicates a very high risk of suicidal behaviour.

A longitudinal study of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter methylation and genotype with poststroke depression,"Introduction: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to play an important role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders including poststroke depression (PSD). BDNF secretion is influenced by epigenetic and genetic profiles. This study aimed to investigate whether BDNF gene promoter methylation status and val66met polymorphism were associated with depression ascertained at two weeks and one year after stroke. Methods: A total of 286 patients were evaluated two weeks after stroke, and 222 (78%) were followed one year later. Depression (major or minor depressive disorder) was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, and classified into prevalent, persistent, and incident PSD according to presence at the two examinations. Depression severity was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The effects of BDNF methylation status and genotype on PSD status were investigated using multivariate logistic regression models. The associations of BDNF methylation status and genotype with score on depression assessment scales were estimated using partial correlation tests and general linear models, respectively. Results: Higher BDNF methylation status was independently associated with prevalent, persistent and particularly with incident PSD, and with worsening depressive symptoms over follow-up but not with baseline severity. The BDNF val66met polymorphism was independently associated with prevalent PSD, but not with persistent and incident PSD nor with depressive symptoms severity. No significant methylation-genotype interactions were found. Limitations: Methylation status was investigated with limited area of the BDNF gene and sample size was relatively small. Conclusions: A role for BDNF in PSD was supported, and associations with BDNF gene methylation status may represent a target for drug development.

The symptom structure of bipolar acute episodes: In search for the mixing link,"Objective: The nature of mixed mood episodes is still a matter of controversy amongst experts. Currently, the approach to this syndrome is mainly categorical and very restrictive. The factor-structure of bipolar mood episodes has not been studied yet. We performed a dimensional analysis of the structure of bipolar episodes aimed at identifying a factor deconstructing mixed episodes; furthermore, we analyzed correlations of factors emerging from the factorial analysis of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) with Temperament Evaluation of Memphis-Pisa-Paris-San Diego (TEMPS-A) and predominant polarity. Method: 187 consecutive bipolar I inpatients hospitalized for DSM-IV-TR acute mood episodes (depressive, manic or mixed) underwent a standardized assessment, including the 24-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS 4.0), the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-21), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the TEMPS-A. Principal factor analysis was performed on BPRS-24 items. Results: This analysis revealed five factors corresponding to ""psychosis"", ""euphoric mania"", ""mixity"", ""dysphoria"" and ""inhibited depression"", capturing 71.89% of the rotated variance. The mixity factor was characterized by higher rates of suicidal ideation, more mixed episodes, higher frequencies of antidepressant (AD) use, depressive predominant polarity and anxious temperament. Discussion: The factor-structure of the BPRS in inpatients with bipolar I disorder with an acute episode of any type is pentafactorial; one factor identified is the mixity factor, which is independent from other factors and characterized by anxiety and motor hyperactivity and by the absence of motor retardation. Our results should prompt reconsideration of proposals for DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the mixed features specifier. Limitations of the study include the relative small sample, the absence of drug-naïve patients and the use of rating scales no specific for mixed states.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in Italian bipolar adult patients: A preliminary report,"Background: It has been recently suggested that bipolar disorder (BD) with comorbid ADHD represents a distinct clinical phenotype of BD. With the aim to assess the impact of ADHD symptoms, we investigated the prevalence, epidemiological and clinical features associated with such a comorbidity in a sample of adult BD patients. Methods: A total of 96 outpatients (aged 18–65 years) with BD were included. All patients were screened using the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale (ASRS) and the Diagnostic, Clinical and Therapeutic Checklist (DCTC), a semi-structured interview developed for systematic collection of familial, demographic, anamnestic and clinical informations and exploration of DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for mood, anxiety, eating, impulse control and alcohol and substance use disorders. The DCTC also includes the Clinical Global Impression Bipolar scale (CGI-BP), the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results: In our sample, 19 (19.8%) out of 96 BD patients fulfilled ASRS criteria for current and lifetime (onset before 7 years of age) ADHD symptoms (ADHD+). Compared to BD probands without ADHD symptoms (ADHD−), + patients showed higher rates of current mixed episode, and lower rates of mania. ADHD+ resulted in more severe mean scores on the CGI-BP mixed, depressive and global subscales. None of the ADHD+ patients were in remission of BD at the time of the evaluation, versus 24 (31.2%) of the ADHD group. ADHD+ patients also reported higher rate of lifetime comorbidity with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and Alcohol Abuse in comparison to ADHD− patients. In particular the different rate in substance abuse was related to cocaine and poly-drug abuse. The two groups did not report significant differences in functioning and social adjustment with the exception of familial adjustment that was more compromised in ADHD+ than in ADHD− patients. Limitations: Retrospective design and limited sample size. Conclusions: In ADHD+ patients, BD is associated with higher rate of mixed states, more severe psychopathology and more impaired familial functioning as well as higher rates of comorbid substance, alcohol and poly-drug abuse compared to BD patients without adult ADHD. Our findings suggest that ADHD symptoms in adults may influence clinical presentation, course and prognosis of BD. Further prospective research is needed to confirm our findings and to explore treatment implications for the management of BD.

Sensation seeking in major depressive patients: Relationship to sub-threshold bipolarity and cyclothymic temperament,"Background: High levels of sensation seeking (SS) have been traditionally reported for lifetime bipolar disorder (BD) and/or substance use disorder (SUD) rather than major depressive disorder (MDD). Nonetheless, a renewed clinical attention toward the burden of sub-threshold bipolarity in MDD, solicits for a better assessment of ""unipolar"" major depressive episodes (MDEs) via characterization of putative differential psychopathological patterns, including SS and predominant affective temperament. Methods: Two hundred and eighty currently depressed cases of MDD and 87 healthy controls were screened using the Zuckerman’s sensation seeking scale-Form-V, the Hypomania Check List-32-item (HCL-32), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Auto-questionnaire-110- item, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11-item, the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory modules and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis-I disorders. Cases were divided into HCL-32 + (subthreshold bipolar)/HCL-32 (""true"" unipolar depressed) depending on the HCL-32 total score. Results: Upon correlation and multivariate regression analyses, the HCL-32 + patients showed the highest levels of SS, higher prevalence of cyclothymic temperament, and higher rates of multiple lifetime axis-I co-morbidities, including SUD. Limits: Recall bias on some diagnoses, including BD, grossly matched healthy control group, lack of ad-hoc validated measures for ADHD, SUD, or axis-II disorders. Conclusions: In our sample, the occurrence of higher levels of SS in ""sub-threshold"" bipolar cases outlined a differential psychopathological profile compared to DSM-defined ""true unipolar"" cases of MDE. If confirmed by replication studies, these findings may aid clinicians in delivering a more accurate diagnosis and a safer use of antidepressants in some MDD cases.

Should an assessment of Axis I comorbidity be included in the initial diagnostic assessment of mood disorders? Role of QIDS-16-SR total score in predicting number of axis I comorbidity,"Background: Axis I comorbidity in mood disorders was common in epidemiological studies. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence, pattern, and number of Axis I comorbidities and the role of the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology—16 items-Self-Report (QIDS-16-SR) in predicting the number of comorbidities in major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BPD). Methods: Baseline data from the first 300 routine clinical outpatients diagnosed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Systematic-Treatment-Enhancement—Program for BPD version 5.0.0 were used. Baseline severity was measured with QIDS-16-SR and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S). Results: Of 113 patients with MDD and 166 with BPD, the prevalence of any current anxiety disorder (AD), substance use disorder (SUD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was 76% versus 74%, 14% versus 29%, and 8% versus 21%, respectively. The most common patterns of current comorbidity were MDD + AD (58.4%) for MDD, and BPD + AD (39.8%) and BPD + AD + SUD (11.4%) for BPD. More than 80% patients with MDD or BPD had ≥ 1 current comorbid disorder. About 20% patients with BPD and 10% with MDD had ≥ 4 other disorders. The number of comorbidities was positively associated with baseline severity and suicidal ideation in both MDD and BPD. A QIDS-16-SR of 10 had a positive predictive value of ≥ 90% in predicting ≥ 1 comorbidity in MDD and BPD. Limitations: The sample was modest and from a tertiary medical center. Conclusion: A thorough diagnostic assessment for Axis I comorbidity should be included in all patients with mood disorders, especially when a QIDS-16-SR of ≥ 10 points.

The reliability and validity of the Everyday Feelings Questionnaire in a clinical population,"Background: Depression could be considered to be on a continuum with well-being and some have argued that it is important to measure well-being as well as distress. The Everyday Feelings Questionnaire was designed to measure both these aspects. Its validity has been assessed in a nonclinical population. This project aims to assess the validity and reliability of the EFQ in a clinical population. Methods: The EFQ was completed by 105 clients within a mental health clinical setting. The following aspects of the EFQ were explored: its internal structure, concurrent validity, re-test reliability and internal consistency. Results: The EFQ had good internal consistency and correlated highly with other measures of anxiety and depression. The correlation between total EFQ scores on the two occasions was reasonable and there was no effect of time during completion. A Bland–Altman plot showed no obvious pattern between the difference between EFQ scores and the mean score. A one factor model showed a moderate fit to the data. Limitations: This study does not explore the acceptability or sensitivity to change of the EFQ, and a larger sample size would be needed to extend the analysis conducted. Conclusions: The EFQ is a valid and reliable measure when used in this clinical population.

Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder/fear of harm phenotype,"Objectives: Intravenous ketamine, a glutamate N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert a rapid antidepressant effect in adults with treatment resistant depression. Children with bipolar disorder (BD) often respond poorly to pharmacotherapy, including polypharmacy. A pediatric-onset Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype has been described, and is characterized by severe clinical features and resistance to accepted treatments for BD. The potential efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine in children with BD with FOH-phenotype were assessed by a systematic retrospective chart review of a case series from the private practice of one of the authors, including cases with clear refractoriness to mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Methods: A comparison was made between routinely collected symptom measures 1–2 weeks prior to and after the administration of ketamine, in 12 treatment-refractory youth, 10 males 2 females ages 6–19 years. Results: Ketamine administration was associated with a substantial reduction in measures of mania, fear of harm and aggression. Significant improvement was observed in mood, anxiety and behavioral symptoms, attention/executive functions, insomnia, parasomnias and sleep inertia. Treatment was generally well-tolerated. Conclusions: Intranasal ketamine administration in treatment-resistant youth with BD-FOH produced marked improvement in all symptomatic dimensions. A rapid, substantial therapeutic response, with only minimal side effects was observed. Formal clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy are warranted.

Brief alcohol counseling improves mental health functioning in veterans with alcohol misuse: Results from a randomized trial,"Background: Alcohol misuse occurs at high rates among U.S. Military Veterans presenting to primary care and is linked to numerous negative social and health consequences. The Veterans Health Administration has recently implemented brief alcohol interventions (BAI) in VA primary care settings. An emerging literature suggests that BAIs that target alcohol consumption may also have secondary health benefits such as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in civilian samples. The present study sought to examine whether secondary health benefits of BAIs observed in civilians generalize to a sample of alcohol misusing Veterans presenting to primary care. Methods: Veterans ( N = 167) screening positive for alcohol misuse during a routine primary care visit were randomized to receive treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU plus a web-delivered BAI. Assessment of overall mental health functioning, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression occurred at baseline, three- and six-month post-treatment. Results: Veterans receiving both BAI protocols demonstrated significant improvements in mental health functioning, depressive symptoms, and use of approach coping from baseline to six-month follow-up. No differential treatment effects on these outcomes were observed. Limitations: Findings are limited by the lack of a no-treatment control group, and the potential impact of regression to the mean and assessment effects on outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings replicate prior studies suggesting that a single-dose BAI may have some secondary mental health benefits for Veterans presenting to primary care with alcohol misuse.

Bipolar depression: Prototypically melancholic in its clinical features,"Background: Numerous studies have considered whether bipolar depression is phenomenologically similar or different to unipolar depression. While there have been some relatively consistent individual features identified, no clear clinical phenotype has been defined for bipolar depression. Methods: A self-report and clinician-rated measure of the Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (‘SMPI’) was used to assess prototypic features of melancholic and non-melancholic depression in a sample of 901 patients clinically diagnosed with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression. The majority also completed a self-report (SDS) severity of depression measure, and provided current and historical data on depression, anxiety, global functioning and stressor severity. Results: Comparative analyses favoured the SMPI-CR above the SMPI-SR measure in terms of discriminatory strengths. The previously determined SMPI-CR difference score cut-off of 4 or more for differentiating melancholic from non-melancholic depression was replicated in this larger sample. SMPI item and prototypic pattern analyses indicated that bipolar depression corresponded closely to unipolar melancholic depression in terms of clinical pattern features but not in regard to a number of socio-demographic, illness course and correlate variables. ‘Atypical features’ were common across bipolar and unipolar disorders, but somewhat more prevalent in bipolar disorder. Limitations: There was no distinction made for the bipolar group between subtypes I and II, with the study simply comparing bipolar with unipolar disorders. The apparent superiority of the clinician-rated in comparison to the SMPI-SR measure may reflect a clinician judgement bias. Conclusions: The SMPI-CR measure indicated that bipolar depression corresponds closely to melancholic depression in terms of its clinical phenotype.

Recurrence of major depressive disorder across different treatment settings: Results from the NESDA study,"Objective: Examine time to recurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) across different treatment settings and assess predictors of time to recurrence of MDD. Methods: Data were from 375 subjects with a MDD diagnosis from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The study sample was restricted to subjects with a remission of at least three months. These subjects were followed until recurrence or the end of the two year follow-up. DSM-IV based diagnostic interviews and Life Chart Interviews were used to assess time to recurrence of MDD across treatment settings. Predictors of time to recurrence were determined using Cox’s proportional hazards analyses. Results: Although trends indicated a slightly higher rate of and shorter time to recurrence in specialized mental health care, no significant difference in recurrence rate (26.8% versus 33.5%, p = 0.23) or in time to recurrence (controlled for covariates) of MDD was found between respondents in specialized mental health care and respondents treated in primary care (average 6.6 versus 5.5 months, p = 0.09). In multivariable analyses, a family history of MDD and previous major depressive episodes were associated with a shorter time to recurrence. Predictors did not differ across treatment settings. Limitations: The study sample may not be representative of the entire population treated for MDD in specialized mental health care. Conclusions: Health care professionals in both settings should be aware of the same risk factors since the recurrence risk and its predictors appeared to be similar across settings.

The effects of the catechol-O-methyltransferase val158met polymorphism on white matter connectivity in patients with panic disorder,"Background: The catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene val158met polymorphism (rs4680) has been found to be associated with various psychiatric phenotypes including panic disorder. Considering the probable genetic influence of COMT on the pathogenesis of panic disorder and white matter connectivity, the present study investigated white matter connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging in relation to the COMT genotype in panic disorder. Methods: Twenty-six patients with panic disorder and twenty-six age- and gender-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Brain magnetic resonance scans and genotype analysis for COMT rs4680 were conducted. Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire, and Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised were assessed. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used for image analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in white matter analysis between panic disorder and healthy controls. However, TBSS analysis showed increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in posterior thalamic radiation, posterior and superior corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and sagittal stratum, all located in the right hemisphere in COMT AA/AG genotype group compared to GG genotype in panic disorder. Voxelwise correlational analysis revealed the symptom severity scores are correlated with the FA in white matter tracts that previously showed significant group differences between AA/AG and GG genotypes in COMT AA/AG genotype group, while no significant correlation was found in GG genotype group. Limitations: The sample size in each group was small, hence, further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm our findings. Conclusions: These data suggested that COMT rs4680 could affect the white matter connectivity in panic disorder.

Depression and insomnia among adolescents: A prospective perspective,"Background: No studies of adolescents have examined the prospective, reciprocal association between insomnia and major depression. Methods: A two-wave, community-based cohort of 3134 youths aged 11–17 at baseline. Major depression was assessed using DSM-IV criteria. Three measures of insomnia were used also following DSM-IV: P ₁, any symptom of insomnia; P ₂, any symptom plus impairment; P ₃, P ₂ with no comorbid mood, anxiety or substance use disorders. Results: In general, the association between insomnia and depression was stronger and more consistent for major depression than for symptoms of depression. Baseline insomnia ( P ₁ and P ₂) increased subsequent risk of major depression 2–3-fold and P ₁ 2-fold in multivariate analyses. Major depression increased risk for subsequent insomnia 2–3-fold for P ₁ and P ₂ 2-fold for P ₂ in multivariate analyses. Results varied by measure of insomnia used. Limitations: Only symptoms of insomnia were assessed, so we could not examine the effects of comorbid sleep disorders nor did we have objective or biological measures of disturbed sleep. We also did not collect data on parental reports of youth depression nor insomnia or sleep problems. Conclusion: Our results provide the first prospective data on insomnia and major depression among adolescents indicating the two are reciprocally related. More studies are needed examining trajectories of insomnia and major depression in childhood and adolescence.

Risk factors for suicide in individuals with depression: A systematic review,"Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in people who die by suicide. Awareness of risk factors for suicide in depression is important for clinicians. Methods: In a systematic review of the international literature we identified cohort and case-control studies of people with depression in which suicide was an outcome, and conducted meta-analyses of potential risk factors. Results: Nineteen studies (28 publications) were included. Factors significantly associated with suicide were: male gender (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.08–2.86), family history of psychiatric disorder (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.00–1.97), previous attempted suicide (OR = 4.84, 95% CI = 3.26–7.20), more severe depression (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.05–4.60), hopelessness (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.49–3.23) and comorbid disorders, including anxiety (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.03–2.45) and misuse of alcohol and drugs (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.77–2.66). Limitations: There were fewer studies than suspected. Interdependence between risk factors could not be examined. Conclusions: The factors identified should be included in clinical assessment of risk in depressed patients. Further large-scale studies are required to identify other relevant factors.

Adherence to the MoodGYM program: Outcomes and predictors for an adolescent school-based population,"Background: Program adherence has been associated with improved intervention outcomes for mental and physical conditions. The aim of the current study is to investigate adolescent adherence to an Internet-based depression prevention program in schools to identify the effect of adherence on outcomes and to ascertain the predictors of program adherence. Methods: Data for the current study ( N = 1477) was drawn from the YouthMood Project, which was conducted to test the effectiveness of the MoodGYM program in reducing and preventing symptoms of anxiety and depression in an adolescent school-based population. The current study compares intervention effects across three sub-groups: high adherers, low adherers and the wait-list control condition. Results: When compared to the control condition, participants in the high adherence intervention group reported stronger intervention effects at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up than participants in the low adherence group for anxiety ( d = 0.34–0.39 vs. 0.11–0.22), and male ( d = 0.43–0.59 vs. 0.26–0.35) and female depression ( d = 0.13–0.20 vs. 0.02–0.04). No significant intervention effects were identified between the high and low adherence groups. Being in Year 9, living in a rural location and having higher pre-intervention levels of depressive symptoms or self-esteem were predictive of greater adherence to the MoodGYM program. Limitations: The program trialled is Internet-based and therefore the predictors of adherence identified may not generalise to face-to-face interventions. Conclusions: The current study provides preliminary support for the positive relationship between program adherence and outcomes in a school environment. The identification of significant predictors of adherence will assist in identifying the type of user who will engage most with an online depression prevention program.

Comparative validity of depression assessment scales for screening poststroke depression,"Introduction: This study aimed to compare screening properties of four assessment scales for poststroke depression (PSD) at 2 weeks and 1 year after index stroke, and investigated factors contributing to misclassification. Methods: A total of 423 patients were evaluated 2 weeks after stroke and 288 (68%) were followed 1 year later, and were diagnosed as having major and minor PSD applying DSM-IV criteria gold standards. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered. The balance of sensitivity and specificity was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results: Discriminating abilities of all the scales for major and all PSD were good (area under ROC values 0.88–0.93 and 0.88–0.92 at 2 weeks; and 0.93–0.96 and 0.89–0.91 at 1 year, respectively). Misclassification was influenced by demographic characteristics and stroke severity particularly for the BDI and HAMD, was more marked for all PSD than for major PSD, and was more prominent at 2 weeks than at 1 year after stroke. Limitations: Patients with only mild to moderate stroke severity were included. Conclusions: Although there were no marked differences in the screening abilities for PSD between the scales, differences were found in factors influencing misclassification. Assessment scales with less somatic items may be recommended for the screening of PSD, particularly at the acute phase of stroke.

"Complex trauma and intimate relationships: The impact of shame, guilt and dissociation","Background: This study examined dissociation, shame, guilt and intimate relationship difficulties in those with chronic and complex PTSD. Little is known about how these symptom clusters interplay within the complex PTSD constellation. Dissociation was examined as a principle organizing construct within complex PTSD. In addition, the impact of shame, guilt and dissociation on relationship difficulties was explored. Methods: Sixty five treatment-receiving adults attending a Northern Irish service for conflict-related trauma were assessed on measures of dissociation, state and trait shame, behavioral responses to shame, state and trait guilt, complex PTSD symptom severity and relationship difficulties. Results: Ninety five percent ( n = 62) of participants scored above cut-off for complex PTSD. Those with clinical levels of dissociation ( n = 27) were significantly higher on complex PTSD symptom severity, state and trait shame, state guilt, withdrawal in response to shame and relationship preoccupation than subclinical dissociators ( n = 38). Dissociation and state and trait shame predicted complex PTSD. Fear of relationships was predicted by dissociation, complex PTSD and avoidance in response to shame, while complex PTSD predicted relationship anxiety and relationship depression. Limitations: The study was limited to a relatively homogeneous sample of individuals with chronic and complex PTSD drawn from a single service. Conclusions: Complex PTSD has significant consequences for intimate relationships, and dissociation makes an independent contribution to these difficulties. Dissociation also has an organizing effect on complex PTSD symptoms.

Serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-sulfate (S) levels in medicated patients with major depressive disorder compared with controls,"Background: There is accumulating evidence regarding gender differences in clinical symptoms or response to antidepressants in patients with depression. However, less attention has been given to sex differences in the underlying biological mechanisms of depression. The adrenal androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate derivative (DHEA-S), play a critical role in controlling affect, mood, and anxiety. Changes in serum adrenal androgen levels have been reported in conditions pertaining to stress as well as in psychiatric disorders. The objective of the present study was to investigate differences in serum levels of adrenal androgens in male and female patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Participants included 90 inpatients with MDD at the psychiatric ward of Juntendo University Koshigaya Hospital who were receiving antidepressants. Serum levels of DHEA and DHEA-S were assessed at the time of admission. Matched controls (based on sex and age) included 128 healthy individuals. First, data from male and female MDD patients and controls were compared. Second, correlations between serum hormone levels and scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) of patients with MDD were assessed by gender. In addition, effects of various factors on adrenal androgens were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results: Serum DHEA levels were significantly increased in both male and female MDD patients compared with controls. Serum levels of DHEA-S in male patients were significantly decreased compared with male controls, whereas no significant differences were seen in female patients and controls. No significant correlations among adrenal androgens were observed in male patients with MDD, whereas significant positive correlations were found in both male and female controls. No significant correlations were seen between adrenal androgens and HAM-D scores in male or female patients. Multiple regression analysis showed that both hormones were affected by the age at onset of depression. Limitations: All subjects in the present study were on antidepressant medications. Conclusions: Elevated levels of serum DHEA may be associated with the biological pathophysiology of depression, as DHEA administration has been found to be effective for the treatment of depression. Findings of differential changes in DHEA-S levels in men compared with women may suggest distinct characteristics of these hormones between men and women with depression. However, DHEA/DHEA-S may be a poor indicator for evaluating severity of depression.

Baseline respiratory parameters in panic disorder: A meta-analysis,"Background: The presence of abnormalities in baseline respiratory function of subjects with panic disorder (PD) is expected according to PD respiratory theories. We aimed to meta-analyze results from studies comparing baseline respiratory and hematic parameters related to respiration between subjects with PD and controls. Methods: A literature research in bibliographic databases was performed. Fixed-effects models were applied for all parameters while random-effects models only when suitable (at least 10 independent studies). Several moderator analyses and publication bias diagnostics were performed. Results: We found significantly higher mean minute ventilation and lower et-pCO₂ in subjects with PD than controls. Moreover we also found evidences of reduced HCO₃ − and PO₄ − hematic concentrations, higher indexes of respiratory variability/irregularity and higher rate of sighs and apneas. Evidence of heterogeneity was partly explained by moderator analyses. No relevant publication bias was found. Limitations: Several shortcomings affected the included studies, such as over-inclusive recruitment criteria, samples unbalanced for socio-demographic characteristics, lack of statistical details and small number of studies available for several parameters. Discussion: Our results support the idea of abnormalities in respiratory function of subjects with PD. Compared to controls, they showed baseline hyperventilation; the results from hematic parameters suggest that hyperventilation may be chronic and not simply caused by their high anxiety levels during respiratory assessment. Evidences of higher variability and irregularity in respiratory patterns of subjects with PD were also found. It is unclear to what extent the higher rate of sighs and apneas may explain the other baseline respiratory abnormalities found in PD.

Moreover, the effect of specific subtypes of trauma on alexithymia and somatization was also investigated. Methods: The present study was conducted on 100 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 50 age and gender matched healthy controls (HC). Data were collected on each of the participants, including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), a 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), and a somatization subscale of the Symptom Check List-Revised Form (SCL-90 R). Patient groups were divided into two categories according to the TAS-20 cut-off score. Reliability and validity were assessed, and factor analyses were conducted on the CTQ-28. Next, the relationships among CT subtypes, alexithymia, and somatization were investigated using Pearson’s and partial correlation analysis. Additionally, the types of CT that predict alexithymia and somatization were also investigated. Results: Significantly higher scores on the clinical variables were noted in the patient group compared with the control group, except for physical neglect on the CTQ. The partial correlation of the CT types with somatization and alexithymia showed that the HARS, HDRS, somatization subscale of the SCL-90 R (for alexithymia), and the TAS-total (for somatization) were covariates. None of the CT types was correlated with somatization, whereas physical abuse and emotional neglect were correlated with alexithymia. Moreover, emotional abuse and emotional neglect predicted scores on the TAS and on the somatization subscale of the SCL-90 R. Conclusions CT is associated with alexithymia and ongoing somatic complaints. Alexithymia contributes to the emergence of somatic symptoms in MDD, particularly following CT. Somatization also contributes to alexithymia. Interestingly, the present study found that the relationship of emotional neglect and physical abuse with alexithymia was independent from somatization. Taken together, these results indicate that emotional abuse and neglect predict the later emergence of alexithymia and somatization (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2013
TEMPS-A and long-term lithium response: Positive correlation with hyperthymic temperament,"Background: Lithium is still regarded as a cornerstone for the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. The best response to lithium is associated with clinical features of episodic clinical course, complete remission, bipolar family history and low psychiatric comorbidity. However, a specific personality profile for the best lithium response was not estimated so far. Such a possibility occurred with an advent of temperament scale for bipolar disorder and of an ability to quantitatively assess lithium prophylactic response. Methods: The study was performed on 71 patients with bipolar mood disorder (21 males, 50 females), aged 31–82 (59 ±12) years, which have been treated with lithium carbonate for at least 5 years (5–37 years, mean 15 years). In all patients, the assessment of five temperaments of TEMPS-A scale (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable and anxious) was done, and correlated with the quality of lithium prophylaxis according to Alda scale. Results: The mean scores for five temperaments of TEMPS-A were not significantly different in male and female patients. The response to lithium correlated significantly positively with hyperthymic temperament score ( r = 0.31, p=0.009), and negatively with anxiety (r = −0.27, p =0.022), cyclothymic ( r = −0.26, p = 0.032), and depressive ( r = −0.23, p = 0.052) temperaments scores. Limitations: Relatively small number of patients. Conclusions: The main finding of the study is an association of lithium response with hyperthymic temperament. This positive correlation as well as other negative correlations between lithium response and TEMPS-A temperaments are discussed in view of clinical and genetic findings in bipolar patients.

Intolerance of uncertainty as a vulnerability factor for hoarding behaviors,"Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been identified as a key vulnerability factor among numerous anxiety related conditions. It has been suggested that individuals engage in uncertainty-motivated behaviors such as avoidance, as a way to cope with ambiguous and potentially distressing situations. Patterns of behavioral avoidance have also been observed in a substantial number of hoarding patients and are thought to directly contribute to the avoidance of discarding. However, no studies to date have examined the potential relationship between IU and hoarding. The primary aim of the current investigation was to examine the association between IU and hoarding behaviors. Method: Participants consisted of 279 college students from a large southern university. Results: Results revealed that IU was a significant predictor of hoarding severity after controlling for relevant covariates. Moreover, when looking at the relationships among IU subfactors and hoarding, results indicated that Factor 1 was significantly associated with hoarding severity whereas Factor 2 was not. Limitations: Future research should attempt to replicate the findings within clinical populations. Additionally, due to the cross sectional nature of the study, future work should utilize a longitudinal design. Conclusions: The current study provides additional evidence that IU is an important individual difference variable associated with various anxiety related conditions. Moreover, our findings revealed that IU is a unique and robust predictor of hoarding behaviors. Increasing our knowledge of vulnerability factors in compulsive hoarding has important implications for the classification of this disorder within DSM-V. Additionally, this information could inform future research and treatment programs.

Does executive functioning (EF) predict depression in clinic-referred adults?: EF tests vs. rating scales,"Background: Deficits in executive functioning (EF) are implicated in neurobiological and cognitive-processing theories of depression. EF deficits are also associated with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, who are also at increased risk for depressive disorders. Given debate about the ecological validity of laboratory measures of EF, we investigated the relationship between depression diagnoses and symptoms and EF as measured by both rating scales and tests in a sample of adults referred for evaluation of adult ADHD. Method: Data from two groups of adults recruited from an ADHD specialty clinic were analyzed together: Adults diagnosed with ADHD ( N =146) and a clinical control group of adults referred for adult ADHD assessment but not diagnosed with the disorder ADHD ( N =97). EF was assessed using a rating scale of EF deficits in daily life and a battery of tests tapping various EF constructs. Depression was assessed using current and lifetime SCID diagnoses (major depression, dysthymia) and self-report symptom ratings. Results: EF as assessed via rating scale predicted depression across measures even when controlling for current anxiety and impairment. Self-Management to Time and Self-Organization and Problem-Solving showed the most robust relationships. EF tests were weakly and inconsistently related to depression measures. Limitations: Prospective studies are needed to rigorously evaluate EF problems as true risk factors for depressive onset. Conclusions: EF problems in everyday life were important predictors of depression. Researchers and clinicians should consistently assess for the ADHD-depression comorbidity. Clinicians should consider incorporating strategies to address EF deficits when treating people with depression.

Distinguishing young people with emerging bipolar disorders from those with unipolar depression,"Background: To facilitate early intervention, there is a need to distinguish unipolar versus bipolar illness trajectories in adolescents and young adults with adult-type mood disorders. Methods: Detailed clinical and neuropsychological evaluation of 308 young persons (aged 12 to 30 years) with moderately severe unipolar and bipolar affective disorders. Results: Almost 30% (90/308) of young people (mean age = 19.4 ± 4.4 yr) presenting for care with affective disorders met criteria for a bipolar-type syndrome (26% with bipolar I). Subjects with bipolar-and unipolar-type syndromes were of similar age (19.8 vs. 19.2 yr) and reported comparable ages of onset (14.5 vs. 14.3 yr). Clinically, those subjects with unipolar and bipolar-type disorders reported similar levels of psychological distress, depressive symptoms, current role impairment, neuropsychological dysfunction and alcohol or other substance misuse. Subjects with unipolar disorders reported more social anxiety ( p &lt; 0.01). Subjects with bipolar disorders were more likely to report a family history of bipolar (21% vs. 11%; [χ² = 4.0, p &lt; .05]) or psychotic (19% vs. 9%; [χ² = 5.5, p &lt; .05]), or substance misuse (35% vs. 23%; [χ² = 3.9, p &lt; .05]), but not depressive (48% vs. 53%; χ² = 0.3, p = .582]) disorders. Conclusions: Young subjects with bipolar disorders were best discriminated by a family history of bipolar, psychotic or substance use disorders. Early in the course of illness, clinical features of depression, or neuropsychological function, do not readily differentiate the two illness trajectories.

Discriminating melancholic and non-melancholic depression by prototypic clinical features,"Background: Melancholia is positioned as either a more severe expression of clinical depression or as a separate entity. Support for the latter view emerges from differential causal factors and treatment responsiveness but has not been convincingly demonstrated in terms of differential clinical features. We pursue its prototypic clinical pattern to determine if this advances its delineation. Methods: We developed a 24-item measure (now termed the Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index or SMPI) comprising 12 melancholic and 12 non-melancholic prototypic features (both symptoms and illness correlates). In this evaluative study, 278 patients referred for tertiary level assessment at a specialized mood disorders clinic completed the self-report SMPI as well as a depression severity measure and a comprehensive assessment schedule before clinical interview, while assessing clinicians completed a clinician version of the SMPI items following their interview. The independent variable (diagnostic gold standard) was the clinician’s judgment of a melancholic versus non-melancholic depressive episode. Discriminative performance was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis of four strategies for operationalising the SMPI self-report and SMPI clinician measures, and with the former strategies compared to ROC analysis of the depression severity measure. The external validity of the optimally discriminating scores on each measure was tested against a range of clinical variables. Result: Comparison of the two self-report measures established that the SMPI provided greater discrimination than the depression severity measure, while comparison of the self-report and clinician-rated SMPI measures established the latter as more discriminating of clinically diagnosed melancholic or non-melancholic depression. ROC analyses favoured self-report SMPI distinction of melancholic from non-melancholic depression being most optimally calculated by a ‘difference’ score of at least four or more melancholic than non-melancholic items being affirmed (sensitivity of 0.69, specificity of 0.77). For the clinician-rated SMPI measure, ROC analyses confirmed the same optimal difference score of four or more as highly discriminating of melancholic and non-melancholic depression (sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.92). As the difference score had positive predictive values of 0.90 and 0.70 (for the respective clinician-rated and self-report SMPI forms) and respective negative predictive values of 0.88 and 0.70, we conclude that the clinician-rated version had superior discrimination than the self-report version. External validating data quantified the self-rated and clinician-rated Index-assigned non-melancholic patients having a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, a higher number of current and lifetime stressors, as well as elevated scores on several personality styles that are viewed as predisposing to and shaping such non-melancholic disorders. Limitations: Assigned melancholic and non-melancholic diagnoses were determined by clinician judgement, risking a circularity bias across diagnostic assignment and clinical weighting of melancholic and non-melancholic features. The robustness of the Index requires testing in primary and secondary levels of care settings. Conclusions: The clinician-rated SMPI differentiated melancholic and non-melancholic depressed subjects at a higher level of confidence than the self-report SMPI, and with a highly acceptable level of discrimination. The measure is recommended for further testing of its intrinsic and applied properties.

Prolonged grief disorder three decades post loss in survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia,"Background: During the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime from 1975 to 1979 millions of Cambodians were confronted with the death or murder of family members. The long-term psychological consequences of these traumatic losses have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and potential predictors of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in survivors of the KR regime. Method: The Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised (ICG-R) was administered in a sample of N = 775 Cambodians in face-to-face interviews who had lost at least one family member during the KR regime. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed with the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and symptoms of depression and anxiety with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25. Results: The prevalence of PGD in the sample was 14.3%. PGD was moderately associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The loss of a spouse, a child, or a parent was associated with higher symptom severity of PGD than was the loss of a sibling or distant relatives. PGD was predicted by the relationship to the deceased and symptoms of depression and PTSD. Limitations: Limitations of the study include the non-random sampling recruitment. The ICG-R has not been validated for use in Cambodia. Conclusions: The vast majority of Cambodians lost family members during the KR regime. Even three decades later, PGD was prevalent in a substantial proportion of the present sample and related to other psychiatric disorders. The results underline the importance of examining PGD in studies of war-related psychological impairment.

Randomized sham controlled trial of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for the treatment of panic disorder with comorbid major depression,"Background: In an open-label trial low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) significantly improved symptoms of panic disorder and major depression. Here we present data of a randomized double-blind study. Methods: Twenty-five patients were assigned 4 weeks of active or sham rTMS to the right DLPFC. rTMS parameters consisted of 1800 stimuli/day, 1-Hz, at 110% of resting motor threshold. Response was defined as a ≥40% decrease on the panic disorder severity scale and a ≥50% decrease on the Hamilton depression rating scale. At the end of the randomized phase, patients were offered the option of receiving open-label rTMS for an additional 4 weeks. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significantly better improvement in panic symptoms with active compared with sham rTMS, but no significant difference in depression. At 4 weeks, response rate for panic disorder was 50% with active rTMS and 8% with sham. After 8 weeks of active rTMS, response rate was 67% for panic and 50% for depressive symptoms. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed significant improvements in panic disorder, major depression, clinical global impression, and social adjustment. Clinical improvement was sustained at 6-month follow-up. Limitations: Limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. Conclusions: Although 4 weeks of rTMS was sufficient to produce a significant effect in panic symptoms, a longer course of treatment resulted in better outcomes for both panic disorder and major depression. These data suggest that inhibitory rTMS to the right DLPFC affects symptoms expression in comorbid anxiety and depression.

Is comorbid borderline personality disorder in patients with major depressive episode and bipolarity a developmental subtype? Findings from the international BRIDGE study,"Background: The nature of the relationship between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) is controversial. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical profile of patients with BD and comorbid BPD in a world-wide sample selected during a major depressive episode (MDE). Methods: From a general sample of 5635 in and out-patients with an MDE, who were enrolled in the multicenter, multinational, transcultural BRIDGE study, we identified 2658 subjects who met bipolarity specifier criteria. Bipolar specifier patients with (BPD+) and without (BPD−) comorbid BPD were compared on diagnostic, socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics. Results: 386 patients (14.5%) met criteria for BPD. A diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV criteria was significantly more frequent in the BPD− than in BPD+, while similar rates in the two groups occurred using DSM-IV-Modified criteria. A subset of the BD criteria with an atypical connotation, such as irritability, mood instability and reactivity to drugs were significantly associated with the presence of BPD. BPD+ patients were significantly younger than BPD− bipolar patients for age, age at onset of first psychiatric symptoms and age at first diagnosis of depression. They also reported significantly more comorbid Alcohol and Substance abuse, Anxiety disorders, Eating Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In comparison with BPD−, BPD+ patients showed significantly more psychotic symptoms, history of suicide attempts, mixed states, mood reactivity, atypical features, seasonality of mood episodes, antidepressants induced mood lability and irritability, and resistance to antidepressant treatments. Limitations: Centers were selected for their strong mood disorder clinical programs, recall bias is possible with a cross-sectional design, and participating psychiatrists received limited training. Conclusions: We confirm in a large sample of BD patients with MDE the high prevalence of patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for BPD. Further prospective researches should clarify whether the mood reactivity and instability captured by BPD DSM-IV criteria are distinguishable from the subjective mood of an instable, dysphoric, irritable manic/hypomanic/mixed state or simply represent a phenotypic variant of BD, related to developmental factors.

Response to antidepressants in major depressive disorder with melancholic features: The CRESCEND study,"Background: This study aimed to determine whether major depressive disorders with melancholic and without melancholic features differ with respect to their responses to treatment with antidepressants. Methods: From a nationwide sample of 18 hospitals in South Korea, 559 presenting patients with major depressive disorder were recruited. The DSM-IV based Structured Clinical Interview was administered for confirmatory diagnoses and depression subtypes with/without melancholic features. After baseline evaluation, they received naturalistic clinician-determined antidepressant interventions. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and re-evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. Results: At baseline, the 243 (43.5%) participants with melancholic features were more likely to have a previous history of depression, and had higher HAMA and lower SOFAS scores. After adjustment for baseline status, participants with melancholic features were more likely to achieve and to experience shorter times to CGI-s remission and associated with an enhanced global symptomatic remission with any antidepressant treatment. They were more likely to achieve and to experience shorter times to CGI-s remission and this difference was strongest in those receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants treatment. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: These findings suggest a faster and more evident global response to pharmacotherapy in melancholia compared to other depressive syndromes, particularly where SSRI agents are used.

"Interrelationship of depression, stress and inflammation in cancer patients: A preliminary study","Objective: Depression is common in cancer patients and detrimentally affects patients' quality of life. Both depression and stress are associated with raised inflammatory marker levels. This prospective study of cancer patients focuses on childhood trauma, recent life events and inflammatory marker levels as risk factors for high post-surgery depressive symptoms. Methods: Ninety cancer patients (56 head and neck, 34 colorectal) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, pre-surgery and six, 12 and 24 weeks post-surgery. Recent life events and childhood trauma were assessed at six and 12 weeks respectively. Blood samples were taken pre- and one and six weeks post-surgery to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Results: Childhood trauma and recent life events were risk factors for higher depressive symptom levels. In colorectal cancer patients, baseline CRP levels were associated with depressive symptom levels at six ( p = 0.008) and 12 weeks ( p = 0.038). Baseline and six week Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) levels were significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms at later time points after adjusting for cancer-related variables. Childhood trauma was positively associated with TNFα and CRP levels in colorectal cancer patients. The associations between inflammatory markers and depressive symptoms were not significant after adjusting for childhood trauma. Limitations: Small sample size. Conclusions: Raised inflammatory mediator levels may be risk factors for depressive symptoms in colorectal cancer patients and thus worth considering as a potential therapeutic target. These pilot data support recent findings demonstrating long-term effects of childhood adversity on adult health.

Determinants of receiving mental health care for depression in older adults,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common among elderly people. However, it appears that only a minority receives treatment. This study aims to identify and analyse the factors that determine whether elderly people with depressive disorders have contact with health care professionals for mental problems. Method: Cross-sectional analysis of cohort data collected in the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older persons (NESDO) and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) among 167 respondents aged ≥55 with a depressive disorder as indicated by the CIDI. Contacts for mental health problems during the past six months (TiC-P), and indicators of predisposing, enabling, and objective need factors were assessed by interview. Results: Of the total sample, 70% had contact for mental health problems, almost entirely within primary care (62%). The odds of having contact increased with advancing age; for respondents born in the Netherlands; for those who felt less lonely; and for those with a higher household income. Limitations: Our study is based on base-line interviews and thus has a cross-sectional character. Therefore, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Furthermore, we studied the respondents’ perception whether mental health care was received. Conclusions: The contact rate for mental health problems is high. Health care professionals should be aware that having contact is not associated with a higher objective need, but rather with increasing age, being Dutch-born, being less lonely and having a higher household income.

Assessing DSM-IV symptoms of panic attack in the general population: An item response analysis,"Background: Unexpected panic attacks may represent a non-specific risk factor for future depression and anxiety disorders. The examination of panic symptoms and associated latent severity levels may lead to improvements in the identification, prevention, and treatment of panic attacks and subsequent psychopathology for ‘at risk’ individuals in the general population. Methods: The current study utilised item response theory to assess the DSM-IV symptoms of panic in relation to the latent severity level of the panic attack construct in a sample of 5913 respondents from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related conditions. Additionally, differential item functioning (DIF) was assessed to determine if each symptom of panic targets the same level of latent severity between different sociodemographic groups (male/female, young/old). Results: Symptoms indexing ‘choking’, ‘fear of dying’, and ‘tingling/numbness’ are some of the more severe symptoms of panic whilst ‘heart racing’, ‘short of breath’, ‘tremble/shake’, ‘dizzy/faint’, and ‘perspire’ are some of the least severe symptoms. Significant levels of DIF were detected in the ‘perspire’ symptom between males and females and the ‘fear of dying’ symptom between young and old respondents. Limitations: The current study was limited to examining cross-sectional data from respondents who had experienced at least one panic attack across their lifetime. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide additional information regarding panic symptoms in the general population that may enable researchers and clinicians to further refine the detection of ‘at-risk’ individuals who experience threshold and sub-threshold levels of panic.

Social phobia in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Prevalence and correlates,"Background: Social Phobia (SP) is an anxiety disorder that frequently co-occurs with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); however, studies that evaluate clinical factors associated with this specific comorbidity are rare. The aim was to estimate the prevalence of SP in a large multicenter sample of OCD patients and compare the characteristics of individuals with and without SP. Method: A cross-sectional study with 1001 patients of the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders using several assessment instruments, including the Dimensional Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Univariate analyses were followed by logistic regression. Results: Lifetime prevalence of SP was 34.6% ( N = 346). The following variables remained associated with SP comorbidity after logistic regression: male sex, lower socioeconomic status, body dysmorphic disorder, specific phobia, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, Tourette syndrome and binge eating disorder. Limitations: The cross-sectional design does not permit the inference of causal relationships; some retrospective information may have been subject to recall bias; all patients were being treated in tertiary services, therefore generalization of the results to other samples of OCD sufferers should be cautious. Despite the large sample size, some hypotheses may not have been confirmed due to the small number of cases with these characteristics (type 2 error). Conclusion: SP is frequent among OCD patients and co-occurs with other disorders that have common phenomenological features. These findings have important implications for clinical practice, indicating the need for broader treatment approaches for individuals with this profile.

"Does unstable mood increase risk of suicide? Theory, research and practice","Background: Suicide represents a substantial problem, with significant societal and personal impact. The identification of factors influencing suicide risk is an important step in preventing self-harming behaviour. In this article the authors explore whether emotional instability increases risk of suicide, beyond that of mood intensity. Method: This article provides a summary of existing theory and indirect evidence in support of an association between emotional instability and suicidality. A systematic literature search (Embase, Medline, PsychInfo) was carried out on literature conducted up to October, 2011. Meta-analysis was used to assess the strength of the proposed association. Results: The systematic search identified 20 journal articles meeting the inclusion criteria, including retrospective questionnaire design studies and research conducted across several time-points. Meta-analysis revealed a moderate association, which remained statistically significant even when only including studies conducted over multiple time-points. This effect was attenuated, but remained significant, when controlling for study selection bias. Limitations: Retrospective questionnaire studies failed to adequately control for mood level. Little is still currently understood about the types of emotional instability (e.g., dysoria, anxiety) most associated with suicidality. Conclusions: Future avenues of investigation include micro- to macro-longitudinal research and the differentiation of emotion subtypes and instability metrics. Momentary assessment techniques may help to detect subtle fluctuations in mood leading to more effective and immediate intervention. Psychosocial intervention strategies for treating unstable emotions are discussed.

Prior sleep problems predict internalising problems later in life,"Background: One possible risk marker of later internalising symptoms is poor sleep, which is a problem for up to 40% of children. The present study investigated whether prior sleep problems could predict internalising symptoms over a period of 18 years of follow-up. Methods: The study sample included 1503 French young adults from the TEMPO cohort (mean age = 28.8 ± 3.6 years) whose parents participate in the GAZEL cohort study. All TEMPO participants previously took part in a study of children’s mental health and behaviour in 1991 (mean age = 10.3 ± 3.6 years) and 1999 (mean age = 18.8 ± 3.6 years). Sleep problems and internalising symptoms (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints) were assessed three times (1991, 1999, 2009) using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) questionnaire. The association between sleep problems in 1991 and trajectories of internalising problems from 1991 to 2009 was tested in a multinomial logistic regression framework, controlling for sex, age, baseline temperament, behavioural problems and stressful life events, as well as family income, and parental history of depression. Results: We identified four trajectories of internalising symptoms: high-persistent (2.5%), high-decreasing (11.4%), low-increasing (11.6%), and low-persistent (74.5%). After controlling for covariates, compared to participants who did not have sleep problems in 1991, those who did were 4.51 times (95% CI = 1.54–13.19, P = .006) more likely to have high-persistent internalising symptoms and 3.69 times (95% CI = 2.00–6.82, P &lt; .001) more likely to have high-decreasing internalising symptoms over the 18-year follow-up. Limitations: Sleep problems and internalising symptoms were based on self-report questions, results should be interpreted with due caution. Conclusions: Sleep problems early in life are associated with an increased likelihood of internalising symptoms that persist from childhood to adulthood.

Cognitive therapy for anxious depression in STAR &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;D: What have we learned?,"Background: Anxious depression, defined as MDD with high levels of anxiety symptoms, has been associated with lower rates of antidepressant response and remission as well as greater chronicity, suicidality and antidepressant side-effect burden. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of cognitive therapy (CT) alone or in combination with medications for anxious versus non-anxious depression. Methods: We assessed the STAR * D study participants who were partial or non-responders to citalopram. Subjects were then either switched ( n = 696) to a new antidepressant or to CT alone, or they were kept on citalopram and augmented ( n = 577) with another antidepressant or CT. We compared response and remission rates, across treatment conditions, between those who met criteria for anxious depression and those who did not. Results: Those with anxious depression had significantly lower remission rates based on the QIDS, whether assigned to switch or augmentation, compared to those with non-anxious depression. Those with anxious depression, compared to those without, had significantly lower response rates based on the QIDS only in the switch group. There was no significant interaction between anxious depression and treatment assignment. Limitations: Limitations include the use of citalopram as the only Level 1 pharmacotherapy and medication augmentation option, the relatively small size of the CT arms, use of depression-focused CT rather than anxiety-focused CT, and focus on acute treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Individuals with anxious depression appear to experience higher risk of poorer outcome following pharmacotherapy and/or CT after an initial course of citalopram and continued efforts to target this challenging form of depression are needed.

Self-regulation of unattainable goals in suicide attempters: A two year prospective study,"Background: Although suicide is a global public health concern with approximately one million people dying by suicide annually, our knowledge of the proximal risk mechanisms is limited. In the present study, we investigated the utility of two proximal mechanisms (goal disengagement and goal reengagement) in the prediction of hospital-treated self-harm repetition in a sample of suicide attempters. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-seven patients hospitalised following a suicide attempt completed a range of clinical (depression, anxiety, hopelessness, suicidal ideation) and goal regulation measures (goal reengagement and disengagement) while in hospital. They were followed up two years later to determine whether they had been re-hospitalised with self-harm between baseline and the follow-up. Results: Self-harm hospitalisation in the past 10 years, suicidal ideation and difficulty reengaging in new goals independently predicted self-harm two years later. In addition, among younger people, having difficulty re-engaging in new goals further predicted self-harm re-hospitalisation when disengagement from existing unattainable goals was also low. Conversely, the deleterious impact of low reengagement in older people was elevated when goal disengagement was also high. Limitations: Only hospital-treated self-harm and suicide were recorded at follow-up, episodes of less medically serious self-harm were not recorded. Conclusions: Suicidal behaviour is usefully conceptualised in terms of goal self-regulation following the experience of unattainable goals.

Effects of adjunctive peer support on perceptions of illness control and understanding in an online psychoeducation program for bipolar disorder: A randomised controlled trial,"Objectives: To examine the comparative effectiveness of an online psychoeducation program for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder within the previous 12 months, completed alone or with adjunctive peer support, on symptoms and perceived control over the illness. Method: Participants were randomly allocated to an eight-week online psychoeducation program ( n = 139), a psychoeducation program plus online peer support ( n = 134) or an attentional control condition ( n = 134). Results: Increased perceptions of control, decreased perceptions of stigmatisation and significant improvements in levels of anxiety and depression, from pre- to post-intervention were found across all groups. There were no significant differences between groups on outcome measures, although a small clinical difference was found between the supported and unsupported conditions in depression symptoms and in functional impairment at the six-month follow-up. Adherence to the treatment program was significantly higher in the supported intervention than in the unsupported program. Gender and age were also significant predictors of adherence, with females and those over the age of 30 showing greater adherence. Limitations: Mood state at study entry was measured by self-report rather than by clinical interview. Conclusions: The pattern of outcomes suggests a primary influence of non-specific or common therapeutic factors across all three intervention groups. A personally tailored intervention may be more suitable for individuals recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and longer term coaching may increase program adherence and long-term improvement in symptoms and functioning.

Randomized non-invasive sham-controlled pilot trial of electroacupuncture for postpartum depression,"Background: Postpartum depression affects 10–15% of mothers. Although acupuncture was efficacious for major depressive disorder in pregnancy and in women outside the perinatal period, there has been no randomized controlled study on the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of acupuncture for postpartum depression. Methods: This was a randomized, subject- and assessor-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled trial. Twenty women within six months postpartum with DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive disorder of mild severity, defined as a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₁₇) score of 12 to 19, were randomly assigned to either electroacupuncture or non-invasive sham acupuncture two sessions weekly for four weeks. Results: There was significant reduction in HDRS₁₇ score from baseline to 4-week posttreatment in both groups, with an effect size 1.4 and 1.8 for electroacupuncture and sham acupuncture, respectively. Improvement was observed as early as two weeks after commencing acupuncture. The response and remission rate in the electroacupuncture group at 4-week posttreatment was 33% and 44%, respectively; for the sham acupuncture group, it was 60% and 50%, respectively. There was no significant between-group difference in all outcome measures, including the HDRS₁₇, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Treatment credibility, success of blinding, and adverse events were similar between groups. Limitation: Small sample size and high attrition rate. No waiting list observation group. Conclusion: Both electroacupuncture and non-invasive sham acupuncture were effective for postpartum depression. Further studies utilizing larger sample size, better recruitment strategies, and home-based acupuncture treatment are warranted.

Novel surveillance of psychological distress during the great recession,"Background: Economic stressors have been retrospectively associated with net population increases in nonspecific psychological distress (PD). However, no sentinels exist to evaluate contemporaneous associations. Aggregate Internet search query surveillance was used to monitor population changes in PD around the United States' Great Recession. Methods: Monthly PD query trends were compared with unemployment, underemployment, homes in delinquency and foreclosure, median home value or sale prices, and S&amp;P 500 trends for 2004–2010. Time series analyses, where economic indicators predicted PD one to seven months into the future, were performed in 2011. Result: PD queries surpassed 1,000,000 per month, of which 300,000 may be attributable to the Great Recession. A one percentage point increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures was associated with a 16% (95%CI, 9–24) increase in PD queries one-month, and 11% (95%CI, 3–18) four months later, in reference to a pre-Great Recession mean. Unemployment and underemployment had similar associations half and one-quarter the intensity. ""Anxiety disorder"", ""what is depression"", ""signs of depression"", ""depression symptoms"", and ""symptoms of depression"" were the queries exhibiting the strongest associations with mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, unemployment or underemployment. Housing prices and S&amp;P 500 trends were not associated with PD queries. Limitations: A non-traditional measure of PD was used. It is unclear if actual clinically significant depression or anxiety increased during the Great Recession. Alternative explanations for strong associations between the Great Recession and PD queries, such as media, were explored and rejected. Conclusions: Because the economy is constantly changing, this work not only provides a snapshot of recent associations between the economy and PD queries but also a framework and toolkit for real-time surveillance going forward. Health resources, clinician screening patterns, and policy debate may be informed by changes in PD query trends.

A 16-year prospective study of prodromal features prior to BPI onset in well Amish children,"Background: Longitudinal research of well Amish children over 16 years to identify the pattern and frequency of prodromal symptoms/behaviors associated with onset of BPI disorder during childhood or adolescence. Methods: Parental informants were interviewed annually using structured and semi-structured interviews to record medical, developmental and behavioral/symptomatic data for their children in two samples. The bipolar sample had 115 children with a BPI parent. The control sample had 106 children of well parents, with and without a positive family history for mood disorders. A panel of clinicians assigned risk ratings independently and blind to family relations. Results: Eight children, age 13 or older, onset with BPI in the bipolar sample compared with one in the control sub-sample (well parent of a BPI sibling). The specific ""pre-school"" behaviors/symptoms that most identified children with BPI from well children in control samples were: sensitivity, crying, hyper-alertness, anxiety/worry and somatic complaints. During school years, parents reported mood (sad) and energy changes (low not high) decreased sleep and fearfulness as key symptoms. Limitations: The sample of 9 BPI onsets is small. However, a variable age of onset means many children remain at risk. Although not statistically significant, 34.6% of the bipolar sample youngsters carry risk ratings compared to 15.2% among controls. Conclusions: The miniclusters of prodromal features that emerged pre-school (ages 1–6), were ""episodic"" through childhood (7–12) and appeared to mimic adult recurrent illness. Prepubertal onset with mania did not occur. The pattern of prodromal symptoms has clinical relevance for its potential predictive value for onset with BPI disorder and early intervention.

Mental disorders and suicide in Japan: A nation-wide psychological autopsy case–control study,"Background: The purpose of the present nationwide psychological autopsy case-control study is to identify the association between mental disorders and suicide in Japan, adjusting for physical conditions. Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted of the closest family members of 49 suicide completers and 145 gender-, age-, and municipality-matched living controls. The interview included sections of socio-demographic characteristics, physical conditions, and a psychiatric interview producing DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders prior to suicide (or at survey). We compared prevalences of mental disorders between the two groups, using conditional logistic regression. Results: A significantly higher proportion with any mental disorder was found in the suicide group (65.3%) compared to the control group (4.8%) (p = 0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 7.5). The population attributable risk proportion associated with mental disorder was 0.24. Mood disorder, particularly major depressive disorder, was the most strongly associated with suicide (p &lt; 0.001). Anxiety disorder, alcohol-related disorder, and brief psychotic disorder were also significantly associated with suicide (p &lt; 0.05). These patterns were unchanged after adjusting for serious chronic physical conditions. Limitations: The present study had some limitations, such as small sample size, sampling bias and information bias. Conclusions: Most mental disorders, particularly mood disorder, were significantly associated with a greater risk of suicide in Japan, independent of physical conditions. Mental disorders are a major target of suicide prevention programs in Japan.

Excess burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes due to psychopathology,"Background: Whether the prevalence of type 1 or 2 diabetes is rising among people with psychopathology is uncertain. This study investigates changes in the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes associated with psychopathology in the adult Australian population from 2001 to 2008. Methods: Data analysed were from 48,359 participants aged ≥25 years from the 2001, 2004-05 or 2007-08 National Health Surveys. Lifetime diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes was determined by self-report. Psychopathology status was determined with the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (using scores ≥30), contemporaneous use of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, or both. Results: Overall, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes remained stable whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased by 36% between 2001 and 2008. On average, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes ranged from 1.43 (0.98, 2.10) to 2.44 (1.63, 3.64) and 1.32 (1.13, 1.53) to 1.67 (1.39, 2.02) for people with compared to those without psychopathology by any definition independent of sociodemographic covariates, consistently over the 8-year period. After further adjustments for lifestyle covariates, the strength of these odds ratios were attenuated and ranged from 1.32 (0.90, 1.95) to 2.24 (1.49, 3.36) and 1.16 (0.99, 1.36) to 1.51 (1.24, 1.83) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Limitations: Data were self-report from serial surveys. Conclusions: The prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes was consistently higher for people with psychopathology from 2001 to 2008. Clinicians should consider routinely screening patients with diabetes for psychopathology and vice versa, as well as lifestyle risk factors, to inform practice for more effective management and prevention planning.

Towards a multifactorial approach for prediction of bipolar disorder in at risk populations,"Background: The high prevalence, recurrence rate, chronicity, and illness burden in bipolar disorder (BD) are well documented. Moreover, insufficient response with conventional pharmacological and manual-based psychosocial interventions, as well as evidence of illness progression and acceleration, invite the need for early detection and primary prevention. Methods: Herein we comprehensively review extant studies reporting on a bipolar prodrome. The overarching aim is to propose a predictive algorithm (i.e. prediction of BD in at-risk populations) integrating genetic (i.e. family history), environmental (e.g. childhood maltreatment) and biological markers (i.e. BDNF, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers). Computerized databases i.e. Pubmed, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library and Scielo were searched using the followed terms: bipolar disorder cross-referenced with prodromal, preclinical, at risk mental states, clinical high risk, ultra high risk, biomarkers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, inflammation, cytokines, oxidative stress, prediction and predictive model. Results: Available evidence indicates that a prodrome to bipolar disorder exists. Commonly encountered features preceding the onset of a manic episode are affective lability, irritability, anger, depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, sleep disorders, as well as disturbances in attention and cognition. Non-specificity and insufficient sensitivity have hampered the development of an adequate prediction algorithm. Limitations: Limitations include biases associated with retrospective studies, poor characterization of clinical high risk, inadequacy of prospective studies regarding sample selection and absence of specificity of risk states. Conclusion: We propose a hypothetical prediction algorithm that is combinatorial in approach that attempts to integrate family history, early adversity, and selected biomarkers.

Common perinatal mental disorders and alcohol dependence in men in northern Viet Nam,"Background: To establish the prevalence and correlates of the perinatal common mental disorders of depression and anxiety (PCMD) and alcohol dependence (AD) in men in northern Viet Nam. Methods: A cross-sectional study of men whose wives were &gt;28 weeks pregnant or mothers of newborns recruited from randomly-selected rural and urban communes. Data sources were Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM IV; CAGE assessment of alcohol use and study-specific questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated by multiple logistic regressions. Results: Overall, 231/360 eligible men were recruited, of whom 17.7% [95% CI, 12.8-22.7] were diagnosed with a PCMD; 33.8% [95% CI, 27.9-40.1] with AD (CAGE score ≥2) and 6.9% [95% CI, 4.3-11.0] with co-morbid PCMD and AD. PCMD were associated with experiences of coincidental life adversity, intimate partner violence, age &gt;30; an unwelcome pregnancy and primiparity. AD was more common among men with low education, living in the poorest households and in unskilled work. Conclusions: Common mental disorders and AD are prevalent, but currently unrecognised among men in northern Viet Nam whose wives are pregnant or have recently given birth.

Predictors of change in perceived burden among caregivers of patients with eating disorders,"Background: Little is known about whether the perceived burden of caring for someone with an eating disorder (ED) changes over time or what may predict such change. Methods: In this prospective study of ED patients and their caregivers, caregivers answered the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire—EU Version (IEQ-EU), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the SF-12, and the Anorectic Behaviour Observation Scale (ABOS) at baseline and after one and two years of follow-up. On the same schedule, patients answered the HADS and the SF-12, as well as the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and the Health-Related Quality of Life in ED—short form (HeRQoLED-s). The psychiatrists assessed ED severity using the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. Results: Perceived caregiver burden significantly improved over the first year of follow-up; no further improvement was observed with longer follow-up. Reduction in perceived burden was associated with lower anxiety in caregivers and patients, and lower caregiver's perception of the severity of the patient's ED. With a decrease in patients' depressive symptoms, caregivers felt less need to urge them to carry out activities of self-care. Limitations: The IEQ-EU evaluates burden of caring in psychosis and mood disorders, but not for EDs. Loss of participants during the study could limit the generalization of results for the second year of follow-up. Conclusions: These data corroborate the need to monitor the health of caregivers of ED patients and provide them with tools to manage the consequences of these disorders, because these consequences can determine the burden perception independent of patients' symptoms.

"The persistence of attachment: Complicated grief, threat, and reaction times to the deceased's name","Background: Complicated grief is increasingly recognized as a debilitating disorder with significant mental and health consequences. The underlying mechanisms of complicated grief remain unclear, however. In the present study, we investigated a specific mechanism of complicated grief (CG) derived from attachment theory: the accessibility of the deceased's mental representation under threat. Methods: In a matched comparison of complicated ( n = 26) and asymptomatic grievers ( n = 30), we used an emotional Stroop task following subliminal threat or neutral primes to examine the accessibility of mental representations of the deceased, current attachment figures, and close others. Results: Complicated grievers did not evidence differential accessibility to the deceased's mental representation across priming conditions, whereas asymptomatic grievers showed reduced accessibility (deactivation) of the deceased's mental representation specifically in the threat prime condition. These effects were independent of depressive symptoms. Across grievers, attachment anxiety and avoidance uniquely predicted accessibility of the deceased's name in the threat condition. Limitations: The limitations of this study are its small sample size and reliance on analog attachment threats. Conclusions: These data support that accessibility of the deceased's mental representation in threatening contexts is an important component of complicated and asymptomatic grieving and that attachment insecurity contributes to a maladaptive reliance on the deceased as an attachment figure.

Longitudinal study of resilience and mental health in marines leaving military service,"Background: Despite a growing emphasis on psychological outcomes following military combat, few longitudinal studies have examined the combined role of risk and protective factors in the mental health of combat-exposed military personnel. This study characterizes the impact of resilience scale scores and combat exposure on mental health outcomes among Marines after separating from military service, along with intra-individual changes in mental health status. Methods: Data were collected from longitudinal surveys of 475 active duty Marines attending a random sample of mandatory Transition Assistance Program workshops before leaving the military and responding to follow-up mail or web surveys an average of 6 months after returning to civilian life. Results: Results revealed distinct risk and protective factors for those meeting screening criteria for mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and functional impairment at follow-up. Primary risk factors included experiencing higher levels of pre-separation combat exposure; post-separation stress across multiple life domains; and experiencing multiple areas of pain post-separation. Protective factors include having higher scores on pre-separation resilience and perceived social support at follow-up indices. We also identified a number of factors associated with change in mental health status from baseline to follow-up. Limitations: Generality is limited by a lower than expected follow-up response rate and an exclusively Marine sample. Conclusion: The role of resilience appeared to have a greater impact on functional impairment than on mental health symptoms per se. Findings provide important input for enhancing training programs and services intended to promote adjustment from military to civilian life. Additional emphasis on social support and coping with stress-related issues are needed in support of combat veterans.

Evolution of perinatal depressive symptoms from pregnancy to two years postpartum in a low-risk sample: The MATQUID cohort,"Background: Few studies have explored the evolution of perinatal depressive symptoms (PNDS) throughout the perinatal period. Aims: To evaluate in a low-risk sample, whether different evolutive profiles of PNDS exist from pregnancy to 2-years postpartum, and whether the subgroups differ regarding psychopathological and demographic characteristics. Methods: In a prospective, longitudinal study from 8 months pregnancy to 2 years postpartum, repeated measures of PNDS using the CES-D were performed on a sample of 579 women at low-risk for PNDS. First, semiparametric mixture models were used to identify groups of women with distinct trajectories of PNDS. Second, multinomial logistic regressions were used to identify risk factors for each group. Results: Four distinct trajectories of PNDS evolution were found: (i) 72% of the women never presented with clinically significant depressive symptoms; (ii) 4% presented with depressive symptoms only during the postnatal period; (iii) 21% presented with depressive symptoms throughout the follow-up period, with a higher intensity during pregnancy; (iv) 3% presented with stable highly intense symptoms throughout the follow-up period. Psychosocial risk factors for PNDS were mainly identified in the patients of the third group, with an influence of socioeconomical variables and anxiety traits. Limitations: The main limitations of the present study are the small size of the sample and the low level of risk for PNDS, so the results cannot be extrapolated to all types of populations. Conclusion: Different subtypes of evolutionary profiles of PNDS are found in a low-risk sample, and are associated with different profiles of risk factors.

Acculturation and post-disaster mental health problems among affected and non-affected immigrants: A comparative study,"Background: It is unknown to what extent acculturation among disaster-affected immigrants is associated with mental health problems (MHP) compared to non-affected immigrants. Methods: We examined the associations between acculturation and post-disaster MHP among affected and non-affected immigrants in The Netherlands. Results: Among the affected group, keeping norms and values of original culture and limited skills to cope with the demands of the new society were independently associated with PTSD-symptomatology, anxiety, depression, hostility, and somatic problems at 18 months post-event. In the non-affected comparison group no associations were found. Interestingly, levels of acculturation did not differ between both groups, in contrast to MHP. Limitations: The acculturation levels could be influenced by the experience of a disaster. However, levels did not differ statistically between the study groups. Furthermore, the groups were reasonably small and the response rates were, although not uncommon in health studies among immigrants, relatively low. Conclusions: The findings of this unique study clearly suggest that post-disaster mental health policies should target low levels of skills to survive in the new society. Furthermore, the acculturation domain of keeping traditional norms and values can be contrary to the Dutch care after a disaster where self-efficacy and individualistic, cognitive functioning are the central goals. Further research is warranted to explore and examine post-event interventions aimed at increasing the levels of acculturation that may facilitate recovery.

"Early and late onset depression in young and middle aged adults: Differential symptomatology, characteristics and risk factors?","Background: Early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) may be different phenomena. In this study, differences between EOD and LOD in symptomatology, psychiatric characteristics and psychosocial/somatic factors were examined. Methods: Baseline data were from 1104 participants with a current major depressive disorder participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (age range 18 65years). DSM-IV diagnoses, depressive symptoms and age of onset were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Analyses were performed by using a continuous as well as a dichotomous (cut-off 40years) age of onset indicator. Results: Differences between EOD and LOD were observed: longer duration of symptoms (p&lt;.001), a personal history of depressive episodes (p&lt;.001), a serious suicide attempt (p&lt;.001), childhood events (p&lt;.001), a family history of depression (p=.03), and high neuroticism (p&lt;.001) were more often present in EOD than in LOD. Also differences in symptomatology were observed: feelings of sadness (p&lt;.001), diminished concentration (p=.02) and suicidal thoughts (p=.001) were significantly less prevalent at a higher age of onset, whereas decreased appetite/weight loss (p=.01) was more prominent at a higher age of onset. Limitations: The age of first depression onset was asked retrospectively and might be biased by selective recall. However, participants can likely recall whether symptoms started earlier or later in life. Conclusions: Despite similarities, our observed differential findings in symptoms, psychiatric characteristics, and psychosocial factors between EOD and LOD further support that EOD is associated with more frequent occurrence of some clinical features of depression. These differential findings are important factors to keep in mind for diagnostics, treatment, and prevention.

Therapists' professional and personal characteristics as predictors of outcome in short- and long-term psychotherapy,"Background: Short- and long-term psychotherapies have been found effective for treating mood and anxiety disorders. Although psychotherapists differ in their effectiveness, virtually no comparative research exists on the therapist characteristics beneficial to short- or long-term therapy. Methods: Altogether 326 outpatients, aged 20–46 years, and suffering from mood or anxiety disorder, were randomly assigned to either short-term (solution-focused or psychodynamic therapy, combined) or long-term (psychodynamic) psychotherapy, and were followed up for 3 years. Therapies were provided by 55 volunteering therapists with at least 2 years of work experience in the given form of therapy. Therapists' professional and personal characteristics, measured before randomization, were assessed with the Development of Psychotherapists Common Core Questionnaire (DPCCQ). Patients' general psychiatric symptoms were assessed as the main outcome measure at baseline and 3, 7, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after start of treatment with the Symptom Check List, Global Severity Index (SCL-90-GSI). Results: Active, engaging, and extroverted therapists produced a faster symptom reduction in short-term therapy than in long-term therapy. More cautious, non-intrusive therapists generated greater benefits in long-term therapy during the 3-year follow-up. Therapists' lower confidence and enjoyment in therapeutic work predicted poorer outcomes in short-term therapy in the long run. Limitations: Generalizability may be limited due to relatively experienced therapists. Conclusions: Therapist characteristics apparently are important determinants of effectiveness of short- and long-term psychotherapy. If confirmed in future studies, results may be applied in training and supervision of therapists as well as in fitting therapy forms with therapist dispositions to maximize treatment benefits.

Gray matter abnormalities in major depressive disorder: A meta-analysis of voxel based morphometry studies,"Background: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been widely used to quantify structural brain changes associated with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). While some consistent findings have been reported, individual studies have also varied with respect to the key brain regions affected by the illness, and how these abnormalities are related to patients' clinical characteristics. Here, we aimed to identify those brain regions that most consistently showed gray matter anomalies in MDD, and their clinical correlates, using meta-analytic techniques. Methods: A systematic search of VBM studies was applied in MDD. Signed differential mapping, a new coordinate based neuroimaging meta-analysis technique, was applied to data collated from a total of 23 studies comparing regional gray matter volumes of 986 MDD patients and 937 healthy controls. Results: Gray matter was significantly reduced in a confined cluster located in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). There were also gray matter reductions in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and decrease in the latter region was evident in patients with multiple-episodes. Amygdala and parahippocampal gray matter volumes were significantly reduced in studies including patients with comorbid anxiety disorders, as well as in first-episode/drug free samples. Conclusions: Gray matter reduction in rostral ACC was the most consistent finding in VBM studies of MDD. The evidence for reductions in other regions within fronto-subcortical and limbic regions was less consistent. The associations between these gray matter anomalies and clinical characteristics, particularly measures relating to illness duration, suggest that chronic MDD has a robust and deleterious, albeit spatially focal, effect on brain structure.

A prospective examination of the association between the centrality of a loss and post-loss psychopathology,"Background: Research has shown that the extent to which a negative event has become central to one's everyday inferences, life-story, and identity is associated with the severity of psychopathology experienced following this event. The current study aimed to extend this prior research by examining the prospective linkage between the centrality of a loss-event and post-loss psychopathology. Methods: To this end, 176 individuals, bereaved within the past year, completed the Centrality of Event Scale (CES) with their loss as the anchor event, together with measures of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), depression, and bereavement-related Posttraumatic Stress-Disorder (PTSD) and complementary questionnaires. One hundred participants again completed symptom-measures one year later. Results: Findings showed that (a) the centrality of a loss was associated with concurrent symptom-levels of PGD, depression, and PTSD; (b) the centrality of a loss predicted PGD-severity, depression-severity, and PTSD-severity one year later, after controlling for baseline symptom-levels; (c) these cross-sectional and prospective linkages remained significant when controlling for relevant demographic and loss-related variables, as well as for indices of neuroticism, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance and persistent closeness to the lost person. Limitations: Limitations include the under-representation of men and the reliance on self-report measures. Conclusions: The current findings provide evidence that the centrality of a negative event is a prospective predictor of post-event psychopathology.

The effects of progress monitoring on subsequent readmission to psychiatric care: A six-month follow-up,"Background: Monitoring patient progress and providing feedback to clinicians and patients about progress during therapy reduce depressive symptoms at treatment completion. However, the effects of feedback on patient outcomes following treatment completion are unknown. Accordingly, the current study aimed to examine the effect of feedback on readmission to psychiatric hospital following completion of a group psychotherapy program. Method: This naturalistic historical follow-up study compared the risk of readmission to a psychiatric hospital for two patient cohorts examined by Newnham et al. (2010a,b); the first cohort received feedback (n = 408) during a group psychotherapy program, whereas the second cohort did not receive feedback (n = 439). The sample included inpatients and day patients, with primarily depressive and anxiety disorders who routinely completed the World Health Organization's Wellbeing Index. Results: Feedback was associated with fewer readmissions over the six months following completion of the therapy program for patients who, at the point of feedback, were on track to make clinically meaningful improvement by treatment termination. Discussion: The findings suggest feedback could result in cost saving and is associated with improved outcomes following treatment completion for patients deemed on track during therapy.

"Maternal depression, socioeconomic position, and temperament in early childhood: The EDEN mother–child cohort","Background: Children of mothers who experience depression in pregnancy may be at high risk of emotional disturbances; however heterogeneity in risk suggests that other factors could play a moderating role. We test the hypothesis that children growing up in families characterised by both maternal depression and socioeconomic disadvantage are especially likely to have temperamental difficulties. Methods: Data come from the mother child EDEN cohort study based in France (n=1903 mother child pairs followed from 24weeks of pregnancy to 12months of age). Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D questionnaire, family socioeconomic position by family income and child temperament by the EAS at age 12months. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for demographic characteristics (child's age, sex, mother's age at birth, number of siblings, parental separation, nonmaternal care) as well as child's premature birth, birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, maternal anxiety during pregnancy and maternal postnatal depression. Results: Accounting for age and sex, family risk (i.e. combined maternal depression and family income) was associated with children' scores of emotionality (p&lt;0.0001) and activity (p=0.02). In multivariate analyses, children growing up exposed to both maternal depression and low income had the highest emotionality scores ( =0.57, se=0.14, p=0.0001). Limitations: Maternal depression symptoms are self-reported. Conclusions: Addressing the mental health needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged families with young children may help reduce the burden of internalising problems in the next generation.

The aim of our study was to examine associations between health-professional diagnosed work-related asthma (WRA) and current depression and the effect of current depression on the associations of WRA with adverse asthma outcomes. Method: We analyzed data from the 2006 and 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Asthma Call-Back Survey and the Anxiety and Depression Module conducted in 25 states and District of Columbia for ever-employed adults with current asthma. We computed weighted proportions and prevalence ratios adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, current employment status, and smoking status. Survey participants who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that their asthma was related to any job they ever had were determined to have WRA. Participants with current depression were identified using self-report of depressive symptoms. Results: Of ever-employed adults with current asthma, an estimated 9.1% had WRA and 17.0% had current depression. Persons with WRA were significantly more likely than those with non-WRA to have current depression. Persons with either WRA, current depression, or both WRA and current depression were significantly more likely to have adverse asthma outcomes than persons with asthma and neither condition. The associations with adverse asthma outcomes were stronger when both current depression and WRA were present. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional and hypothesis-generating study. Conclusions: Depression may play an important role in asthma management and should be considered when assessing patients with asthma and, in particular, those with WRA.

Type D personality and persistence of depressive symptoms in a German cohort of cardiac patients,"Background: Depression is associated with a negative prognosis in coronary heart disease and heart failure patients. Type D personality has been shown to predict the persistence of depressive symptoms over 12 months. Data on longer follow-up periods and on the effectiveness of Type D as a screening tool compared to established measures of depressive symptoms are missing. Methods: Type D personality and depressive mood were assessed with the DS14 and the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) in 679 consecutive cardiac patients (22.2% female, mean age 62.4 ± 10.2 years) over a period of 6 years. Latent class and growth mixture models with Type D, comorbidity, age, and sex as covariates were used to model individual depression trajectory classes and to predict trajectories and class membership. Estimates of specificity and sensitivity were calculated for Type D and the HADS-D baseline cut-off point. Results: In a model with four latent classes (mild symptoms, moderate and increasing symptoms, significant but decreasing symptoms, and significant and increasing symptoms), Type D predicted the membership in the class with significant and increasing symptoms (OR = 10.94, 4.93, and 3.15). Sensitivity and specificity were 59% and 78% for Type D and 47% and 80% for the HADS-D. Limitations: Some possible confounders might be missing. With just two measurement points only linear trajectories could be modeled. Conclusions: Type D personality is a stronger predictor for persistent depressive symptoms than the baseline HADS-D score, but the predictive power seems low for clinical practice.

Affective intensity and lability: Heritability in adult male twins,"Background: Inability to monitor and self-regulate heightened levels of affect lability and affect intensity is associated with a range of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, psychosomatic symptoms and socially maladaptive behaviors. Despite the importance of these aspects of affective regulation, there are no twin study data to shed light on the genetic and environmental components of these constructs. Methods: Affective Lability Scale (ALS) and Affect Intensity Measure (AIM) questionnaires were administered to 796 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry and subjected to twin and model-fitting analyses. Complete data were available from 182 monozygotic and 119 dizygotic twin pairs. Results: Biometrical genetic model-fitting estimates indicated that additive genetic influence accounted for 40% of the variance in affect intensity and 25% of the variance in the ALS subscale assessing anxiety-depression mood shifts. Nonadditive genetic influence was indicated for ALS subscales measuring shifts between normal mood and depression (29%) and anger (27%), respectively. There was negligible evidence of shared environmental influence on affect measures. In contrast, estimates of nonshared environmental influences ranged from 52% to 74%. Limitations: Female were not included in this study due to the nature of the twin cohort. Data from subjects in a population cohort may not generalize to clinical populations. Measures of environment were not included. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for moderate heritability of affect intensity and specific measures of affect lability. Individual differences in mood regulation may represent phenotypic variation in a core psychobiologic vulnerability (e.g., neurotransmitter systems).

"An evolutionary based social rank explanation of why low income predicts mental distress: A 17 year cohort study of 30,000 people","Background: This paper presents a new psychological model of why low income increases risk of mental distress. Consistent with evolutionary perspectives on disorder, income was predicted to relate to mental distress only through acting as an indirect proxy for social rank. Methods: Participants were part of a longitudinal cohort sample of 30,000 people who were representative of the British population and who completed measures annually for up to 17 years. Mental distress was assessed via the General Health Questionnaire which measures anxiety, depression, and general functioning. Results: Both income and the rank of the income within the region (and the rank of income within other comparison groups, such as similar individuals) predicted current and future distress. However, when distress was jointly regressed on income and income rank, only income rank remained a significant predictor. Limitations: The outcome measure was self-report (although the predictor was objective). Conclusions: The results support psychosocial rather than material explanations of why income relates to distress, and suggest that a concern for social rank is the mechanism through which these effects occur. This mechanism is consistent with an evolutionarily based “involuntary defeat syndrome” where hard wired responses to low social rank increase risk for disorder and the Decision by Sampling model of how people make relative judgments. Negative cognitions associated with low social rank (particularly defeat and entrapment) may be clinically targetable in both prevention and treatment programs to reduce socio-economic mental health disparities.

Occurrence of affective disorders compared to other psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is a common genetic disorder with highly variable clinical manifestations that may include depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Studies of psychiatric disorders in youth with 22qDS often had methodological limitations. This study reviewed clinical studies with the currently best available methodology to determine the occurrence of affective disorders compared to other psychiatric disorders in youth with 22qDS. Method: A PubMed search was performed to identify psychiatric studies published from 2000 through 2009 of children and adolescents with genetically confirmed 22qDS who underwent systematic psychiatric assessments. Studies that met defined inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected for further analysis. Results: Seven studies with a total of 323 children and adolescents with 22qDS (mean age = 10.8 years) met the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Depressive disorders, but not bipolar spectrum disorders, were increased compared to community-based rates in youth without 22qDS. Anxiety disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were the most frequent disorders. Although psychotic-like phenomena and schizotypical traits were reported, only two adolescents (&lt;1%) had a psychotic disorder. Limitations: Unknown selection and assessment factors may have impacted on occurrence rates. Conclusion: The elevated occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and attention disorders in children with 22qDS, compared to community-based rates in children without 22qDS, suggest that psychiatric screening is needed. Longitudinal study is needed to determine if these childhood psychiatric disorders will resolve, continue into adulthood, or develop into more serious psychopathology.

Risk constellations prior to the development of bipolar disorders: Rationale of a new risk assessment tool,"Background: The precise characterisation of a high risk status for the development of a psychiatric disorder and the question of how well this predicts disease manifestation is of major importance as negative consequences of late diagnosis and treatment have been well demonstrated. In the absence of well defined and disease specific biological markers for bipolar disorder, the recognition of premature stages must rely on combinations of risk factors that have been associated with later disease manifestation. Methods: A review of the literature and our experience from the Early Recognition Centre led us to identify symptom constellations. Results: Individual categories defined and grouped included: (I) genetic risk, (II) substance use, misuse or dependence, (III) diagnosis/suspected diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, (IV) pronounced creativity, (V) impairment in psychosocial functioning, (VI) subthreshold affective symptoms, and (VII) early symptomatology including (a) changes in sleep and circadian rhythm, (b) changes in mood, mood swings/affective lability, (c) fearfulness/anxiety, and (d) dissociative symptoms. These risk constellations were operationalised and a new risk assessment instrument, the Early Phase Inventory for Bipolar Disorders (EPI bipolar ) was developed. Limitations: Challenges regarding the validity of the data on which the instrument is based, specificity of and correlations between risk categories, and ethical considerations were encountered. Conclusions: Further use of EPI bipolar in research should help to refine prodromal features and narrow these down to a less cumbersome core that can be used to develop a shortened tool for use in clinical care. Prospective longitudinal research is needed to establish the predictive validity of this novel bipolar disorder risk assessment tool.

Beta blocker therapy is associated with reduced depressive symptoms 12 months post percutaneous coronary intervention,"Background: Beta blocker therapy may induce depressive symptoms, although current evidence is conflicting. We examined the association between beta blocker therapy and depressive symptoms in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients and the extent to which there is a dose–response relationship between beta blocker dose and depressive symptoms. Methods: Patients treated with PCI (N = 685) completed the depression scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 1 and 12months post PCI. Information about type and dose of beta blocker use was extracted from medical records. Results: Of all patients, 68% (466/685) were on beta blocker therapy at baseline. In adjusted analysis, beta blocker use at 1 month post PCI (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.53–1.26) was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. At 12 months post PCI, there was a significant relationship between beta blocker use and depressive symptoms (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.31–0.84), with beta blocker therapy associated with a 49% risk reduction in depressive symptoms. There was a dose–response relationship between beta blocker dose and depressive symptoms 12 months post PCI, with the risk reduction in depressive symptoms in relation to a low dose being 36% (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.37–1.10) and 58% (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.24–0.76) in relation to a high dose. Conclusions: Patients treated with beta blocker therapy were less likely to experience depressive symptoms 12 months post PCI, with there being a dose–response relationship with a higher dose providing a more pronounced protective effect.

Cross-sectional comparison of the clinical characteristics of adults with early-onset and late-onset obsessive compulsive disorder,"Background: Age at onset (AAO) in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may differentiate genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtypes. The current cross-sectional study compared the characteristics of early-onset OCD (onset age ≤18 years) and late-onset OCD (onset age &gt;18 years). The AAO cut-off was based on the onset distribution observed in our systematically recruited patients with OCD. Methods: Six hundred and two (including 339 men and 263 women) outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria of OCD were recruited from the Shanghai Mental Health Center and were screened by a battery of instruments: Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) attached Y–BOCS Symptom Checklist, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 275 early-onset patients were compared to those of the 327 late-onset patients. Results: Compared to patients with late-onset OCD, early-onset patients with OCD were significantly more likely to be male (66.9% vs. 47.4%, X ² = 23.1, p &lt; 0.001), to have a positive family history of mental illnesses (26.5% vs. 19.0%, X ² = 4.9, p = 0.026), and to have a longer duration of illness [80.0 (SD = 80.7) vs. 65.5 (SD = 78.3) months, t₆₀₀ = 3.17, p = 0.002]. Early-onset patients also had significantly higher scores on the HAMA, HAMD, STAI2, and obsessive in Y–BOCS. The sexual and symmetry/exactness obsessions and the washing/cleaning compulsions were significantly more prevalent in the early-onset group. Conclusions: The study of a large sample from mainland China confirms the findings from previous studies and supports the hypothesis that early-onset OCD is a demographically and clinically distinct subtype of OCD.

Early Maladaptive Schemas among patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder,"Background: Bipolar disorder is associated with a variety of cognitive features that seem to play a role in affective symptoms. Schema theory may serve as a unifying theory that would explain many of these features. This study is an exploratory investigation of schema theory's Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMSs) among individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Methods: A sample of 74 participants with bipolar disorder and 99 mixed clinical controls (46 with unipolar depression and 53 with anxiety disorders) completed the Young Schema Questionnaire and comparison measures. Associations were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Mean scores were compared with previously established benchmarks. Results: Participants with bipolar disorder demonstrate elevated scores on most EMSs, many at an intermediate position between nonclinical and mixed clinical control groups. When controlling for depression, participants with bipolar disorder exceed those with unipolar depression on Approval-Seeking/Recognition-Seeking and Entitlement/Grandiosity . Bipolar group membership is predicted by high scores on Approval-Seeking/Recognition-Seeking and low scores on Emotional Inhibition and Abandonment . Limitations: Women were overrepresented. Axis II traits were not assessed, nor were manic symptoms in the mixed clinical sample. Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is associated with a general activation of the EMSs. Approval-Seeking/Recognition-Seeking and Entitlement/Grandiosity seem to be particularly high, while Emotional Inhibition and Abandonment seem to be typically low. These EMS are highly consistent with characteristics of the bipolar spectrum. By demonstrating the activation of the EMSs, this study suggests that the EMS component of schema theory may be applied to bipolar disorder. Future research should explore how EMSs might interact with life events to trigger affective symptoms and, ultimately, the applicability of schema therapy to bipolar disorder.

Frontal regional homogeneity increased and temporal regional homogeneity decreased after remission of first-episode drug-naïve major depressive disorder with panic disorder patients under duloxetine therapy for 6 weeks,"Objective: We designed this study to investigate the changes of regional homogeneity (ReHo) after a 6-week duloxetine therapy in first-episode drug-naïve major depressive disorder with panic disorder (FEMDDPD) patients. Method: 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning and ReHo functional MRI analysis were performed on 15 patients (male: 5; female: 10; age: 35.87 ± 9.59 years old) at baseline and remitted status (sixth week) compared with 15 healthy control subjects (male: 4; female: 11; age: 34.30 ± 9.87 years old) which were scanned twice within 6 weeks. The ReHo was analyzed by the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data analysis toolbox). The ReHos of different time-points were compared by using paired t test function of REST. Results: ReHo increased in right superior frontal cortex, right medial frontal cortex and decreased in right superior temporal cortex (uncorrected p &lt; 0.00005, cluster threshold &gt;20, surface connected theory) after remission of symptoms in these FEMDDPD patients within 6 weeks (improvements of clinician rating and self rating scale scores; post-hoc corrected p &lt; 0.001). No significant changes of ReHo were observed in the controls within 6 weeks (uncorrected p &lt; 0.1, no cluster threshold setting, surface connected theory). The changes of ReHo value were mildly correlated with improvements of clinical rating scales with age, gender, depression and anxiety severity as covariates. Conclusion: Our study suggested that differential modulations inside the default mode network probably were associated with remission of FEMDDPD symptoms after duloxetine therapy.

Cholecystokinin system genes: Associations with panic and other psychiatric disorders,"Background: The cholecystokinin (CCK) system has long been hypothesised to have a role in the pathogenesis of panic attacks. Previous research into genetic variation within the CCK gene and the genes for its two receptors, CCKAR and CCKBR , has produced mixed results. We aimed to clarify this association by investigating multiple variants within each gene and multiple phenotypes associated with panic that may have confounded the previous studies' findings. Methods: Variants were selected for the three genes based on HapMap CEU data. Individuals from a family based cohort (n = 563) were genotyped for these variations and this data was analysed in FBAT. Results: CCKBR showed the strongest association with panic, having multiple variants with p &lt; 0.05 (lowest: p = 0.007). In CCKAR , some evidence was found for an association with panic, though further analysis suggested that the co-morbid bipolar–panic phenotype was most strongly associated. No variants in CCK were associated with panic but broader anxiety phenotypes did show associations. Limitations: Small sample size prevented thorough investigation of phenotypes, particularly pure disorders, and no correction was made for the multiple phenotypes analysed. Conclusions: Our findings support the involvement of variation in the CCK system, particularly CCKBR , in the pathogenesis of panic. Our data suggest that variation in CCK may be involved in several anxiety phenotypes and CCKAR may be involved in the development of panic co-morbid with bipolar disorder. These latter findings require further investigation and highlight the importance of clearly defined phenotypes when investigating psychiatric genetics.

A 40-week double-blind aripiprazole versus lithium follow-up of a 12-week acute phase study (total 52weeks) in bipolar I disorder,"Background: This study followed manic or mixed bipolar I subjects for an additional 40 weeks after initial randomization to 12 weeks of lithium versus aripiprazole monotherapy. This is the only long-term, double-blind study comparing lithium and aripiprazole. Methods: Patients continued receiving either aripiprazole 15 or 30 mg/day, or lithium 900, 1200 or 1500 mg/day in a double-blind fashion for 40 weeks after completing a 12-week double-blind study (52 weeks total treatment). Efficacy endpoints included adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 52 in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores (observed cases). Remission was defined as YMRS total score ≤12. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Results: Of the 66 patients who entered the extension phase, only 20 patients (30.3%) completed the entire phase (aripiprazole n = 7; lithium n = 13). The significant improvement that occurred over the first 12 weeks was maintained over the 40 weeks of blinded continuation (from Week 12 through Week 52). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the extension phase for aripiprazole were akathisia, headache, somnolence, anxiety and nasopharyngitis (all 8%), and for lithium were insomnia (15.8%), headache (13.2%), diarrhea (13.2%) and vomiting (10.5%). Mean weight change was +2.71 kg for lithium and +5.66 kg for aripiprazole (p = 0.46). Limitations: This trial was not powered to statistically compare active treatments, and long-term completion rates were low in both groups. Conclusions: Aripiprazole monotherapy appears to be equivalently useful to lithium for the extended treatment of mixed or manic bipolar disorder patients.

Expressive writing and positive writing for participants with mood disorders: An online randomized controlled trial,"Introduction: Expressive writing—writing about traumatic, stressful or emotional events—often leads to improvements in physical and psychological health in non-clinical and clinical populations. Recent studies have shown that positive writing may also be beneficial. Research has not yet investigated whether either expressive writing or positive writing offers benefits for people with mood disorders. Method: Participants were recruited online and were randomly allocated to expressive writing, positive writing or control writing. The following questionnaires were completed online: Centre for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale (CES-D), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness (PILL), overall health questions, Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and COPE Inventory (COPE). Participants then wrote for 20 min on 4 occasions, and then completed follow-up questionnaires. Results: Linear mixed models with custom contrasts were conducted to assess differences between groups and over time. All 3 groups showed significant improvements over time on mental health and some physical health outcomes. There were no significant differences between groups and no significant group by time interactions. These results were not moderated by demographic factors, personality subtypes or coping styles. Conclusion: The expressive writing, positive writing and time management control writing groups all reported significantly fewer mental and physical symptoms for at least 4 months post-writing. When expressive and positive writing groups were combined, the resulting 'emotional writing group' showed significantly lower scores on the DASS stress subscale than the control writing group at all time-points. Potential reasons are discussed and areas of further study identified.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in adolescent females with emotional disorders not treated with SSRIs,"Background: Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) show elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Studies of adolescents with MDD or anxiety disorders (AD) are few and present conflicting results. Methods: We studied plasma cytokines in a clinical sample of adolescent females with MDD and/or clinical AD (n = 60, mean age 16.8 years), compared to healthy controls (n = 44; mean age 16.5 years). Results: The clinical sample showed significantly higher values of IL-2 (Z = −4.09, p &gt; 0.0001), IL1-beta (Z = −2.40, p &lt; 0.05) and IL-10 (Z = −2.38, p &lt; 0.05) as compared to controls. The subgroup of the clinical sample not treated with SSRIs had a significant difference of IL-6 (Z = −2.26, p &lt; 0.05) in addition to the difference of IL-2 and IL1-beta, but showed no difference of IL-10 as compared to the controls. SSRI treatment was related to IL-6, explaining 26% of the variance in the clinical sample after controlling for BMI and symptom severity. In the clinical sample, levels of IL-6 and IFN-gamma were positively correlated with self-assessed symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (corr.coeff 0.35 resp 0.40 at p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: The cross-sectional design does not allow for conclusions on causality. The sample sizes were relatively small and a large drop-out in the clinical sample may have influenced the representativity. Discussion: The study suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines are part of the pathophysiology of emotional disorders in adolescent females and that SSRIs have anti-inflammatory properties. The findings prompt further studies on the specific mechanisms involved and may contribute to the development of more effective treatment and prevention.

Clinical features and risk factors for post-partum depression in a large cohort of Chinese women with recurrent major depressive disorder,"Background: Post partum depression (PPD) is relatively common in China but its clinical characteristics and risk factors have not been studied. We set out to investigate whether known risk factors for PPD could be found in Chinese women. Methods: A case control design was used to determine the impact of known risk factors for PPD in a cohort of 1970 Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD). In a within-case design we examined the risk factors for PPD in patients with recurrent MDD. We compared the clinical features of MDD in cases with PPD to those without MDD. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic and ordinal regression. Results: Lower occupational and educational statuses increased the risk of PPD, as did a history of pre-menstrual symptoms, stressful life events and elevated levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Patients with PPD and MDD were more likely to experience a comorbid anxiety disorder, had a younger age of onset of MDD, have higher levels of neuroticism and dysthymia. Limitations: Results obtained in this clinical sample may not be applicable to PPD within the community. Data were obtained retrospectively and we do not know whether the correlations we observe have the same causes as those operating in other populations. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the despite cultural differences between Chinese and Western women, the phenomenology and risk factors for PPD are very similar.

The impact of educational status on the clinical features of major depressive disorder among Chinese women,"Background: Years of education are inversely related to the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the relationship between the clinical features of MDD and educational status is poorly understood. We investigated this in 1970 Chinese women with recurrent MDD identified in a clinical setting. Methods: Clinical and demographic features were obtained from 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depression between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between educational level and clinical features of MDD. Results: Subjects with more years of education are more likely to have MDD, with an odds ratio of 1.14 for those with more than ten years. Low educational status is not associated with an increase in the number of episodes, nor with increased rates of co-morbidity with anxiety disorders. Education impacts differentially on the symptoms of depression: lower educational attainment is associated with more biological symptoms and increased suicidal ideation and plans to commit suicide. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to males or to other patient populations. Since the threshold for treatment seeking differs as a function of education there may an ascertainment bias in the sample. Conclusions: The relationship between symptoms of MDD and educational status in Chinese women is unexpectedly complex. Our findings are inconsistent with the simple hypothesis from European and US reports that low levels of educational attainment increase the risk and severity of MDD.

Developing a clinical typology of dysfunctional anger,"Background: This study attempted to validate a clinical typology of dysfunctional anger proposed by DiGiuseppe and Tafrate (2007) using assessment data obtained from 197 participants assessed at an outpatient clinic for anger problems. Methods: Several self-report scales assessing anger, hostility, impulsivity and aggression, as well as a structured interview regarding anger experience and expression, were administered; Axis I and II comorbidity were assessed using clinical assessment and the SCID-II PQ. Results: We found support for four of the proposed eight types described by DiGiuseppe and Tafrate—Pervasive Dysfunctional Anger, Impulsive Type; Pervasive Dysfunctional Anger, Mixed Type; Impulsive Aggressive Dysfunctional Anger; and Suppressed Dysfunctional Anger—with significant, predicted group differences on self-report measures of anger, aggression, and impulsivity, as well as differences in Axis I and II diagnoses. Limitations: Patients were rarely assigned to the other four dysfunctional anger types and thus we could not examine the validity of these types. We relied heavily on self-report data. Conclusions: Anger is a common symptom in outpatient psychiatry clinics. It is associated with both mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses, and often co-occurs with substance use problems. Different types of angry patients will likely require different assessment and treatment approaches.

Validation of three psychometric instruments for screening for perinatal common mental disorders in men in the north of Vietnam,"Background: Perinatal non-psychotic common mental disorders (PCMDs) are less well recognised in men than in women. However, there are adverse consequences of PCMD for men, their partners and their infants. There is a need for simple, readily administered screening tools for use in research and primary health care for men, including in low income settings. The aim of this study was to validate three scales for screening PCMDs in men in northern Vietnam. Methods: Translated and culturally verified versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Zung's Self-rated Anxiety Scale (Zung SAS), and the General Health Questionnaire 12 items (GHQ-12) were validated against a gold-standard diagnostic tool, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV diagnoses in a community-based sample of 231 Vietnamese men who were partners of pregnant women or women who had recently given birth. Post-hoc analyses, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses, and Cronbach's alpha were performed to examine the validity and internal reliability of the three scales. Results: The prevalence of PCMDs in men was 17.8% (95%CI: 13.3–22.3). The AUROC of the EPDS 76.7% (95%CI: 67.9–85.5), the Zung SAS was 77.5% (95%CI: 68.9–86.0) and the GHQ-12was 79.2% (95%CI: 71.2–87.1). The selected cut-off point to detect clinically significant symptoms in men using the EPDS was 4/5 (Sensitivity (Se) 68.3% and specificity (Sp) 77.4%), the Zung SAS was 35/36 (Se 70.7% and Sp 79.0%) and the GHQ-12 was 0/1 (Se 75.6% and Sp 74.7%). Conclusions: PCMDs in men are an unrecognised public health problem in northern Vietnam. Overall the cut off scores to detect clinically significant symptoms are lower than those reported in high income settings.
