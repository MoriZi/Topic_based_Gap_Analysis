25,A review of popular smartphone apps for depression and anxiety: Assessing the inclusion of evidence-based content,"Smartphone applications for the treatment of depression and anxiety have acquired millions of users, yet little is known about whether they include evidence-based therapeutic content. We examined the extent to which popular mental health applications (MH apps) for depression and anxiety contain treatment elements found in empirically supported psychotherapy protocols (i.e., ""common elements""). Of the 27 MH apps reviewed, 23 included at least one common element, with a median of three elements. Psychoeducation (in 52% of apps), relaxation (44%), meditation (41%), mindfulness (37%), and assessment (37%) were the most frequent elements, whereas several elements (e.g., problem solving) were not found in any apps. We also identified gaps between app content and empirically supported treatments. Cognitive restructuring was more common in depression protocols than in depression apps (75% of protocols vs. 31% of apps), as was problem solving (34% vs. 0%). For anxiety, exposure (85%, 12%), cognitive restructuring (60%, 12%), and problem solving (25%, 0%) were more common in protocols than apps. Overall, our findings highlight empirically supported treatment elements that are poorly represented in current MH apps. The absence of several core treatment elements underscores the need for future research, including randomized trials testing the effectiveness of popular MH apps.",2328695987.0, Journal Article,2019
26,The effect of a brief online self-compassion versus cognitive restructuring intervention on trait social anxiety,"We compared two brief online interventions of 2-week duration for individuals with elevated levels of social anxiety. Participants were randomized to self-compassion or cognitive restructuring conditions (N = 119) and assessed across five assessment points, including a 5-week follow-up. Mediators and moderators of outcome were also examined. Both interventions led to significant decreases in social anxiety (d's ranged from 0.26 to 0.58), which were maintained and improved at follow-up (d's from baseline ranged from 0.53 to 0.80). Of those who were above social anxiety cut-off at baseline (&gt;75%), approximately 20% of participants in each group showed reliable and clinically significant changes in symptoms. No differences between the treatment conditions were found for social anxiety outcomes. Similarly, there were no measures that differentially mediated the effect of treatment condition on social anxiety. Furthermore, we did not find support for a theory-driven mediational model in which self-compassion reduced social anxiety through activation of the soothing system. Contrary to predictions and theory, neither self-criticism nor fear of self-compassion moderated the effect of the interventions. Although preliminary, the findings suggest that self-compassion techniques warrant further study as an additional means of reducing social anxiety.",2328695184.0, Journal Article,2019
27,Validating the use of a smartphone app for remote administration of a fear conditioning paradigm,"Fear conditioning models key processes related to the development, maintenance and treatment of anxiety disorders and is associated with group differences in anxiety. However, laboratory administration of tasks is time and cost intensive, precluding assessment in large samplesnecessary for the analysis of individual differences. This study introduces a newly developed smartphone app that delivers a fear conditioning paradigm remotely using a loud human scream as an aversive stimulus. Three groups of participants (total n = 152) took part in three studies involving a differential fear conditioning experiment to assess the reliability and validity of a smartphone administered fear conditioning paradigm. This comprised of fear acquisition, generalisation, extinction, and renewal phases during which online US-expectancy ratings were collected during every trial with evaluative ratings of negative affect at three time points. We show that smartphone app delivery of a fear conditioning paradigm results in a pattern of fear learning comparable to traditional laboratory delivery and is able to detect individual differences in performance that show comparable associations with anxiety to the prior group differences literature.",2328695000.0, Journal Article,2019
28,Acquisition and generalization of appetitive responding in obese and healthy weight females,"Findings of a few recent studies suggest that obesity is characterized by deficits in appetitive learning about food cues. This could point towards an increased tendency in obese individuals to overgeneralize appetitive responding to stimuli that resemble the conditioned food cue – possibly explaining frequent eating desires and overeating in obesity. The current study aimed to investigate whether obese individuals 1) indeed exhibit appetitive learning deficits and 2) show overgeneralization of conditioned appetitive responses. Obese and matched healthy-weight females (N = 85) completed a differential appetitive conditioning task using food as rewards. First, appetitive responding to a novel stimulus was learned (acquisition phase), after which stimuli with varying resemblance to the food-associated stimulus were presented (generalization phase). Cue-elicited eating expectancies, eating desires, stimulus evaluations, and actual food intake were examined. Results indicated successful acquisition of appetitive responding across all outcome measures. The acquired responses also generalized, indicating that generalization can function as an additional mechanism by which learned food cues can promote food consumption. The data further suggested that overweight and obesity are not characterized by appetitive learning deficits nor by overgeneralization, but that a subgroup of obese individuals (those high in trait anxiety) may be more prone to overgeneralization of appetitive responding.",2328694896.0, Journal Article,2019
29,Adolescent development and risk for the onset of social-emotional disorders: A review and conceptual model,"The adolescent developmental stage appears to be a sensitive period for the onset of several particular forms of mental disorder that are characterised by heightened emotionality and social sensitivity and are more common in females than males. We refer to these disorders (social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, eating disorders, major depression) collectively as the social-emotional disorders. The aim of this paper is to address an important question in the understanding of social-emotional disorders – why do these disorders commonly begin during adolescence? We present a conceptual model that describes some of the key changes that occur during adolescence and that addresses some hypothesised ways in which these changes might increase risk for the development of social-emotional disorders. An overview of the extant empirical literature and some possible directions for future research are suggested. The model points to interesting links between psycho-social risk factors that should highlight potentially fruitful directions for both psychopathology research and early intervention programs.",2328693340.0, Journal Article,2019
30,The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study: Online recruitment into the largest recontactable study of depression and anxiety,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common, debilitating and costly. These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors, but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety and broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research. Methods: The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (www.gladstudy.org.uk) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact. Results: Online recruitment was effective; 42,531 participants consented and 27,776 completed the questionnaire by end of July 2019. Participants' questionnaire data identified very high rates of recurrent depression, severe anxiety, and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of the sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the more educated, especially at younger ages. Discussion: This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes, and treatment for anxiety and depression.",2328691306.0, Journal Article,2019
31,Content-specific interpretation biases in clinically anxious children,"Cognitive theories of anxiety suggest that anxious children interpret negatively only those materials specifically related to the content of their anxiety. So far, there are only a few studies available that report on this postulated content-specificity of interpretation processes across different anxiety disorders in children, and most of them focused on social anxiety. Therefore, we examined interpretation bias and its content-specificity in a group of clinically anxious children between the ages of 6–12 years with various anxiety disorders, using an ""ambiguous scenarios"" task. Children were asked to finish scenarios that were related to either social threat, general threat, or separation threat. In total, 105 clinically anxious children, 21 control children and their mothers were assessed with the ADIS-C/P and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale. As expected, clinically anxious children provided significantly more negative endings to the scenarios than control children. Within the clinically anxious group, specific interpretation biases were found: Interpretation of scenarios related to social threat, general threat, and separation threat were only predicted by the children's self-reported levels of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and separation anxiety, respectively. These findings support the content-specificity hypothesis that clinically anxious children display interpretation biases that are specific to fear-relevant stimuli.",2299167682.0, Journal Article,2019
32,Genetic influences on treatment-seeking for common mental health problems in the UK biobank,"The majority of those who experience clinical anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in the population do not receive treatment. Studies investigating inequalities in treatment outcomes rarely consider that individuals respond differently to their experience of the environment. Much of our environment is under genetic influence, via our behaviour, whereby individuals actively select their experiences. If genes influence who seeks and receives treatment, selection bias will confound genomic studies of treatment response. Furthermore, if some individuals are at high genetic risk of needing but not commencing treatment, then greater efforts could be made to engage them. The role of common genetic variation on four lifetime treatment-seeking behaviours (treatment-seeking, treatment-receipt, self-help, self-medication with alcohol/drugs) was examined in participants of the UK Biobank (sample size range: 48,106 - 75,322). Treatment-related behaviours were only modestly heritable in these data. Nonetheless, genetic correlations reveal substantial genetic overlap between lifetime treatment-related behaviours and psychiatric disorders, symptoms and behavioural traits. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine genetic influences on treatment-related behaviours. Further work is required to determine whether genetic factors could be used alongside clinical, social and demographic factors to identify at risk groups and inform strategies which target early intervention.",2299167509.0, Journal Article,2019
33,Do sudden gains predict treatment outcome in social anxiety disorder? Findings from two randomized controlled trials,"Objective: Sudden gains (SGs) have been found to occur during randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Evidence is mixed whether SGs relate to treatment outcome in SAD. We examined SGs in two RCTs for SAD. Method: Study 1 (N = 68) examined SGs in individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and Study 2 (N = 100) compared SGs in group CBT and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Weekly ratings of social anxiety were used to calculate SGs. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale were completed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up to assess outcome. Results: In Study 1, 17.6% of participants experienced a SG. Participants with SGs started and ended treatment with lower social anxiety. SGs were not associated with greater decreases in social anxiety from pre-to posttreatment or 12-month follow-up. In Study 2, SGs occurred in 27% of participants and at comparable rates in MBSR and group CBT. SGs were not associated with changes in social anxiety during treatment in either condition. Conclusion: SGs occurred during treatment for SAD. In both RCTs, participants improved regardless of experiencing a SG, suggesting that SGs are not predictive of greater improvement during treatment for SAD.",2299166364.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
34,"Look out captain, I hear an ambiguous alien! A study of interpretation bias and anxiety in young children","There is convincing evidence that anxious children and adolescents are biased to interpret ambiguity in a negative way (Stuijfzand, Creswell, Field, Pearcey, &amp; Dodd, 2017). However, little research examines interpretation bias in children under eight years. This is due to existing measures of interpretation bias being inappropriate for young children. Consequently, we aimed to develop a new interpretation bias task for young children using tones. Children learnt to associate high tones with a 'happy alien' and low tones with an 'angry alien'. They were then asked to classify tones from the middle of the frequency range (ambiguous tones) as 'happy' or 'angry'. Corrugator muscle activity was recorded alongside behavioural responses. A community sample of 110 children aged 4–8 years, split into high and low anxious groups, completed the task. High anxious children were more likely to interpret the ambiguous tones as negative but this effect was small and only apparent after controlling for developmental factors. Corrugator activity aligned with behavioural responses for trained but not ambiguous tones. This is the first study to assess interpretation bias in young children using behavioural and physiological measures. Results indicate the task is developmentally appropriate and has potential utility for future research.",2299164633.0, Journal Article,2019
35,Incentive-based extinction of safety behaviors: Positive outcomes competing with aversive outcomes trigger fear-opposite action to prevent protection from fear extinction,"Maladaptive safety behavior maintains fear and anxiety by prohibiting inhibitory learning about the non-occurrence of feared outcomes (known as protection from extinction). Not engaging in safety behavior, however, requires to act opposite to fear-motivated behavioral tendencies. The initiation of such fear-opposite action by positive outcomes, which were in conflict with safety behavior, was tested. Following fear acquisition to a warning signal (CS+), participants acquired safety behavior to prevent the aversive outcome (n = 48). Next, safety behavior also prevented gaining rewards. In a control group (n = 50), neutral outcomes were presented to control for novelty effects of the second outcome. Subsequently, no aversive outcome occurred anymore. Phases with safety behavior were intermitted by phases without safety behavior being available to examine cognitive and physiological indicators of fear and anxiety. Without competing positive outcomes, safety behavior was frequently executed, persisted in absence of the aversive outcome, and prohibited extinction learning. Positive outcomes clearly reduced safety behavior despite equal levels of acquired fear. This enabled fear extinction as soon as the aversive outcome was absent. Importantly, this extinction learning resulted in attenuated fear and anxiety responses when safety behavior became unavailable. Post-hoc findings indicated that the mere anticipation of positive outcomes slightly reduced safety behavior. Thus, competing positive outcomes triggered fear-opposite action that prevented persistent safety behavior and protection from extinction.",2299164442.0, Journal Article,2019
36,Reducing negative stimulus valence does not attenuate the return of fear: Two counterconditioning experiments,"Exposure-based treatment for anxiety disorders is effective for many patients, but relapse is not uncommon. One predictor of the return of fear is the negative valence of fear-relevant stimuli. The aim of the current experiments was to examine whether counterconditioning with positive film clips reduces this negative stimulus valence as well as the return of fear, compared to standard extinction training and to an extinction training with non-contingent exposure to the positive film clips. Participants were 87 students in Experiment 1 (three-day paradigm), and 90 students in Experiment 2 (one-day paradigm). They first underwent a differential acquisition phase, in which one of three pictures was paired with an electric shock. They were then randomly allocated to one of the three intervention groups. Afterwards, they underwent a test phase in which pictures were presented without shock (to measure spontaneous recovery of fear), which was followed by unsignaled shocks to induce reinstatement of extinguished fear. Outcome variables were self-reported stimulus valence, shock expectancy, skin conductance, and fear-potentiated startle. In both experiments, counterconditioning decreased negative stimulus valence, relative to the other interventions, but it did not reduce spontaneous fear recovery or fear reinstatement. Overall, our findings do not support the notion that counterconditioning reduces return of fear.",2317027064.0, Journal Article,2019
37,Fear conditioning and extinction in anxious and non-anxious youth: A meta-analysis,"Fear conditioning and extinction have been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Most fear conditioning studies have been conducted with adult samples and the few published developmental studies in clinically anxious youth have yielded inconsistent results. The aim of the current review was to use meta-analysis to examine possible differences in fear conditioning and extinction in clinically anxious and non-anxious youth. Seven fear conditioning studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 160 clinically anxious and 166 non-anxious youth. All the studies included in the meta-analysis used a differential conditioning paradigm with at least one or more of the primary dependent variables: self-reported fear, skin conductance response (SCR) and fear potentiated startle (FPS). Similar differential fear acquisition and extinction patterns were observed in anxious and non-anxious individuals. However, anxious youth exhibited stronger fear responses to individual stimuli compared to their non-anxious counterparts. Results in clinically anxious youth resemble those reported in previous studies with clinically anxious adults. Importantly, due to the small number of fear learning studies conducted among youth, these results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed so as to better understand fear acquisition and extinction processes in developmental populations. In addition, future studies should focus on other fear-related learning processes such as differences in return of fear, retrieval of fear memory and more subtle differences in fear generalization.",2317026889.0, Journal Article,2019
38,A randomized controlled trial of a bidirectional cultural adaptation of cognitive behavior therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders,"Background: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) programs with ethnic and cultural sensitivity are scarce. This study was the first randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders using bidirectional cultural adaptation. Methods: The Japanese Anxiety Children/Adolescents Cognitive Behavior Therapy program (JACA-CBT) was developed based on existing evidence-based CBT for anxious youth and optimized through feedback from clinicians in the indigenous cultural group. Fifty-one children and adolescents aged 8–15 with anxiety disorders were randomly allocated to either a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT: 122.08 days, SD = 48.15) or a wait-list control condition (WLC: 70.00 days, SD = 11.01). Participants were assessed at pre-treatment and post-treatment as well as 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment (92.88 days, SD = 17.72 and 189.42 days, SD = 25.06) using a diagnostic interview, self-report measures of anxiety, depression, cognitive errors, and a parent-report measure of anxiety. Results: A significant difference was found between the CBT and WLC at post-treatment, specifically 50% of participants in the treatment condition were free from their principal diagnoses compared to 12% in the wait-list condition, χ2 (1, N = 51) = 8.55, η2 = 0.17, p &lt; .01. In addition, participants in the treatment condition showed significant improvement in clinical severity and child-self reported depression, F (1, 49) = 12.38, p &lt; .001, F (1, 47.60) = 5.95, p &lt; .05. At post-treatment, Hedge's g between the conditions was large for clinical severity, 1.00 (95% CI = 0.42–1.58), and moderate for the self-report anxiety scale, 0.43 (0.19–1.04), two depression scales, 0.39 (0.22–1.00), 0.48 (0.14–1.09), and the cognitive errors scale, 0.38 (0.24–0.99). Finally, significant improvements in diagnostic status were evident at the 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments when combining the CBT and WLC, ps &lt; .001. Conclusion: The current results support the transportability of CBT and the efficacy of a bidirectional, culturally adapted cognitive behavior therapy in an underrepresented population.",2317026663.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
39,Attentional bias modification in social anxiety: Effects on the N2pc component,"Several meta-analyses to date have confirmed the efficacy of attentional bias modification (ABM) in shifting reaction times away from threatening stimuli, reducing anxiety symptoms, and buffering against stressor vulnerability. The reliability of reaction time differences, however, has been found to show unacceptable psychometric properties. In this study, we tested the impact of an extensive Dot-Probe ABM procedure, consisting of close to 7000 trials, concurrently with behavioral and electrophysiological measures within a large sample of over 100 highly socially anxious participants. Results indicated that the N2pc component demonstrates superior internal consistency and more statistical power in detecting attentional biases and their modification than reaction time (RT) differences. RTs were neither indicative of an attentional bias before ABM nor of a modification over time. In contrast, the N2pc indexed both an initial attentional preference for threatening stimuli and an alteration of this relationship after training. Outcomes were not specific for attentional training away from threat but also occurred in the no-contingency control procedure, casting doubt on the theoretic underpinnings of ABM. Electrophysiological measures are an important complement to the ABM literature and should be further utilized to assess attentional biases with excellent reliability.",2317025362.0, Journal Article,2019
40,Feasibility and dissemination of a computerized home-based treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A randomized clinical trial,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a prevalent, impairing, and undertreated psychiatric disorder. We examined if a home-based computerized treatment program can feasibly be delivered and successfully treat GAD symptoms. Using a randomized control trial, we compared three active groups receiving computerized sequenced Attention Bias Modification (ABM) followed by Applied Relaxation psychoeducation (AR-pe), the reversed sequence of AR-pe and ABM, and a simultaneous ABM and AR-pe group to an assessment only control group. The participants comprised 169 adults with a diagnosis of GAD. We asked participants to complete as many as twenty-four 30-min sessions of an at-home computerized treatment program over 12 weeks. The control group received 24 brief assessment questionnaires as well as assessments of attention bias. Results from intent-to-treat analyses show faster rate of improvement for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) over time in groups that received active training in contrast to the clinical monitoring (CM) control group. Follow-up analyses revealed that both sequenced groups improved in anxiety when compared to the control group, while the simultaneous group did not outperform the control group. Results suggest that sequenced delivery of ABM and AR, may be a viable home-based treatment option for individuals with GAD who have limited access to resources or are otherwise unable to seek available treatments that require engagement outside of the home.",2317025331.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
41,A randomized controlled trial of unguided internet cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism in adolescents: Impact on risk for eating disorders,"Objective: Perfectionism is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of eating disorders. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of unguided Internet cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism (ICBT-P) as a treatment and prevention for perfectionism and symptoms of eating disorders, anxiety, depression and self-esteem in female adolescents. Method: Young women (N = 94, 14–19 years) who self-identified as having difficulties with perfectionism but did not have a clinical eating disorder diagnosis were recruited. Participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: unguided ICBT-P, unguided ICBT for nonspecific stress management (ICBT-S), or waitlist control. Results: All analyses were intent-to-treat. ICBT-P resulted in the most favorable outcomes at post-treatment and 3- and 6-months follow-up. ICBT-P was superior to control on all outcome measures at 3- and 6-months and superior to ICBT-S on all outcomes over most time points (ds = 0.13–0.94). Clinical significance analysis demonstrated that the treatment prevented symptom increases over 6-month follow-up, with ICBT-P superior to ICBT-S in prevention of clinical perfectionism and depressive symptoms, and ICBT-P superior to waitlist control in prevention of eating disorder symptoms. There was relatively high attrition, although there were no differences in attrition between the groups at 3- and 6-month follow-up and rates were commensurate with other Internet interventions. Discussion: The findings support unguided ICBT-P as a useful target for preventing eating disorder and associated symptoms in female youth who self-identify as perfectionistic.",2317025156.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
42,The online treatment of suicidal ideation: A randomised controlled trial of an unguided web-based intervention,"Suicide is a major public health issue, and treatment of suicidal thoughts may contribute to its prevention. Provision of online treatment of suicidal ideation may reduce barriers that suicidal individuals experience in face-to-face treatment. We therefore aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based intervention targeting a reduction of suicidal ideation. We carried out a two-arm, parallel-design, randomised controlled trial in the general population in Flanders (Belgium) (registered as NCT03209544). Participants who were 18 years or older and experienced suicidal ideation were included. The intervention group (n = 365) received access to the unguided web-based intervention, and the control group (n = 359) was placed on a waitlist. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Participants reported high levels of suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety at baseline. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group experienced a significant decline in suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety both at post-test and at follow-up. An important limitation of the study was a high dropout rate, in particular in the intervention group. Our findings suggest that the online self-help intervention was more effective in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide-related symptoms than a waitlist control in a severely affected population. It can help in filling the gap between crisis help and face-to-face treatment.",2256514576.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
43,Efficacy of an internet and app-based gratitude intervention in reducing repetitive negative thinking and mechanisms of change in the intervention's effect on anxiety and depression: Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been identified as a transdiagnostic process that is involved in various forms of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled trial compared a 5-week internet and app-based gratitude intervention (intervention group; IG) with adherence-focused guidance against a wait list control group (WLG) in reducing RNT in a sample with elevated RNT. Method A total of 260 individuals were randomized to either the IG or the WLG. Data were collected at baseline (T1), within one week post intervention (T2), and at three (3-MFU) and six-months of follow-up (6-MFU; for IG only). The primary outcome was RNT. Secondary outcomes included other mental health outcomes and resilience factors. Results Participants of the IG reported significantly less RNT at T2 (d = 0.61) and 3-MFU (d = 0.75) as compared to WLG. Improvements were sustained until 6-MFU. Significant, small to moderate effect sizes were identified for most secondary outcomes at T2 and 3-MFU. Furthermore, results of mediation analyses revealed that the gratitude intervention exerts its effect on anxiety and depression by reducing the risk factor of RNT, while the mediating role of resilience was less clear. Conclusions The gratitude intervention investigated in this study was found to be effective in reducing RNT. Gratitude interventions might affect mental health by two parallel pathways: increasing resources and reducing risk factors.",2256513480.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
44,An idiographic statistical approach to clinical hypothesis testing for routine psychotherapy: A case study,"In order to develop more targeted, efficient, and effective psychotherapeutic interventions, calls have been made in the literature for greater use of idiographic hypothesis testing. Idiographic analyses can provide useful information regarding mechanisms of change within individuals over time during treatment. However, it remains unclear how clinicians might utilize idiographic statistical analyses during routine treatment to test clinical hypotheses, and in turn, guide treatment. We present an idiographic statistical framework for clinical hypothesis testing with routine treatment data that enables clinicians to examine a) whether the client's symptoms and hypothesized mechanisms change over time, b) whether trajectories of change reflect the timing of interventions, c) whether mechanisms predict subsequent symptoms, and d) whether relationships exist between multiple mechanisms, symptoms, or other treatment-related constructs over time. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for clinical hypothesis testing by applying it to routine treatment data collected from a 56 year-old male who presented with a combination of anger problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. We discuss how results from analyses can inform the case-formulation and guide clinical decision-making. We aim to make these methods more accessible by providing an online platform where clinicians can enter client data, test their clinical hypotheses using idiographic analyses, and utilize the results to disseminate their findings.",2246257291.0, Journal Article,2019
45,"Mindfulness and associations with symptoms of insomnia, anxiety and depression in early adulthood: A twin and sibling study","This study investigated associations between mindfulness and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Mindfulness was disaggregated into five subscales: ‘nonreactivity to inner experience’, ‘observing’, ‘acting with awareness’, ‘describing’ and ‘nonjudging of inner experience’. Twin models were used to examine genetic and environmental influences on mindfulness, symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety and on their associations. Data came from a longitudinal twin/sibling study (G1219) comprising 862 individuals (age range 22–32 years, 66% females). Less mindfulness was associated with greater symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety (r = .22-.48). Of the mindfulness subscales, ‘nonjudging of inner experience’ was most strongly associated with the other traits. Overall mindfulness was largely influenced by non-shared environmental factors (E = .72) although familial influences played a role for overall mindfulness, as well as for the ‘acting with awareness’ and ‘describing’ subscales. The genetic correlations between overall mindfulness and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety ranged from .32 to .75 (but were non-significant), while the shared environmental correlations ranged from −.78 to .79 (also non-significant). The non-shared environmental influences between these three variables were moderately, significantly correlated (rE = .21-.55).",2246257282.0, Journal Article,2019
46,Automated virtual reality exposure therapy for spider phobia vs. in-vivo one-session treatment: A randomized non-inferiority trial,"This study compared the efficacy of a technician-assisted single-session virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for the treatment of spider phobia featuring low-cost consumer-available hardware and novel automated software to gold-standard in-vivo one-session treatment (OST), using a parallel group randomized non-inferiority design. Method Participants (N = 100) were randomized to VRET and OST arms. Assessors blinded to treatment allocation evaluated participants at pre- and post-treatment as well follow-up (3 and 12 months) using a behavioral approach test (BAT) and self-rated fear of spider, anxiety, depression and quality-of-life scales. A maximum post-treatment difference of 2-points on the BAT qualified as non-inferiority margin. Results Linear mixed models noted large, significant reductions in behavioral avoidance and self-reported fear in both groups at post-treatment, with VRET approaching the strong treatment benefits of OST over time. Non-inferiority was identified at 3- and 12- months follow-up but was significantly worse until 12-months. There was no significant difference on a questionnaire measuring negative effects. Conclusions Automated VRET efficaciously reduced spider phobia symptoms in the short-term and was non-inferior to in-vivo exposure therapy in the long-term. VRET effectiveness trials are warranted to evaluate real-world benefits and non-specific therapeutic factors accruing from the presence of a technician during treatment.

47,Intolerance of uncertainty is associated with reduced attentional inhibition in the absence of direct threat,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional tendency to find uncertain situations aversive. There is limited understanding as to how IU may bias attention to uncertainty in the absence of direct threat. Here we examined the extent to which uncertain distractors and individual differences in IU impacted eye-movements during an attentional capture task. Participants were asked to move their eyes towards a target, whilst ignoring an array of distractors. An additional distractor could appear before or after the target in a near or far location from the target. We observed high IU individuals to display fewer first saccades to the target in all conditions. The results were specific to IU, over trait anxiety. Overall, these results suggest that IU modulates attention to uncertainty in the absence of direct threat. Such findings inform the conceptualisation of IU and its relation to psychopathology.",2246254873.0, Journal Article,2019
48,The unique and conditional effects of interoceptive exposure in the treatment of anxiety: A functional analysis,"Interoceptive exposure (IE; exposure focused on anxiety about somatic sensations) is a well-established component of treatments for panic disorder (PD), but little is known about the specificity of its effects or individual response patterns resulting from this intervention. This study investigated the utility of IE in the treatment of PD with claustrophobia, examining its mechanisms in isolation and in combination with situational exposure. Ten adults with PD and claustrophobia were treated with a flexible single-case approach. Participants received up to 6 sessions of IE; nonresponders received up to 6 additional sessions of IE combined with situational exposure. Hypotheses were: 1) Reductions in anxiety sensitivity (AS) and fearful expectancies would coincide with the introduction of IE and reach clinical significance by the end of the IE phase; 2) Reductions in claustrophobic avoidance would coincide with the introduction of situational exposure; 3) Fear extinction and distress habituation would occur in both intervention phases. Hypothesis 1 was not supported: Five participants experienced a reduction in AS and six participants experienced reduced expectancies of feared outcomes, but this did not reliably coincide with introduction of IE. Hypothesis 2 was supported: Claustrophobic avoidance improved more after the addition of situational exposure. Hypothesis 3 was supported: Habituation and fear extinction, whereby distress and expectancies of feared outcomes decreased and fear tolerance increased, were observed in response to IE delivered alone and in combination with situational exposure. IE appeared more helpful to participants who were fearful of the physical consequences of somatic sensations (e.g., heart attack) vs. other consequences (e.g., embarrassment). The observed variability in response to IE suggests a need for individualized implementation of this intervention.",2242775780.0, Journal Article,2019
49,A preliminary naturalistic clinical case series study of the feasibility and impact of interoceptive exposure for eating disorders,"Recent literature suggests that individuals with eating disorders demonstrate altered interoceptive processing, which may relate to the maintenance of symptoms and thus represent a salient treatment target. Adopting treatment techniques effective for other conditions characterized by disturbed interoceptive processes (e.g., anxiety disorders) could aid in improving the outcomes of psychological interventions for eating disorders. The current investigation was a naturalistic case series (N = 4) that examined adjunctive interoceptive exposure (IE) for eating disorders, with an emphasis on evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of this intervention on anxiety sensitivity, interoceptive deficits, and eating disorder symptoms. Results suggested that all individuals who received 4 consecutive sessions of traditional and eating-disorder-specific IE exercises demonstrated decreases in interoceptive deficits and subjective distress. Results for anxiety sensitivity and eating disorder symptoms were encouraging yet more mixed. Findings also generally suggested that the intervention was feasible and acceptable, yet between-session practice compliance varied considerably among participants. Overall, we describe how IE may be used to target interoceptive deficits in eating disorders and provide preliminary evidence of how this may be accomplished within naturalistic intensive outpatient settings.",2242774606.0, Journal Article,2019
50,Isolating the effect of opposite action in borderline personality disorder: A laboratory-based alternating treatment design,"Evaluating the unique effects of each component included in treatment protocols for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a necessary step in refining these interventions so that they only include skills that drive therapeutic change. One strategy, included in several prominent treatments for BPD, is acting opposite to emotion-driven behavioral urges; engaging in behaviors that are inconsistent with an experienced emotion is thought to lead to reductions in its intensity, though this has not been empirically-tested. The present study was a single-case experiment, specifically an alternating treatment design, that explored the effects of a laboratory-based adaptation of opposite action (versus acting consistent) on emotional intensity. Sixteen individuals with BPD attended six laboratory sessions in which they were instructed to act consistent with an induced emotion in half the sessions and opposite in the other half. Participants were randomly assigned to the specific emotion (i.e., anxiety, sadness, anger, and shame/guilt) that was induced across all study sessions. Findings from visual inspection and percentage of non-overlapping data suggest that acting opposite (versus consistent) leads to significantly greater decreases in emotional intensity for those in the sadness and guilt/shame conditions, but not those in the anxiety or anger conditions. Possible interpretations of these findings are presented. Replication outside of the laboratory context is necessary to draw further conclusions of the clinical implications of these findings.",2242774586.0, Journal Article,2019
51,Intraindividual change in anxiety sensitivity and alcohol use severity 12-months following smoking cessation treatment,"Although past work has documented reduction in alcohol use severity among smokers following smoking cessation treatment, little is known regarding factors associated with this reduction. The current study sought to examine relations between trajectories of change in anxiety sensitivity and non-targeted alcohol use severity from baseline to one year following smoking cessation treatment. Individuals (n = 386) were adult daily smokers engaged in a smoking cessation treatment study. Measures of alcohol use severity and anxiety sensitivity were collected at baseline as well as 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-treatment. Latent growth curve modelling was used to estimate intercepts and slopes. Anxiety sensitivity (M = −0.87 95% CI [-1.19, −0.54], p &lt; 0.001) and alcohol use severity (M = −0.22 95% CI [-0.38, −0.06], p = 0.006) each significantly reduced over time. Reductions in anxiety sensitivity were strongly associated with reductions in alcohol use over time (r = 0.63, 95% CI [0.18, 1.09], p = 0.006). Changes in anxiety sensitivity positively correlated with changes in alcohol use severity. Examinations of means suggest that anxiety sensitivity reduced earlier whereas alcohol use severity reduced later in the follow-up period. If replicated establishing temporal precedence of change, these results could implicate anxiety sensitivity reduction as one avenue towards reduced alcohol use severity, among smokers.",2218300989.0, Journal Article,2019
52,Fear of negative and positive evaluation and reactivity to social-evaluative videos in social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is marked by persistent fear of being scrutinized by others. This and most diagnostic symptoms relate to some form of fear of negative evaluation (FNE). More recent accounts of SAD, such as the Bivalent Fear of Evaluation Model, however, complement FNE with fear of positive evaluation (FPE), described as distress and avoidance of positive feedback. An explicit test of the incremental validity of FPE in discriminating SAD patients from controls – over and on top of the explanatory power of FPE – is currently missing and generally, well controlled laboratory experiments with positive and negative social stimuli in this patient group are rare. To fill this gap, we exposed 35 patients with SAD and healthy controls (HCs) to short social-evaluative video clips with actors expressing negative and positive as well as neutral statements while recording reactivity on experiential measures (valence, arousal, and approval ratings) as well as on facial electromyography and electrocardiography. In addition, participants completed questionnaire measures of FNE and FPE. Results revealed that FPE questionnaire scores as well as experiential (valence and appreciation) and electromyographical reactivity measures to positive videos improved prediction of group membership beyond the predictive power of FNE questionnaires scores and reactivity to negative videos. Results document the importance of FPE to more fully characterize and understand social anxiety and SAD. Implications include amendments to future diagnostic criteria, theoretical models, and treatment approaches for SAD.",2218300806.0, Journal Article,2019
53,Peritraumatic unconditioned and conditioned responding explains sex differences in intrusions after analogue trauma,"Higher prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women than men may be explained by sex differences in fear learning processes. Initial evidence points to elevated unconditioned and conditioned fear responding as well as to elevated state anxiety in women as potential peritraumatic mechanisms. Using the “conditioned-intrusion-paradigm”, which combines differential fear conditioning with the trauma-film paradigm, neutral sounds were presented as predictors of the occurrence (CS+) or non-occurrence (CS-) of highly aversive films. Intrusions were elicited by these sounds in the laboratory after conditioning and naturalistic intrusions were assessed in daily-life on subsequent days. Compared to men (n = 62), women (n = 60) reported more intrusions and associated distress following analogue trauma. Sex differences in intrusive symptoms were mediated by a) higher unconditioned trauma responding, b) slowed extinction of differential CS valence ratings, and c) elevated state anxiety increase across conditioning in women. Secondary analyses revealed that state anxiety was the strongest mediator, followed by slowed extinction learning. Mediation models were unrelated to sex differences in trait anxiety or depressive symptoms. Thus, associative (extinction learning) and non-associative (state anxiety, trauma responding) mechanisms contribute to sex differences in intrusive symptoms after analogue trauma and might add to the heightened vulnerability to PTSD in women.",2218299667.0, Journal Article,2019
54,I feel safe when i know: Contingency instruction promotes threat extinction in high intolerance of uncertainty individuals,"Extinction-resistant threat is considered to be a central feature of pathological anxiety. Reduced threat extinction is observed in individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Here we sought to determine whether contingency instructions could alter the course of threat extinction for individuals high in IU. We tested this hypothesis in two identical experiments (Exp 1 n = 60, Exp 2 n = 82) where we recorded electrodermal activity during threat acquisition with partial reinforcement, and extinction. Participants were split into groups based on extinction instructions (instructed, uninstructed) and IU score (low, high). All groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to learned threat versus safety cues during threat acquisition, indicative of threat conditioning. In both experiments, only the uninstructed high IU groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to the learned threat versus safety cue during threat extinction. These findings suggest that uncertain threat during extinction maintains conditioned responding in individuals high in IU.",2218299457.0, Journal Article,2019

56,Open trial of a personalized modular treatment for mood and anxiety,"Psychosocial treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are generally effective, however, a number of treated individuals fail to demonstrate clinically-significant change. Consistent with the decades-old aim to identify ‘what works for whom,’ personalized and precision treatments have become a recent area of interest in medicine and psychology. The present study followed the recommendations of Fisher (2015) to employ a personalized modular model of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Employing the algorithms provided by Fernandez, Fisher, and Chi (2017), the present study collected intensive repeated measures data prior to therapy in order to perform person-specific factor analysis and dynamic factor modeling. The results of these analyses were then used to generated personalized modular treatment plans on a person-by-person basis. Thirty-two participants completed therapy. The average number of sessions was 10.38. Hedges g's for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were 2.33 and 1.62, respectively. The change per unit time was g = .24/session for the HRSD and g = 0.17/session for the HARS. The current open trial provides promising data in support of personalization, modularization, and idiographic research paradigms.",2218299109.0, Journal Article,2019
57,Improving Access to psychological therapies for people with severe mental illness (IAPT-SMI): Lessons from the South London and Maudsley psychosis demonstration site,"Implementation of evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) remains low in routine services. The United Kingdom Improving Access to Psychological Therapies for people with Severe Mental Illness (IAPT-SMI) initiative aimed to address this issue. The project evaluated whether existing services could improve access to CBTp and demonstrate effectiveness using a systematic approach to therapy provision and outcome monitoring (in a similar way to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) model for people with anxiety and depression). We report the clinical outcomes and key learning points from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust IAPT-SMI demonstration site for psychosis. Additional funding enabled increased therapist capacity within existing secondary care community mental health services. Self-reported wellbeing and psychotic symptom outcomes were assessed, alongside service use and social/occupational functioning. Accepted referrals/year increased by 89% (2011/12: n = 106/year; 2012–2015: n = 200/year); 90% engaged (attended ≥5 sessions) irrespective of ethnicity, age and gender. The assessment protocol proved feasible, and pre-post outcomes (n = 280) showed clinical improvements and reduced service use, with medium effects. We conclude that, with appropriate service structure, investment allocated specifically for competent therapy provision leads to increased and effective delivery of CBTp. Our framework is replicable in other settings and can inform the wider implementation of psychological therapies for psychosis.",2218297460.0, Journal Article,2019
58,An analysis of within-treatment change trajectories in valued activity in relation to treatment outcomes following interdisciplinary Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for adults with chronic pain,"A key issue in chronic pain treatment concerns changes necessary for reduced pain-related distress and disability. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavior change approach, theorizes several important treatment processes. Increased engagement in valued activities appears highly relevant as previous work has indicated it is related to current and future functioning and to treatment outcomes. This study sought to examine change trajectory in valued activity over the course of an interdisciplinary program of ACT and its relation to outcomes at treatment conclusion and three-month follow-up (N = 242). Latent change trajectories of valued activity were assessed weekly over four weeks of treatment and analyzed via latent growth curve and growth mixture modeling. A single latent trajectory with an increasing linear slope was indicated. Overall, slope of change in valued activity was predictive of improvement in psychosocial outcomes at post-treatment, including psychosocial disability, depression, pain anxiety, and discrepancy between values importance and success. Slope was not related to change in pain intensity or physical disability at post-treatment, nor was it related to change in any variable at follow-up. Findings are discussed in relation to the ACT model, in that support was provided in relation to post-treatment improvements for psychosocial variables.",2202791478.0, Journal Article,2019
59,Integrated cognitive behavioral therapy for comorbid cannabis use and anxiety disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is the most common illicit substance use disorder and individuals with CUD have high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbidity between CUD and anxiety disorders is of public health relevance given that although motivation enhancement therapy (MET) combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for CUD, outcomes are worse for patients with elevated anxiety. The current study tested the acceptability and efficacy of the integration of a transdiagnostic anxiety CBT (i.e., treatment of patients with any anxiety disorder) with MET-CBT (integrated cannabis and anxiety reduction treatment, or ICART) for CUD compared to MET-CBT alone. Treatment-seeking cannabis users (56.4% male, M age = 23.2, 63.3% non-Hispanic White) with CUD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to ICART (n = 27) or MET-CBT (n = 28). Patients in the ICART condition attended significantly more treatment sessions than those in the MET-CBT condition. Patients in the ICART condition were more likely to be abstinent post-treatment than those in MET-CBT. Further, treatment produced decreases in cannabis use and related problems. Notably, therapy type did not moderate the impact of treatment on frequency of use and related problems. Together, these data suggest that ICART may be at least as efficacious as a gold-standard psychosocial CUD treatment, MET-CBT, for a difficult-to-treat subpopulation of cannabis users.",2202788943.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
60,Examining links between cannabis potency and mental and physical health outcomes,"Cannabis use is associated with unwanted health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, poor sleep hygiene, and disrupted cognitive functioning. However, research to date has not been able to disentangle the complexities of these relations, leaving behavioral health service providers lacking clear direction for treatment. A limiting factor may be the common practices for cannabis use assessment. Cannabis use is typically assessed by frequency, even though to estimate the amount of psychoactive compounds ingested potency, quantity, and route of administration should also be assessed. This study, one of the first of its kind, takes an important step in assessing cannabis use by studying the link between cannabis potency and behavioral health (i.e., physical and mental health) outcomes. Self-reported data were analyzed using the New Statistics, which focuses on effect sizes and confidence intervals, rather than null hypothesis significance testing. Findings were inconsistent, with some positive, some negative, and some trivial associations across four domains (i.e., demographic variables, cannabis use variables, mental health, and physical health). The most valuable discovery was the importance of method of administration in understanding the link between potency and health. We observed a “potency valley” (i.e., a range of potencies for which products were not available) between flower potencies and concentrate potencies. Further, collapsing potency data across flower and concentrated cannabis obscured important relations between cannabis potency and behavioral health outcomes. Findings suggest that to more fully understand the relation between cannabis potency and behavioral health outcomes, researchers should examine potency separately across routes of administration.",2202787859.0, Journal Article,2019
61,The effects of exercise on transdiagnostic treatment targets: A meta-analytic review,"Background The present study meta-analytically reviewed the effects of exercise on four transdiagnostic treatment targets: anxiety sensitivity (AS), distress tolerance (DT), stress reactivity (SR), and general self-efficacy (GSE). Methods We conducted systematic searches of peer-reviewed studies in bibliographical databases (Cochrane Library, psychINFO, PubMed) before April 1, 2018. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the effect of exercise on AS, DT, SR, or GSE using at least one validated outcome instrument in a sample of adolescents (≥13 years old) or adults were selected. We employed a meta-analysis of effects using random-effects pooling modeling for each treatment target. Results The systematic search yielded 28 RCTs meeting eligibility criteria. Exercise interventions had a large effect on reducing AS (six studies, Hedges's g = 0.72, p = .001), a medium effect on increasing GSE (eight studies, Hedges's g = 0.59, p &lt; .001), and a small effect on reducing SR (ten studies, Hedges's g = 0.32, p &lt; .001). Evidence from four studies suggested that exercise interventions had a small but non-significant effect on increasing DT (Hedges's g = 0.21, p = .26). Conclusions This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence exercise can engage certain transdiagnostic targets. Further research is required to optimize exercise intervention parameters to achieve the strongest effects on these important mechanistic variables.",2202787822.0, Journal Article,2019
62,Predictive value of attentional bias for the recurrence of depression: A 4-year prospective study in remitted depressed individuals,"Previous research showed that individuals who were remitted from a depressive disorder displayed heightened attention towards negative adjectives (e.g., worthless). We tested if this attentional bias (AB) is predictive of future recurrence of depressive episodes and/or having depressive symptoms at 2- and 4-year follow-up. We used a longitudinal approach within the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and selected participants who were remitted from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 918). AB was measured with a verbal Exogenous Cueing Task; using 2 presentation times (500 and 1250 ms) and 3 stimulus types (negative, positive, neutral). Over 4 years, we prospectively assessed recurrence of depressive episodes and depressive symptomatology after participants completed the ECT. Diagnosis of depressive disorder was measured with clinical rating-scales and self-report questionnaires. A heightened probability of recurrence was neither associated with (heightened) AB for negative nor with (lowered) AB for positive adjectives. Thus, the findings do not support the view that an AB toward negative stimuli or away from positive stimuli plays a critical role in the recurrence of depression.",2202791500.0, Journal Article,2019
63,Reductions in anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns prospectively mitigate trauma symptom development,"Identifying a malleable pre-trauma risk marker for posttraumatic stress is crucial to preventing symptom development among at-risk individuals. One such candidate is anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC), which represents the fear of psychological incapacitation due to anxious arousal. While the extant literature suggests that applying ASCC interventions prior to trauma exposure should mitigate development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), this has not been formally tested. We examined whether individuals randomized to receive a Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST; n = 44) prior to a trauma film paradigm would report lower film-specific PTSS after one week compared to individuals randomized to a physical health education training control condition (n = 47). Results revealed that post-intervention ASCC and week-one PTSS were both lower among the CAST condition, and reductions in ASCC mediated the relationship between intervention condition and follow-up PTSS. The current study demonstrated that reducing ASCC prior to an analog trauma can mitigate the development of PTSS. This is critical for establishing ASCC as a causal risk factor for PTSS and encourages the use of ASCC interventions in samples at-risk for trauma exposure.",2178565804.0, Journal Article,2019
64,Gain through pain: Augmenting in vivo exposure with enhanced attention to internal experience leads to increased resilience to distress,"Recent variants of exposure therapy ask clients to directly engage with the distress associated with avoided experiences in order to become more resilient to future anxiety-provoking situations. In this study, we consider how this engagement impacts behavioral willingness. Forty-eight participants with high fear of cockroaches completed in vivo exposures while either mindfully attending externally to the feared object (Ext), or to both the object and their internal distress (Int/Ext). While both groups showed improvement, behavioral, subjective and physiological measures revealed different patterns of change. Immediate testing showed that participants in the Ext condition improved more in subjective distress, with no other differences between groups. A second testing a week later in an ecologically valid environment showed that participants the Int/Ext intervention continued to improve behaviorally, regardless of their reported subjective discomfort. These findings highlight the importance of explicit engagement with distress during exposures, that forego immediate subjective relief for long-term behavioral improvement.",2178562450.0, Journal Article,2019
65,A randomized controlled trial of the judicious use of safety behaviors during exposure therapy,"Safety behaviors-actions performed to prevent, escape from, or reduce the severity of perceived threat-are typically eliminated during exposure therapy for clinical anxiety. Yet some experts have called for the strategic and “judicious use” of safety behaviors during exposure to improve treatment acceptability/tolerability without diminishing its efficacy. Empirical findings regarding this debate are mixed and existing work is subject to several methodological limitations. The current randomized controlled trial incorporated longitudinal design and multimethod assessment to compare the efficacy of traditional exposure with the elimination of safety behaviors (E/ESB) and exposure with judiciously used safety behaviors (E/JU). Adults with clinically significant spider fear (N = 60) were randomized to four twice-weekly sessions of E/ESB or E/JU. Self-report and behavioral measures were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up. Participants exhibited large effects on all measures from pretreatment to posttreatment, with no change from posttreatment to follow-up. There were no significant group differences in treatment outcome or treatment acceptability/tolerability. Exploratory analyses were used to compare behavioral and inhibitory learning processes between conditions. Clinical implications, study limitations, and future directions are discussed in terms of inhibitory learning theory.",2179663409.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
66,Predictors of behavioral avoidance during respiratory symptom provocation,"Excessive anxiety and avoidance during provocation of body symptoms are core features of anxiety-related disorders and might contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders. Previous studies examined psychological (anxiety sensitivity, fear of suffocation and trait anxiety) and biobehavioral (breath-holding time) predictors of reported anxiety during symptom provocation. However, the role of these predictors on avoidance of feared body symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, the present work aimed at investigating the main and interactive effects of psychological and biobehavioral variables in predicting avoidance during provocation of dyspnea that successively increased in severity. 28 of 69 participants prematurely terminated the provocation sequence, thus preventing further progression of symptom provocation. Logistic regressions revealed that higher anxiety sensitivity and lower breath-holding time were significantly associated with avoidance during exposure. Suffocation fear and trait anxiety were not related to avoidance. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between breath-holding time and anxiety sensitivity in predicting avoidance. Participants with a lower breath-holding time showed more avoidance behavior when reporting high as compared to low anxiety sensitivity. The data suggest that anxiety sensitivity and breath-holding time increase the risk to show avoidance and thus might contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders.",2179661718.0, Journal Article,2019
67,The need for standards in the design of differential fear conditioning and extinction experiments in youth: A systematic review and recommendations for research on anxiety,"Fear extinction studies in youth have yielded mixed results due to developmental processes and variations in design, methodology and dependent measures. This systematic review focused on studies with healthy youth between 2 and 17 years of age to identify experimental parameters of studies documenting extinction effects. Thirty-five studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes emerged (a) some studies employed parameters and task demands that are complex and require active participant involvement whereas others involved simple stimulus configurations and passive participant involvement, and (b) variation exists among dependent measures in units of measurement, timing and type of measurement. The review identified that studies using geometric shape conditioned stimuli (CS) paired with a tone unconditioned stimulus (US) (e.g., metal scraping on slate), as well as face CSs with a scream US produced the most reliable extinction effects, although the latter combination may be associated with higher drop-out than shape CSs and a tone US. The most commonly used and effective dependent measures for revealing extinction effects were skin conductance responses (SCR) and subjective ratings (SR) of CS valence, fearfulness and arousal. Fear potentiated startle (FPS) blink reflexes were also an effective but less commonly used measure. It is recommended that future studies use shape CSs and the metal scraping on slate US in studies involving children and either shape CSs and the metal scraping on slate US or face CSs paired with a scream US with adolescents. It is also recommended that US expectancy ratings and CS evaluations are assessed trial-by-trial and between-phase, and that startle-eliciting stimuli to measure startle blink reflexes are delivered on every second trial per CS so that SCR and FPS can be examined. However, further research is required to determine whether increased participant involvement due to providing trial-by-trial and between-phase ratings of the CSs and US differentially influences responding, particularly in children relative to adolescents and adults.",2179660579.0, Journal Article,2019
68,Statistical learning as a predictor of attention bias modification outcome: A preliminary study among socially anxious patients,"Attention bias modification (ABM) is a novel therapy designed to modulate attentional biases towards threat typically observed among anxious individuals. Bias modification is allegedly achieved via extraction of a statistical regularity embedded within the treatment task. However, no prior study examined prediction of ABM therapeutic response in relation to patients' capacity to extract statistical properties from the environment, a capacity known as “statistical learning”. Here, 30 treatment-seeking patients with social anxiety disorder completed a gold-standard statistical learning task at baseline and then received six sessions of ABM therapy. Results indicate that baseline statistical learning capacity predicts treatment outcome: the better patients' statistical learning capacity, the greater their reduction in clinician-rated and self-reported social anxiety symptoms. Restricted capacities for statistical learning could account for the moderate effect sizes of ABM therapy in clinical trials. Poor response may occur in patients who fail to extract the underlying contingency embedded in ABM.",2179659902.0, Journal Article,2019
147,The impact of depression and anxiety treatment on biological aging and metabolic stress: Study protocol of the MOod Treatment with Antidepressants or Running (MOTAR) study,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders have shown to be associated to premature or advanced biological aging and consequently to adversely impact somatic health. Treatments with antidepressant medication or running therapy are both found to be effective for many but not all patients with mood and anxiety disorders. These interventions may, however, work through different pathophysiological mechanisms and could differ in their impact on biological aging and somatic health. This study protocol describes the design of an unique intervention study that examines whether both treatments are similarly effective in reducing or reversing biological aging (primary outcome), psychiatric status, metabolic stress and neurobiological indicators (secondary outcomes). Methods: The MOod Treatment with Antidepressants or Running (MOTAR) study will recruit a total of 160 patients with a current major depressive and/or anxiety disorder in a mental health care setting. Patients will receive a 16- week treatment with either antidepressant medication or running therapy (3 times/week). Patients will undergo the treatment of their preference and a subsample will be randomized (1:1) to overcome preference bias. An additional no-disease-no-treatment group of 60 healthy controls without lifetime psychopathology, will be included as comparison group for primary and secondary outcomes at baseline. Assessments are done at week 0 for patients and controls, and at week 16 and week 52 for patients only, including written questionnaires, a psychiatric and medical examination, blood, urine and saliva collection and a cycle ergometer test, to gather information about biological aging (telomere length and telomerase activity), mental health (depression and anxiety disorder characteristics), general fitness, metabolic stress-related biomarkers (inflammation, metabolic syndrome, cortisol) and genetic determinants. In addition, neurobiological alterations in brain processes will be assessed using structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in a subsample of at least 25 patients per treatment arm and in all controls. Discussion: This intervention study aims to provide a better understanding of the impact of antidepressant medication and running therapy on biological aging, metabolic stress and neurobiological indicators in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders in order to guide a more personalized medicine treatment.

148,"Implementation research for public sector mental health care scale-up (smart-dapper): A sequential multiple, assignment randomized trial (smart) of non-specialist-delivered psychotherapy and/or medication for major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (dapper) integrated with outpatient care clinics at a county hospital in kenya","Background: Mental disorders are a leading cause of global disability, driven primarily by depression and anxiety. Most of the disease burden is in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where 75% of adults with mental disorders have no service access. Our research team has worked in western Kenya for nearly ten years. Primary care populations in Kenya have high prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To address these treatment needs with a sustainable, scalable mental health care strategy, we are partnering with local and national mental health stakeholders in Kenya and Uganda to identify 1) evidence-based strategies for first-line and second-line treatment delivered by non-specialists integrated with primary care, 2) investigate presumed mediators of treatment outcome and 3) determine patient-level moderators of treatment effect to inform personalized, resource-efficient, non-specialist treatments and sequencing, with costing analyses. Our implementation approach is guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Methods/design: We will use a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to randomize 2710 patients from the outpatient clinics at Kisumu County Hospital (KCH) who have MDD, PTSD or both to either 12 weekly sessions of non-specialist-delivered Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or to 6 months of fluoxetine prescribed by a nurse or clinical officer. Participants who are not in remission at the conclusion of treatment will be rerandomized to receive the other treatment (IPT receives fluoxetine and vice versa) or to combination treatment (IPT and fluoxetine). The SMART-DAPPER Implementation Resource Team, (IRT) will drive the application of the EPIS model and adaptations during the course of the study to optimize the relevance of the data for generalizability and scale –up. Discussion: The results of this research will be significant in three ways: 1) they will determine the effectiveness of non-specialist delivered first- and second-line treatment for MDD and/or PTSD, 2) they will investigate key mechanisms of action for each treatment and 3) they will produce tailored adaptive treatment strategies essential for optimal sequencing of treatment for MDD and/or PTSD in low resource settings with associated cost information-a critical gap for addressing a leading global cause of disability.

149,Education level and risk of postpartum depression: Results from the Japan environment and children’s study (JECS),"Background: Lower socioeconomic status is often thought to be associated with an elevated risk of postpartum depression; however, this relationship exhibits noticeable heterogeneity between studies. The present study examined this relationship in Japan. Methods: Data were obtained from 90,194 mothers in an ongoing birth cohort of the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. Socioeconomic status was assessed based on the mothers’ highest education level during pregnancy. Postpartum depression was identified at 1 and 6 months postpartum based on an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of ≥9, and analyses were also performed based on the sub-scores for anxiety, depression, and anhedonia symptoms. Logistic and generalized linear regression model analyses were used to calculate odds ratios for postpartum depression according to education level with the highest education group (≥16 years of education) defined as the reference group, while controlling for covariates in a stepwise fashion. Results: Univariate analysis revealed that a lower education level was associated with a higher prevalence of postpartum depression and related symptoms. Although these relationships weakened in the fully adjusted models, odds ratios for cases and related symptoms remained significant at 1 and 6 months postpartum. Among three symptom dimensions, the relationship was strongest and weakest in the depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Conclusions: A lower education level was an independent risk factor for postpartum depression. In view of the low mobility of the education level, this finding suggests the potential importance of collecting information regarding education levels at the earliest opportunity.

150,"Cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of late life depression: Study protocol of a multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial (CBTlate)","Background: Late-life depression (LLD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in old age. It is associated with various adverse outcomes and frequent use of health care services thereby remaining a serious public health concern. Compared with depression in early adulthood, most treatment options of LLD are less effective. Psychotherapy may be particularly beneficial for LLD due to specific psychological conditions in old age and a low risk of side effects. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is highly established and effective in depression in young and mid-life there is only a limited number of small studies on CBT in LLD. An LLD-specific CBT has not yet been compared to an active, but unspecific supportive psychological intervention in a multicentre trial. Methods: Here we present the design of the CBTlate trial, which is a multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, parallel group trial. CBTlate aims at including 248 patients with LLD of both genders at 7 sites in Germany. The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that a 15-session individually-delivered CBT specific for LLD is of superior efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression in comparison with a supportive unspecific intervention (SUI) of the same quantity. The intervention includes 8 weeks of individual treatment sessions twice per week and a follow-up period of 6 months after randomization. The primary end point is the severity of depression at the end of treatment measured by the self-rated 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Secondary endpoints include depressive symptoms at week 5 and at follow-up (6 months after randomization). Additional secondary endpoints include the change of depressive symptoms assessed with a clinician-rating-scale and a patient reported outcome instrument for major depressive disorder, anxiety symptoms, sleep, cognition, quality of life, and overall health status from baseline to end-of treatment and to end of follow-up. Add-on protocols include MRI and the collection of blood samples. Discussion: This study is the first multicentre trial of a specific CBT intervention for LLD compared to an unspecific supportive psychological intervention administered in a specialist setting. It has important implications for developing and implementing efficient psychotherapeutic strategies for LLD and may be a significant step to broaden treatment options for people suffering from LLD.

151,"Child maltreatment, peer victimization, and social anxiety in adulthood: A cross-sectional study in a treatment-seeking sample","Background: Childhood adversities, especially emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and peer victimization are considered to be crucial risk factors for social anxiety disorder (SAD). We investigated whether particular forms of retrospectively recalled childhood adversities are specifically associated with SAD in adulthood or whether we find similar links in other anxiety or depressive disorders. Methods: Prevalences of adversities assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and a questionnaire of stressful social experiences (FBS) were determined in N = 1091 outpatients. Adversity severities among patients with SAD only ( n = 25), specific phobia only ( n = 18), and generalized anxiety disorder only ( n = 19) were compared. Differences between patients with anxiety disorders only ( n = 62) and depressive disorders only ( n = 239) as well as between SAD with comorbid depressive disorders ( n = 143) and SAD only were tested. Results: None of the adversity types were found to be specifically associated with SAD and severities did not differ among anxiety disorders but patients with depressive disorders reported more severe emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than patients with anxiety disorders. SAD patients with a comorbid depressive disorder also reported more severe adversities across all types compared to SAD only. Conclusion: Findings indicate that particular forms of recalled childhood adversities are not specifically associated with SAD in adulthood. Previously established links with SAD may be better explained by comorbid depressive symptoms.

152,Variability in clinician intentions to implement specific cognitive-behavioral therapy components,"Background: CBT comprises many discrete components that vary in complexity, but implementation and training efforts often approach CBT as a single entity. We examined variability in clinician intentions to use different structural and interventional components of CBT for three different clinical groups: clients receiving CBT, clients with depression, and clients with anxiety. Methods: Clinicians ( n = 107) trained in CBT completed a one-time electronic survey. Clinicians’ intentions were measured using established item stems from social psychology adapted to examine intentions to use six specific CBT components: exposure therapy, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, planning homework, reviewing homework, and agenda-setting. Results: Intentions were weakest, on average, for exposure. They were strongest, on average, for reviewing homework. A series of ANOVAs with Tukey’s post-hoc tests revealed that participants intended to use exposure with clients receiving CBT ( p = .015) and clients with anxiety ( p &lt; .001) significantly more than for clients with depression. Participants intended to use behavioral activation with clients with depression ( p = .01) significantly more than for clients with anxiety. No other intentions to use CBT components differed among these three clinical populations. Conclusions: When studying determinants of CBT use and designing interventions to increase use, implementers should consider that different CBT components may require different implementation strategies.

Kalk and Ben Carter ( BMC Psychiatry , 2019[Nov][29], Vol 19[356]). In the original article, one of the author names was misspelled. The name Phillipa has been corrected to Philippa. The name is correct in this record, and has been corrected in the original record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-74390-001). Background: Over the past decade, smartphone use has become widespread amongst today’s children and young people (CYP) which parallels increases in poor mental health in this group. Simultaneously, media concern abounds about the existence of ‘smartphone addiction’ or problematic smartphone use. There has been much recent research concerning the prevalence of problematic smartphone use is in children and young people who use smartphones, and how this syndrome relates to mental health outcomes, but this has not been synthesized and critically evaluated. Aims: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of PSU and quantify the association with mental health harms. Methods: A search strategy using Medical Subject Headings was developed and adapted for eight databases between January 1, 1st 2011 to October 15th 2017. No language restriction was applied. Of 924 studies identified, 41 were included in this review, three of which were cohort studies and 38 were cross sectional studies. The mental health outcomes were self-reported: depression; anxiety; stress; poor sleep quality; and decreased educational attainment, which were synthesized according to an a priori protocol. Results: The studies included 41,871 CYP, and 55% were female. The median prevalence of PSU amongst CYP was 23.3% (14.0–31.2%). PSU was associated with an increased odds of depression (OR = 3.17;95%CI 2.30–4.37; I ² = 78%); increased anxiety (OR = 3.05 95%CI 2.64–3.53; I ² = 0%); higher perceived stress (OR = 1.86;95%CI 1.24–2.77; I ² = 65%); and poorer sleep quality (OR = 2.60; 95%CI; 1.39–4.85, I ² = 78%). Conclusions: PSU was reported in approximately one in every four CYP and accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health. PSU is an evolving public health concern that requires greater study to determine the boundary between helpful and harmful technology use. Policy guidance is needed to outline harm reduction strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",2331826798.0," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Erratum/Correction",2019
154,"Association between depression, anxiety and weight change in young adults","Background: To investigate whether there are bi-directional associations between anxiety and mood disorders and body mass index (BMI) in a cohort of young adults. Methods: We analysed data from the 2004–2006 (baseline) and 2009–2011 (follow-up) waves of the Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study. Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders were retrospectively diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Potential mediators were individually added to the base models to assess their potential role as a mediator of the associations. Results: In males, presence of mood disorder history at baseline was positively associated with BMI gain (β = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.14–1.40), but baseline BMI was not associated with subsequent risk of mood disorder. Further adjustment for covariates, including dietary pattern, physical activity, and smoking reduced the coefficient (β) to 0.70 (95% CI: 0.01–1.39), suggesting that the increase in BMI was partly mediated by these factors. In females, presence of mood disorder history at baseline was not associated with subsequent weight gain, however, BMI at baseline was associated with higher risk of episode of mood disorder (RR per kg/m²: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.08), which was strengthened (RR per kg/m² = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00–1.15) after additional adjustment in the full model. There was no significant association between anxiety and change in BMI and vice-versa. Conclusion: The results do not suggest bidirectional associations between anxiety and mood disorders, and change in BMI. Interventions promoting healthy lifestyle could contribute to reducing increase in BMI associated with mood disorder in males, and excess risk of mood disorder associated with BMI in females.

155,Longitudinal trajectories of comorbid PTSD and depression symptoms among U.S. service members and veterans,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study examined longitudinal trajectories of PTSD and MDD symptoms among service members and veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD. Methods: Eligible participants ( n = 1704) for the Millennium Cohort Study included those who screened positive at baseline for both PTSD (PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version) and MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire). Between 2001 and 2016, participants completed a baseline assessment and up to 4 follow-up assessments approximately every 3 years. Mixture modeling simultaneously determined trajectories of comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Multinomial regression determined factors associated with latent class membership. Results: Four distinct classes (chronic, relapse, gradual recovery, and rapid recovery) described symptom trajectories of PTSD/MDD. Membership in the chronic class was associated with older age, service branch, deployment with combat, anxiety, physical assault, disabling injury/illness, bodily pain, high levels of somatic symptoms, and less social support. Conclusions: Comorbid PTSD/MDD symptoms tend to move in tandem, and, although the largest class remitted symptoms, almost 25% of participants reported chronic comorbid symptoms across all time points. Results highlight the need to assess comorbid conditions in the context of PTSD. Future research should further evaluate the chronicity of comorbid symptoms over time.

156,Associations of psychological distress with positive psychological variables and activities of daily living among stroke patients: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Depression and anxiety result in psychological distress, which can further affect mental status and quality of life in stroke patients. Exploring the associations between positive psychological variables and symptoms of psychological distress following stroke is of great significance for further psychological interventions. Methods: A total of 710 stroke patients from the five largest cities in Liaoning Province in China were enrolled into the present study in July 2014. All patients independently completed the questionnaires with respect to psychological distress and positive psychological variables. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, respectively. Positive psychological variables were evaluated using Perceived Social Support Scale, Adult Hope Scale (AHS), General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale and Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Activities of Daily Living (ADL) was measured using Barthel Index. Factors associated with psychological variables and depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified using t-test, ANOVA, correlation and hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms were present in 600 of 710 (84.51%) and 537 of 710 (75.63%) stroke patients enrolled, respectively.Social support (β = −0.111, p &lt; 0.001) and hope (β = −0.120, p &lt; 0.001) were negatively associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Resilience (β = −0.179, p &lt; 0.001) was negatively associated with depressive symptoms.Self-efficacy (β = −0.135, p &lt; 0.001) was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that ADL accounted for 10.0 and 6.0% of the variance of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively.Social support, resilience, self-efficacy and hope as a whole accounted for 7.5 and 5.3% of the variance of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese stroke survivors should receive attentions from all stakeholders. Findings suggested that intervention strategies on ADL, social support, hope, resilience and self-efficacy could be developed to improve psychosocial outcomes for stroke survivors.

158,"The association between involuntary subordination and common mental disorders among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanghai, China","Background: Involuntary subordination is a mechanism that switches off fighting behaviors when a losing organism is unable to continue in a struggle. The study aim was to investigate the association between involuntary subordination and the common mental disorders of anxiety and depression among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanghai, China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 547 MSM in four Shanghai districts. Sociodemographic and psychosocial participant data were collected. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between anxiety, depression, and involuntary subordination. Results: 12.2 and 30.9% Of the MSM demonstrated high levels of anxiety and depression respectively. Univariate analysis showed that involuntary subordination and the involuntary subordination constructs of defeat, social comparison, submissive behavior, and entrapment were associated with anxiety and depression. Multivariate analysis indicated that defeat ( ORm = 1.091, 95% CI = 1.004–1.185) and entrapment ( ORm = 1.174, 95% CI = 1.079–1.278) were significantly associated with anxiety. Defeat ( ORm = 1.265, 95% CI = 1.166–1.372), social comparison ( ORm = 1.119, 95% CI = 1.061–1.181), entrapment ( ORm = 1.132, 95% CI = 1.047–1.224), and submissive behavior ( ORm = 0.897, 95% CI = 0.825–0.975) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusions: The findings confirmed an association between anxiety, depression, and involuntary subordination among MSM. These findings could form the basis of a new, integrated, and holistic approach to the identification of high-risk groups and the development of interventions for anxiety and depression among MSM.

159,The (cost) effectiveness of guided internet-based self-help CBT for dialysis patients with symptoms of depression: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Only a minority of dialysis patients with depressive symptoms are diagnosed and receive treatment. Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Underlying factors for this undertreatment may be the lack of evidence for the safety and effectivity of antidepressant medication, the reluctance of patients to adhere to antidepressant medication, the lack of mental healthcare provision in somatic healthcare environments and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) related physical limitations that complicate face-to-face psychotherapy. Guided Internet-based self-help treatment has demonstrated to be effective for depressive symptoms in other chronic patient populations and may overcome these barriers. The aim of this study is to investigate the (cost) effectiveness of a guided Internet-based self-help intervention for symptoms of depression in dialysis patients. Methods: This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigates the effectiveness of a 5-week Internet-based self-help Problem Solving Therapy (PST) for depressive symptoms in dialysis patients. Depressive symptoms will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory – second edition (BDI-II), with a cut-off score of ≥ 10. We aim to include 206 dialysis patients with depressive symptoms who will be cluster randomized to the intervention or the Care as Usual (CAU) control group. Secondary outcomes will include anxiety symptoms, quality of life, economic costs and clinical outcomes, such as inflammatory factors and hair cortisol levels. Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), 2 weeks after intervention (T1) and 6 months (T2), 12 months (T3) and 18 months (T4) after intervention. The control group will be measured at the same time points. Analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Mixed models will be used to assess the changes within each condition between pre-treatment and post-treatment. Discussion: If demonstrated to be (cost) effective, Internet-based PST will offer new possibilities to treat dialysis patients with depressive symptoms and to improve their quality of care.

160,Anxiety at age 15 predicts psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal ideation in late adolescence and young adulthood: Results from two longitudinal studies,"Background: Anxiety disorders in adolescence have been associated with several psychiatric outcomes. We sought to describe the prospective relationship between various levels of adolescent anxiety and psychiatric diagnoses (anxiety-, bipolar/psychotic-, depressive-, and alcohol and drug misuse disorders) and suicidal ideation in early adulthood while adjusting for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Furthermore, we aimed to estimate the proportion attributable to the various anxiety levels for the outcomes. Methods: We used a nation-wide population-based Swedish twin study comprising 14,106 fifteen-year-old twins born in Sweden between 1994 and 2002 and a replication sample consisting of 9211 Dutch twins, born between 1985 and 1999. Adolescent anxiety was measured with parental and self-report. Psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal ideation were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register and via self-report. Results: Adolescent anxiety, of various levels, predicted, in the Swedish National Patient Register, anxiety disorders: hazard ratio (HR) = 4.92 (CI 3.33–7.28); depressive disorders: HR = 4.79 (3.23–7.08), and any psychiatric outcome: HR = 3.40 (2.58–4.48), when adjusting for ADHD, ASD, and DCD. The results were replicated in the Dutch data. The proportion of psychiatric outcome attributable to adolescent anxiety over time (age 15–21) was 29% for any psychiatric outcome, 43–40% for anxiety disorders, and 39–38% for depressive disorders. Conclusion: Anxiety in adolescence constitutes an important risk factor in the development of psychiatric outcomes, revealing unique predictions for the different levels of anxiety, and beyond the risk conferred by childhood ADHD, ASD, and DCD. Developmental trajectories leading into psychiatric outcomes should further empirically investigated.

161,Does the treatment of anxiety in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using cognitive behavioral therapy improve child and family outcomes? Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Up to 60% of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) meet diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety disorder, including Social, Generalized and/or Separation Disorder. Anxiety in children with ADHD has been shown to be associated with poorer child and family functioning. Small pilot studies suggest that treating anxiety in children with ADHD using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has promising benefits. In a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aim to investigate the efficacy of an existing CBT intervention adapted for children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety compared with usual care. Methods: This RCT is recruiting children aged 8–12 years ( N = 228) from pediatrician practices in Victoria, Australia. Eligibility criteria include meeting full diagnostic criteria for ADHD and at least one anxiety disorder (Generalized, Separation or Social). Eligible children are randomized to receive a 10 session CBT intervention (Cool Kids) versus usual clinical care from their pediatrician. The intervention focuses on building child and parent skills and strategies to manage anxiety and associated impairments including cognitive restructuring and graded exposure. Minor adaptations have been made to the delivery of the intervention to meet the needs of children with ADHD including increased use of visual materials and breaks between activities. The primary outcome is change in the proportion of children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at 5 months randomization. This will be assessed via diagnostic interview with the child’s parent (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children V) conducted by a researcher blinded to intervention condition. Secondary outcomes include a range of child (e.g., anxiety symptoms, ADHD severity, behavior, quality of life, sleep, cognitive functioning, school attendance) and parent (e.g., mental health, parenting behaviors, work attendance) domains of functioning assessed at 5 and 12 months post-randomization. Outcomes will be analyzed using logistic and mixed effects regression. Discussion: The results from this study will provide evidence on whether treating comorbid anxiety in children with ADHD using a CBT approach leads to improvements in anxiety and/or broader functional outcomes.

162,The longitudinal association between lifetime mental disorders and first onset or recurrent suicide ideation,"Background: Although the cross-sectional association between mental disorders and suicide ideation is well studied, less is known about the prospective association. In this paper, we estimated among those without 12-month suicide ideation at baseline, the association between a wide variety of common mental disorders at baseline and suicide ideation within the 6-year follow-up period, after controlling for history of other mental disorders and demographic variables. Methods: Data were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a prospective representative adult cohort study with baseline (n = 6646) with a 6-year follow-up period. Lifetime mental disorders were assessed at baseline with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Within the longitudinal design, participants with first time or recurrent suicide ideation were defined follows: having no suicide ideation in the 12 months before the baseline assessment, and reporting to have had seriously thought about suicide between baseline and the 6-year follow-up period. Multiple logistical regression was used to estimate the longitudinal association between suicide ideation and a specific mental disorder while controlling for comorbidity and baseline variables. To account for the prevalence of a disorder in the population, for each disorder, the population attributable risk proportion (PARP) was calculated. Results: 2.9% ( n = 132) of the participants that did not report suicide ideation in the past 12 months at baseline reported suicide ideation at follow-up. Of these 132 cases, 81 (61%) experienced suicide ideation for the first time in their lives and could be viewed as first onset cases. 51 (39%) reported recurrent suicide ideation. After controlling for comorbidity, the only two disorders that were significantly related to suicide ideation at follow-up were lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). PARP for MDD was 47.8 and 16.6% for GAD. Conclusions: After controlling for all other mental disorders, a lifetime history of MDD and GAD were related to suicide ideation at follow-up. For clinical practice, this indicates that patients with a history of MDD or GAD stay vulnerable for suicide ideation, even though they did not report suicide ideation in the past year.

163,"Characterization of mental health in cannabis dispensary users, using structured clinical interviews and standardized assessment instruments","Background: Cannabis is commonly used for its medical properties. In particular, cannabis is purported to have beneficial effects on a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Studies assessing mental health in cannabis dispensary users typically evaluate symptoms using self-report check lists, which provide limited information about symptom severity, and whether subjects meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. There is, therefore, a need for studies which assess mental health in dispensary users with standardized and well validated scientific instruments, such as those used in clinical drug trials. Methods: One hundred medical cannabis users were recruited from a community dispensary. All subjects completed a structured clinical interview with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Subjects also completed the Perceived Stress Scale-10, PROMIS Fatigue Scale, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and the Brief Pain Inventory. Details about cannabis use were also recorded. Results: Lifetime prevalence of mental illness in this cohort was high, and a large proportion of subjects endorsed psychological symptoms. The proportion of subjects who met criteria for classification of a current psychiatric disorder was low for mood disorders, but high for anxiety disorders and substance abuse/dependence. Cannabis use differed between the main psychiatric conditions. Conclusions: The present results indicate that rates of mental illness may be high in medical cannabis dispensary users. Use of structured clinical assessments combined with standardized symptom severity questionnaires provide a feasible way to provide a more rigorous and detailed evaluation of conditions and symptoms in this population.

164,Trajectories of clinical and parenting outcomes following admission to an inpatient mother-baby unit,"Background: This study aimed to examine trajectories of clinical and parenting outcomes following admission to a mother-baby unit (MBU), and to explore factors associated with these trajectories. Methods: Women admitted to an MBU completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS) and Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS) at admission, discharge and 3 months following discharge. Questions assessing psychosocial risk and adult attachment style were also completed at admission, and information relating to service engagement in the time since discharge was collected at follow-up. Additional clinical and demographic information was extracted from the patient medical record. Results: Seventy-five women participated in the study. Overall, significant improvements in mean scores on measures of anxiety and parenting confidence were maintained 3-months following discharge. However, the majority of women (93.3%) followed trajectories that were characterised by deterioration in self-reported mother-infant attachment following discharge. 62.9 and 34.6% of women followed trajectories of increased symptoms of depression and stress between discharge and follow-up, respectively. Across measures, the least optimal trajectories, or least optimal scores, at follow-up were associated with less secure maternal attachment style (associated with more anxiety symptoms, poorer parenting confidence and maternal-infant attachment), older maternal age (more depressive symptoms) and increased psychosocial risk (more anxiety symptoms). Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the clinical implications of anxious attachment style for the mental health and parenting outcomes of women admitted to an MBU and the importance of incorporating mother-infant therapy as part of an ongoing management plan. Comprehensive discharge planning and transitional care to help ensure women discharged from an MBU are best supported in the longer term is recommended.

165,Current state of evidence of cannabis utilization for treatment of autism spectrum disorders,"The core symptoms and co-morbidities associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect daily living and quality of life. Existing pharmacological interventions are only able to attenuate some related symptoms but are unable to address the underlying etiologies associated with ASD. Anecdotal evidence, which claims benefit from the use of cannabis to treat symptoms among this population, has been gaining popularity as families seek solutions. This paper analyzed recent peer-reviewed literature to identify the current state of evidence regarding cannabis use for the ASD population. Systematic reviews, reports, and experimental studies were assessed to understand the current extent and nature of the evidence on the risks and benefits of cannabis use for ASD. At this time, three large-scale clinical trials are currently at varying stages of progress and publication of results. Only five small studies were identified that have specifically examined cannabis use in ASD. Given the sparse state of evidence directly assessed in this population, studies which examined effects of cannabis on shared pathological symptoms of ASD such as hyperactivity, sleep disorders, self-injury, anxiety, behavioral problems, and communication were also reviewed. Studies revealed mixed and inconclusive findings of cannabis effects for all conditions, except epilepsy. Adverse outcomes were also reported, which included severe psychosis, increased agitation, somnolence, decreased appetite, and irritability. In addition, a wide range of cannabis compositions and dosage were identified within the studies, which impact generalizability. There is currently insufficient evidence for cannabis use in ASD, which creates an urgent need for additional large-scale controlled studies to increase understanding of risks and benefits and also to examine the impact of “entourage effects.” This will support discussions of treatment options between health care providers and ASD patients and their families. Evidence may lead to a desired new line of treatment or prevent adverse outcomes from unsubstantiated use amongst families aiming for symptom reduction.

166,Risk factors for suicidal thoughts in informal caregivers: Results from the population-based Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2),"Background: Previous research suggests that family caregivers contemplate suicide at a higher rate than the general population. Much of this research has been disease specific and in relatively small samples. This study aimed to compare suicidal thoughts between non-caregivers and informal caregivers of people with a variety of conditions, in a large representative sample, and to identify significant risk factors. Methods: The general population study NEMESIS-2 (N at baseline = 6646) included 1582 adult caregivers at the second wave (2010–2012) who also participated at the third wave (2013–2015). Suicidal thoughts were assessed over 4 years, with the Suicidality Module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. The presence of suicidal thoughts was estimated and risk factors for suicidal thoughts were assessed with logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and gender. Results: Thirty-six informal caregivers (2.9%) reported suicidal thoughts during the 4 year study period. The difference between caregivers and non-caregivers (3.0%) was not significant. Among caregivers, significant risk factors for suicidal thoughts included being unemployed, living without a partner, having lower levels of social support, having a chronic physical disorder, a mood disorder or an anxiety disorder, and having impaired social, physical and emotional functioning. These risk factors were also found in non-caregivers. No caregiving-related characteristics were associated with suicidal thoughts. Conclusion: There was no elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in caregivers and risk factors for suicidal thoughts in caregivers were consistent with risk factors in non-caregivers. No association between caregiving characteristics and suicidal thoughts was found. Caregivers with limited resources and in poorer health might still benefit from prevention and intervention efforts.

167,Serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics could be promising treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer,"In a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice.

168,Population-based surveys and interventions for mental health literacy in China during 1997–2018: A scoping review,"Background: This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997–2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method: Following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results: MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China ( n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions: More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

169,"The ReThink study: A 3-arm parallel randomized trial of cognitive bias modification, with and without adherence promotion, for adolescent anxiety disorder: Trial design and protocol","Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem among youth, contribute to reduced quality of daily life, and are associated with high rates of comorbidity. However, treatment rates for anxiety are very low, causing a sizeable treatment gap. There is an immediate need to identify treatment interventions that are effective, affordable, and can be delivered easily to the youth population. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is one potentially effective intervention that could reach youth on a large scale, especially when self-administered at home. Thus, we aim to assess the benefit of CBM to treat youth anxiety. Further, we aim to test whether adding an adherence promotion (AP) component to the CBM intervention can improve outcomes, and whether CBM delivered both with and without the AP component is cost effective. Methods: This is a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted within an existing healthcare system. Potentially eligible youth (ages 12 to 17) will be identified by reviewing the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical anxiety diagnoses, which are then confirmed via research interview. We aim to enroll 498 participants and randomize them 1:1:1 to one of three arms: Arm 1 is a Low-Ratio version of the CBM program (nearly identical to the other CBM versions, but minimally effective); Arm 2 is a High-Ratio “active” CBM program; and Arm 3 is the High-Ratio CBM program with an added AP component. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. Youth in all three arms will self-administer the CBM program at home and will be asked to complete twelve intervention sessions over a four-week period. Arm 3 participants (High-Ratio CBM + AP) will also receive up to four telephone calls from phone coaches during the intervention period to provide technical assistance, encouragement, and motivational enhancement to increase adherence. The primary clinical outcome will be anxiety remission at 6-month follow-up. Discussion: This study protocol describes the method and design for an RCT to test whether self-administered CBM both with and without adherence promotion can be an effective at-home treatment for anxious youth.

Following publication of the original article, one of the authors’ names was spelled incorrectly. Originally the author name has been published as: Gemma Ryans. The correct author name is: Gemma Ryan. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-48716-001). This commentary examines publicly available information on 2017–2018 outcomes in the UK government’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, a National Health Service (NHS) primary care mental health programme in England. In that year there were 1.4 million referrals into IAPT and over 500,000 people completed a course of treatment. The IAPT database collects routine session-by-session outcome monitoring data for this population, including outcomes for depression and anxiety in a stepped care model which includes a range of psychological therapies, among them Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Person-centred Experiential Therapy, known in the IAPT programme as Counselling for Depression (CfD). In 2017–18, 32% of all referrals were for anxiety and stress disorders, 26% for depression, and 35% were unspecified. The definition of treatment completion is receipt of 2 sessions or more and on this basis 60% of all referrals in 2017–18 did not complete treatment, predominantly because they failed to attend the initial appointment, or ended after only one session. Four years of data on outcomes for CBT and CfD suggests these therapies are broadly comparable in terms of both recovery rate and average number of sessions, though the number of referrals to each therapy varied widely. Data on treatment choice and satisfaction was favourable but there were issues with low return rates and invalid data. Information on outcomes for ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as a measure of local economic deprivation, indicate lower outcomes for a number of patient groups. Data on employment status outcomes suggest little overall change, including for the category of those on benefits payments. The data published alongside the annual IAPT reports mean there is an increasing amount of information in the public domain about IAPT performance, but it is time consuming to extract and evaluate. This report highlights a number of points of concern which suggest the need for improvement on multiple axes. We suggest that improved researcher access to the huge IAPT dataset can allow for more detailed evaluations of IAPT that can inform policy/decision-making to improve outcomes for clients.

171,A test of the goodness of fit of the generic metacognitive model of psychopathology symptoms,"Background: Common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety frequently co-occur and may share etiological mechanisms. The metacognitive model is based on the principle that there are common pathological mechanisms across disorders that account for comorbidity and therefore can be conceptualized in one generic model. A central prediction of the model is that particular metacognitive beliefs concerning the value of worry, and the uncontrollability and danger of cognition are positively correlated with psychopathology symptoms. In the present study, we set out to test the overall fit of this model by assessing generic metacognitive beliefs and judgements of attention control capacity as predictors of common and frequently co-occurring emotional distress symptoms. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 645 participants gathered at convenience completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. Results: Structural equation modelling indicated a good model fit for the generic metacognitive model, and the predictors accounted for 93% of the variance in distress consisting of depression-, generalized- and social anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: This finding supports the generic model and the implication that it can be used as a basis to formulate and treat multiple presenting problems.

172,Dynamic Interactive Social Cognition Training in Virtual Reality (DiSCoVR) for social cognition and social functioning in people with a psychotic disorder: Study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Problems in social functioning (e.g., unemployment, social isolation), are common in people with a psychotic disorder. Social cognition is a treatment target to improve social functioning, as it is a proximal predictor of social functioning. Social Cognition Training (SCT) improves social cognition, but may not generalize (enduringly) to social functioning, perhaps due to insufficient opportunity to practice in daily-life social situations. Using virtual reality (VR) for SCT could address this problem, as VR is customizable, accessible, and interactive. We will test the effect of a VR SCT, ‘DiSCoVR’, on social cognition and social functioning in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: In total 100 people with a psychotic disorder and deficits in social cognition will be recruited for this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to VR SCT (DiSCoVR) or VR relaxation training (VRelax; active control). DiSCoVR is a 16-session individual SCT, consisting of three modules: 1) emotion perception (recognizing facial emotions in a virtual shopping street); 2) social perception and theory of mind (observing social interactions between virtual characters and assessing their behavior, emotions and thoughts); and 3) application of higher-order social cognition in social interaction (role-playing personalized situations in VR). People receiving VRelax complete sixteen individual sessions, in which they receive psycho-education about stress, identify personal stressors, learn relaxation techniques, and explore relaxing immersive virtual environments. Assessments will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are emotion perception (Ekman 60 Faces), social perception and theory of mind (The Awareness of Social Inference Test). Secondary outcomes include social functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale), experiences and social interactions in daily life (experience sampling of emotions, social participation and subjective experience of social situations), psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, perceived stress, anxiety, positive and negative symptoms) and self-esteem. Discussion: To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT testing the efficacy of VR SCT. It will also investigate generalization to daily life social situations, the durability of treatment effects, and moderators and mediators of treatment success. Trial registration: On December 5, 2017, this trial was registered prospectively in the Dutch Trial Register as NTR6863.

173,The characteristics and risk factors for common psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer seeking help for mental health,"Background: Although the adverse effects of cancer diagnoses and treatments on mental health are known, about less than 10% of patients are estimated to be referred to seek help. The primary purpose of this study was to obtain the baseline information on patients with cancer seeking help for mental health who presented for the first time to the psycho-oncology outpatient clinic, and to identify risk factors that may provide clues healthcare practitioners in recognizing those needing psychological help in oncology practice. Methods: We reviewed the charts of 566 patients with cancer who were referred to the psycho-oncology outpatient clinic over a two-year period. The study includes the socio-demographic data, illness characteristics, psychiatric characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, and treatment recommendations for these patients. Results: The incidence of diagnoses of psychiatric disorders was 97.5%. The distributions of psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: any kind of adjustment disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, organic brain syndrome, personality disorders, delusional disorder, and insomnia. Recurrence of cancer, other chronic medical illnesses, a history of psychiatric disorders, poor social support, and low income comprised the common significant risk factors for adjustment disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. These risk factors were also seen to be significant in the regression analysis in terms of sex. Conclusion: This study identifies the distribution of psychiatric disorders, the risk factors for specific psychiatric disorders, and draws attention to the fact that there are serious delays in patients seeking psychiatric help and in the referrals of oncologists for psychological assessment. Identifying risk factors and raising oncologists’ awareness toward risk factors could help more patients gain access to mental health care much earlier.

174,Effectiveness of the Japanese standard family psychoeducation on the mental health of caregivers of young adults with schizophrenia: A randomised controlled trial,"Background: This study examined the effects of the standard model of family psychoeducation (SM-FPE) in Japan on the mental health of relatives who care for young patients with a psychotic disorder. Methods: Stratified by recent-onset/chronic psychosis, 74 caregivers of outpatients aged 30.1 years (mean) were randomly assigned to receive TAU (treatment as usual) alone or TAU plus SM-FPE. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of the intervention (10 weeks), and 1 month post-intervention (14 weeks). The primary outcome was the trait anxiety of caregivers at 14 weeks. Secondary outcomes included caregivers’ state anxiety, psychological distress, care burden, and expressed emotion. Integrating these secondary outcomes, a conceptual framework of caregivers’ health state was assessed via structural equation modelling. Results: Compared with TAU alone, SM-FPE plus TAU did not significantly improve all caregivers’ individual outcomes. Direct effects of the intervention were observed in the caregivers of chronic patients as significant improvements of their overall mental health state at 10 weeks, which indirectly continued until 14 weeks. However, such intervention effects were not observed in the caregivers of recent-onset patients. Conclusions: The lack of effectiveness in the recent-onset stage suggests that the usefulness of the SM-FPE needs to be corroborated by further research.

175,The mediating effect of health anxiety in the relationship between functional somatic symptoms and illness behavior in Chinese inpatients with depression,"Background: Functional somatic symptoms in depression disorder may cause inappropriate illness behavior hindering the treatment process. Health anxiety may play a role in this relationship, but few studies have examined it. The current study aimed to investigate the role of health anxiety in the relationship between functional somatic symptoms and illness behavior in patients with depression. Methods: The present study recruited 323 hospitalized patients with depression to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Whiteley-Index-7, and Scale for the Assessment of Illness Behavior, then constructed a structural equation model to examine whether health anxiety mediated the relationship between functional somatic symptoms and illness behavior. Results: The results showed significant correlations between any two of the three variables of interest. More importantly, health anxiety played a partially mediating role (42.86%) in the relationship between functional somatic symptoms and illness behavior. Further analysis suggested that elderly patients reached higher health anxiety than younger patients when their functional somatic symptoms were mild. Conclusions: These results highlight that health anxiety may mediate the influence of functional somatic symptoms on illness behavior. The implications of assessing and intervening in health anxiety in patients with depression were discussed.

177,"Prevalence of risky alcohol use behavior and associated factors in pregnant antenatal care attendees in Debre Berhan, Ethiopia, 2018","Background: National Institute of alcohol and alcoholism define Problem/risky use of alcohol as drinking in a way that can negatively impact our health and life, but the body is not physically dependent on the substance. Risky alcohol use behavior is harmful to both the fetus and the mother such as maternal alcohol intoxication and alcohol use disorder, abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, and prematurity. This study is aimed to assess the prevalence of risky alcohol use for both the mother and the fetus during pregnancy among mothers who have used alcohol at least once in the current pregnancy. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among a total of 380 mothers who have used alcohol at least once during the current pregnancy. The participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Binary Logistic Regression models were done to identify associated factors. Odds Ratios with their 95% Confidence Interval was computed and variables with a p -value &lt; 0.05 during multivariable analysis were considered significantly associated factors.Results: A total of 380 mothers who used alcohol at least once (any amount) in the current pregnancy were included in the study and further interviewed for risky alcohol use behavior with a response rate of 100%. The overall prevalence of risky alcohol use behavior was 16.1% (95% CI = 12.1, 19.7). Having poor social support, having moderate to severe depression and anxiety, having diagnosed family history of mental illness, having a history of abortion were important factors which significantly associated with risky alcohol use behavior. Conclusion: Significant proportions of pregnant mothers were risky alcohol drinkers. It will be better if screening of any amount of alcohol use during pregnancy and providing health education (about the risk of alcohol use) for all pregnant women who attend antenatal care follow up.

178,Efficacy and mechanisms underlying a gamified attention bias modification training in anxious youth: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Attention bias modification training (ABMT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) likely target different aspects of aberrant threat responses in anxiety disorders and may be combined to maximize therapeutic benefit. However, studies investigating the effect of ABMT in the context of CBT have yielded mixed results. Here, we propose an enhanced ABMT to target the attentional bias towards threat, in addition to classic CBT for anxiety disorders in youth. This enhanced ABMT integrates the modified dot-probe task used in previous studies, where a target is always presented at the previous location of the neutral and not the simultaneously presented threatening stimulus, with a visual search, where the targets are always presented distally of threatening distractors. These two training elements (modified dot-probe and visual search) are embedded in an engaging game to foster motivation and adherence. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of the enhanced ABMT in the context of CBT. Further, we aim to replicate two previous findings: (a) aberrant amygdala connectivity being the neurobiological correlate of the attentional bias towards threat at baseline; and (b) amygdala connectivity being a mediator of the ABMT effect. We will also explore moderators of treatment response (age, sex, depressive symptoms and irritability) on a behavioral and neuronal level. Methods: One hundred and twenty youth (8–17 years old) with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis all receive CBT and are randomized to nine weeks of either active or control ABMT and symptom improvement will be compared between the two study arms. We will also recruit 60 healthy comparison youth, who along with eligible anxious youth, will be assessed with the dot-probe task during fMRI (anxious youth: before and after training; healthy volunteers: second measurement twelve weeks after initial assessment). Discussion: The present study will contribute to the literature by (1) potentially replicating that aberrant amygdala connectivity mediates the attentional bias towards threat in anxious youth; (2) determining the efficacy of enhanced ABMT; and (3) advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ABMT.

179,"Co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms: Trajectories from adolescence to midlife using group-based joint trajectory analysis","Background: Co-occurrence of mental and somatic symptoms is common, and recent longitudinal studies have identified single trajectories of these symptoms, but it is poorly known whether the symptom trajectories can also co-occur and change across the lifespan. We aimed to examine co-occurring symptoms and their joint trajectories from adolescence to midlife. Methods: Longitudinal data were derived from Northern Sweden, where 506 girls and 577 boys aged 16 years participated at baseline in 1981 (99.7% of those initially invited), and have been followed up in four waves until the age of 43. Survey data were collected about depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Potential joint development of this three-component symptom set was examined with multiple response trajectory analysis, a method that has not been previously used to study co-occurrence of these symptoms. Results: We identified a five trajectory solution as the best: “very low” (19%), “low” (31%), “high” (22%), “late sharply increasing” (16%) and a “very high increasing” (12%). In the “late sharply increasing” and “very high increasing” groups the scores tended to increase with age, while in the other groups the levels were more stable. Overall, the results indicated that depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms co-exist from adolescence to midlife. Conclusions: The multiple response trajectory analysis confirmed high stability in the co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms from adolescence to midlife. Clinicians should consider these findings to detect symptoms in their earliest phase in order to prevent the development of co-occurring high levels of symptoms.

180,Pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders in older people with intellectual disability in comparison with the general population,"Background: People with intellectual disability (ID) have high prevalence of psychiatric disorders, but even higher rates of prescription of psychotropic drugs. Methods: Using Swedish national registers, we identified a group of older people with ID and diagnosis of mood disorders (ICD-10 codes F32-F39) and/or anxiety (ICD-10 code F4) during 2006–2012 ( n = 587) and a referent group of people from the general population with the same diagnoses during the same time period ( n = 434). For both groups, we collected information on prescription of anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, antidepressants, and GABA-agonists. Results: Among those with a diagnosis of anxiety, people with ID were more likely than those in the general population to be prescribed anxiolytics (Relative Risk 1.32 [95% Confidence Interval 1.19–1.46]) and GABA-agonists (1.10 [1.08–1.31]). Moreover, among those with anxiety but without mood disorders, ID was associated with increased prescription of antidepressants (1.20 [1.03–1.39]). Within the ID cohort, behaviour impairment and MSP (i.e. moderate, severe, or profound) ID was associated with increased prescription of anxiolytics, both among those with anxiety (1.15 [1.03–1.30] for behaviour impairment and 1.23 [1.10–1.38] for MSP ID) and among those with mood disorders (1.14 [0.97–1.35] for behaviour impairment and 1.26 [1.04–1.52] for MSP ID). Moreover, MSP ID was associated with increased prescription of GABA-agonists among those with anxiety (1.23 [1.10–1.38]). Conclusions: The excess prescription of anxiolytics but not antidepressants may suggest shortages in the psychiatric health care of older people with intellectual disability and mood and anxiety disorders.

181,Mindfulness-based social cognition training (SocialMIND) versus psychoeducational multicomponent intervention for people with a first episode of psychosis: A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: People who suffer a first episode of psychosis experience higher levels of distress and suffering. Early intervention programs combine pharmacological and psychosocial strategies that include different components, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychosocial interventions, medication adherence, family psychoeducation, counselling, etc. Among the complementary approaches, mindfulness-based interventions help participants to cultivate a radical acceptance of their psychotic experiences within a person-centered framework. They show promising results for people with longer duration of psychosis, but there is still no evidence for people who have recently experienced their first episode of psychosis. Methods: The present parallel-group, single-blind (evaluator), randomised (1:1 ratio), controlled (versus active comparator), superiority, clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of SocialMIND on social functioning as measured by the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. The active comparator will be a psychoeducational multicomponent intervention (PMI) that incorporates elements of early intervention programs that are effective for people who have suffered a first episode of psychosis. Both SocialMIND and PMI encompass eight weekly sessions, four bi-weekly sessions, and five monthly sessions. Changes in primary and secondary outcomes will be measured after weekly (8th week), bi-weekly (16th week) and monthly sessions (56th week), and 3 months after completing the intervention (68th week). Secondary outcomes include symptoms of psychosis, anxiety and depression, as well as indicators of general functioning. Tertiary outcomes are measures of social cognition, neurocognition, mindfulness, and indicators of inflammation and oxidative stress. A final sample of 80 participants is proposed to detect clinically significant differences in social functioning. Discussion: This is the first mindfulness-based social cognition training for people with psychosis. SocialMIND aims to generate changes in the real-life functioning of people who have experienced a first episode of psychosis, and to be at least as effective as a psychoeducational multicomponent program. Adherence to the interventions is a common problem among young people with psychosis, so several difficulties are anticipated, and some methodological issues are discussed.

182,Lower versus higher frequency of sessions in starting outpatient mental health care and the risk of a chronic course; a naturalistic cohort study,"Background: An adequate frequency of treatment might be a prerequisite for a favorable outcome. Unfortunately, there is a diversity of factors that interfere with an adequate frequency of sessions. This occurs especially in the first phase of treatment, while the first phase seems vital for the rest of treatment. The aim of this naturalistic study was to explore the impact of the initial frequency of treatment sessions on treatment outcome in a diverse mental health care population. Methods: Anonymized data were analyzed from 2,634 patients allocated for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and personality disorders to outpatient treatment programs in a large general mental health care facility. Patients’ treatment outcome was routinely monitored with the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45.2), every 12 weeks. Frequency of sessions was assessed for the first three months of treatment. Using Cox-proportional-hazard models, we explored the associations between initial frequency and improvement (reliable significant change) and recovery (reliable and clinically significant change).Results: Improvement and recovery were associated with symptom severity and functional impairment at start of treatment, the year the treatment started, number of measurements, the treatment program (anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and personality disorders) and receiving group therapy other than psychotherapy. Conclusions: In addition to severity at start of treatment and other predictors of outcome, a low frequency of initial treatment sessions might lead to a less favorable outcome and a more chronic course of the mental disorder. This association seems not to be limited to a specific diagnostic group, but was found in a large group of patients with common mental disorders (depression and anxiety disorders) and patients with a personality disorder. Despite organizational obstacles, more effort should be made to start treatment quickly by an effective frequency of session.

183,A qualitative study of the acceptability of cognitive bias modification for paranoia (CBM-pa) in patients with psychosis,"Background: Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) has been used successfully as a computer-based intervention in disorders such as anxiety. However, CBM to modify interpretations of ambiguous information relevant to paranoia has not yet been tested. We conducted a qualitative investigation of a novel intervention called CBM for paranoia (CBM-pa) to examine its acceptability in patients with psychosis. Methods: Eight participants with psychosis who completed CBM-pa were identified by purposive sampling and invited for a semi-structured interview to explore the facilitators and barriers to participation, optimum form of delivery, perceived usefulness of CBM-pa and their opinions on applying CBM-pa as a computerised intervention. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis by researchers working in collaboration with service users. Results: Themes emerged relating to participants’ perception about delivery, engagement, programme understanding, factors influencing experience, perceived impact and application of CBM-pa. CBM-pa was regarded as easy, straightforward and enjoyable. It was well-accepted among those we interviewed, who understood the procedure as a psychological intervention. Patients reported that it increased their capacity for adopting alternative interpretations of emotionally ambiguous scenarios. Although participants all agreed on the test-like nature of the current CBM-pa format, they considered that taking part in sessions had improved their overall wellbeing. Most of them valued the computer-based interface of CBM-pa but favoured the idea of combining CBM-pa with some form of human interaction. Conclusions: CBM-pa is an acceptable intervention that was well-received by our sample of patients with paranoia. The current findings reflect positively on the acceptability and experience of CBM-pa in the target population. Patient opinion supports further development and testing of CBM-pa as a possible adjunct treatment for paranoia.

184,Explanation of somatic symptoms by mental health and personality traits: Application of Bayesian regularized quantile regression in a large population study,"Background: Somatic syndrome is one of the remarkably prevalent issues in primary health care and subspecialty settings. We aimed to elucidate multidimensional associations between somatic symptoms with major mental problems and personality traits in the framework of the quantile regression model with a Bayesian approach. Methods: A total of 4763 employees at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services in Isfahan province, Iran, filled out four validated questionnaires including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), NEO Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and PHQ-15 for somatic symptom severity. In addition, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) were determined using Rome IV criteria. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Bayesian regularized quantile regression with adaptive LASSO penalization were applied for reduced dimension of somatic symptoms and variable selection and parameter estimation, respectively. Results: The 25 major somatic symptoms were grouped into four factors including general, upper gastrointestinal, lower gastrointestinal and respiratory by EFA. Stress, depression, and anxiety had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors. The effect of anxiety in each four extracted factors was more than stress and depression. Neuroticism and agreeableness had significant effects on all of the four extracted factors, generally ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of somatic symptoms and psychosomatic complaints in correlation with the diverse range of mental co-morbidities, developing more detailed diagnostic tools and methods is crucial; nonetheless, it seems that providing better interdisciplinary approaches in general medical practice is groundwork.

185,"Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an unguided, internet-based self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder in university students: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial","Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent among university students, but the majority of affected students remain untreated. Internet- and mobile-based self-help interventions (IMIs) may be a promising strategy to address this unmet need. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an unguided internet-based treatment for SAD among university students. The intervention is optimized for the treatment of university students and includes one module targeting fear of positive evaluations that is a neglected aspect of SAD treatment. Methods: The study is a two arm randomized controlled trial in which 200 university students with a primary diagnosis of SAD will be assigned randomly to either a wait-list control group (WLC) or the intervention group (IG). The intervention consists of 9 sessions of an internet-based cognitive-behavioral treatment, which also includes a module on fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Guidance is delivered only on the basis of standardized automatic messages, consisting of positive reinforcements for session completion, reminders, and motivational messages in response to non-adherence. All participants will additionally have full access to treatment as usual. Diagnostic status will be assessed through Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM Disorders (SCID). Assessments will be completed at baseline, 10 weeks and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be SAD symptoms at post-treatment, assessed via the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Secondary outcomes will include diagnostic status, depression, quality of life and fear of positive evaluation. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be evaluated from a societal and health provider perspective. Discussion: Results of this study will contribute to growing evidence for the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of unguided IMIs for the treatment of SAD in university students. Consequently, this trial may provide valuable information for policy makers and clinicians regarding the allocation of limited treatment resources to such interventions.

186,Study design of the routine outcome monitoring for geriatric psychiatry &amp;amp; science (ROM-GPS) project; a cohort study of older patients with affective disorders referred for specialised geriatric mental health care,"Background: Affective disorders, encompassing depressive-, anxiety-, and somatic symptom disorders, are the most prevalent mental disorders in later life. Treatment protocols and guidelines largely rely on evidence from RCTs conducted in younger age samples and ignore comorbidity between these disorders. Moreover, studies in geriatric psychiatry are often limited to the “younger old” and rarely include the most frail. Therefore, the effectiveness of treatment in routine clinical care for older patients and impact of ageing characteristics is largely unknown.Objective: The primary aim of the Routine Outcome Monitoring for Geriatric Psychiatry &amp; Science (ROM-GPS) – project is to examine the impact of ageing characteristics on the effectiveness of treatment for affective disorders in specialised geriatric mental health care.Methods: ROM-GPS is a two-stage, multicentre project. In stage one, all patients aged ≥60 years referred to participating outpatient clinics for specialised geriatric mental health care will be routinely screened with a semi-structured psychiatric interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and self-report symptom severity scales assessing depression, generalized anxiety, hypochondria, and alcohol use. Patients with a unipolar depressive, anxiety or somatic symptom disorder will be asked informed consent to participate in a second (research) stage to be extensively phenotyped at baseline and closely monitored during their first year of treatment with remission at one-year follow-up as the primary outcome parameter. In addition to a large test battery of potential confounders, specific attention is paid to cognitive functioning (including computerized tests with the Cogstate test battery as well as paper and pencil tests) and physical functioning (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and different frailty indicators). The study is designed as an ongoing project, enabling minor adaptations once a year (change of instruments).Discussion: Although effectiveness studies using observational data can easily be biased, potential selection bias can be quantified and potentially corrected (e.g. by propensity scoring). Knowledge of age-related determinants of treatment effectiveness, may stimulate the development of new interventions. Moreover, studying late-life depressive, anxiety and somatic symptom disorders jointly enables data-driven studies for more optimal classification of these disorders in later life.Trial registration: Dutch Trial Register: NL6704 (www.trialregister.nl).

187,"Effects of exercise on symptoms of anxiety, cognitive ability and sick leave in patients with anxiety disorders in primary care: Study protocol for PHYSBI, a randomized controlled trial","Background: Anxiety disorders are common and associated with reduced quality of life, impaired physical and mental health and an increased economic burden for society. While evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise treatment for depression, there is a need for high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCT) with a focus on anxiety disorders. Further research is also warranted regarding outcomes of cognitive function, other health-related variables, dose-response effects, work ability and potential mechanisms. Method/design: Using a parallel, RCT design with three assessment points (baseline, post-intervention and one-year follow-up), we aim to assess the effect of a 12-week exercise intervention in primary care patients with anxiety disorders (n = 180), diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I; Swedish version 6.0.0d DSM-IV). Participants are randomly assigned to three physical exercise groups: one low-intensity training group, one moderate- to high intensity training group and one control non-exercise group. Assessments include measures of anxiety symptoms, cognitive function, physical health variables such as cardiovascular fitness, sick-leave and levels of hormones/cytokines in blood samples. Discussion: Findings from this study will provide novel insights regarding the effects of exercise treatment on not only anxiety symptoms but also other outcomes including mental and physical health, cognitive function, dose-response effects, work ability/sick leave and on biomarkers that may help explain underlying mechanisms.

188,Efficacy of Mentalization-based group therapy for adolescents: The results of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Background: Mentalization Based Therapy (MBT) has yielded promising outcomes for reducing self-harm, although to date only one study has reported MBT’s effectiveness for adolescents (Rossouw and Fonagy, J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 51:1304–1313, 2012) wherein the treatment protocol consisted of an intensive programme of individual and family therapy. We sought to investigate an adaptation of the adult MBT introductory manual in a group format for adolescents. Methods: The present study is a randomised controlled single blind feasibility trial that aims to (1) adapt the original explicit MBT introductory group manual for an adolescent population (MBT-Ai) and to (2) assess the feasibility of a trial of MBT-Ai through examination of consent rates, attendance, attrition and self-harm. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine change over time in independent and dependent variables between groups, and multi level models (MLM) were conducted to examine key predictors in relation to change over time with self-report self-harm and emergency department presentation for harm as the primary outcome variables. Results: Fifty-three young people consented to participate and were randomised to MBT-Ai + TAU or TAU alone. Five participants withdrew from the trial. Trial procedures seemed appropriate and safe, with acceptable group attendance. Self-reported self-harm and emergency department presentation for self-harm significantly decreased over time in both groups, though there were no between group differences. Social anxiety, emotion regulation, and borderline traits also significantly decreased over time in both groups. Mentalization emerged as a significant predictor of change over time in self reported self harm and hospital presentation for self-harm. Conclusions: It was feasible to carry out an RCT of MBT-Ai for adolescents already attending NHS CAMHS who have recently self-harmed. Our data gave signals that suggested a relatively brief group-based MBT-Ai intervention may be a promising intervention with potential for service implementation. Future research should consider the appropriate format, dosage and intensity of MBT for the adolescent population.

189,The occurrence of comorbidities with affective and anxiety disorders among older people with intellectual disability compared with the general population: A register study,"Background: Little is known regarding the burden of comorbidities among older people with intellectual disability (ID) who have affective and anxiety disorders. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the occurrence and risk of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities with affective and/or anxiety disorders in older people with ID compared to the general population. Methods: This population study was based on three Swedish national registers over 11 years (2002–2012). The ID group was identified in the LSS register, which comprises of data on measures in accordance with the Act Concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments ( n = 7936), and a same-sized reference cohort from the Total Population Register was matched by sex and year of birth. The study groups consisted of those with affective ( n = 918) and anxiety ( n = 825) disorder diagnoses. The information about diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register based on ICD-10 codes. Results: The rate of psychiatric comorbidities with affective and anxiety disorders was approximately 11 times higher for people with ID compared to the general reference group. The two most common psychiatric comorbidities occurred with affective and anxiety disorders were Unspecified non-organic psychosis and Other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical disease (8% for each with affective disorders and 7 and 6% with anxiety disorders, respectively). In contrast, somatic comorbidity comparisons showed that the general reference group was 20% less likely than the ID cohort to have comorbid somatic diagnoses. The most commonly occurring somatic comorbidities were Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (49 and 47% with affective and anxiety disorders, respectively) and Signs and symptoms and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings not elsewhere classified (44 and 50% with affective and anxiety disorders, respectively). Conclusion: Older people with ID and with affective and anxiety diagnoses are more likely to be diagnosed with psychiatric comorbidities that are unspecified, which reflects the difficulty of diagnosis, and there is a need for further research to understand this vulnerable group. The low occurrence rate of somatic diagnoses may be a result of those conditions being overshadowed by the high degree of psychiatric comorbidities.

190,Investigation of anterior cingulate cortex gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate-glutamine levels in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and disabling psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD. Methods: We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures. Results: Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables. Conclusions: These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD. Yet, it seems that a disruption in the balance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission may have a particularly important role to play in OCD pathophysiology.

191,Prediction of psychiatric comorbidity on premature death in a cohort of patients with substance use disorders: A 42-year follow-up,"Background: We need to better understand how the use of different substances and psychiatric comorbidity influence premature death generally and cause-specific death by overdose, intoxication and somatic disorders in people with substance use disorders. Method: A cohort of 1405 patients consecutively admitted to a Swedish detoxification unit for substance use disorders in 1970–1995 was followed-up for 42 years. Substances were identified by toxicological analyses. Mortality figures were obtained from a national registry. Causes of death were diagnosed by forensic autopsy in 594 patients deceased by 2012. Predictions were calculated by competing risks analysis. Results: Forty-two per cent of the cohort died during follow-up; more men than women (46.3% vs 30.4%). The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated as the ratio of observed deaths in males and females in specific age groups in the cohort versus expected deaths in corresponding groups in the general population. SMR was 5.68 for men (CI 95%; 5.04–6.11) and 4.98 (CI 95%; 4.08–5.88) for women. The crude mortality rate (number of deaths divided by number of person observation years) was 2.28% for men and 1.87% for women. Opiates predicted increased risk of premature death while amphetamine and cannabis predicted lower risk. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were identified in 378 cases and personality disorders in 763 cases. Primary psychoses or mood/depression and anxiety disorders predicted a higher risk of premature mortality. Death by overdose was predicted by male gender, younger age at admission to substance treatment, opiate use, and comorbid depression and anxiety syndromes. Cannabis and amphetamine use predicted a lower risk of overdose. Death by intoxication was predicted by male gender, use of sedatives/hypnotics or alcohol/mixed substances, primary psychoses and depression/anxiety syndromes. Premature death by somatic disorder was predicted by male gender and alcohol/mixed abuse. Conclusion: Psychiatric comorbid disorders were important risk factors for premature drug-related death. Early identification of these factors may be life-saving in the treatment of patients with substance use disorders.

192,Mental health of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and their parents in China: A cross-sectional survey,"Backgrounds: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is an adolescent onset spinal deformity, which can negatively affect the mental health of these patients. But no studies about their parental mental health have been reported so far. In this study, the parental mental health of AIS patients and the associated risk factors were evaluated by a cross-sectional survey. Methods: 64 AIS patients who underwent conservative or surgical treatments in our hospital from April 2017 to March 2018, and their parents were enrolled in the AIS group. 85 parents of healthy children were enrolled in the control group. Depression and anxiety were separately assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). Spearman correlation coefficients were first estimated to investigate the relationships among the parental PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores and the patient’s PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores in the AIS group. Then, the morbidities of the parental probable major depressive disorder (pMDD, PHQ score ≥ 10) and probable general anxiety disorder (pGAD, GAD-7 score ≥ 10) were compared between the AIS and control groups. Third, the potential risk factors for parental pMDD or pGAD in the AIS group were compared using the chi-squared test or Student’s t-test, respectively. Finally, the uneven distributive variates were analyzed using the binary logistic regression model. Results: Both parental depression and anxiety were moderately associated with those of the patients ( r = 0.448~0.515, p &lt; 0.01) in the AIS group, respectively. The morbidities of parental pMDD and pGAD in the AIS group were 14.1%, significantly higher than those in the control group (pMDD = 4.7%, p = 0.045; pGAD = 3.5%, p = 0.019). A Cobb angle of the major curve ≥50° ( p = 0.034, odds ratio [OR] = 8.264), patients with pMDD (p = 0.018, OR = 17.576), and low education level of the parents ( p = 0.026, OR = 0.122) were the risk factors of parental pMDD. Household income &lt; 8000 rmb/month was the risk factor for parental pGAD ( p = 0.021). Conclusions: The morbidities of pMDD and pGAD in parents of AIS patients were higher than those in parents of healthy children. Parental depression and anxiety were closely associated with their children’s depression and anxiety. Therefore, the parental mental health of AIS patients should be paid attention to, especially for those parents with risk factors.

193,Prevalence of prolonged grief disorder in a sample of female refugees,"Background: Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is a distinct syndrome that follows bereavement. It is different from other mental disorders and is characterized by symptoms such as yearning for the bereaved, or intense emotional pain or distress. Violent loss is one major risk factor for the development of PGD. Objectives: PGD has been studied in different populations, mostly in small samples, with only a few of them being representative. Although research highlighted that traumatic experiences paired with challenges related to migration make refugees particularly vulnerable to PGD, PGD has only rarely been studied in refugees. Thus, this article a) examines the prevalence of PGD in female refugees in Germany according to the criteria proposed by Prigerson and colleagues in 2009, and b) associates PGD with other common psychopathology (e.g. anxiety, depression, somatization and trauma). Method: A total of 106 female refugees were assessed for bereavement and PGD. Of these 106 individuals, 85 were interviewed using the Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (PG-13). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), somatization was assessed by the Somatization Subscale of the Symptom-Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and the number of witnessed and experienced trauma was assessed by the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS/HTQ). Results: Ninety of the 106 participants had experienced bereavement, and among those, 9.41% met criteria for PGD. The most frequent PGD symptoms were bitterness, longing or yearning for the bereaved, and lack of acceptance of the loss. Furthermore, grief symptoms were significantly associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization, and the number of experienced traumatic events. Conclusion: The PGD prevalence rate found corresponds with previous studies, demonstrating that prevalence rates for PGD are especially high in refugees. High prevalence rates of bereavement as well as PGD highlight the need for assessment and specifically tailored treatment of PGD in refugees. PGD goes along with significant psychopathology, which further emphasizes the need for treatment.

194,"The prevalence, metabolic disturbances and clinical correlates of recent suicide attempts in Chinese inpatients with major depressive disorder","Background: Metabolic disturbances have been correlated with suicidality, but little is known about the association between suicide risk and metabolic disturbances among individuals with depression. This study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlations, especially cardio-metabolic associated factors of recent suicide attempts in Chinese patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: A total of 288 MDD inpatients were recruited. Their clinical and demographic data together with plasma glucose, lipid and thyroid function parameters were collected. Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) were rated for most of the patients. Results: Of these MDD inpatients, 20.14% had attempted suicide during the past 1 month. Compared to those who had not attempted suicide, the suicide attempters had a significantly longer duration of illness, lower low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lower total cholesterol, and more psychotic symptoms. However, all these significant results did not survive after the bonferroni correction (all p &gt; 0.05). A logistic regression analysis indicated that suicide attempts were associated with the lower total cholesterol and more psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis of the association of low plasma cholesterol level and recent suicidal attempts in patients with MDD.

195,An evaluation of large group cognitive behaviour therapy with mindfulness (CBTm) classes,"Background: Ensuring equitable and timely access to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is challenging within Canada’s service delivery model. The current study aims to determine acceptability and effectiveness of 4-session, large, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with Mindfulness (CBTm) classes. Methods: A retrospective chart review of adult outpatients ( n = 523) who attended CBTm classes from 2015 to 2016. Classes were administered in a tertiary mental health clinic in Winnipeg, Canada and averaged 24 clients per session. Primary outcomes were (a) acceptability of the classes and retention rates and (b) changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) scales. Results: Clients found classes useful and &gt; 90% expressed a desire to attend future sessions. The dropout rate was 37.5%. A mixed-effects linear regression demonstrated classes improved anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score change per class = − 0.52 [95%CI, − 0.74 to − 0.30], P &lt; 0.001) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score change per class = − 0.65 [95%CI, − 0.89 to − 0.40], P &lt; 0.001). Secondary analysis found reduction in scores between baseline and follow-up to be 2.40 and 1.98 for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Effect sizes were small for all analyses. Conclusions: This study offers preliminary evidence suggesting CBTm classes are an acceptable strategy to facilitate access and to engage and maintain clients’ interest in pursuing CBT. Clients attending CBTm classes experienced improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Symptom improvement was not clinically significant. Study limitations, such as a lack of control group, should be addressed in future research.

196,Protocol for a randomized controlled dismantling study of an internet-based intervention for depressive symptoms: Exploring the contribution of behavioral activation and positive psychotherapy strategies,"Background: There are evidence-based interventions for depression that include different components. However, the efficacy of their therapeutic components is unknown. Another important issue related to depression interventions is that, up to now, their therapeutic components have only focused on reducing negative symptoms rather than on improving positive affect and well-being. Because the low levels of positive affect are more strongly linked to depression than to other emotional disorders, it is important to include this variable as an important treatment target. Positive psychotherapeutic strategies (PPs) could help in this issue. The results obtained so far are consistent and promising, showing that Internet-based interventions are effective in treating depression. However, most of them are also multi-component, and it is important to make progress in investigating what each component contributes to the intervention. Methods: The current study will be a three-armed, simple-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial with a dismantling design. 192 participants will be randomly assigned to: a) an Internet-based Global Protocol condition, which includes traditional therapeutic components of evidence-based treatments for depression (Motivation for change, Psychoeducation, Cognitive Therapy, Behavioral Activation (BA), Relapse Prevention) and PPs component, offering strategies to enhance positive mood and promote psychological strengths; b) an Internet-based BA Protocol condition (without the PPs component), and c) an Internet-based PPs Protocol condition (without the BA component). Primary outcome measures will be the BDI-II and PANAS. Secondary outcomes will include other variables such as depression, anxiety and stress, quality of life, resilience, and wellbeing related measures. Treatment acceptance and usability will also be measured. Participants will be assessed at pre-, post-treatment, 3-, 6- and 12- month follow- ups. The data will be analyzed based on the Intention-to-treat principle. Per protocol analyses will also be performed. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized dismantling intervention study for depression with the aim of exploring the contribution of a PPs component and the BA component in an Internet-based intervention. The three protocols are online interventions, helping to reach many people who need psychological treatments and otherwise would not have access to them.

197,HELP@APP: development and evaluation of a self-help app for traumatized Syrian refugees in Germany—A study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Syrians represent the largest group among refugees in Germany. Many of them were exposed to sequential traumatizing events including war, escape and post-migration stressors, which significantly increase the risk to develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress and other mental disorders. However, there is a lack of adequate treatment options for traumatized refugees in Germany. Moreover, their access to psychosocial care is often restricted due to legal regulation, language barriers, and unclear cost coverage. We therefore aim to develop a low-threshold supportive self-help app for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress symptoms. By conducting a randomized controlled trial, we further aim to evaluate the apps’ efficacy, usability, acceptance, and economic health benefit/cost-effectiveness. Methods: We will develop a modular, interactive self-help app in Arabic, which will be grounded on cognitive-behavioral models for the treatment of posttraumatic stress. Subsequently, screened positive (i.e., Syrian refugees, 18–65 years old, mild to moderate posttraumatic stress symptomatology as quantified by the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5/PDS-5) participants (ideally up to n = 234) will be randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and control group (CG), respectively. Participants in the IG will gain access to the self-help app for one month, while participants in the CG will receive psychoeducational reading material in form of a comprehensive brochure on traumatization and posttraumatic stress. Measurements are scheduled before the intervention (T0), directly after the intervention (T1, one month later) and three months after the intervention (T2). Using linear mixed effect models, we will investigate change in posttraumatic symptomatology. We will also test for changes in secondary outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Moreover, we will inspect the usability and user acceptance of the app. To evaluate the app in terms of its economic health benefit, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated.

Thus, the app can help to add-on to routine care, which currently lacks sufficient and appropriate treatment options for Syrian refugees.

198,Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and treatment as usual in bipolar disorder,"Background: Despite multiple pharmacological interventions, many people with bipolar disorder (BD) experience substantial residual mood symptoms, even in the absence of severe mood episodes, which have a negative impact on the course of illness and quality of life. Limited data are available on how to optimize treatment for BD, especially for those who suffer from persistent and residual depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a psychological treatment option for BD. This study aims to investigate whether adding MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) will result in symptomatic and functional improvements in adults with BD compared to TAU alone. Methods/design: This study is a prospective, evaluator blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of MBCT + TAU and TAU alone in 160 adults with bipolar type I and type II. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), mid-treatment (Tmid), and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), 12 (T4), and 15 (T5) months follow-up. Primary outcome is post-treatment severity of depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician administered). Secondary outcomes are severity of (hypo) manic symptoms, anxiety, relapse rates, overall functioning, positive mental health, and cost-effectiveness. As possible mediators will be assessed rumination of negative affect, dampening and rumination of positive affect, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Discussion: This study will provide valuable insight into the (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT on clinician- and self-rated symptoms of BD, relapse rates, positive mental health, and overall functioning.

Petter Gustavsson, Ingrid Agartz and Erik G. Jönsson ( BMC Psychiatry , 2018[Feb][27], Vol 18[54]). After publication of the original article, it was brought to our attention that some of the numbers in Table 3 were incorrectly reported due to data entry errors. The corrected Table 3 can be found in the erratum—Modified values are marked with bold. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-08950-001). Background: Personality is considered as an important aspect in persons with psychotic disorders. Several studies have investigated personality in schizophrenia. However, no study has investigated stability of personality traits exceeding three years in patients with schizophrenia. This study aims to investigate the stability of personality traits over a five-year period among patients with schizophrenia and non-psychotic individuals and to evaluate case-control differences. Methods: Patients with psychotic disorders ( n = 36) and non-psychotic individuals ( n = 76) completed Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP) at two occasions five years apart. SSP scores were analysed for effect of time and case-control differences by multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and within-subjects correlation. Results: MANCOVA within-subjects analysis did not show any effect of time. Thus, SSP mean scale scores did not significantly vary during the five-year interval. Within subject correlations (Spearman) ranged 0.30–0.68 and 0.54–0.75 for the different SSP scales in patients and controls, respectively. Patients scored higher than controls in SSP scales Somatic Trait Anxiety, Psychic Trait Anxiety, Stress Susceptibility, Lack of Assertiveness, Detachment, Embitterment, and Mistrust. Conclusion: The stability of the SSP personality trait was reasonably high among patients with psychotic disorder, although lower than among non-psychotic individuals, which is in accordance with previous research.

200,The cytokine profile of women with severe anxiety and depression during pregnancy,"Background: Controversial findings regarding the association between pro-inflammatory cytokines and depression have been reported in pregnant subjects. Scarce data about anxiety and its relationships with cytokines are available in pregnant women. To understand the association between anxiety and cytokines during pregnancy, we conducted the present study in women with or without depression. Methods: Women exhibiting severe depression (SD) and severe anxiety (SA) during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy ( n = 139) and control subjects exhibiting neither depression nor anxiety ( n = 40) were assessed through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Serum cytokines were measured by a multiplex bead-based assay. Correlation tests were used to analyze the data and comparisons between groups were performed. A general linear model of analysis of variance was constructed using the group as a dependent variable, interleukin concentrations as independent variables, and HDRS/HARS scores and gestational weeks as covariables. Results: The highest levels of Th1- (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ), Th17- (IL-17A, IL-22), and Th2- (IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13) related cytokines were observed in women with SD + SA. The SA group showed higher concentrations of Th1- (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ) and Th2- (IL-4, and IL-10) related cytokines than the controls. Positive correlations were found between HDRS and IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in the SA group ( p &lt; 0.03), and between HDRS and Th1- (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α), Th2- (IL-9, IL-10, IL-13) and Th17- (IL-17A) cytokines ( p &lt; 0.05) in the SD + SA group. After controlling the correlation analysis by gestational weeks, the correlations that remained significant were: HDRS and IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-17A in the SD + SA group ( p &lt; 0.03). HARS scores correlated with IL-17A in the SA group and with IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-2 in the SD + SA group ( p &lt; 0.02). The linear model of analysis of variance showed that HDRS and HARS scores influenced cytokine concentrations; only IL-6 and TNF-α could be explained by the group. Conclusions: We found that the cytokine profiles differ when comparing pregnant subjects exhibiting SA with comorbid SD against those showing only SA without depression.

201,Searching for the optimal number of response alternatives for the distress scale of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire,"Background: The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization. Prior to computing scale scores from the item scores, the three highest response alternatives (‘Regularly’, ‘Often’, and ‘Very often or constantly present’) are usually collapsed into one category to reduce the influence of extreme responding on item- and scale scores. In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of this transformation for the distress scale based on a variety of criteria. Methods: Specifically, by using the Graded Response Model, we investigated the effect of this transformation on model fit, local measurement precision, and various indicators of the scale’s validity to get an indication on whether the current practice of recoding should be advocated or not. In particular, the effect on the convergent- (operationalized by the General Health Questionnaire and the Maastricht Questionnaire), divergent- (operationalized by the Neuroticism scale of the NEO-FFI), and predictive validity (operationalized as obtrusion with daily chores and activities, the Biographical Problem list and the Utrecht Burnout Scale) of the distress scale was investigated. Results: Results indicate that recoding leads to (i) better model fit as indicated by lower mean probabilities of exact test statistics assessing item fit, (ii) small (&lt; .02) losses in the sizes of various validity coefficients, and (iii) a decrease (DIFF (SE’s) = .10–.25) in measurement precision for medium and high levels of distress. Conclusions: For clinical applications and applications in longitudinal research, the current practice of recoding should be avoided because recoding decreases measurement precision for medium and high levels of distress. It would be interesting to see whether this advice also holds for the three other domains of the 4DSQ.

202,"""After the Fort McMurray wildfire there are significant increases in mental health symptoms in grade 7–12 students compared to controls"": Correction","Reports an error in ""After the Fort McMurray wildfire there are significant increases in mental health symptoms in grade 7–12 students compared to controls"" by Matthew R. G. Brown, Vincent Agyapong, Andrew J. Greenshaw, Ivor Cribben, Pamela Brett-MacLean, Julie Drolet, Caroline McDonald-Harker, Joy Omeje, Monica Mankowsi, Shannon Noble, Deborah Kitching and Peter H. Silverstone ( BMC Psychiatry , 2019[Jan][10], Vol 19[18]). After publication of the original article, the authors reported an error in Table 2. The Probable depression value on the 8 th row of the table should have an asterisk as follows: Probable depression 31% 17% 0.00001 *. This is to indicate that this p-value is statistically significant after multiple comparison correction. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-01960-001). Background: In order to examine the impact of disasters on adolescent mental health, this study compared population mental health survey data from two communities in Alberta, Canada: Fort McMurray, which experienced a major natural disaster, and Red Deer, which did not. Methods: Data from 3070 grade 7–12 students from Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada (collected in 2017, 18 months after the 2016 wildfire) was compared with data from 2796 grade 7–12 students from Red Deer, Alberta, Canada (collected in 2014). The same measurement scales were used for both surveys. Both of these cities have populations of approximately 100,000, and both cities are located in Alberta, Canada. For this reason, Red Deer is an appropriate non-disaster impacted community to compare to the disaster impacted community of Fort McMurray. Results: The results of this comparison demonstrate that mental health symptoms were statistically significantly elevated in the Fort McMurray population when compared to the control population in Red Deer. This occurred for scores consistent with a diagnosis of depression (31% vs. 17%), moderately severe depression (17% vs. 9%), suicidal thinking (16% vs. 4%), and tobacco use (13% vs. 10%). Consistent with there being major mental health impacts from the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, self-esteem scores and quality of life scores were also statistically significantly lower in Fort McMurray. While the rates of anxiety disorder were similar (15% vs. 16%), the mean scores on the anxiety scale were slightly higher, with this difference reaching statistical significance. There were no statistical differences in the rates or scores for alcohol or substance use. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous findings showing a significant negative impact of disasters on many aspects of adolescent mental, with a particular increase in symptoms related to depression and suicidal thinking. These findings highlight first, the need to identify adolescents most at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms after experiencing the trauma of disaster and second, the importance and necessity of implementing short and long term mental health intervention programs specifically aimed at adolescents, in order to help mitigate the negative effects of disasters on their mental health.

203,"Efficacy and feasibility of a humor training for people suffering from depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorder: A randomized controlled trial","Background: Humor trainings have positive effects on mental health and well-being. However, studies investigating the effects of humor trainings in clinical samples are still rare. This study investigated the efficacy and feasibility of a humor training for people suffering from depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. Methods: Based on a diagnostic interview (SCID I and II), 37 people were randomized into a training ( n = 19) or wait list control group ( n = 18) and completed questionnaires at pre, post, and 1 month follow-up. After the training group had completed its training and evaluation measures, the wait list control group received the training and the outcomes of the group were additionally evaluated (post2 and follow-up2). Results: After training, improvements in humor-related outcomes were observed for the training group, but these were relativized when compared to the wait list control group. Secondary outcomes remained unaffected by the training. In addition, the training group reported interpersonal difficulties. Within-group analyses of the wait list control group after completion of their training showed effects on almost all primary and secondary outcomes and feedback indicated a better atmosphere. Conclusions: In summary, the different outcomes of the two groups are surprising and can show potential moderators of efficacy, such as interpersonal and group-specific climate variables. Since moderators of humor trainings in clinical samples have not been investigated at all, future studies should consider integrating them into their design.

204,Associations of mood symptoms with NYHA functional classes in angina pectoris patients: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent and associated with a worse prognosis in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. However, the influence of disease severity on mood symptoms is unknown. The specific associations of mood symptoms with NYHA classes remain unexplored. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive inpatients with angina pectoris (AP) confirmed by angiography were included into analysis. Somatic and cognitive symptom scores derived from Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to assess mood symptoms. Predictors for depression and anxiety with strict and lax standards were compared. We hypothesized NYHA classification to be an indicator of disease severity through analyses with clinical features using ordinal logistic model. Applying both binary and ordinal logistic models, we evaluated the associations of mood symptoms with NYHA classes. Results: Discrepancy of disease severity existed between the depressed and nondepressed. NYHA classification was proved to be an integrated index under influence of age, coronary stenosis, heart failure and diabetes. NYHA class I and II individuals with AP were at equivalent risk for depression (NYHA II vs I: binary model OR 1.32 (0.59,2.96), p = 0.50; ordinal model OR 1.17 (0.73,1.88), p = 0.52), however NYHA class III/IV patients shared a sharply higher risk (NYHA III/IV vs I: binary model OR 3.32 (1.28,8.61), p = .013; ordinal model OR 3.94 (2.11,7.36), p &lt; .001). Analyses on somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms confirmed this finding and hinted a greater impact of education background on mood when patient’s condition is unstable. Anxiety seemed in the whole picture irrelevant with NYHA classes. Comparing with NYHA class I/II, AP patients in NYHA class III/IV tended to be less anxious. However, when CHD became unstable, the calmness may immediately be broken up. A great distinction of the ratio of anxiety and depression symptom scores between NYHA class III/IV stable and unstable AP patients ( p = .018) was observed. Conclusions: Mood symptoms in CHD patients are to a great extend derived from disease itself. Only for patients with relatively serious physical condition, unexpected discomforts caused by disease notably impact the emotions. Education background tends to influence the mood especially when disease is still unstable.

205,Prevalence of mental disorders and epidemiological associations in post-conflict primary care attendees: A cross-sectional study in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka,"Background: Experiencing conflict and displacement can have a negative impact on an individual’s mental health. Currently, prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs) at the primary care level in post-conflict areas within the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is unknown. We aimed to explore this prevalence in conflict-affected populations attending primary care, using a structured package of validated screening tools for MHDs. Methods: This cross-sectional study aimed to determine factors related to mental health disorders at the primary care level in Northern Province, Sri Lanka. A structured interview was conducted with internally displaced adults attending 25 randomly selected primary care facilities across all districts of Northern Sri Lanka (Jaffna, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya). Participants were screened for depression, anxiety, psychosis, PTSD, and somatoform symptoms. Results: Among 533 female and 482 male participants (mean age 53.2 years), the prevalence rate for any MHD was 58.8% (95% CI, 53.8–61.4), with 42.4% screening positive for two or more disorders (95% CI, 38.6–46.1). Anxiety prevalence was reported at 46.7% (95% CI, 41.9–51.5), depression at 41.1% (95% CI, 38.7–44.5), PTSD at 13.7% (95% CI, 10.6–16.8), somatoform symptoms at 27.6% (95% CI, 23.6–31.5), and psychosis with hypomania at 17.6% (95% CI, 13.3–21.9). Conclusion: This is the first study at the primary care level to investigate prevalence of MHDs among conflict-affected populations in the Northern Province, Sri Lanka. Results highlight unmet mental health needs in the region. Training intervention to integrate mental health services into primary care is planned.

206,"Cognitive predictors of treatment outcome for exposure therapy: Do changes in self-efficacy, self-focused attention, and estimated social costs predict symptom improvement in social anxiety disorder?","Background: Cognitions play an important role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: To investigate whether changes in cognitions during the first six sessions of exposure therapy are associated with treatment outcome, we assessed reported self-focused attention, self-efficacy in social situations, and estimated social costs in 60 participants ( M age = 36.9 years) diagnosed with SAD who received in vivo or virtual reality exposure therapy. Results: Patients demonstrating a greater decrease in estimated social costs during treatment reported greater improvement of their social anxiety symptoms following both forms of exposure therapy. While changes in self-focused attention and social self-efficacy during treatment were significantly associated with treatment outcome when examined individually, these changes did not significantly predict symptom improvement beyond social costs. Conclusions: Changes in estimated social costs during treatment are associated with improvement of social anxiety symptoms after exposure therapy. Future research needs to further investigate estimated social costs as a predictor in relation to other cognitive variables.

207,The impact of the Paris terrorist attacks on the mental health of resident physicians,"Background: On November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks took place in Paris. One hundred and twenty-nine people were immediately killed and 302 needed emergency care. Many resident physicians were on the front line of the medical response. Our aim was to report the frequency of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression among resident physicians after the Paris terrorist attacks. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires, including the Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), were emailed two months after the attacks to 2413 Parisian resident physicians. Exposure to the attacks was defined as having direct clinical contact with one of the victims up to one week after the attacks, being one of the victims, or having one among close relatives. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 680 (28.2%) residents. Eighty-four (12.4%) reported symptoms of PTSD (IES-R ≥ 33), 76 (11.2%) reported symptoms of anxiety (HADS anxiety score &gt; 10) and 16 (2.4%) reported symptoms of depression (HADS depression score &gt; 10). Exposed residents had higher IES-R scores than non-exposed residents (18.8 ± 16.6 versus 14.2 ± 12.0, p = 0.001), and 40 (18.5%) of them reported symptoms of PTSD, compared to 44 (9.5%) of the non-exposed residents ( p = 0.001). Conclusions: There was a high frequency of symptoms of mental distress among our respondents. Dedicated screening and care strategies must be considered in the event of new attacks.

208,Cannabidiol enhancement of exposure therapy in treatment refractory patients with phobias: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Phobic anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and are burdensome in terms of loss of quality of life and work productivity. Evidence-based treatments are relatively successful in the majority of patients, especially exposure therapy. However, a substantial subset of patients fails to achieve or stay in remission. Preclinical and genetic research have yielded evidence that the cannabinoid system is involved in the extinction of fear, presumed to underlie the beneficial effects of exposure therapy in phobic disorders. A cannabinoid constituent that may enhance endocannabinoid signaling is cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis. Hence, the addition of CBD to exposure therapy is expected to strengthen effects of treatment. To determine the added benefit of CBD on exposure therapy, we conduct a randomized controlled trial, in which patients in whom previous treatment as usual has not yielded sufficient response receive either CBD or placebo preceding 8 exposure sessions in a double-blind fashion. A subsidiary aim is to explore which (combination of) clinical, behavioral and genetic profiles of patients are related to treatment response. Methods/design: This is an 8-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-two patients with social phobia or panic disorder with agoraphobia with incomplete response to earlier treatment will be included from outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. Patients are randomized to augmentation of exposure therapy with 300 mg CBD or placebo. The study medication is administered orally, 2 h preceding each of the eight 90 min exposure sessions. Measurements will take place at baseline, first administration of medication, every session, mid-treatment, last administration of medication, post-treatment and at 3 and 6 months’ follow-up. The primary outcome measure is the score on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ). In addition, determinants of the expected treatment enhancing effect of CBD will be explored. Discussion: This is the first trial to investigate whether the addition of CBD to exposure therapy is effective in reducing phobic symptoms in treatment refractory patients with social phobia or panic disorder with agoraphobia.

209,The GET READY relapse prevention programme for anxiety and depression: A mixed-methods study protocol,"Background: Since anxiety and depressive disorders often recur, self-management competencies are crucial for improving the long-term course of anxiety and depressive disorders. However, few relapse prevention programmes are available that focus on improving self-management. E-health combined with personal contact with a mental health professional in general practice might be a promising approach for relapse prevention. In this protocol, the GET READY (Guided E-healTh for RElapse prevention in Anxiety and Depression) study will be described in which a relapse prevention programme is developed, implemented and evaluated. The aim of the study is to determine patients’ usage of the programme and the associated course of their symptoms, to examine barriers and facilitators of implementation, and to assess patients’ satisfaction with the programme. Methods: Participants are discharged from mental healthcare services, and are in complete or partial remission. They receive access to an E-health platform, combined with regular contact with a mental health professional in general practices. Online questionnaires will be completed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 9 months. Also, semi-structured qualitative individual interviews and focus group interviews will be conducted with patients and mental health professionals. Discussion: This mixed-methods observational cohort study will provide insights into the use of a relapse prevention programme in relation to the occurrence of symptoms, as well as in its implementation and evaluation. Using the results of this study, the relapse prevention programme can be adapted in accordance with the needs of patients and mental health professionals. If this programme is shown to be acceptable, a randomized controlled trial may be conducted to test its efficacy.

210,Effects of surgical repair of obstetric fistula on severity of depression and anxiety in Ethiopia,"Background: The surgical repair of fistula can address the physical symptoms, but may not end the psychological challenges that women with fistula face. There are a few studies that focus on women with this condition in Ethiopia. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of surgical repair of obstetric fistula on the severity of depression and anxiety in women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. Method: The study employed a longitudinal study design to investigate the changes in 219 women with obstetric fistula admitted to six fistula management hospitals in Ethiopia. The data were collected on admission of the patients for obstetric fistula surgical repair and at the end of six-month post repair. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain socio-demographic information and medical history of the respondents. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales. The data was entered using Epi-Data software and then exported to SPSS for further analysis. The Mann-Whitney-U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Paired t-test were performed to measure the change in psychological symptoms after surgical repair. Result: Though 219 respondents were interviewed pre-obstetric fistula surgical repair, only 200 completed their follow up. On admission, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 91 and 79% respectively. After surgical repair, the prevalence rate was 27 and 26%. The differences in the prevalence of screen-positive women were statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The study concluded that the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms decrease post-obstetric fistula surgical repair. However, a woman with continued leaking after surgery seems to have higher psychological distress than those who are fully cured. Clinicians should manage women with obstetric fistula through targeted and integrated mental health interventions to address their mental health needs.

211,Somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with coronary artery disease—A secondary analysis of the SPIRR-CAD study,"Background: Depressive symptoms are common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are associated with an unfavourable outcome. Establishing prognostic patient profiles prior to the beginning of mental health care may facilitate higher efficacy of targeted interventions. The aim of the current study was to identify sociodemographic and somatic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with CAD. Methods: Based on the dataset of the multicentre SPIRR-CAD randomised controlled trial ( n = 570 patients with CAD and ≥ 8 points on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), 141 potential sociodemographic and somatic predictors of the change in the HADS-D depression score from baseline to 18-month-follow-up were derived in two different ways. We screened for univariable association with response, using either analysis of (co)variance or logistic regression, respectively, both adjusted for baseline HADS-D value and treatment group. To guard against overfitting, multivariable association was evaluated by a linear or binomial (generalised) linear model with lasso regularisation, a machine learning approach. Outcome measures were the change in continuous HADS-D depression scores, as well as three established binary criteria. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated to assess possible influences of comorbidities on our results and was also entered in our machine learning approach. Results: Higher age ( p = 0.002), unknown previous myocardial infarction ( p = 0.013), and a higher heart rate variability during numeracy tests ( p = .020) were univariably associated with a favourable depression outcome, whereas hyperuricemia ( p ≤ 0.003), higher triglycerides ( p = 0.014), NYHA class III ( p ≤ 0.028), state after resuscitation ( p ≤ 0.042), intake of thyroid hormones ( p = 0.007), antidiabetic drugs ( p = 0.015), analgesic drugs ( p = 0.027), beta blockers (p = 0.035), uric acid drugs ( p ≤ 0.039), and anticholinergic drugs ( p = 0.045) were associated with an adverse effect on the HADS-D depression score. In all analyses, no significant differences between study arms could be found and physical comorbidities also had no significant influence on our results. Conclusion: Our findings may contribute to identification of somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome in patients with CAD. The unexpected effects of specific medication require further clarification and further research is needed to establish a causal association between depression outcome and our predictors.

212,MyCompass in a Swedish context—Lessons learned from the transfer of a self-guided intervention targeting mental health problems,"Background: Depression and anxiety is a major public health problem, in Sweden and internationally. Internet-based interventions are increasingly acknowledged as promising approaches for individuals with varying degrees of mental health problems. We present findings from the implementation of myCompass , a fully automated self-guided intervention of Australian origin, in a Swedish context. Methods: We ( i ) share our experience of the E-health study platform (i.e., regarding security aspects, functionality) to which the myCompass intervention was linked, and ( ii ) report findings from the empirical evaluation of myCompass (i.e., prerequisites, execution, study outcomes), in a community sample of individuals ( N = 837) reporting mild-to-moderate levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Outcomes were calculated with repeated measures ANOVA and linear mixed models. Results: The E-health study platform proved to be an efficient tool enabling randomization, informed consent and evaluation to be administered in a fully automated manner. The study rendered substantial interest initially with 1207 individuals enrolling, however it failed to maintain engagement of those enrolled with only few participants logging in more than once or twice following registration. A smaller subgroup of “active users” ( n = 35) had a markedly higher activity in the program, however their treatment results were not significantly better than those of the control group. Conclusion: Based on the large number of dropouts and also modest use of the intervention overall, only tentative speculations can be made regarding its effectiveness in a Swedish context. The number of individuals remaining active in the intervention is much more limited that the number of individuals initially signing up. Moreover, the transportation of interventions across countries and cultures may need more careful consideration, and pilot-trials before attempting large-scale trials are recommended.

213,Clinical guidelines for the management of depression with specific comorbid psychiatric conditions French recommendations from experts (the French Association for Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology and the fondation FondaMental),"Background: Recommendations for pharmacological treatments of major depression with specific comorbid psychiatric conditions are lacking. Method: The French Association for Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology and the fondation FondaMental developed expert consensus guidelines for the management of depression based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriatneness Method. Recommendations for lines of treatment are provided by the scientific committee after data analysis and interpretation of the results of a survey of 36 psychiatrist experts in the field of major depression and its treatments. Results: The expert guidelines combine scientific evidence and expert clinician’s opinion to produce recommendations for major depression with comorbid anxiety disorders, personality disorders or substance use disorders and in geriatric depression. Conclusion: These guidelines provide direction addressing common clinical dilemmas that arise in the pharmacologic treatment of major depression with comorbid psychiatric conditions.

214,More than depression: A multi-dimensional assessment of postpartum distress symptoms before and after a residential early parenting program,"Introduction: Parents are vulnerable to psychological distress symptoms in the postpartum period. It is routine to screen for depressive symptoms, but anxiety, stress, fatigue, irritability and insomnia symptoms are less often assessed despite their prevalence. This study aimed to assess multiple dimensions of psychological distress, and their reliable change and clinically significant change among women admitted to a residential program for assistance with unsettled infant behaviors (UIB). Method: Women admitted to a five-night residential early parenting program completed self-report measures: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Irritability Depression Anxiety Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index. A sub-group completed a computerized emotional Go-NoGo (EGNG) task as a measure of emotional impulsivity. Results: Seventy-eight women were recruited ( M age = 34.46, SD age = 4.16). On admission, 48% of women reported clinically elevated depressive symptoms and 97.5% of women not reporting elevated depressive symptoms reported clinical elevations in at least one other form of distress. Upon discharge, all self-report distress symptoms were significantly reduced (all p -values &lt;.001), but reliable and clinically significant change only occurred in a subgroup of women. There were no significant changes in indicators of impulsivity based on the EGNG. Conclusions: In addition to, and often in the absence of, depressive symptoms, women attending an early parenting program experienced a wide range of psychological distress, including fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and stress. Different forms of distress improved in different magnitudes to the treatment provided. These findings highlight the need for a multi-dimensional approach in the assessment and treatment of postpartum distress.

McDowell, Jaclyn M. White Hughto and Sari L. Reisner ( BMC Psychiatry , 2019[Jan][9], Vol 19[16]). Following publication of the original article, errors were discovered in NSSI prevalence and Annual household income. The correct information is provided. In addition, it is noted that the second author’s name should be written as Jaclyn M.W. Hughto. The name appears correctly in this record, and has been corrected in the original record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-01660-001). Background: Trans-masculine (TM) individuals, who are assigned female sex at birth and identify along the masculine gender spectrum, face mental health disparities relative to cisgender people. Limited research has sought to explore the multi-level risk and protective factors associated with mental health morbidity for TM populations. Methods: Between August 2015–September 2016, 150 TM adults were enrolled in a one-time biobehavioral health study. A survey assessed socio-demographics, past 12-month everyday discrimination, lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV), resilience (using the Brief Resilience Scale), and other factors. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations between participant characteristics and four mental health statuses: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results: In this sample (76.7% had a binary gender identity, i.e., man or transgender man; 74.7% were white, 70.0% were under age 30 years), 42.2% had PTSD based on past 30-day symptoms; 25.7% had depression based on past 7-day symptoms; 31.1% had anxiety based on past 7-day symptoms; and 31.3% had engaged in NSSI within the past 12-months. Results from multivariable models: 1) PTSD: unemployment, lifetime IPV and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with increased odds of PTSD, while having a partner was associated with the reduced odds of PTSD. 2) Depression: lower educational attainment and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with the increased odds of depression, while greater resilience was associated with the reduced odds of depression. 3) Anxiety: low annual household income and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with the increased odds of anxiety, while resilience was associated with the reduced odds of anxiety. 4) NSSI: past 12-month discrimination was associated with the increased odds of past 12-month NSSI, while higher age and greater resilience was associated with the reduced odds of NSSI (all p -values &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Unemployment, low income, limited education, everyday discrimination, and violence were risk factors for poor mental health, while being in a relationship, higher age, and personal resilience were protective against mental health morbidity. Findings highlight the need for interventions to address the individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that may be driving poor mental health in this population.

216,Prevalence and determinants of symptoms of antenatal common mental disorders among women who had recently experienced an earthquake: A systematic review,"Background: Antenatal common mental disorders (CMDs) including anxiety, depressive, adjustment, and somatoform disorders are prevalent worldwide. There is emerging evidence that experiencing a natural disaster might increase the risk of antenatal CMDs. This study aimed to synthesise the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMDs among women who had recently experienced an earthquake. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The search included both electronic and manual components. Five major databases were searched. A data extraction table was used to summarise study characteristics and findings. Two authors examined the quality of studies independently using a quality assessment tool. A narrative synthesis of the findings is reported. Results: In total seven articles met inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from six to seven out of ten. All the studies were cross-sectional surveys and were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Sample sizes varied among studies. The prevalence of clinically-significant symptoms of antenatal CMD ranged from 4.6% (95% CI, 3.2; 6.5) experiencing ‘psychological stress’ in Japan to 40.8% (95% CI, 35.5; 46.4) ‘depression’ in China. While all studies were conducted in an earthquake context, only four examined some aspect of earthquake experiences as a risk factor for antenatal CMDs. In multivariable analyses, higher marital conflict, poor social support, multiparity, stresses of pregnancy and the personality characteristic of a negative coping style were identified as risks and a positive coping style as protective against antenatal CMDs. Conclusions: This systematic review found that women who have recently experienced an earthquake are at heightened risk of antenatal mental health problems. It indicates that in addition to the establishment of services for safe birth which is recognised in post-disaster management strategies, pregnancy mental health should be a priority. The review also revealed that there is no evidence available from the world’s low-income nations where natural disasters might have more profound impacts because local infrastructure is more fragile and where it is already established that women experience a higher burden of antenatal CMDs.

217,"Effectiveness of a self-management training for patients with chronic and treatment resistant anxiety or depressive disorders on quality of life, symptoms, and empowerment: Results of a randomized controlled trial","Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common mental disorders. A substantial part of patients does not achieve symptomatic remission after treatment in specialized services. Current care as usual (CAU) for these patients consists of long-term supportive contacts. Termination of CAU is often not considered to be an option due to persistent symptoms, a low level of functioning, and the absence of further treatment options. A new intervention, ZemCAD, offers a program focused on rehabilitation and self-management, followed by referral back to primary care. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial was carried out in twelve specialized outpatient mental health care services in the Netherlands. Consenting and eligible patients were invited for the MINI interview and the baseline questionnaire. Assessments were done at 6 (T1), 12 (T2) and 18 (T3) months post baseline. We used linear mixed model analysis (LMM) to ascertain the effectiveness of the ZemCAD group relative to the CAU group on quality of life, symptom severity and empowerment. Results: In total 141 patients were included. The results at 18-month follow-up regarding to quality of life and symptom severity, showed no significant differences between the ZemCAD group and the CAU group, except on the ‘social relationships’-domain ( d = 0.37). With regard to empowerment a significant difference between both groups was observed in the total empowerment score and one empowerment dimension (d = 0.45 and d = 0.39, respectively). After the ZemCAD intervention, more patients went from specialized outpatient mental health services back to a less specialized health care setting with less intensive treatment, such as primary care. Conclusion: The findings in this study suggest that patients with chronic and treatment-resistant anxiety and depression using the ZemCAD intervention improve on empowerment but not on symptom severity or quality of life. Since little is known about the effects of rehabilitation and self-management in patients with chronic and treatment resistant anxiety and depressive disorders, this is a first attempt to provide a proof-of-concept study in this under-researched but important field.

218,An outreach collaborative model for early identification and treatment of mental disorder in Danish workplaces,"Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental disorders among the working population with potentially high personal and financial cost. The overall aim of this study was to test the applicability of an outreach collaborative model for early identification and treatment of clinical and sub-clinical mental disorders among Danish employees. This applicability was examined by I) investigating the fractions of identified and treated clinical and subclinical cases, II) describing the distribution and characteristics of cases identified and III) investigating the effect of allocated treatment. Methods: A longitudinal study design with four assessments (T0-T3) over 16 months was applied. Self-reporting questionnaires probing for psychopathology were distributed to all employees in six consecutively enrolled companies at the four time points. Employees meeting the screening criteria at T1 were assessed diagnostically. Subjects diagnosed with a clinical mental disorder were allocated to outpatient psychiatric treatment, and subjects with subclinical conditions were allocated to preventive cognitive behavioural therapy. Follow-up was conducted 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. We used chi-squared test and F-test to compare the different groups on baseline characteristics and mixed effects linear regression to analyse the treatment effects. Results: Forty (6.8%) of the 586 responders at T1 were diagnosed with a clinical mental disorder and referred to outpatient psychiatric treatment. Thirty-three (5.6%) were affected by a subclinical condition and referred to preventive treatment. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the employees diagnosed with a clinical condition had never received treatment before. Symptom severity decreased significantly for both treated groups until follow-up. When compared to a composed control group, subclinical cases displayed a more rapid initial significant symptomatic decrease on the global symptom scale (coefs = − 0.914, 95% CI [− 1.754, − 0,075]) and anxiety sub-scale (coefs = − 1.043, 95% CI [− 2.021, − 0.066]). This did not apply to the clinical cases as no significant difference in change were identified. Conclusions: The outreach collaborative model demonstrated an applicability to identify both clinical and subclinical cases, among these a high number of employees with an unmet need for treatment. We found evidence of a positive initial effect on symptomatology from the allocated preventive treatment among the subclinical cases, but not for clinical cases.

219,"Extending access to a web-based mental health intervention: Who wants more, what happens to use over time, and is it helpful? Results of a concealed, randomized controlled extension study","Background: Web-based mental health applications may be beneficial, but adoption is often low leaving optimal implementation and payment models unclear. This study examined which users were interested in extended access to a web-based application beyond an initial 3-month trial period and evaluated if an additional 3 months of access was beneficial. Methods: This study was a concealed extension of a multi-center, pragmatic randomized controlled trial that assessed the benefit of 3 months of access to the Big White Wall (BWW), an anonymous web-based moderated, multi-component mental health application offering self-directed activities and peer support. Trial participants were 16 years of age or older, recruited from hospital-affiliated mental health programs. Participants who received access to the intervention in the main trial and completed 3-month outcome assessments were offered participation. We compared those who were and were not interested in an extension of the intervention, and re-randomized consenting participants 1:1 to receive extended access or not over the subsequent 3 months. Use of the intervention was monitored in the extension group and outcomes were measured at 3 months after re-randomization in both groups. The primary outcome was mental health recovery as assessed by total score on the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS-r), as in the main trial. Linear mixed models were used to examine the time by group interaction to assess for differences in responses over the 3-month extension study. Results: Of 233 main trial participants who responded, 119 (51.1%) indicated an interest in receiving extended BWW access. Those who were interested had significantly higher baseline anxiety symptoms compared to those who were not interested. Of the 119, 112 were re-randomized (55 to extended access, 57 to discontinuation). Only 21 of the 55 extended access participants (38.2%) used the intervention during the extension period. Change in RAS-r scores over time was not significantly different between groups (time by group, F(1,77) = 1.02; P = .31). Conclusions: Only half of eligible participants were interested in extended access to the intervention with decreasing use over time, and no evidence of added benefit. These findings have implications for implementation and payment models for this type of web-based mental health intervention.

220,Comorbid tobacco and other substance use and symptoms of anxiety and depression among hospitalised orthopaedic trauma patients,"Background: No study has examined the prevalence of tobacco, other substance use, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and rates of comorbidities among the orthopaedic trauma population, despite the impact they have on recovery from surgery. This study aims to 1) describe the rates of symptoms and substance use; 2) compare rates of symptoms and substance use among smokers versus non-smokers; and 3) examine the relationship between symptoms and substance use with smoking status. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of orthopaedic trauma patients was conducted in two Australian public hospitals. Demographic characteristics, smoking status, alcohol consumption, recent cannabis use, and symptoms of anxiety and/or depression were examined. Differences between current and non-smokers were compared using Pearson Chi² tests. Multivariate logistic regression explored variables related to tobacco smoking. Results: Eight hundred nineteen patients participated. Over one-fifth (21.8%) identified as a current smoker, half (51.8%) reported consuming alcohol at hazardous levels in the last 12 months, and about 10% stated that they had used cannabis in the last 30 days (9.7%), or experienced symptoms of either anxiety (12.4%), or depression (12.9%) in the last two weeks. Over one-fifth of current tobacco smokers (21.8%) reported drinking heavily in the last 12 months and using cannabis recently. Males, with a lower educational attainment, who were unmarried, had used cannabis recently, and report drinking heavily were more likely to be current smokers. Conclusions: Health behaviour interventions addressing comorbidities are warranted among the orthopaedic trauma population given the high rate of comorbidity and impact these may have on recovery.

221,Acceptability of psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers: A systematic review,"Background: Most of patients with dementia are cared for by family members. Caring for people with dementia is challenging; approximately 30–55% of caregivers suffered from anxiety or depressive symptoms. A range of studies have shown that psychosocial interventions are effective and can improve caregivers’ quality of life, reduce their care burden, and ease their anxiety or depressive symptoms. However, information on the acceptability of these interventions, despite being crucial, is under-reported. Methods: Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on EMBASE, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycARTICLES until August 2017 and the searches were updated on June 2018. The selection criteria included primary studies with data about the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers and publications written in English. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted study characteristics and data, assessed the methodological quality of the included studies by using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist, and conducted a narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data. Results: A total of 10,610 abstracts were identified through systematic searches. Based on screening titles and abstracts, 207 papers were identified that met the criteria for full paper review, with 42 papers from 13 different countries meeting the inclusion criteria. We found high- and moderate-quality evidence showing psychosocial interventions were acceptable, with important benefits for caregivers. Facilitators of acceptability included caregivers’ need for intervention, appropriate content and organization of the intervention, and knowledge and professionalism of the staff. Barriers to acceptability included participants’ poor health status and low education levels, caregiving burden, change of intervention implementers, and poor system performance of interventions. Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence to support the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers. However, the available supporting evidence is limited, and there is currently no adequate information from these studies indicating that the acceptability has received enough attention from researchers. More well-designed studies assessing psychosocial interventions are needed to give specific statements about acceptability, and the measure of acceptability with psychosocial interventions should be more comprehensive.

222,After the Fort McMurray wildfire there are significant increases in mental health symptoms in grade 7–12 students compared to controls,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 19[97] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2019-17405-001). After publication of the original article, the authors reported an error in Table 2. The Probable depression value on the 8 th row of the table should have an asterisk as follows: Probable depression 31% 17% 0.00001 *. This is to indicate that this p-value is statistically significant after multiple comparison correction.] Background: In order to examine the impact of disasters on adolescent mental health, this study compared population mental health survey data from two communities in Alberta, Canada: Fort McMurray, which experienced a major natural disaster, and Red Deer, which did not. Methods: Data from 3070 grade 7–12 students from Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada (collected in 2017, 18 months after the 2016 wildfire) was compared with data from 2796 grade 7–12 students from Red Deer, Alberta, Canada (collected in 2014). The same measurement scales were used for both surveys. Both of these cities have populations of approximately 100,000, and both cities are located in Alberta, Canada. For this reason, Red Deer is an appropriate non-disaster impacted community to compare to the disaster impacted community of Fort McMurray. Results: The results of this comparison demonstrate that mental health symptoms were statistically significantly elevated in the Fort McMurray population when compared to the control population in Red Deer. This occurred for scores consistent with a diagnosis of depression (31% vs. 17%), moderately severe depression (17% vs. 9%), suicidal thinking (16% vs. 4%), and tobacco use (13% vs. 10%). Consistent with there being major mental health impacts from the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, self-esteem scores and quality of life scores were also statistically significantly lower in Fort McMurray. While the rates of anxiety disorder were similar (15% vs. 16%), the mean scores on the anxiety scale were slightly higher, with this difference reaching statistical significance. There were no statistical differences in the rates or scores for alcohol or substance use. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous findings showing a significant negative impact of disasters on many aspects of adolescent mental, with a particular increase in symptoms related to depression and suicidal thinking. These findings highlight first, the need to identify adolescents most at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms after experiencing the trauma of disaster and second, the importance and necessity of implementing short and long term mental health intervention programs specifically aimed at adolescents, in order to help mitigate the negative effects of disasters on their mental health.

In addition, it is noted that the second author’s name should be written as Jaclyn M.W. Hughto. The name has been corrected in this record.] Background: Trans-masculine (TM) individuals, who are assigned female sex at birth and identify along the masculine gender spectrum, face mental health disparities relative to cisgender people. Limited research has sought to explore the multi-level risk and protective factors associated with mental health morbidity for TM populations. Methods: Between August 2015–September 2016, 150 TM adults were enrolled in a one-time biobehavioral health study. A survey assessed socio-demographics, past 12-month everyday discrimination, lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV), resilience (using the Brief Resilience Scale), and other factors. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations between participant characteristics and four mental health statuses: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results: In this sample (76.7% had a binary gender identity, i.e., man or transgender man; 74.7% were white, 70.0% were under age 30 years), 42.2% had PTSD based on past 30-day symptoms; 25.7% had depression based on past 7-day symptoms; 31.1% had anxiety based on past 7-day symptoms; and 31.3% had engaged in NSSI within the past 12-months. Results from multivariable models: 1) PTSD: unemployment, lifetime IPV and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with increased odds of PTSD, while having a partner was associated with the reduced odds of PTSD. 2) Depression: lower educational attainment and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with the increased odds of depression, while greater resilience was associated with the reduced odds of depression. 3) Anxiety: low annual household income and past 12-month discrimination were each associated with the increased odds of anxiety, while resilience was associated with the reduced odds of anxiety. 4) NSSI: past 12-month discrimination was associated with the increased odds of past 12-month NSSI, while higher age and greater resilience was associated with the reduced odds of NSSI (all p -values &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Unemployment, low income, limited education, everyday discrimination, and violence were risk factors for poor mental health, while being in a relationship, higher age, and personal resilience were protective against mental health morbidity. Findings highlight the need for interventions to address the individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that may be driving poor mental health in this population.

224,Outcomes of telephone-delivered low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy (LiCBT) to community dwelling Australians with a recent hospital admission due to depression or anxiety: Mindstep™,"Background: In 2006, the British government launched ‘Improving Access to Psychological Therapies’ (IAPT), a low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy intervention (LiCBT) designed to manage people with symptoms of anxiety and depression in the community. The evidence of the effectiveness of IAPT has been demonstrated in multiple studies from the UK, USA, Australia and other countries. MindStep™ is the first adaptation of IAPT in Australia, delivered completely by telephone, targeting people with a recent history of a hospital admission for mental illnesses within the private health system. This paper reports on the outcome of the first 17 months of MindStep™ implemented across Australia from March 2016. Methods: This prospective observational study investigated the MindStep™ program in a cohort of clients with a recent hospitalisation for mental illnesses. The study used quantitative methods to compare pre-post treatment clinical measures ( N = 680) using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). This study also included in-depth interviews with participants ( N = 14) and coaches ( N = 4) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the program. Results: Of the 867 clients referred to MindStep™, 757 had initial assessments by phone making an enrolment rate of 87.3%. Following assessment, 680 commenced treatment and of them, 427 (62.7%) completed treatment. According to ‘per-protocol’ analysis ( N = 427), there was a large effect size for post-treatment PHQ-9 (d = 1.03) and GAD-7 (d = 0.99) scores; reliable recovery rate was 62% (95% CI: 57–68%). For intent-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation ( N = 680), effect sizes were also large for pre-post treatment change: PHQ-9 (d = 0.78) and GAD-7 (d = 0.76). The reliable recovery rate was 49% (95% CI: 45–54%). Qualitative findings supported these claims where participants were positive about MindStep™ and found the telephone delivery and use of mental health coaches highly acceptable. Conclusions: MindStep™ has demonstrated encouraging outcomes that suggest LiCBT can be successfully delivered to people with a history of hospital admissions for anxiety and depressive disorders and achieve target recovery rates of &gt; 50%. Other promising evaluation findings indicate the MindStep™ option is acceptable, feasible and safe within the stepped models of mental health care delivery in Australia.

45,"Metacognitive therapy for depression: A 3-year follow-up study assessing recovery, relapse, work force participation, and quality of life","A major challenge in the treatment of depression has been high relapse rates following treatment. The current study reports results from a 3-year follow-up of patients treated with metacognitive therapy (MCT). Thirty-four of the 39 patients enrolled in the original study attended assessment (participation rate of 87%). There were large reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems, and worry, as well as metacognitive beliefs. Three patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for axis-I disorders: one with depression and two with generalized anxiety disorder. Sixty percent had not experienced any new depressive episodes in the 3-year follow-up period, and the static relapse rates were low (11–15%). Recovery rates ranged from 69 to 97% depending upon the four different criteria used. Nevertheless, 26% had sought out treatment for depression or other psychological difficulties. Most patients (70%) had experienced negative life events in the follow-up period, but these events did not influence current depression severity. Return to work outcomes were encouraging, as eight out of 13 patients that had been on benefits were no longer receiving benefits. Life satisfaction ratings showed mean scores around 70 (on a 0–100 scale) and showed a moderate to strong negative correlation with depression severity. In conclusion, MCT appears to be promising with respect to long-term effect. Randomized controlled trials should investigate if the long-term effect of MCT surpasses that of other evidence-based treatments for depression.

46,Do trait emotional intelligence and dispositional mindfulness have a complementary effect on the children’s and adolescents’ emotional states?,"Mindfulness is both a non-judgmental and present-centered awareness, which has been applied to reduce negative emotions. On the other hand, Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) is the way of how good people perceive their emotional intelligence abilities (perceiving, expressing, understanding, and regulating emotions), which are involved in people’s social functioning. This empirical study was designed to analyze whether dispositional mindfulness (DM) and TEI have a potential combined role for children and adolescent’s emotional states. In a sample of primary school students ( N = 318), age ranged from 8 to 16 years old ( M = 11.25, SD = 2.20), participants filled a TEI measure (ESCQ, Emotional skills and competence questionnaire) and two measures of DM (CAMM, Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure and AFQ-Y, Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth). Measures selected included: PANAS (Positive affect and negative affect schedule), White Bear Suppression Inventory (a thought suppression inventory), and STAIC (State-Trait Anxiety for Children). Findings pointed out that TEI measures (labeling and expression, understanding, and managing emotions) were positively and significantly related to positive emotional states (especially, positive affect and balance) and negatively with a lower association with state anxiety. However, DM measures were both negatively and strongly associated with negative emotional states (thought suppression, negative affect, and anxiety). Conclusions indicate that a combined effect of both TEI skills and DM based interventions would be more complete than each one separately for better social functioning of children and teenagers.

47,Identifying the internalizing disorder clusters among recently hospitalized cardiovascular disease patients: A receiver operating characteristics study,"Depression and anxiety disorders are common among cardiovascular disease (CVD) populations, leading several cardiology societies to recommend routine screening to streamline psychological interventions. However, it remains poorly understood whether routine screening in CVD populations identifies the broader groups of disorders that cluster together within individuals, known as anxious-misery and fear. This study examines the screening utility of four anxiety and depression questionnaires to identify the two internalizing disorder clusters; anxious-misery and fear. Patients with a recent hospital admission for CVD ( n = 85, 69.4% males) underwent a structured clinical interview with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The participants also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, Overall Anxiety Severity Impairment Scale (OASIS), and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 yielded appropriate screening properties to detect three different iterations of the anxious-misery cluster (sensitivity &gt;80.95% and specificity &gt;82.81%). The GAD-7 was the only instrument to display favorable screening properties to detect a fear cluster omitting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; sensitivity 81.25%, specificity 76.81%). These findings indicate that the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 could be implemented to reliably screen for anxious-misery disorders among CVD in-patients, however, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to detect fear disorders were contingent on the placement of PTSD and OCD within clusters. The findings are discussed in relation to routine screening guidelines in CVD populations and contemporary understandings of the internalizing disorders.

We asked each participant individually to report their expectancies about feared outcomes in public speaking situations and which of these could be tested in VRET. Each of the expectancies was categorized as being related to: (1) participants’ own reactions, (2) (overt) reactions of the audience, or (3) (covert) negative evaluation. We examined whether the proportion of testable expectancies could predict treatment outcome and which type of expectancies were evaluated as being more testable in VRET. Additionally, we experimentally manipulated retrospective reasoning about whether or not expectancies related to the overt reactions of the audience could be violated by providing verbal information after VRET about whether or not the virtual audience was interactive. A reduction in public speaking anxiety was observed from pre- to post-VRET. Treatment effects were, however, not predicted by the individually reported proportions of testable expectancies. Participants evaluated expectancies about their own reactions as being more testable in VRET compared to expectancies about reactions of the audience or about being negatively evaluated. In addition, we did not find evidence that the experimental manipulation regarding whether or not the audience was interactive influenced treatment effects. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that the effects of VRET are not univocally explained by the mechanism of expectancy violation.

49,How and when do leaders influence employees’ well-being? Moderated mediation models for job demands and resources,"Following the call of recent reviews on leadership and well-being, the purpose of this study is to examine how and when two contrasting leadership styles, transformational leadership (TFL) and passive-avoidant leadership (PAL), are related to employees’ anxiety and thereby either promote or inhibit employees’ well-being. Using the prominent job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework, we propose that the relationship between leadership behavior and anxiety is mediated by organizational job demands, namely, role ambiguity (RA), and job resources, namely, team climate for learning (TCL), as well as moderated by autonomy as important job characteristic. A sample of 501 knowledge workers, working in teams in a German research and development (R&amp;D) organization, answered an online survey. We tested moderated multiple mediation models using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results demonstrated that the relationships between TFL as well as PAL on the one hand and anxiety on the other hand were fully mediated by RA and TCL. Job autonomy moderated the quality of the leadership–job demand relationship for TFL and PAL. This paper contributes to understanding the complex relationship between leadership and followers’ well-being taking into account a combination of mediating and moderating job demands and resources. This is the first study that examines the effects of TFL and PAL on well-being taking into account the job demand RA and team processes and autonomy as resources.

50,"Trust after terror: Institutional trust among young terror survivors and their parents after the 22nd of July terrorist attack on Utøya Island, Norway","In the aftermath of terrorist attacks and disasters, public institutions play an important role in re-establishing safety and justice. However, little is known about the importance of institutional trust for victims’ potential for healing in the aftermath of mass trauma. This study examines levels of post-terror trust in the police and in the justice system among young survivors from the 2011 Utøya terror attack and their parents. Furthermore, it investigates how institutional trust develops over time among directly affected populations, and whether it is associated with psychological distress. 325 survivors and 463 parents were interviewed face-to-face at wave one (4–5 months post-terror) and 285 survivors and 435 parents at wave two (14–15 months). Levels of institutional trust in victims were compared to general population data from the European Social Survey adjusted for age, gender, and ethnic background. Measures included trust in the police and justice system, post-traumatic stress reactions, anxiety and depression, and quality of life. Trust in the police among survivors and parents was higher than or comparable to trust levels in the general population at wave one, but decreased for survivors and parents at wave two. Trust in the justice system was higher among those directly affected than in the general population, and increased from wave one to wave two. Levels of institutional trust were negatively associated with distress for survivors in both waves and for parents in wave two. Levels of institutional trust were positively associated with perceived quality of life in parents and survivors. Directly affected groups’ institutional trust differed from that of the general population following the terrorist attack, although being directly affected did not necessarily imply weakened institutional trust. This study found trust to be institution specific, however, trust in institutions changed with time, and the passing of time might be an important factor in better understanding whether trust will generalize across institutions or not. Institutional trust was negatively associated with psychological distress. This finding highlights the potential for institutions to create a healing post-disaster environment.

51,"Traumatic events, personality and psychopathology in Takotsubo syndrome: A systematic review","Objective: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a transient heart disease that has been historically related to the occurrence of psychological (emotional) factors (“broken heart” syndrome). We aimed to conduct a systematic review analyzing the role of psychological factors in TTS. Methods: All studies on TTS and psychological factors from January 1991 through April 2019 were scrutinized according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the PRISMA statements. Selected studies were additionally evaluated for the Risk of Bias according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Fifteen case-control studies (by Mayo Clinic criteria) were finally selected. Most studies analyzed stressful life-events or trauma, although with conflicting findings, while a likely role of long-lasting psychological distress seemed to be a homogenous result. Among life-time psychopathology, only anxiety appeared to have a significant role. Some studies outlined a likely role of personality, but findings are conflicting. Conclusion: Our findings do not lead to any definitive assumption on the specific role of psychological factors in TTS, also for scant strong methodology of the most part of the studies. More studies with stronger research methodology are needed to better characterize psychological elements in TTS.

52,Impact of a mindfulness-based intervention on basic psychological need satisfaction and internalized symptoms in elementary school students with severe learning disabilities: Results from a randomized cluster trial,"Background: Mindfulness is hypothesized to lead to more realistic appraisals of the three basic psychological needs, which leads people to benefit from high levels of need satisfaction or helps them make the appropriate changes to improve need satisfaction. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have also shown promise to foster greater basic psychological need satisfaction in students with learning disabilities (LDs). Objective: The goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a MBI on the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs and on internalized symptoms in students with severe LDs. A randomized cluster trial was implemented to compare the progression of need satisfaction, anxiety, and depression symptoms in participants preto post-intervention and at follow-up. Method: Elementary school students with severe LDs ( N = 23) in two special education classrooms took part in this study and were randomly attributed to either an experimental or an active control group. Results: Mixed ANOVAs first showed that the experimental condition did not moderate change over time such that similar effects were observed in the experimental and active control groups. Looking at main effects of time on participants’ scores of autonomy, competence, and relatedness across time, we found a significant within-person effect for the competence need ( p = 0.02). Post hoc analyses showed that for both groups, competence scores were significantly higher at post-intervention ( p = 0.03) and at follow-up ( p = 0.04), when compared to pre-intervention scores. A significant main effect was also found for anxiety levels over time ( p = 0.008). Post hoc analyses showed that for both groups, scores were significantly lower at post-intervention ( p = 0.01) and at follow-up ( p = 0.006), when compared to pre-intervention scores. Conclusion: Although the MBI seemed useful in increasing the basic psychological need of competence and decreasing anxiety symptoms in students with severe LDs, it was not more useful than the active control intervention that was used in this project. Future studies should verify that MBIs have an added value compared to other types of interventions that can be more easily implemented in school-based settings.

53,Tailored screening for late-life depression: A short version of the Teate Depression Inventory (TDI-E),"A number of assessment instruments have been developed as efficacy measures of geriatric depression in clinical trials but most showed several weaknesses, such as time-consuming administration, development and validation in younger populations, and lack of discrimination between anxiety and depression. Among the extant self-report measures of depression, the 21-item Teate Depression Inventory (TDI; Balsamo and Saggino, 2013), developed via Rasch analysis, showed a satisfactory level of diagnostic accuracy, and allowed the reduction of false positives in test scoring in adult population. The present study explored the potential improvement in the psychometric performance of the TDI in the elderly by item refinement through Rasch analysis in a sample of 836 elderly people (49.5% males; mean age = 73.28; SD = 6.56). A resulting shorter version was composed of the best-fitting and discriminative nine items from the full form. The Teate Depression Inventory (TDI-E) (E for elderly) presented good internal construct validity, with unidimensional structure, local dependency, good reliability (person separation index and Cronbach’s alpha), and no signs of differential item functioning or measurement bias due to gender and age (65 vs. 75+ years). Cut-off points and normative data provided could enhance the clinical usefulness of the TDI-E, which seems to be a promising valid and reliable tool for the screening of geriatric depression, with less risk of finding false positives due to overlapping of depression in elderly with other comorbid conditions.

54,Is the student-centered learning style more effective than the teacher-student double-centered learning style in improving reading performance?,"Appropriate learning styles enhance the academic performance of students. This research compares and contrasts the popular effect of teacher-student double centered learning style (TSDCLS) and student-centered learning style (SCLS) on one’s reading, including reading comprehension, inference, main idea abstraction, and reading anxiety. One hundred and fifty one students in grade 4 from three groups (two experimental groups and one control group) participated in the experiment with 18 weeks’ reading comprehension training. The results showed that, first, both learning styles contributed to students’ reading comprehension, inference, main idea abstraction, and reading anxiety. Second, the TSDCLS contributed more to reading anxiety, and the SCLS contributed more to reading comprehension. Both learning styles had similar effects on inference and main idea abstraction. From the correlation test, excluding the correlation between SCLS and reading anxiety which was not significant, all other effects were significant. These findings are discussed along with implications and ideas for future research.

Given the emotionally and physically challenging nature of their work, high rates of burnout have been reported among health care professionals. This may put them at a higher risk for of suffering from adverse mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety and stress. In our study, we aim to assess the prevalence i of and associations among burnout and job dissatisfaction and adverse mental health outcomes in a developing country, where the challenges faced by the health care system are unique. Facilities are over-burdened and there is a sharp contrast between doctor to patient ratios in developing and developed countries. We plan to conduct a cross sectional study at the largest tertiary care hospital in Pakistan and its peripheral affiliated health centers. A proportionate sampling technique will be employed to include medical and nursing students, interns, residents and consultants. Previously validated questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout tool, DASS 21, and Job Satisfaction Survey will be disseminated through Survey Monkey. Statistical analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 to study the association among burnout, job dissatisfaction, adverse health outcomes and demographic and work-related factors This study may begin laying the foundation for prioritizing the novel concept of physician mental health in the developing world.

56,"My dream, my rules: Can lucid dreaming treat nightmares?","Nightmares are defined as repeated occurrences of extremely dysphoric and well-remembered dreams that usually involve subjective threats to survival, security, or physical integrity. Generally, they occur during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and lead to awakenings with distress and insufficient overnight sleep. Nightmares may occur spontaneously (idiopathic) or as recurrent nightmares. Recurrent nightmares cause significant distress and impairment in occupational and social functioning, as have been commonly observed in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. By contrast, during lucid dreaming (LD), subjects get insight they are dreaming and may even control the content of their dreams. These features may open a way to help those who suffer from nightmare disorder through re-significations of the dream scene, i.e., knowing that they are dreaming and having control over their dream content. Thus, lucid dreamers might be able to render nightmares normal dreams, thereby assuring a restoring sleep. The aim of the present study is to review the existing literature of the use of LD as an auxiliary tool for treatment of nightmares. We conducted a careful literature search for eligible studies on the use of LD treatment for nightmares. We observed that whereas LD may be a feasible aid in the treatment of patients with nightmares through minimizing their frequency, intensity and psychological distress, the available literature is still scarce and does not provide consistent results. We conclude therefore that more research is clearly warranted for a better estimation of the effective conductance and therapeutic outcome of LD treatment in clinical practice.

57,What comes first metacognition or negative emotion? A test of temporal precedence,"The Self-Regulatory Executive Function model predicts that emotional symptoms and metacognition can causally affect each other. Crucially, for the model metacognition must cause emotion disorder symptoms. Therefore, in time-series data involving repeated measurements, metacognitions should predict subsequent changes in emotion. 265 participants completed a questionnaire battery three times over a 2 month period. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using cross-lagged panel analysis tested the inter-relationships between metacognitive beliefs, anxiety and depression symptoms over time. The cross-lagged structural model was a significantly better fit than the autoregressive model. Metacognitive beliefs were found to predict subsequent symptoms of anxiety while symptoms of anxiety predicted later metacognition over different time courses. The metacognition factor representing uncontrollability and danger of thoughts appeared to be prominent in the effects observed. Metacognitions and depression were also positively related over time to a lesser degree, but in the cross-lagged model these temporal relationships were non-significant. This is likely due to low levels of depression within the sample and low variability over time. The findings for anxiety are consistent with the S-REF model and with experimental and prospective studies supporting metacognitive beliefs as a causal mechanism in psychological distress symptoms.

58,"A randomized controlled trial of concentrated ERP, self-help and waiting list for obsessive- compulsive disorder: The bergen 4-day treatment","Background: The Bergen 4-day treatment (B4DT) is a concentrated exposure-based treatment for patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) delivered during four consecutive days. The B4DT has in a number of effectiveness studies demonstrated promising results as approximately 90% of patients gain reliable clinical change post-treatment and nearly 70% are recovered on a long-term basis. Methods: The current study is the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of the B4DT. Forty-eight patients diagnosed with OCD were randomized to B4DT, self-help (SH), or waiting list (WL) with 16 patients in each condition. All participants randomized to the B4DT underwent the treatment without any attrition. Results: The B4DT yielded significantly better effects than control conditions on measures of OCD, depression, and generalized anxiety. The response rate ( 35% reduction of the individual patient’s pre-treatment Y-BOCS score) was 93.8% in B4DT, 12.5% in SH and 0% in WL, while remission rate (response criterion is fulfilled and the post-treatment Y-BOCS score is 12 points) was 62.5%, 6.3%, and 0%, respectively. Furthermore, patients who had received the B4DT, showed improved work- and social functioning. None of the patients treated with B4DT showed signs of deterioration. In comparison, one patient in the SH condition was in remission, and one showed significant clinical improvement, whereas the remaining showed no change. Conclusion: The results indicate that the B4DT is an effective treatment for patients suffering from OCD.

59,The effect of high-intensity interval/circuit training on cognitive functioning and quality of life during recovery from substance abuse disorder. A study protocol,"This proposed study will examine whether structured physical activity reduces the recovery time of cognitive functioning during the early phase of substance use disorder treatment. Addiction or substance dependence is associated with neurobiological changes and cognitive impairment that can affect quality of life and the efficacy of therapy for up to a year after clinical detoxification. The biological, psychological, and social effects of physical exercise have the potential to be a therapeutic approach to increase quality of life and relieve symptoms associated with substance abuse, such as psychosis, depression, and anxiety. There is a dearth of research on physical activity and exercise in clinical substance use disorder patients. This protocol describes a clinical study that will examine cognitive recovery after substance abuse using physical exercise as a treatment intervention. We will use a quasi-experimental longitudinal clinical trial, with a pretest and multiple posttests, on naturally randomized sequential groups. Patients will be consecutively be recruited into the study groups, with a control group that is completed, before its followed by an intervention group, each with 30 patients. Patients will be enrolled 2 weeks after the start of detoxification, at which time all subjects will be inpatients at the Stavanger Salvation Army Treatment Center in the Norwegian specialized healthcare system. Cognition will be evaluated with a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests, including several tests of executive function. Physical fitness will be tested with the Rockport 1-Mile Walk Test, the 30-S Chair Stand Test, the 1-Min Burpee Test at baseline (within the first 2 weeks of admittance) and after 4 weeks. The intervention will be a 30-min workout at 70–90% of maximum heart rate (134–170 bpm), recorded and calculated by a Polar heart rate monitor. The intervention treatment will be administered four times a week for 4 weeks and will consist of high-intensity circuit training, high-intensity interval training, functional movement, and primitive reflex training. We anticipate improvement in both the control and intervention groups, with the exercise intervention group having the greatest increase in recovery of cognitive function because of the combination of functional full body movements and primitive movement training in an intense interval training program.

60,Interaction effects of behavioral inhibition system/behavioral activation system and cost/probability biases on social anxiety,"Introduction: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms are maintained by cognitive biases, which are overestimations of the severity and likelihood of negative social events (cost/probability biases), and by sensitivity to rewards and punishments that are determined according to behavioral inhibition/behavioral activation systems (BIS/BAS). Cost/probability biases might activate the behavioral immune system and exacerbate the avoidance of social events. Earlier studies have proposed that low BIS or high BAS decrease SAD symptoms; BIS/BAS may even change the effects of cognitive biases on SAD symptoms. Hence, the current study investigates the interaction effects of BIS/BAS and cost/probability biases on SAD symptoms. Method: Seventy-six Japanese undergraduate students completed the Japanese version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), which comprises Fear and Avoidance subscales, the BIS/BAS Scale, and the Social Cost Probability Scale. Results: A multiple regression analysis was performed to examine whether cost/probability biases, BIS/BAS, and their interactions affected SAD symptoms; following this, the main effects of cost bias and BIS were determined for LSAS-Fear (β = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.33, p &lt; 0.01) and LSAS-Avoidance (β = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). The interaction effect between cost bias and BAS was significant for LSAS-Avoidance (β = −0.32, p &lt; 0.05). Simple slope analysis showed that the slope of cost bias was significant for low-BAS individuals (β = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001) but not for high-BAS individuals (β = −0.21, n.s.). The interaction effect between probability bias and BAS was significant for LSAS-Avoidance (β = 0.40, p &lt; 0.01) as well. Further, simple slope analysis revealed that the slope of probability bias was significant for low-BAS individuals (β = −0.53, p &lt; 0.05) but not for high-BAS individuals (β = 0.17, n.s.). Discussion: The study found interesting results with respect to the avoidance of social events. Low-BAS individuals with high cost or low probability biases regarding social events may have a tendency to avoid social events. In contrast, if high-BAS individuals overestimate the cost of social events or underestimate the probability of social events, their anticipation of rewards might prevent them from avoiding social events.

61,Optimism and mental health of minority students: Moderating effects of cultural adaptability,"Optimism, cultural adaptation, and mental health are distinct but associated concepts. An optimistic personality assists in maintaining mental health, and people with optimistic personality traits have better health than those with pessimistic personality traits. It has also been argued that (home or host) cultural factors influence the ability to adapt to individual social contexts and that interactions with individuals from different cultural backgrounds can help reduce social difficulties. Culture has a very important influence on the mental health of Tibetan college students, like other college students. This study aimed to investigate the initial mechanism of the potential influence of optimism on individuals’ mental health and cultural adaptability to/integration with mainstream culture. A total of 1027 Tibetan college students from four universities in western China were recruited for the study. The tools used included an instrument developed by the authors and used for the first time here to assess optimism, as well as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Positive Affect Scale (PAS). Optimism influenced mental health in the present study. The results were as follows: (1) cultural adaptability played a moderating role in the relationship between self-efficacy optimism and depression (β = 0.193, p &lt; 0.01); (2) the moderating role of cultural adaptability in the relationship between optimism and positive emotions was not clear (p &gt; 0.05); and (3) cultural adaptability moderated the relationship between self-efficacy optimism and life satisfaction (β = 0.286, p &lt; 0.01). Thus, optimism and mental health are closely related, and cultural adaptability significantly affects the effect of self-efficacy in regulating depression and life satisfaction among Tibetan college students in China.

62,Attentional bias modification in virtual reality—A VR-based dot-probe task with 2D and 3D stimuli,"Background: Attentional bias modification (ABM) aims to reduce anxiety by attenuating bias toward threatening information. The current study incorporated virtual reality (VR) technology and three-dimensional stimuli with a dot-probe task to evaluate the effects of a VR-based ABM training on attentional bias and anxiety symptoms. Methods: A total of 100 participants were randomized to four training groups. Attentional bias was assessed at pre- and post-training, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at pre-training, post-training, 1-week follow-up, and 3-months follow-up. Results: Change in anxiety did not correlate with change in bias ( p = 0.24). A repeated-measures ANOVA showed no significant difference in bias from pre- to post-ABM ( p = 0.144), or between groups ( p = 0.976). For anxiety symptoms, a linear mixed-effects model analysis revealed a significant effect of time. Participants showed reduction in anxiety score at each successive assessment ( p &lt; 0.001). However, no other significant main effect or interactions were found. A clinically significant change analysis revealed that 9% of participants were classified as ‘recovered’ at 3-months follow-up. Conclusion: A single session of VR-based ABM did not change attentional bias. The significant reduction in anxiety was not specific to active training, and the majority of participants remained clinically unchanged.

63,Preventive effects of escitalopram against anxiety-like depressive behaviors in monosodium glutamate-teated rats subjected to partial hepatectomy,"The reasons for the relationship between depression and chronic liver disease (CLD) are complex and multifactorial. Further research is needed to decipher the etiology and establish an optimal management approach for depression in patients, including the potential role of non-pharmacological treatments. monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated rats are more likely to develop anxiogenic- and depressive-like behaviors, which could be related to the dysfunction of serotonergic system. In this study, partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed in MSG-treated rats and the histopathological changes were observed in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and liver. The effect of escitalopram, a widely used antidepressant, on neural and liver injury in this model was also examined. The MSG + PH-treated rats displayed decreased distances traveled in total, in center arena, and in the left side of arena in inner open field test (OFT), as compared to saline, saline + PH, and MSG-treated animals. The present study established that PH aggravated anxiety-like depressive behaviors in MSG-treated rats, concordant with damaged Nissl bodies (and neurites), decreased IBA-1 and Sox-2 expression in OFC and neurotransmitter disorder. Escitalopram treatment could alleviate these pathological changes as well as reduce hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolism.

65,Trait emotional intelligence and classroom emotions: A positive psychology investigation and intervention among Chinese EFL learners,"The link between emotional intelligence (EI) and negative emotions, especially anxiety, has been investigated in different educational contexts including second/foreign language (L2) learning contexts. However, the link between EI and positive emotions remains underexplored, despite the growing interest of second language acquisition (SLA) researchers in positive emotions, motivated by the Positive Psychology (PP) movement. Grounded on PP theories, a correlational and experimental investigation was conducted on EI and two typical L2 classroom emotions, namely Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE) and Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA). For the correlational study, questionnaires were administered to 1,718 English learners from three high schools in China. Statistical results showed medium correlations among students’ EI, FLE, and FLA. In the intervention study, a pre-test, treatment and post-test design was adopted. A six-week PP-based EI intervention (“ARGUER” training model in class and the “three activities” of PP in diary) was conducted in the experiment class of 56 students, while not in the control class of 52 students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five students in the experimental class and their English teacher. ANCOVA test results and qualitative findings indicated that the EI intervention was effective in improving EI, boosting more positive classroom emotions and alleviating negative classroom emotions. The findings in both the correlational and intervention studies are discussed in combination with previous studies. We also further address their theoretical and practical implications for L2 education.

66,Lowered plasma steady-state levels of progesterone combined with declining progesterone levels during the luteal phase predict peri-menstrual syndrome and its major subdomains,"Background: It is unknown whether lowered steady state levels of sex hormones coupled with changes in those hormones during the menstrual cycle are associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Objective: To examine associations between levels of progesterone and oestradiol during the menstrual cycle and PMS considering different diagnostic criteria for PMS. Methods: Forty-one women aged 18–45 years with a regular menstrual cycle completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for all 28 consecutive days of the menstrual cycle. Blood was sampled at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 to assay oestradiol and progesterone. Results: We developed a new diagnosis of peri-menstrual syndrome, which is characterized by increased DRSP severity in pre and post-menstrual periods and increased scores on the major DRSP dimensions, i.e., depression, physio-somatic symptoms, breast tenderness and appetite, and anxiety. This new diagnosis performed better than classical diagnoses of PMS, including that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Lowered steady state levels of progesterone, when averaged over the menstrual cycle, together with declining progesterone levels during the luteal phase predict severity of peri-menstrual symptoms. Steady state levels of oestradiol and declining oestradiol levels during the cycle are also related to DRSP severity although most of these effects appeared to be mediated by progesterone. Conclusion: A significant increase in menstrual-cycle related symptoms can best be conceptualized as “peri-menstrual syndrome” and may result from insufficient progesterone production (relative corpus luteum insufficiency), which, in part may result from lowered oestradiol production indicating suboptimal pre-ovulatory follicular development.

67,Traumatic stress produces delayed alterations of synaptic plasticity in basolateral amygdala,"Acute traumatic event exposure is a direct cause of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Amygdala is suggested to be associated with the development of PTSD. In our previous findings, different activation patterns of GABAergic neurons and glutamatergic neurons in early or late stages after stress were found. However, the neural plastic mechanism underlying the role of basolateral amygdala (BLA) in post-traumatic stress disorder remains unclear. Therefore, this study mainly aimed at investigating time-dependent morphologic and electrophysiological changes in BLA during the development of PTSD. We used single prolonged stress (SPS) procedure to establish PTSD model of rats. The rats showed no alterations in anxiety behavior as well as in dendritic spine density or synaptic transmission in BLA 1 day after SPS. However, 10 days after SPS, rats showed enhancement of anxiety behavior, and spine density and frequency of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in BLA. Our results suggested that after traumatic stress, BLA displayed delayed increase in both spinogenesis and synaptic transmission, which seemed to facilitate the development of PTSD.

Time-lagged data were collected at two points in time from 211 doctor interns working in various hospitals in Pakistan. Our results fully supported a proposed serial multiple-mediator model. Workplace bullying was indirectly related to life satisfaction via job-related anxiety and insomnia. This study provides evidence of a spillover effect as to how workplace bullying increases employees’ job-related anxiety which in turn leads to insomnia resulting in reduced employees’ life satisfaction. The present study extends research on workplace bullying to display its theoretical as well as empirical effects on life satisfaction. It demonstrates that workplace bullying as an occupational and psychological stressor has multiple effects on employees’ life satisfaction through a serial mediation model in the context of a developing country. It further explains that workplace bullying not only affects an employee’s workplace behaviors but also extends to the employee’s overall life satisfaction.

69,"Adult attachment style, emotion regulation, and social networking sites addiction","While there is substantial evidence that emotion regulation plays a role in the maintenance of substance and behavior addiction, its role in addiction to social networking sites (SNS) remains unclear. Drawing on attachment theory, we explore whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between insecure attachment and SNS addiction among 463 college students. The participants completed the short version of the Experience in Close Relationships Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and Chinese Social Media Addiction Scale. The results indicated that attachment anxiety positively predicted SNS addiction and that emotion regulation mediated this link. These findings suggest that individuals’ affective regulation capability should be a target of future interventions and treatments.

70,Effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on self-compassion and psychological health among young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment,"Background: Individuals who were maltreated during childhood are faced with increased risks for developing various psychological symptoms that are particularly resistant to traditional treatments. This pilot study investigated the effects of a mindfulness based behavioral intervention for young adults with a childhood maltreatment history. Methods: This study looked at self-report psychological questionnaires from 20 subjects (5 males) before and after a mindfulness-based behavioral intervention, compared to 18 subjects (6 males) in the waiting list control group (age range 22– 29); all subjects experienced mild-to-moderate childhood maltreatment. We analyzed changes in stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness and self-compassion related to the intervention with linear mixed effects models; we also analyzed the relationships among questionnaire score changes with partial correlation analyses and mediation analysis. Results: Linear mixed effects model analyses revealed significant group by time interaction on stress ( p &lt; 0.01), anxiety ( p &lt; 0.05), and self-compassion ( p &lt; 0.01), with the mindfulness group having significant reduction in stress and anxiety ( p &lt; 0.01), and significant increase in mindfulness ( p &lt; 0.05) and self-compassion ( p &lt; 0.001). Partial correlation analyses showed that among all subjects from both groups, changes in mindfulness positively correlated with changes in self-compassion (r = 0.578, p = 0.001), which negatively correlated with changes in depression ( r = -0.374, p = 0.05) and anxiety ( r = -0.395, p &lt; 0.05). Changes in self-compassion mediated, in part, the relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in anxiety (average causal mediation effect = -4.721, p &lt; 0.05). We observed a dose-dependent effect of the treatment, i.e., the number of intervention sessions attended were negatively correlated with changes in stress ( r = -0.674, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety ( r = -0.580, p &lt; 0.01), and depression (r = -0.544, p &lt; 0.05), after controlling for the individual differences in childhood maltreatment severity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, to some extent, the mindfulness-based intervention can be helpful for improving self-compassion and psychological health among young adults with a childhood maltreatment history.

71,Visual working memory for faces and facial expressions as a useful “tool” for understanding social and affective cognition,"Visual working memory (VWM) is one of the most investigated cognitive systems functioning as a hub between low- and high-level processes. Remarkably, its role in human cognitive architecture makes it a stage of crucial importance for the study of socio-affective cognition, also in relation with psychopathology such as anxiety. Among socio-affective stimuli, faces occupy a place of first importance. How faces and facial expressions are encoded and maintained in VWM is the focus of this review. Within the main theoretical VWM models, we will review research comparing VWM representations of faces and of other classes of stimuli. We will further present previous work investigating if and how both static (i.e., ethnicity, trustworthiness and identity) and changeable (i.e., facial expressions) facial features are represented in VWM. Finally, we will examine research showing qualitative differences in VWM for face representations as a function of psychopathology and personality traits. The findings that we will review are not always coherent with each other, and for this reason we will highlight the main methodological differences as the main source of inconsistency. Finally, we will provide some suggestions for future research in this field in order to foster our understanding of representation of faces in VWM and its potential role in supporting socio-affective cognition.

72,Two reasoning strategies in patients with psychological illnesses,"Hyper-emotion theory states that psychological disorders are conditions in which individuals experience emotions that are appropriate to the situation but inappropriate in their intensity. When these individuals experience such an emotion, they are inevitably compelled to reason about its cause. They therefore develop characteristic strategies of reasoning depending on the particular hyper-emotion they experience. In anxiety disorders (e.g., panic attack, social phobia), the perception of a disorder-related threat leads to hyper-anxiety; here, individuals’ reasoning is corroboratory, adducing evidence that confirms the risk (corroboratory strategy). In obsessive-compulsive disorders, the threat of having acted in an irresponsible way leads to both hyper-anxiety and guilt; here, individuals’ reasoning is refutatory, adducing only evidence disconfirming the risk of being guilty (refutatory strategy). We report three empirical studies corroborating these hypotheses. They demonstrate that patients themselves recognize the two strategies and spontaneously use them in therapeutic sessions and in evaluating scenarios in an experiment.

73,Pressing crowd noise impairs the ability of anxious basketball referees to discriminate fouls,"The decision-making processes of referees in sports are affected by many factors, including the pressure of spectators. While the home/visitor bias has been previously investigated, the role of crowd noise has been less studied. In the present study, we investigated how the crowd noise (calm vs. pressing) influence the decisions of basketball referees, when examining videos of potential fouls. In doing so, we also considered the level of competitive anxiety of referees (low vs. high anxiety), as factor potentially interacting with the pressure exerted by the spectators. A 2 × 2 ANOVA (Crowd noise x Anxiety) revealed a significant interaction [ F (1,28) = 7.33; p &lt; 0.05; ηp² = 0.21; power = 0.74], with the highly anxious referees showing poorer performances in the pressing crowd condition [ t (14) = 2.24; p &lt; 0.05; d = 0.64]. The results indicate that the crowd noise does not seem to affect the referees' decisions, unless we consider the anxiety. The present findings suggest that the decisions of referees with high anxiety might be more easily influenced by external factors like crowd noise. Based on these results, referees' federations should consider the possibility to develop training protocols dedicated to highly anxious referees, to avoid their decisions from being biased by spectators' pressure.

74,(Why) do you like scary movies? A review of the empirical research on psychological responses to horror films,"Why do we watch and like horror films? Despite a century of horror film making and entertainment, little research has examined the human motivation to watch fictional horror and how horror film influences individuals’ behavioral, cognitive, and emotional responses. This review provides the first synthesis of the empirical literature on the psychology of horror film using multi-disciplinary research from psychology, psychotherapy, communication studies, development studies, clinical psychology, and media studies. The paper considers the motivations for people’s decision to watch horror, why people enjoy horror, how individual differences influence responses to, and preference for, horror film, how exposure to horror film changes behavior, how horror film is designed to achieve its effects, why we fear and why we fear specific classes of stimuli, and how liking for horror develops during childhood and adolescence. The literature suggests that (1) low empathy and fearfulness are associated with more enjoyment and desire to watch horror film but that specific dimensions of empathy are better predictors of people’s responses than are others; (2) there is a positive relationship between sensation-seeking and horror enjoyment/preference, but this relationship is not consistent; (3) men and boys prefer to watch, enjoy, and seek our horror more than do women and girls; (4) women are more prone to disgust sensitivity or anxiety than are men, and this may mediate the sex difference in the enjoyment of horror; (5) younger children are afraid of symbolic stimuli, whereas older children become afraid of concrete or realistic stimuli; and (6) in terms of coping with horror, physical coping strategies are more successful in younger children; priming with information about the feared object reduces fear and increases children’s enjoyment of frightening television and film. A number of limitations in the literature is identified, including the multifarious range of horror stimuli used in studies, disparities in methods, small sample sizes, and a lack of research on cross-cultural differences and similarities. Ideas for future research are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2019
75,Heidelberg Risk Sport-Specific Stress Test: A paradigm to investigate the risk sport-specific psycho-physiological arousal,"In risk sports with medium to high risks of injury (e.g., surfing, free solo climbing, wingsuit flying), athletes frequently find themselves in unexpected and threatening situations. Elevated psycho-physiological stress responses to these situations might have tremendous consequences for their performance as well as for their long-term health. To gain a better understanding of the psycho-physiological response to such events, innovative, externally valid and standardized stress induction protocols are needed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate a risk sport-specific stress protocol, i.e., the Heidelberg Risk Sport-Specific Stress Test (HRSST), which utilizes fear of falling as the stressful event. Climbing novices were asked to climb up a 12 m high wall. Then, participants were requested to “jump into the rope”, leading to a secured fall of about 3 m. This imposed physical danger assumed to elicit psycho-physiological responses. Self-reported state anxiety, salivary cortisol, and heart rate/heart rate variability were measured before, during, and after the HRSST. Results of four independent studies that investigated the psycho-physiological response to the HRSST in 214 participants were analyzed, leading to conclusions about the stressor’s effectiveness. Results showed that self-reported state anxiety consistently increased after the HRSST in all four experiments (moderate to large effects). The results of the physiological indicators were inconclusive. Salivary cortisol significantly increased after the HRSST in one of four experiments (small effect sizes). Although heart rate significantly increased during the “jump in the rope” in experiment 1, heart rate variability significantly decreased after the HRSST in only one of three experiments (small effect sizes). Findings suggest that the HRSST is a valid method to induce risk sport-specific emotional stress, but effects on physiological stress markers were rather minor. To sum up, in case of appropriate sports climbing facilities, the HRSST appears to be a cost-efficient and promising stress induction protocol: It offers the possibility to investigate risk sport-specific stress responses and their underlying mechanisms in climbing novices. These findings may also find application in professions in which individuals are exposed to risky situations, such as police officers, medical first responders, firefighters and military personnel.

76,Twelve months post-treatment results from the Norwegian version of improving access to psychological therapies,"Objectives: Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC) is the Norwegian version of the England’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). Both programs have been associated with substantial symptom reductions from pre- to post-treatment. The present study extends these findings by investigating symptom levels at 12 months post-treatment, as well as treatment outcome in relation to low- vs. high-intensity treatment forms. Design and Outcome Measures: A prospective cohort design was used. All participants ( n = 1530) were asked to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire (GAD-7) at baseline, before each session during treatment, at final treatment, and at 12 months post-treatment. Cohen’s d was used as effect size measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the high missing data rates at post-treatment (≈44%) and 12 months post-treatment (≈58%). Results: A large symptom reduction was seen from baseline to 12 months post-treatment for both PHQ ( d = −0.98) and GAD ( d = −0.94). Improvements observed at post-treatment were largely maintained at 12 months post-treatment (PHQ (Δ d = 0.10) and GAD (Δ d = 0.09). Recovery rates decreased only slightly from 49.5% at post-treatment to 45.0% at follow-up. Both low- and high-intensity treatment forms were associated with substantial and lasting symptoms reductions (−1.26 ≤ d ≤ −0.73). Sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter the main results. Conclusion: The findings suggest long-lasting effects of the PMHC program and encourage the use of low-intensity treatment forms in PMHC like settings.

77,Hepatitis C pretreatment profile and gender differences: Cognition and disease severity effects,"Background: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to infect the brain, however, the findings based on associated neuropsychiatric syndrome are controversial and the association itself remains unclear. Gender research in HCV infection is limited, failing to integrate the role of gender differences in neurocognitive syndrome. The aim of this study was to characterize psychological and neurocognitive profiles in HCV-infected patients before treatment and to explore gender differences in those profiles, as well as the impact of disease severity. Methods: A total of 86 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C were included. Depression and anxiety were assessed using Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A), Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). For cognition, a neuropsychological battery to measure attention, concentration and memory was used, and executive function components validated for the Portuguese population was also used before starting treatment. To identify the disease severity, platelet ratio index, and FibroScan® were used. Results: A statistically significant gender effect was found on HAM-A ( B = 0.64, CI: 0.17–1.11) and HAM-D ( B = 0.62, CI: 0.14–1.09), with women scoring higher compared to men. Regarding neuropsychological scores, significant differences between gender were identified in executive functions measured by Trail Making Test (TMT B) ( B = 0.48, CI: 0.02–0.97), TMT B-A ( B = 0.26, CI: −39.2 to −3.7) and in digit span total ( B = −0.52, CI: −1.0 to −0.04), with women performing worse than men. Controlling for years of substance dependence, TMT-B and TMT B-A showed significant gender differences. Regarding the presence or absence of substance dependence, only HAM-A and HAM-D remained significant. For categorical variables, Digit Span Total was also influenced by gender, with women being more likely to be impaired: odds ratio (OR) = 7.07, CI: 2.04–24.45), and a trend was observed for Digit Span Backward (OR = 3.57, CI: 1.31–9.75). No significant differences were found between disease severity and neurocognitive performance. Conclusion: Data suggest that gender has an influence on depression, anxiety and cognitive functions with women showing greater impairment compared with men. This effect seems to be influenced by substance dependence.

78,"Attentional disengagement deficits predict brooding, but not reflection, over a one-year period","A growing literature suggests that rumination is linked to attentional disengagement deficits in depression. This is particularly the case with brooding, a maladaptive form of rumination. However, research on the potential constructive association between attentional disengagement and self-reflection, a putative adaptive form of rumination, is sparse. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine whether visual attentional disengagement deficits differentially predict dispositional brooding and self-reflection tendencies. Depressed participants ( n = 17), those in remission from depression ( n = 42), and their peers with no depression histories ( n = 70) completed clinical interviews, the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), and an eye-tracking task that measured attentional disengagement from pleasant (happy) and unpleasant (sad) facial images during a laboratory visit, and the RRS at 4 month intervals over a 1-year period. Results revealed that slow disengagement from sad faces, and rapid disengagement from happy faces, was specifically associated with brooding tendencies concurrently and across follow-up. Attentional disengagement was unrelated to self-reflection. The disengagement-brooding associations remained after controlling for depression status and anxiety disorder histories, suggesting that attentional control deficits may be a state-independent marker of brooding. Theoretical and clinical implications for these associations are discussed.

79,A novel approach for investigating Parkinson’s disease personality and its association with clinical and psychological aspects,"Objective: A complex relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms, personality traits and neurochemical changes in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been highlighted in the past several decades. In particular, a specific Parkinson personality with obsessive traits has been described. However, despite the great amount of anecdotal evidence, this aspect, together with its neurobiological, psychological and clinical correlates, are still not clearly defined. Therefore, we performed a case-control study in order to investigate the presence and rate of obsessive personality traits in PD patients within the theoretical framework of cognitive-constructivist model. Moreover, the relationship between PD personality and clinical, psychological and quality of life (QoL) aspects in PD were investigated. Methods: Fifty-one non-demented patients with probable or possible PD (not demented) were recruited at the inpatient-outpatient San Luca Hospital, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Control group was composed by forty-eight age- and education-matched healthy volunteers. Patients underwent a neurological investigation including Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), Modified Hoehn and Yahr and Schwab and England staging scales. The following psychological questionnaires were administered to the overall sample: Personal Meaning Questionnaire (PMQ), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y (STAI-Y), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36). Results: No significant differences in personality styles were observed in PD patients and controls, with a prevalence of phobic personal meaning organization (PMO) in both groups. However, PD patients showed more anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms than controls at the psychological questionnaires, as well as poorer QoL levels. The intensity of personality traits, and in particular for the obsessive personality style, were negatively associated with QoL and positively with disease severity. No significant relationships were observed between personality and other clinical aspects, such as side of onset and disease duration. Conclusion: Parkinson’s disease patients did not show a different personality profile according to the cognitive-constructivist model with respect to controls. However, in this population, a general enhancement in the tendency to codify experience by means of specific cognitive and emotional patterns was associated to disease progression and to a poorer QoL.

80,Psychosocial support in liver transplantation: A dyadic study with patients and their family caregivers,"Background and aims: Liver transplantation provides an opportunity of survival for patients with liver failure; however, this procedure is known to be psychologically and physically fatiguing for patients and their informal caregivers. The aim of this study was to investigate how perceived social support and the distribution of dependency were associated with the psychological wellbeing of patients waiting for liver transplantation and their caregivers, as a dyad. Methods: The present was a cross-sectional study. Ninety-five participants were recruited at a hospital in Northern Italy, during the psychological evaluation for inclusion in the transplantation list: 51 patients (19 with alcohol-related illness) and 44 family caregivers. Both patients and caregivers filled in a Symptom Checklist and Kelly’s Dependency Grids. Patients also compiled the Medical Outcome Study Social-Support Survey, and caregivers compiled the Family Strain Questionnaire Short-Form. Results: Caregivers reported important levels of strain and strongly related to a worsening of their own and patients’ symptoms. Patients with alcohol-related pathologies had a narrower social network, which corresponded to an increase in family strain. On the sample as a whole, regression analyses showed that perceived social support and dependency measures did not predict patients’ and caregivers’ symptoms. Nevertheless, cluster analysis identified a group of caregivers who distributed their dependency more and experienced lower levels of depression, anxiety, and strain. Conclusions: These results suggest the usefulness of a dyadic approach in the research, prevention, and care of liver diseases. A deeper comprehension of the functioning of dyads will help practitioners in the identification of situations at risk.

81,Occupational rehabilitation is associated with improvements in cognitive functioning,"Introduction: Occupational rehabilitation may be offered to workers on long-term sick leave who often report problems with cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, pain, and reduced work ability. The empirical knowledge is sparce on how occupational rehabilitation may influence cognitive and emotional functioning and patients have not previously been subjected to comprehensive objective testing. The main aim of this study was to assess possible changes in cognitive and emotional functioning such as memory, attention, executive function, and emotion recognition among patients in occupational rehabilitation. Methods: A large sample of 280 sick-listed workers referred to inpatient and outpatient occupational rehabilitation was recruited. The rehabilitation programs had a mean duration of 28 days and comprised physical activity, cognitive behavior treatment components and collaboration with the workplace. A pre–post design was applied to investigate possible changes in cognitive and emotional functioning (primary outcomes) and work and health measures (secondary outcomes), comparing the rehabilitation group with a control group of 70 healthy workers. Individuals in the control group were tested at random time points with an approximately 28 day interval between pre- and post-test, thus coinciding with the duration of rehabilitation. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for the main analyses. Results: Compared to the control group, the rehabilitation group had greater gains from pre- to post-test in focused and sustained attention, as well as greater improvements in work ability and reduction in subjective health complaints (SHC), helplessness, pain, pain related to work, anxiety, and depression. In the rehabilitation group, exploratory correlational analysis indicated that improvements in focused and sustained attention were associated with improvements in return-to-work self-efficacy, work ability as well as a reduction in SHC. Conclusion: The sick-listed workers improved in focused and sustained attention and work and health measures after participating in occupational rehabilitation. This study is one of the first to systematically investigate changes in cognitive and emotional functioning during occupational rehabilitation. Clinical practice should benefit from increased knowledge about all cognitive functions and should be specifically aware of the improvements in focused and sustained attention, while memory, executive function and emotion recognition remained unchanged. The results can be used as a motivation to tailor specific interventions to gain further improvements in all cognitive and emotional functions.

82,"Investigating irrational beliefs, cognitive appraisals, challenge and threat, and affective states in golfers approaching competitive situations","On approach to competitive situations, affective states (emotions and anxiety) occur through the complex interaction of cognitive antecedents. Researchers have intimated that irrational beliefs might play an important role in the relationship between cognitive appraisals and affective states, but has ignored challenge and threat. In the current research, we examine the interaction between cognitive appraisals, irrational beliefs, and challenge and threat to predict golfers’ pre-competitive affective states. We adopted a cross-sectional atemporal design to examine how golfers approached two different competitive situations: imagined imminent golf competition (phase 1), and actual future golf competition (phase 2). Path analysis revealed how cognitive appraisals, irrational beliefs, and challenge and threat interact to predict affective states among golfers. Serial atemporal multiple mediation analysis indicated that the relationships between cognitive appraisals and affective states were mediated by irrational beliefs and challenge and threat. Further, some differences were revealed between phase 1 and phase 2 in the serial multiple atemporal mediation results with regard to challenge. That is, at phase 1 no significant serial mediation was found for any affective outcomes, but at phase 2 significant serial mediation was found for all affective states, showing that irrational beliefs and challenge serial mediated the associations between cognitive appraisals and affective states. The finding that mediation and bivariate associations differed across phase 1 and phase 2 is echoed in the phase 1-phase 2 tests of differences. The current research makes a theoretical advancement by elucidating in more detail the complex interaction between cognitive antecedents and mediators of affective states. Specifically, the inclusion of challenge and threat alongside irrational beliefs and cognitive appraisals is an important theoretical advancement that builds on work inside of sport literature (e.g., Dixon et al., 2016) and outside of sport literature (e.g., David et al., 2002, 2005), as this constellation of theoretically related antecedents of affective states has not been examined together in the extant research.

83,The relationship between adolescents’ stress and Internet addiction: A mediated-moderation model,"This cross-sectional study explored the impact of stress, social anxiety, and social class on Internet addiction among adolescents. The subjects—1,634 middle school students—were investigated using the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) Chinese Short Form, the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS), and the Questionnaire of Family Social-economic Status. The results show that 12% of the adolescents investigated showed signs of Internet addiction. With the increase of grade, the tendency of Internet addiction and the number of addicts gradually increased. It also showed that Internet addiction is positively correlated with stress and social anxiety and negatively correlated with social class. Social anxiety partially mediates the impact of stress on Internet addiction and social class indirectly influences Internet addiction by moderating the relationship between stress and social anxiety. In conclusion, there is a mediated-moderation effect between stress and adolescent Internet addiction This means that adolescents from different social classes have different types of anxiety when they feel the stress, which influences their choices concerning internet use.

84,"Temperament, executive functioning, and anxiety in school-age children who stutter","The purpose of this study was to examine temperament dimensions, executive functioning ability, and anxiety levels in school-age children who stutter and their non-stuttering peers. Participants were 100 Portuguese children aged 7 to 12 years ( M = 9.13; SD = 1.70), including 50 children who stutter and 50 children who do not stutter. Analyses, which were performed separately for younger and older participants, sought to identify correlations between key variables. Temperament was evaluated through a parent questionnaire, executive functioning was evaluated through children’s responses on a performance test, and anxiety level was assessed through a self-perception scale. On the temperament measure, comparisons between children who stutter and their non-stuttering peers revealed that older children who stutter exhibited significantly higher scores on the Anger/Frustration, Impulsivity, and Sadness subscales, and lower averages on the Attention/Focusing, Perceptual sensitivity, and Soothability/Falling Reactivity subscales. On the executive functioning task, comparisons revealed that the group of younger children who stutter exhibited significantly higher average execution times than their non-stuttering peers. There were no statistically significant differences in anxiety between children who stutter and children who do not stutter, and there were no statistically significant correlations between temperament factors and measures of executive functioning. Children who stutter experienced lower ability to orient attention and greater emotional reactivity compared with their non-stuttering peers. Significant correlations were found between executive functioning and age and among the temperament factors themselves. These results, which support the need for a multidimensional view of stuttering, were interpreted in the context of the Dual Diathesis – Stressor model. Findings indicate that temperament and executive functioning abilities may contribute to the development of stuttering.

85,"Working smarter not harder: Oxytocin increases domestic dogs’ ( &lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris&lt;/i&gt;) accuracy, but not attempts, on an object choice task","The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been shown to enhance dogs’ ability to perform an object choice task (OCT) involving the use of human pointing cues, when delivered intranasally. This study aimed at further investigating whether OT enhances task performance by increasing choices made, or by increasing correctness of choices made, and to compare these treatment effects to dog appeasing pheromone (DAP), known to balance emotional activation in dogs. Hence, we compared OCT performance between three groups of dogs: (i) dogs administered OT and a sham collar, (ii) dogs administered a saline placebo and a DAP collar, and (iii) control dogs administered a saline placebo and a sham collar. All three groups consisted of a combination of male and female pet dogs and assistance-dogs-in-training currently living with a volunteer carer. The study also evaluated the effect of intranasal OT and/or DAP on plasma levels of OT, and prolactin; which has previously been linked with anxiety in dogs. The dogs’ emotional state was measured using the Emotional Disorders Evaluation in Dogs (EDED) scale. The owners’/carers’ degree of anxious- and avoidant-style attachment to their dogs was accessed using the Pet Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ). Interesting descriptive data appeared for both treatment groups. Particularly, in OT group, we obtained significant results demonstrating that intranasal OT enhances OCT performance in dogs compared to control, by increasing the percentage of correct choices, but not the number of choices, made. Results also support that the mode of action of intranasal OT is via direct access to the brain and not via the blood, since no elevation of plasma OT (or prolactin) levels were observed after intranasal administration in this study. Similarly, DAP application did not significantly alter OT or prolactin peripheral concentrations. Several differences were observed between fostered and pet dogs, namely: fostered dogs demonstrated higher levels of serum prolactin, made more choices on the OCT compared to pet dogs but were not more likely to be correct, and were fostered by carers with higher avoidant attachment scores than pet dog owners. These findings implicate consideration of potential carer and training consequences for assistance dogs.

86,"Emotional stress during pregnancy—Associations with maternal anxiety disorders, infant cortisol reactivity, and mother–child interaction at pre-school age","There is growing evidence that even milder forms of maternal stress or anxiety during pregnancy affect the fetus causing possible long-term consequences for infant and child development. The mechanisms through which prenatal maternal stress may affect the unborn are not yet entirely clarified. Due to limited self-regulatory skills after birth, infants depend on sensitive behavior of their parents to regulate affective states and physiological arousal. Dyadic affect regulation has been linked to various developmental patterns up to adolescence and thereby represents a key element of early social relationships. Aim of the study was to evaluate possible long-term consequences of emotional stress during pregnancy and postpartum anxiety disorders, as well as infant postpartum cortisol reactivity on mother–child-interaction at pre-school age. The sample comprised of N = 63 mother–infant dyads at study entry, n = 28 diagnosed with postpartum anxiety disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV), n = 35 were healthy controls. Mothers were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders at an average infant age of M = 4.1 months and filled out a questionnaire regarding emotional stress during pregnancy. Further, they were videotaped during the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm (FFSF), a widely used mild socio-emotional stressor for infants. To determine infant stress-reactivity, infant salivary cortisol was collected before, immediately after and 20 min after the FFSF. Missing values were estimated by multiple imputations. At the age of M = 5.3 years, mother-child-interaction was re-assessed in a follow-up sample of n = 30 dyads via a free-play situation. Moreover, dimensional measures for anxiety were assessed. Mothers in the clinical group reported significantly higher stress scores than the control group. Infant stress reactivity in the early postpartum period and maternal anxiety symptoms at the 5-year follow-up assessment were significantly associated with dyadic interaction quality at pre-school age. Even though maternal stress during pregnancy did not directly predict mother–child interaction quality at pre-school age, it was significantly correlated with infant cortisol reactivity during postpartum period. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when interpreting the results considering the small sample size.

87,The flowering of positive psychology in foreign language teaching and acquisition research,"The present contribution offers an overview of a new area of research in the field of foreign language acquisition, which was triggered by the introduction of Positive Psychology (PP) (MacIntyre and Gregersen, 2012). For many years, a cognitive perspective had dominated research in applied linguistics. Around the turn of the millennium researchers became increasingly interested in the role of emotions in foreign language learning and teaching, beyond established concepts like foreign language anxiety and constructs like motivation and attitudes toward the foreign language. As a result, a more nuanced understanding of the role of positive and negative learner and teacher emotions emerged, underpinned by solid empirical research using a wide range of epistemological and methodological approaches. PP interventions have been carried out in schools and universities to strengthen learners and teachers’ experiences of flow, hope, courage, well-being, optimism, creativity, happiness, grit, resilience, strengths, and laughter with the aim of enhancing learners’ linguistic progress. This paper distinguishes the early period in the field that started with MacIntyre and Gregersen (2012), like a snowdrop after winter, and that was followed by a number of early studies in relatively peripheral journals. We argue that 2016 is the starting point of the current period, characterized by gradual recognition in applied linguistics, growing popularity of PP, and an exponential increase in publications in more mainstream journals. This second period could be compared to a luxuriant English garden in full bloom.

88,Hope and fulfillment after complex trauma: Using mixed methods to understand healing,"Research has shown that the experience of Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) can increase the rates of physical and emotional sequela, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and physical pain. However, little is known about the healing journeys for those women who, after surviving CSA, also experience unwanted sexual experiences (USE) as a young adult. The goal of this mixed method study is to compare identity, distress, and positive health outcomes for survivors of CSA and USE with those of women who have survived USE alone. First, 206 women completed a survey that evaluated mental health distress, trauma centrality, and health indicators, and these women were invited to take part in an additional interview. A subsample of 24 women agreed to be interviewed with a narrative interview that examined trauma recovery from a holistic perspective. Thematic analysis of the interview data revealed contextual and internal barriers and facilitators of healing. Eight qualitative dimensions were derived from code frequencies of the emerging 50 qualitative codes, including Normalization, Denial, Negative Impact, Positive Coping, Rumination, Identity Healing, Hope, and Fulfillment Healing, and Engagement Healing. We then used t-tests to compare the mean code frequencies of these code complexes for survivors of CSA/USE and USE alone, and the significant findings revealed hypotheses to be tested in the larger quantitative sample. H1: Survivors of CSA will have less denial than USE alone; H2: Survivors of CSA will have higher Negative Impact scores than USE alone, and H3: Survivors of CSA will have more Hope and Fulfillment than USE alone. H1 was supported; survivors of both CSA and USE had a significantly higher mean Centrality Scores than Survivors of USE alone. H2 was supported, and all negative impact scores were significantly higher for the survivors of both CSA and USE than survivors of USE alone. H3 was partially supported. Survivors of both CSA and USE had significantly higher mean Post-Traumatic growth scores. However, survivors of USE alone had significantly higher means for Sense of Coherence and Self-Compassion scores. Implications for practice are discussed.

89,Measuring the cognitive attentional syndrome in cardiac patients with anxiety and depression symptoms: Psychometric properties of the CAS-1R,"Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a recent treatment with established efficacy in mental health settings. MCT is grounded in the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model of emotional disorders and treats a negative perseverative style of thinking called the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS), thought to maintain psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The evaluation of effective psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in chronic physical illness is a priority and research in this area depends on the suitability and validity of measures assessing key psychological constructs. The present study examined the psychometric performance of a ten-item scale measuring the CAS, the CAS-1R, in a sample of cardiac rehabilitation patients experiencing mild to severe symptoms of anxiety and/or depression ( N = 440). Participants completed the CAS scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Metacognitions Questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30). The latent structure of the CAS-1R was assessed using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). In addition, the validity of the measure in explaining anxiety and depression was assessed using hierarchical regression. CFA supported a three-factor solution (i.e., coping strategies, negative metacognitive beliefs and positive metacognitive beliefs). CFA demonstrated a good fit, with a CFI = 0.988 and an RMSEA = 0.041 (90% CI = 0.017–0.063). Internal consistency was acceptable for the first two factors but low for the third, though all three demonstrated construct validity and the measure accounted for additional variance in anxiety and depression beyond age and gender. Results support the multi-factorial assessment of the CAS using this instrument, and demonstrate suitability for use in cardiac patients who are psychologically distressed.

90,Verifying Feighner’s hypothesis; anorexia nervosa is not a psychiatric disorder,"Mental causation takes explanatory priority over evolutionary biology in most accounts of eating disorders. The evolutionary threat of starvation has produced a brain that assists us in the search for food and mental change emerges as a consequence. The major mental causation hypothesis: anxiety causes eating disorders, has been extensively tested and falsified. The subsidiary hypothesis: anxiety and eating disorders are caused by the same genotype, generates inconsistent results because the phenotypes are not traits, but vary along dimensions. Challenging the mental causation hypothesis in Feighner et al. (1972) noted that anorexic patients are physically hyperactive, hoarding for food, and they are rewarded for maintaining a low body weight. In 1996, Feighner’s hypothesis was formalized, relating the patients’ behavioral phenotype to the brain mechanisms of reward and attention (Bergh and Södersten, 1996), and in 2002, the hypothesis was clinically verified by training patients how to eat normally, thus improving outcomes (Bergh et al., 2002). Seventeen years later we provide evidence supporting Feighner’s hypothesis by demonstrating that in 2012, 20 out of 37 patients who were referred by a psychiatrist, had a psychiatric diagnosis that differed from the diagnosis indicated by the SCID-I. Out of the 174 patients who were admitted in 2012, most through self-referral, there was significant disagreement between the outcomes of the SCID-I interview and the patient’s subjective experience of a psychiatric problem in 110 of the cases. In addition, 358 anorexic patients treated to remission scored high on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, but an item response analysis indicated one (unknown) underlying dimension, rather than the three dimensions the scale can dissociate in patients with psychiatric disorders. These results indicate that psychiatric diagnoses, which are reliable and valid in patients with psychiatric disorders, are less well suited for patients with anorexia. The results are in accord with the hypothesis of the present Research Topic, that eating disorders are not always caused by disturbed psychological processes, and support the alternative, clinically relevant hypothesis that the behavioral phenotype of the patients should be addressed directly.

91,"Inferiority or even superiority of virtual reality exposure therapy in phobias?—A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials specifically comparing the efficacy of virtual reality exposure to gold standard in vivo exposure in agoraphobia, specific phobia, and social phobia","Background: Convincing evidence on Virtual Reality (VR) exposure for phobic anxiety disorders has been reported, however, the benchmark and golden standard for phobia treatment is in vivo exposure. For direct treatment comparisons, the control of confounding variables is essential. Therefore, the comparison of VR and in vivo exposure in studies applying an equivalent amount of exposure in both treatments is necessary. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of reports published until June 2019. Inclusion criteria covered the diagnosis of Specific Phobia, Social Phobia, or Agoraphobia, and a randomized-controlled design with an equivalent amount of exposure in VR and in vivo. We qualitatively reviewed participants' characteristics, materials, and the treatment procedures of all included studies. For quantitative synthesis, we calculated Hedges' g effect sizes for the treatment effects of VR exposure, in vivo exposure, and the comparison of VR to in vivo exposure in all studies and separately for studies on each diagnosis. Results: Nine studies ( n = 371) were included, four on Specific Phobia, three on Social Phobia, and two on Agoraphobia. VR and in vivo exposure both showed large, significant effect sizes. The comparison of VR to in vivo exposure revealed a small, but non-significant effect size favoring in vivo ( g = −0.20). Specifically, effect sizes for Specific Phobia ( g = −0.15) and Agoraphobia ( g = −0.01) were non-significant, only for Social Phobia we found a significant effect size favoring in vivo ( g = −0.50). Except for Agoraphobia, effect sizes varied across studies from favoring VR to favoring in vivo exposure. Conclusions: We found no evidence that VR exposure is significantly less efficacious than in vivo exposure in Specific Phobia and Agoraphobia. The wide range of study specific effect sizes, especially in Social Phobia, indicates a high potential of VR, but also points to the need for a deeper investigation and empirical examination of relevant working mechanisms. In Social Phobia, a combination of VR exposure with cognitive interventions and the realization of virtual social interactions targeting central fears might be advantageous. Considering the advantages of VR exposure, its dissemination should be emphasized. Improvements in technology and procedures might even yield superior effects in the future.

92,Self-determined motivation and competitive anxiety in athletes/students: A probabilistic study using Bayesian networks,"This study attempts to analyze the relationship between two key psychological variables associated with performance in sports – Self-Determined Motivation and Competitive Anxiety – through Bayesian Networks (BN) analysis. We analyzed 674 university students that are athletes from 44 universities that competed at the University Games in Mexico, with an average age of 21 years (SD = 2.07) and with a mean of 8.61 years’ (SD = 5.15) experience in sports. Methods: Regarding the data analysis, firstly, classification using the CHAID algorithm was carried out to determine the dependence links between variables; Secondly, a BN was developed to reduce the uncertainty in the relationships between the two key psychological variables. The validation of the BN revealed AUC values ranging from 0.5 to 0.92. Subsequently, various instantiations were performed with hypothetical values applied to the “bottom” variables. Results showed two probability trees that have extrinsic motivation and amotivation at the top, while the anxiety/activation due to worries about performance was at the bottom of the probabilities. The instantiations carried out support the existence of these probabilistic relationships, demonstrating their scarce influence on anxiety about competition generated by the intrinsic motivation, and the complex probabilistic effect of introjected and identified regulation regarding the appearance of anxiety due to worry about performance.

93,Profiles of perfectionism among adolescents attending specialized elite- and ordinary lower secondary schools: A Norwegian cross-sectional comparative study,"The versatile construct of perfectionism has been heavily debated, e.g., its nature or measurement constituents, how it influences performances or, most importantly, our health. Conventional linear analyses seem inadequate to address such challenges. Hence, we used a latent variable and a person-centered approach to identify different patterns of perfectionism, and their relationships with psychological health as outcome among early adolescents (13–14 years) attending conventional or elite sports-/performance-oriented lower secondary schools (14 schools, 832 students, 53% girls). All students completed two perfectionism scales, i.e., the child-adolescent perfectionism scale (CAPS) and the frost multidimensional perfectionism scale (FMPS). The criterion-related variables of psychological health included anxiety, depression, eating disorder problems, self-worth and resilience, respectively. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded a four-factor representation of perfectionism. Using latent class analysis extracted five profiles of perfectionism, which were related to the criterion variables. Three profiles were clear indicators of either low or high perfectionism score patterns. Two profiles showed a mixed picture of high and low scores, whereas one represented a psychological healthy subgroup. About four of ten adolescents in the ordinary schools matched the two most debilitating perfectionism profiles compared to two of ten in the elite schools. How these results align with international findings is discussed along with the relevance for early interventions aimed at preventing the potential downsides of perfectionism. Longitudinal studies are need to explore profile trajectories as well as possible health consequences.

94,Interventions for psychological health of stroke caregivers: A systematic review,"Background: The increasing number of stroke patients (SPs) requires informal caregivers to bear a high burden of responsibilities and heavy (di)stress. Moreover, these issues could lead to the development of serious psychological problems (e.g., depressive and/or anxious) that in turn could give rise to poor health-related quality of life outcomes. However, although the value of psychological interventions has been widely recognized for SPs, the scientific literature lacks an updated synthesis of interventions addressing the psychological health of their caregivers. Aim: The aim of this review is to summarize the interventions for the psychological health of stroke caregivers and provide a resume of literature-based evidence of their efficacy. Method: A literature review from 2005 to date was conducted in three online databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria for studies were (A) English language, (B) caregivers and patients aged 18 years or above, (C) SP's caregiver beneficiating of a specific intervention, and (D) outcome measures addressing depressive and/or anxiety symptomology, quality of life, well-being, or burden. Results: Across the selected 45 studies, substantial differences are observable in three main categories: (a) type of intervention (b) techniques, and (c) operators. Interventions' advantages and results are discussed. Overall, studies using psychological techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, coping skill-training, and problem-solving therapy, showed their usefulness and efficacy in reducing the caregivers' depressive and anxious symptoms, and burden. Interventions led by psychologists and tailored to meet caregivers' specific needs showed more positive outcomes. Conclusion: This review underlines the usefulness of psychological interventions aimed at reducing the psychological burden, such as anxious and depressive symptomatology, of SPs' informal caregivers. Hence, psychological interventions for caregivers should be integrated as part of the stroke rehabilitation process to improve informal caregivers' and patients' quality of life and well-being.

95,“You feel they have a heart and are not afraid to show it”: Exploring how clients experience the therapeutic relationship in emotion-focused therapy,"Background: The therapeutic relationship is regarded as an important source of change in emotion-focused therapy (EFT) (Greenberg, 2014; Watson, 2018), but few qualitative studies have specifically investigated how clients experience the role of the relationship in EFT. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to explore what clients experienced as helpful or hindering aspects of the therapeutic relationship when undergoing EFT for depression, anxiety, and severe self-criticism. Methods: We interviewed 18 clients after a clinical trial of time-limited EFT, to explore their experiences of the relationship with their therapist during treatment. The interviews were analyzed using hermeneutic-phenomenological thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006; Binder et al., 2012). Results: We identified four main themes: (1) Forming a trusting relationship or finding it hard to connect, (2) Collaborating and struggling to find new ways to relate to painful feelings, (3) Alliance ruptures and needs for repair when working with distressing emotions, and (4) The significance of new relational experiences. Conclusion: Clients described therapists’ genuineness and the establishment of trust in the relationship as important preconditions to open up to vulnerability and painful feelings, and engaging fully in specific EFT interventions. The findings also indicate that the therapists need to be mindful of different client preferences and monitor potential alliance ruptures when working to change distressing emotions in therapy.

96,Effects of ego-depletion and state anxiety on performance changes in dart-throwing tasks: A latent curve model approach reporting trial data for human participants,"This study examined the effects ego depletion (ED) and state anxiety (SA)have on performance changes in dart-throwing, a perceptual-motor task, using a Latent Curve Model (LCM). Twenty-two men, who had never played darts before, were recruited and randomly assigned to two counterbalanced groups: Group A was exposed first to ED and then to non-ED (NED), and Group B was exposed first to NED and then to ED. We found that the number of trials had a non-linear effect on darts performance, which improved as the number of trials increased before declining again; that is, mean radial error decreased first and then increased. Therefore, motor performance was sustained in the form of a quadratic curve as the number of task executions increased. In general, the higher the degree of ED and SA, the greater the negative effect on performance. However, this phenomenon was observed only in the early-phase trials, and the interacting influence of ED and SA appeared in the late-phase trials. Thus, this study demonstrated that ED and SA have direct effects on performance curves in early-phase trials only, and that their interacting influence appears in late-phase trials.

97,Psychological flexibility as a resilience factor in individuals with chronic pain,"Resilience factors have been suggested as key mechanisms in the relation between symptoms and disability among individuals with chronic pain. However, there is a need to better operationalize resilience and to empirically evaluate its role and function. The present study examined psychological flexibility as a resilience factor in relation to symptoms and functioning among 252 adults with chronic pain applying for participation in a digital ACT-based self-help treatment. Participants completed measures of symptoms (pain intensity, and anxiety), functioning (pain interference and depression), as well as the hypothesized resilience factor psychological flexibility (measured as avoidance, value obstruction, and value progress). As expected, symptoms, functioning and resilience factors were significantly associated. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that psychological flexibility significantly contributed to the prediction of pain interference and depression when adjusting for age, pain and anxiety. Also, participants with low levels of psychological flexibility were more likely to be on sick leave. Furthermore, a series of multiple mediation analyses showed that psychological flexibility had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between symptoms and functioning. Avoidance was consistently shown to contribute to the indirect effect. Results support previous findings and suggest the importance of psychological flexibility as a resilience factor among individuals with chronic pain and anxiety.

98,Attachment style of volunteer counselors in telephone emergency services predicts counseling process,"Telephone emergency services (TES) provide emotional support and aim to prevent suicide. The current study examines a potential change of volunteer counselors’ attachment characteristics during TES training and investigates the predictive influence of counselor attachment for their competence and working alliance with callers. We recruited 261 volunteers enrolled in training for paraprofessional counseling in the German Telephone Emergency Service (TelefonSeelsorge). Participants were assessed three times during their training (mean training duration 13.3 months) and responded to questionnaires on adult attachment (Experience in Close Relationships-Revised) and their counseling competence (adapted Development of Psychotherapists Common Core Questionnaire). In addition, they indicated the quality of the working alliance (adapted Working Alliance Inventory – Short, Revised) with their client callers upon training completion. Results showed that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, significantly decreased during training. Lower attachment avoidance predicted better working alliances with callers as well as better general skillfulness. Implications for the training of volunteer telephone counselors are discussed.

99,"Creative flexibility performance is neither related to anxiety, nor to self-control strength, nor to their interaction","Previous research has reliably found that self-control strength moderates the anxiety-performance relationship for cognitive and perceptual-motor tasks that involve executive functioning. In the present preregistered experiment ( N = 200; https://aspredicted.org/a775h.pdf), we investigated whether the interaction of anxiety and self-control also predicts creative flexibility performance. According to the Attentional Control Theory, anxiety can impair executive functioning. In the case that creative flexibility relies on executive functions, anxiety should therefore interfere with creative flexibility performance. However, self-control strength has been demonstrated to serve as a buffer against the negative effects of anxiety on executive functioning. Therefore, we assumed that there will be a negative relationship between anxiety and creative flexibility performance, and that this negative relationship would be more pronounced for participants who are low compared to high in momentary self-control strength. Analogous to the previous studies, we manipulated the participants’ self-control strength (ego depletion vs. no depletion) and subsequently induced a potentially threatening test situation. The participants then completed a measure of their state anxiety and a standardized test of creative flexibility. Contrary to our expectation, self-control strength, state anxiety, and their interaction did not predict creative flexibility performance. Complementary Bayesian hypothesis testing revealed strong support for the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that, at least under certain conditions, creative flexibility performance may be unrelated to resource-dependent executive functions.

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of pain and to test the association between demographic, clinical, psychological factors, and self-assessed pain in Chinese cancer population. Methods: A total of 553 cancer patients were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Patient’s basic demographic data was collected by a study-designed information sheet, and patient’s pain, sleep disturbance and psychological distress were assessed by several validated measurements (MPQ-SF, AIS, FoP-Q-SF, PHQ-9, and GAD-7). Descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed. Results: Of the 553 patients, 411 (74.32%) patients reported that they experience some degree of pain. Fear of progression, anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with different subscales and the overall pain score in bivariate correlation matrix. Insomnia, depressive symptoms, and fear of cancer progression were significant independent factors of cancer pain on multivariate analyses. Conclusion: Psychological factors play a great role in the relationship between objective pathophysiology and patient’s subjective experience of pain. It is important to evaluate each individual in detail with respect to psychological distress and pain severity when planning treatment and rehabilitation.

101,Color choice preference in cognitively impaired patients: A look inside Alzheimer’s disease through the use of Lüscher color diagnostic,"Objective: To study the emotional state of cognitively impaired patients through the color choice preference in a group of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and compare it with a group of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and a matched control group. Methods: A total of 71 AD, 50 MCI and 68 controls were consecutively evaluated. All patients and controls underwent the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) and the Lüscher color test. Results: Cognitively impaired patients mainly chose auxiliary colors, in particular violet and brown, and rejected black and gray. AD patients predominantly chose forms corresponding to auxiliary colors. The auxiliary color choice negatively correlated with the MMSE score. MCI patients and controls had a higher presence of anxiety on gray table and controls had higher frustration and ambivalence, i.e., psychic complexity, on basic color tables.Data globally suggest that AD patients live with a feeling of personal change due to instability and emotional insecurity, experiencing physical discomfort and a bodily need of being welcomed in a favorable environment. They aspire to a sensitive understanding by someone with whom they can be identified. Differently, MCI patients have less of these needs; however, they feel more anxious. Conclusion: The comprehension of the inner emotional state of cognitively impaired patients allows us to better communicate with them and effectively approach their behavioral disorders. Like other projective techniques, such as the tree-drawing test and the human figure-drawing test, Lüscher color test is proposed as a simple and unconventional approach to understand the emotional life of AD patients. The awareness of clinicians about the existential fragility and insecurity of such type of patients allows us not only to better manage their behavioral disturbances but also to improve their quality of life and that of their caregivers.

102,A longitudinal examination of military veterans’ Invictus Games stress experiences,"This study explored patterns of change in stress variables (i.e., stressors, appraisals, emotions) encountered by wounded, injured, and sick military veterans in the build up to, during, and following an international sporting competition. The study also examined interactions between psychosocial variables and salivary biomarkers of stress and how these relate to veterans’ health, well-being, illness, and performance. 40 Invictus Games (IG) athletes and a control group of 20 military veteran athletes completed questionnaires at seven time points over a 12-week period. Furthermore, participants provided morning and evening saliva samples at four time points to measure cortisol and secretory immunoglobulin A. Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed significant changes in growth trajectories of stress-related variables. For example, team and culture stressors and anger and dejection emotions significantly increased in the build up to competition, whilst challenge appraisals and excitement and happiness emotions significantly decreased over the same time-frame. A number of the stress related variables also predicted performance, well-being, and mental health. Specifically, organizational stressors and threat appraisals were found to negatively relate to performance, well-being, and mental health. Furthermore, whilst challenge appraisals and problem focused coping positively related to veterans’ well-being, adopting emotion-focused and avoidance coping strategies negatively predicted well-being and mental health. Turning to emotions, experiencing anger, anxiety, and dejection negatively related to mental health, well-being and performance; whereas happiness and excitement displayed a positive relationship with these outcomes. The findings also highlighted that organizational stressor intensity was positively related to cortisol exposure at competition. To conclude, this study not only provides a novel, longitudinal, interdisciplinary insight into psychological and biological markers of the stress response as it relates to the performance, health, and well-being of military veterans, but also further contributes to theoretical understanding on the transactional nature of stress. Moreover, the findings significantly contribute to practice regarding how best to support this unique population in adaptively responding to and engaging with competitive sport.

103,How to reduce test anxiety and academic procrastination through inquiry of cognitive appraisals: A pilot study investigating the role of academic self-efficacy,"Background and Objectives: Test anxiety can impair learning motivation and lead to procrastination. Control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006) assumes test anxiety to be a result of students’ appraisals of the testing situation and its outcomes. Modification of cognitive appraisals such as low self-efficacy beliefs is thus assumed to reduce test anxiety and subsequent procrastination. In the present study, we tested the effects of an inquiry-based stress reduction (IBSR) intervention on students’ academic self-efficacy, their test anxiety, and subsequent procrastination in the final stages of an academic term. Design: Longitudinal quasi-randomized intervention control trial. Methods: University students identified worry thoughts regarding a specific and frightening testing situation. Intervention participants ( n = 40) explored their worry thoughts with the IBSR method. Participants of an active waitlist control group ( n = 31) received the intervention after the study was completed. Dependent variables were assessed before and after the intervention as well as at the end of the term. Results: Data-analyses revealed that the IBSR intervention reduced test anxiety as well as subsequent academic procrastination in comparison to the control group. The effect on test anxiety was partly due to an enhancement of self-efficacy. Conclusion: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that IBSR might help individuals to cope with their test anxiety and procrastination.

104,Effects of dance movement therapy and dance on health-related psychological outcomes. A meta-analysis update,"Background: Dance is an embodied activity and, when applied therapeutically, can have several specific and unspecific health benefits. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of dance movement therapy (DMT) and dance interventions for psychological health outcomes. Research in this area grew considerably from 1.3 detected studies/year in 1996–2012 to 6.8 detected studies/year in 2012–2018. Method: We synthesized 41 controlled intervention studies ( N = 2,374; from 01/2012 to 03/2018), 21 from DMT, and 20 from dance, investigating the outcome clusters of quality of life, clinical outcomes (with sub-analyses of depression and anxiety), interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, and (psycho-)motor skills. We included recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in areas such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, elderly patients, oncology, neurology, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular disease, including follow-up data in eight studies. Results: Analyses yielded a medium overall effect ( d ² = 0.60), with high heterogeneity of results ( I ² = 72.62%). Sorted by outcome clusters, the effects were medium to large ( d = 0.53 to d = 0.85). All effects, except the one for (psycho-)motor skills, showed high inconsistency of results. Sensitivity analyses revealed that type of intervention (DMT or dance) was a significant moderator of results. In the DMT cluster , the overall medium effect was small, significant, and homogeneous/consistent ( d = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001, I ² = 3.47). In the dance intervention cluster , the overall medium effect was large, significant, yet heterogeneous/non-consistent ( d = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001, I ² = 77.96). Results suggest that DMT decreases depression and anxiety and increases quality of life and interpersonal and cognitive skills, whereas dance interventions increase (psycho-)motor skills. Larger effect sizes resulted from observational measures, possibly indicating bias. Follow-up data showed that on 22 weeks after the intervention, most effects remained stable or slightly increased. Discussion: Consistent effects of DMT coincide with findings from former meta-analyses. Most dance intervention studies came from preventive contexts and most DMT studies came from institutional healthcare contexts with more severely impaired clinical patients, where we found smaller effects, yet with higher clinical relevance. Methodological shortcomings of many included studies and heterogeneity of outcome measures limit results. Initial findings on long-term effects are promising.

Numerous questions remain to be answered with regard to the relationship between cyberbullying and school refusal behavior. This study examines school refusal profiles (measured by School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised) and assesses whether these profiles vary with respect to the level of victimization, aggression, aggression-victimization, and observation of cyberbullying (measured with the Screening of Harassment among Peers). The sample consisted of 1,102 Spanish high school students, aged 12–18 ( M = 14.30, SD = 1.71). Latent class analysis revealed three school refusal behavior profiles: non-school refusal behavior, school refusal behavior by negative reinforcements (oriented to the avoidance of social evaluation and negative affectivity in school situations), and school refusal behavior by positive reinforcements (oriented to obtaining the attention of others with significant or tangible reinforcements). The ANOVA found statistically significant differences for all cyberbullying behaviors. Students with school refusal by negative reinforcements had significantly higher mean scores as compared to the other profiles in victimization, aggression, aggression-victimization, and observation behaviors, while the levels of cyberbullying were similar between students without school refusal and students with school refusal behavior by positive reinforcements. These findings underscore the need to consider priority interventions to prevent cyberbullying in children who refuse school for the purpose of avoiding situations of anxiety and negative emotions.

106,"Child and Adolescent Social Adaptive Functioning Scale: Factorial invariance, latent mean differences, and its impact on school refusal behavior in Spanish children","This study aims to examine the factorial invariance and latent mean differences across gender of the Spanish version of the Child and Adolescent Social Adaptive Functioning Scale (Study 1) and to value the function of social functioning as a protective ability of school refusal behavior (Study 2). Participants were Spanish students aged 8–12 years carefully chosen by simple random cluster, 345 for the first study ( M = 9.17; SD = 1.03) and 1,032 students for the second study ( M = 10.02; SD = 1.77). The measures used were the Child and Adolescent Social Adaptive Functioning Scale (CASAFS) and the School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised (SRAS-R). Results about the validation of the scale supported the model proposed in this study for the CASAFS, with 15 items and a four-factor structure (school performance, peer relationships, family relationships, and home duties/self-care). Findings revealed invariance across gender for this model and good internal consistency levels were exhibited in each of the four dimensions of the CASAFS (0.76, 0.72, 0.74, and 0.71). Latent mean differences did not report differences between boys and girls. Regarding the second study, the social functioning acted as a protective factor of school refusal behavior by negatively and significantly predicting high scores in school refusal behavior due to anxiety symptoms or feelings of negative affect linked to the obligation to attend school. Opposite results were found for those students who justify their refusal to attend school in pursuing tangible reinforcements outside the school setting. These findings strengthen the reliability and validity of the CASAFS and the idea of social functioning as a person’s ability which could prevent school refusal behavior is discussed.

107,Caregiver choice and caregiver outcomes: A longitudinal study of Irish spousal dementia caregivers,"Background: The perception of choice in becoming a caregiver may impact on caregiver psychological and physical health. We determined the proportion of spousal dementia caregivers who felt they had a choice, and examined whether lack of choice in taking up the caregiving role and the perceived degree of choice in caregiving predicted caregiver health and wellbeing and care-recipient placement in long-term care at 1-year follow-up. Methods: We performed secondary analyses of data from DeStress, a longitudinal study of 251 spousal dementia caregivers in Ireland. We used multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses to examine whether lack of choice (a dichotomous item) and/or the perceived degree of choice (a 9-point scale) at baseline predicted caregiver health (number of chronic health conditions; self-reported health) and wellbeing (e.g., burden, anxiety, depression, stress, and positive aspects of caregiving) and care status (continued care at home or placement in long-term care) at follow-up. Results: The vast majority of caregivers (82%) reported that they had no choice in taking up the caregiving role. Nevertheless, nearly three-quarters (74%) responded above the midpoint on the rating scale (Mean = 6.82, SD = 3.22; Median = 9; Mode = 9), indicating they provided care voluntarily. Caregivers who reported a greater degree of choice were more likely to still be providing care at home at follow-up and to identify benefits from providing care. Neither choice nor degree of choice predicted any other caregiver outcomes. Conclusion: For the vast majority of spousal dementia caregivers, taking up the caregiving role is not perceived as a choice; yet, most report performing this role voluntarily. Thus, facilitating greater choice may not necessarily diminish the key contribution family caregivers make to the care system. Although we found no evidence that caregiver choice predicted more positive caregiver health and wellbeing, the perception of choice is important in and of itself, and may benefit caregivers by facilitating the identification of positive aspects of care and be a factor in delaying care-recipient placement in long-term care. Future research should be especially mindful of how caregiver choice is assessed and how this may affect the resulting prevalence of choice.

108,"Quality of life, depression, anxiety symptoms and mood state of wheelchair athletes and non-athletes: A preliminary study","The present study aims to compare quality of life, depression, anxiety symptoms, and profile of mood state of wheelchair athletes and non-athletes. Thirty-nine basketball and rugby wheelchair athletes ( n = 23, nine women, age 36.0 ± 10.0 years; body mass 66.2 ± 13.8 kg; height 170.0 ± 8.5 cm) and non-athletes ( n = 16, 4 women, 39.0 ± 14.2 years; body mass 79.6 ± 17.2 kg; height 170.0 ± 6.4 cm) were recruited. Quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms and mood disorders were evaluated by the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and Profile of Mood State questionnaire, respectively. Comparison between groups (non-athletes vs. athletes) was performed using Student’s t -test for independent samples. No differences ( p &gt; 0.05) were found between non-athletes vs. athletes regards to quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms and profile of mood state. Overall, non-athletes and athletes presented medium anxiety symptoms and mild to moderate depressive symptoms. In conclusion, the wheelchair athletes and non-athletes presented similar quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and profile of mood state.

109,Impact of physical exercise on symptoms of depression and anxiety in pre-adolescents: A pilot randomized trial,"Aim: The intensity of the most appropriate exercise to use in depressed youth is unclear due to differences in methodology and the lack of evidence documenting the effect of physical activity in children. Therefore, the authors of this study attempted to document the effectiveness of different training intensities to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in pre-teens. Methods: The study included twenty-seven, randomly selected pre-adolescents (aged between 9–11 years of age) all of whom had Primary education. The participants were enrolled and, over a 5-week period, were subject to either intensive or low-to-moderate exercise programs four times a week. Psychological self-reports, as well as physical examinations, were conducted before and after such programs in blinded assessments. Psychological effects were considered the primary outcome, whilst physical condition was secondary. Results: Four subjects were lost and twenty-three were analyzed. General linear model with 2 criteria revealed significant changes ( p = 0.05) in trait anxiety symptoms over time in the low-to-moderate intensity group (LMIG). Within group changes followed a significant decrease in levels of anxiety (38.82 ± 2.20 to 33.36 ± 2.83, p = 0.004) and depression (10.36 ± 2.83 to 6.73 ± 1.88, p = 0.006) related symptoms amongst those in the LMIG. Interpretation: This study indicated that depression and anxiety symptoms were reduced amongst a non-clinical sample of Primary educated pre-adolescents when they were subject to a low-to-moderate exercise program. The program focused on associating movement with pleasure, encouraged positive and non-competitive interactions between participants.

110,Mindful sensation seeking: An examination of the protective influence of selected personality traits on risk sport-specific stress,"Stress often has a negative influence on sports performance. Stress-induced decreases in performance can be especially disastrous for risk sports athletes, who often put their life at risk when practicing their sport. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify protective factors in stressful situations in risk sports. On average, risk sports athletes score extremely high on the personality trait sensation seeking. At the same time, theoretical considerations about dispositional mindfulness suggest that mindful athletes can handle stress more effectively. The main goal of this experiment is to examine the influence of sensation seeking and mindfulness on the stress response to a risk sport-specific stressor. To induce stress, 88 male students completed the Heidelberg Risk Sport-Specific Stress Test (HRSST) which utilizes fear of falling as the stressful event during a climbing exercise. Psychological (anxiety) and physiological (cortisol) responses were measured at multiple time points before and after the HRSST to determine the severity of the stress response. In reaction to the stressor, a significant increase in self-reported state anxiety, but no significant increase in cortisol were observed. The mindfulness subscale external observation correlated positively with anxiety in the climbing wall, sensation seeking and the anxiety scales after the jump correlated negatively and sensation seeking predicted anxiety subscales after the jump in hierarchical regression analyses. However, mindfulness did not predict anxiety measures. Neither sensation seeking nor mindfulness correlated significantly with cortisol levels. The results suggest that high sensation seekers perceive a risk sport-specific stressor as less stressful. The missing physiological response might be explained by the Cross-Stressor-Adaptation-Hypothesis and particularities of the sample. Good internal observers might be especially aware of their need of stimulation and new experiences, which in turn might explain the higher experience-seeking scores. Future studies should further examine the role of mindfulness in stressful situations and the interaction of its subscales with sensation seeking. The current experiment offers new possibilities for adjoining research fields at the interface between sports sciences, psychology and medicine: The findings can be transferred to high risk professions such as police officers, firefighters and military forces (e.g., for selection processes or for interventions).

111,A randomized controlled trial of metacognitive therapy for depression: Analysis of 1-year follow-up,"This paper reports the 1-year follow-up results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which examined the efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT) for unipolar depression compared to a waiting condition. Thirty-nine patients with major depression were offered MCT and were divided into two conditions; immediate MCT with 10 weekly sessions or a waiting period that had a 10-week delayed MCT start. Two participants dropped out during the waiting condition. Thirty-four patients participated in the follow-up assessment. Based on the intent-to-treat sample and all patients, 67% were classified as recovered, 13% improved, and 20% were unchanged at 1-year follow-up. For the completers sample 73% recovered, 12% improved, and 15% were unchanged. Five of the 31 patients (13%) that were in remission at post-treatment experienced relapse at 1-year follow-up. Within-group effect sizes were large for reductions in symptoms of depression ( d = 2.09) and anxiety ( d = 1.16) at 1-year. Treatment response was associated with reductions in rumination, worry, and metacognitive beliefs as predicted by the metacognitive model, but reductions in metacognitions independently predicted reductions in depression scores from pre-treatment to 1-year follow-up. The results suggest that treatment gains are stable at 1-year follow-up. The study sets the stage for future research, which should evaluate MCT over a longer term and compare it with active treatments using suitably powered RCTs.

112,Acute stress shapes creative cognition in trait anxiety,"This study examined the cognitive mechanism underlying acute stress in creative cognition among individuals with high and low trait anxiety. Specifically, cognitive inhibition was assessed using the flanker task during acute stress. Fifty-two participants (26 with high trait anxiety, 26 with low trait anxiety, with a mean age of 18.94 years) underwent stress induction via the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). They all completed the Alternative Uses Test (AUT) and the Remote Associates Test (RAT) before and after the TSST. Biochemical markers (salivary cortisol and salivary alpha amylase) were recorded at regular intervals. The results showed that cognitive inhibition was influenced by trait anxiety and acute stress. In low-trait anxious individuals after experiencing acute stress, there was a lack of cognitive inhibition and they performed better in AUT (fluency), compared to before experiencing acute stress, whereas high-trait anxious individuals showed a decreased interference effect and reduced performance in AUT (fluency, flexibility, and originality). In the RAT, there were shorter response times and increased accuracy after acute stress in both high- and low-trait anxiety groups. Thus, we suggest that cognitive control, which modulates changes in acute stress, influences creative cognition. These findings provide evidence that inhibition control mediates the effect of stress on the creativity of individuals with different trait anxiety.

113,Priming emotional salience reveals the role of episodic memory and task conflict in the non-color word stroop task,"Previous research attempted to account for the emotional Stroop effect based on connectionist models of the Stroop task that implicate conflict in the output layer as the underlying mechanism (e.g., Williams et al., 1996). Based on Kalanthroff et al.’s (2015) proactive-control/task-conflict (PC-TC) model, our study argues that the interference from non-color words (neutral and negative words) is due to task conflict. Using a study-test procedure 120 participants (59 high and 61 low trait anxiety) studied negative and neutral control words prior to being tested on a color responding task that included studied and unstudied words. The results for the low anxiety group show no emotional Stroop effect, but do demonstrate the slowdown in response latencies to a block of studied and unstudied words compared to a block of unstudied words. In contrast, the high anxiety group shows (a) an emotional Stroop effect but only for studied negative words and (b) a reversed sequential modulation in which studied negative words slowed down the color-responding of studied negative words on the next trial. We consider how these findings can be incorporated into the PC-TC model and suggest the interacting role of trait anxiety, episodic memory, and emotional salience driving attention that is based on task conflict.

114,The relationship between math anxiety and math performance: A meta-analytic investigation,"Math anxiety (MA) has been suggested to decrease the math performance of students. However, it remains unclear what factors moderate this relationship. The aim of this research was to explore the link between MA and math performance. Studies that explored the math anxiety-performance link, conducted from 2000 to 2019 (84 samples, N = 8680), were identified and statistically integrated with a meta-analysis method. The results indicated a robust negative math anxiety-performance link. Furthermore, regarding the analysis of moderator variables, this negative link was stronger in the studies that involved Asian students, but this link was the weakest in the studies that involved European students. Moreover, this negative link was stronger in the studies within a senior high school group, whereas it was the weakest in the studies within an elementary group. Finally, this negative link was strongest among studies that used a custom test and studies that assessed problem-solving skills. Potential explanations and implications for research and practice are discussed.

115,"The role of anxiety, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence on general perceived self-efficacy in university students","The main objective of the present research is to analyze the relationship of levels of self-efficacy and anxiety, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence in Spanish university students. This study has a cross-sectional design. The sample was composed of 258 university students recruited from three academic areas. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Significant bivariate analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between self-efficacy and state anxiety ( r = −0.340) and trait anxiety ( r = −0.466). In addition, a direct correlation was found between self-efficacy and the coping strategies of problem-solving ( r = 0.312), emotional expression ( r = 0.133), cognitive restructuring ( r = 0.195), social withdrawal ( r = 0.103), and coping with a situation ( r = 0.303), as well as with the emotional intelligence dimensions of emotional clarity ( r = 0.397) and repair mood ( r = 0.347). Multivariate regression analysis showed that trait anxiety, problem-solving, emotional expression, social withdrawal, and emotional clarity were significantly related to the dependent variable, predicting 39% of total variance on levels of general perceived self-efficacy. In conclusion, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the related factors to general perceived self-efficacy in undergraduate students.

116,Psychometric properties of the general anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale in a heterogeneous psychiatric sample,"The GAD-7 is commonly used as a measure of general anxiety symptoms across various settings and populations. However, there has been disagreement regarding the factor structure of the GAD-7, and there is a need for larger studies investigating the psychometric properties of the measure. Patients undergoing treatment ( N = 1201), both inpatient and outpatient patients, completed the GAD-7 at pre- and post-treatment. Measures of depression, well-being, and other anxiety measures were also completed, making it possible to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Internal consistency and convergent validity were excellent for the total sample, and there was acceptable variation related to treatment groups. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random sample (50%) of the patients at intake and then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the factor structure in the other part of the sample at intake. The EFA indicated a clear one-factor solution, but the one-factor solution with CFA provided a poor fit to the data. Correlating the residuals among items assessing somatic symptoms led to a good fit in a respecified CFA solution. The GAD-7 has excellent internal consistency, and the one-factor structure in a heterogeneous clinical population was supported.

117,A comparison of metacognitive therapy in current versus persistent depressive disorder—A pilot outpatient study,"Background: Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a modern approach with demonstrated efficacy in current major depressive disorder (MDD). The treatment aims to modify thinking styles of rumination and worry and their underlying metacognitions, which have been shown to be involved in the initiation and perpetuation of MDD. We hypothesized that metacognitive therapy may also be effective in treating persistent depressive disorder (PDD). Methods: Thirty depressed patients (15 with MDD; 15 with PDD) were included. Patients in both groups were comparable on depression severity and sociodemographic characteristics, but PDD was associated with more former treatments. Metacognitive therapy was applied by trained psychotherapists for a mean of 16 weeks. Results: We observed a significant improvement of depressive symptoms in both groups, and comparable remission rates at the end of treatment and after 6 months follow-up. Furthermore, we observed significant and similar levels of improvement in rumination, dysfunctional metacognitions, and anxiety symptoms in both groups. Limitations: The study is limited by the small sample size and a missing independent control group. The effect of the therapeutic alliance was not controlled. The quality of depression rating could have been higher. Conclusions: We demonstrated that metacognitive therapy can successfully be applied to patients with PDD. The observed results were comparable to those obtained for patients with current major depressive disorder. Further studies with larger groups and a randomized design are needed to confirm these promising initial findings.

118,Math anxiety: The relationship between parenting style and math self-efficacy,"The goal of the current study is to examine the direct and indirect influences of parenting styles, math self-efficacy, and the participants’ sex on math anxiety. The research population ( N = 204) included randomly selected participants, whose native language is Hebrew and were born in Israel. The participants were surveyed about four measures that served as the research tools. They answered questions about demographics, math anxiety, and the parenting style of the child’s mother and about math self-efficacy. The research data concluded that there were strong correlations between the authoritarian parenting style and math anxiety. The authoritative parenting style had both a direct positive correlation and an indirect negative correlation on math anxiety. This is in contrast to the permissive parenting style which was exclusively found to have a small positive correlation on math anxiety. The participant’s sex had both direct and indirect influences on math anxiety. Math anxiety levels, as well as the negative effects of self-efficacy on the level of math anxiety, were higher in females compared to males. These findings are relevant when considering methods of diagnosis and intervention surrounding math anxiety.

119,Risk of mental disorders in children and adolescents with atopic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Assessing the psychological effects on children and adolescents of suffering atopic dermatitis (AD) is essential, when planning successful management. This study aimed to systematically review the literature regarding risk of mental disorders in children and adolescents with, or without, AD; and to explore confounders. We identified potentially relevant studies from EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC, the British Nursing Index, the Family and Society Studies Worldwide, the Social Work Abstracts, and the Sociological Abstracts from inception to Sep 30, 2018. Investigators independently screened titles and abstracts, and then full-texts. Investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Meta-analyses using random-effects models were performed, reporting odds ratios (ORs; 95% CIs). Thirty-seven studies ( n = 2,068,911 children/ adolescents) were included. Meta-analysis of 35 studies found that children and adolescents with AD had significantly higher risk of total mental disorders than those without AD (OR = 1.652; 95% CI, 1.463–1.864). There was no significant difference in risks for ADHD (OR = 1.563; 95% CI, 1.382–1.769); sleep disorders (OR = 2.100; 95% CI, 1.322–3.336); anxiety (OR = 1.339; 95% CI, 1.062–1.687); depression (OR = 1.402 95% CI, 1.256–1.565); conduct disorder (OR = 1.494 95% CI, 1.230–1.815); or ASD (OR = 2.574; 95% CI, 1.469–4.510; Q b = 8.344, p = 0.138). Race/ethnicity of child, target of comparison, type of studies, representativeness of the sample, measures of AD and mental disorders were significant moderators for total mental disorders. Integrated, holistic, multidisciplinary management of pediatric AD is significantly important, which emphasizes the well-being of the whole person.

120,The mediating role of romantic attachment in the relationship between attachment to parents and aggression,"Background: A secure attachment style could promote more intimacy in romantic relationships, while an insecure attachment style could be correlated with less positive romantic relationships in adulthood. Numerous studies have noted that a secure attachment to parents was correlated with lower levels of aggression, whereas insecure attachments were associated with higher levels of aggression. We aimed to investigate the role of the attachment system as a mediator of the expression of aggressiveness during adolescence. Specifically, we considered that the attachment to parents and peers could influence one’s attachment to a romantic partner. Methods: We empirically tested whether there were relationships of parent and peer attachment on aggressiveness mediated by romantic attachment style. Participants of the study included 411 students. Results: Results indicated that for males an insecure father-child attachment style seems to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and avoidance in romantic attachments and then with aggressiveness. For females, an insecure mother-child attachment style seems to be associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Conclusion: The attachment to parents and to peers plays a key role in defining romantic attachment according to gender, and these dimensions in turn tend to affect the levels of aggressiveness.

121,Alexithymia and psychological distress in patients with fibromyalgia and rheumatic disease,"Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic rheumatologic disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and other psychopathological symptoms which have a negative impact on patients’ quality of life. FMS is frequently associated with alexithymia, a multidimensional construct characterized by difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF) and verbally communicating them difficulty describing feelings (DDF) and an externally oriented cognitive thinking style (EOT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between alexithymia, anxious and depressive symptoms and pain perception, in patients with FMS and other rheumatic diseases (RD). Methods: The sample consisted of 127 participants (M = 25, F = 102; mean age: 51.97; SD: 11.14), of which 48 with FMS, 41 with RD and 38 healthy control group (HC). All groups underwent to a test battery investigating anxiety and depressive symptoms (HADS), pain (VAS; QUID-S/-A) and alexithymia (TAS-20). Results: A high prevalence of alexithymia (TAS ≥ 61) was found in FMS (47.9%) and RD (41.5%) patients, compared to the HC group (2.6%). FMS patients showed significant higher scores than HC on DIF, DDF, EOT, anxiety and depression. The clinical sample, FMS and RD groups combined ( n = 89), alexithymic patients (AL, n = 40) exhibited higher scores in pain and psychological distress compared to non-alexithymic patients (N-AL, n = 34). Regression analysis found no relationship between alexithymia and pain in AL, meanwhile pain intensity was predicted by anxiety in N-AL. Conclusion: While increasing clinical symptoms (pain intensity and experience, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression) in patients with fibromyalgia or rheumatic diseases, correlations were found on the one side, between alexithymia and psychological distress, on the other side, between pain experience and intensity. Meanwhile, when symptoms of psychological distress and alexithymia were subthreshold, correlations with pain experience and intensity became stronger.

122,As time goes by: Anxiety negatively affects the perceived quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes of long duration,"Introduction Age-related medical conditions are increasing worldwide. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a chronic disease, which affects a large amount of general population, accounting for over 90% of diabetes mellitus (DM) cases. Purpose As psychopathological symptoms frequently occur in medical conditions, our study aimed at exploring whether psychological factors and metabolic control may affect health related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods Forty five patients with T2DM were consecutively recruited and assessed with a psychodiagnostic battery: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Beck Depression Inventory II edition (BDI-II) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), including indexes Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS, MCS). Moreover, time since DM diagnosis and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were detected. Results Participants (mean age 65.3 ± 5.9 years) had a mean time since diagnosis of 11.6 ± 6.7 years, and showed a good metabolic control as highlighted by mean HbA1c values 7.1 ± 0.9%. Median HAM-A score [25(20.7–30.6)], represented high prevalence of anxious symptoms. A moderate expression of depressive symptoms was observed [BDI-II score: 13(8.3–21.4)]. A multiple regression analysis, after correcting for age, BMI, HbA1c value and BDI-II score, showed the perceived quality of life relative to PCS was significantly related to both disease duration (β = −0.55, p = 0.03, SE = 0.25) and HAM-A scores (β = −0.52, p = 0.04, SE = 0.24). Moreover, both HAM-A (β = −0.67, p = 0.01, SE = 0.26) and BDI-II (β = −0.48, p = 0.02, SE = 0.20) scores were independently predictive of MCS. Metabolic control, instead, was not a significant predictor. Conclusion Our study suggests a predictive role of both anxiety levels and time since diagnosis in perceived HRQoL in T2DM patients. PCS was associated with anxiety and time since diagnosis and MCS was associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms but not with diabetes duration or metabolic control. These data could be useful to plan T2DM training programs focused on psychological health concerns, possibly leading to a healthy self-management and a better perceived HRQoL, even assisting patients in reducing the negative effect due to the chronicization of T2DM.

123,Validation of the measurement of need frustration,"Until recently, need frustration was considered to be the absence of need satisfaction, rather than a separate dimension. Whilst the absence of need satisfaction can hamper growth, experiencing need frustration can lead to malfunctioning and subsequent psychopathology. Therefore, examining these constructs separately is vital, as they produce different outcomes, with the consequences of need frustration potentially more severe. This study sought to examine predictors of need frustration using undergraduate students and individuals from the wider community ( N = 510, females N = 404, M age = 24.15). Participants completed the new need satisfaction frustration scale and measures of anxiety, stress, depression, and negative and positive affect. Support for the position that need frustration is separate to Need Satisfaction and is related to psychological health problems (i.e., ill-being) was found. However, autonomy frustration was not found to be a significant predictor of ill-being. Extending previous research, this study found relationships of stress and somatic anxiety with need frustration. Further, a relationship between need frustration with anxiety and depression occurred, when these symptom dimensions were examined separately, through distinct questionnaires. Support for the construct of need frustration highlights the necessity of examining need frustration in addition to need satisfaction within future studies. Interventions specific to reducing need frustration, specifically competence and relatedness frustration within both the educational and workplace setting are outlined.

124,Metacognitive therapy of early traumatized patients with borderline personality disorder: A phase-II baseline controlled trial,"Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is proving to be an effective and brief treatment for anxiety disorders and depression, but there are no investigations of its feasibility and effect on primary personality disorders. We conducted a baseline controlled phase II trial of MCT on a group of patients with Borderline personality disorder all reporting early trauma history with sexual or physical abuse. All had been referred to our study after hospitalization and subsequently treated at the university outpatient clinic at NTNU. Twelve patients referred for severe long-term trauma and emotional instability were offered participation in the program. All gave their consent and were included in the trial. We aimed to examine retention over treatment and follow-up, if the treatment can be delivered in a standardized way across complex and heterogeneous patients and any evidence associated with treatment effects on a range of measures to inform subsequent trials. We measured change in mood, borderline-related symptoms, interpersonal problems, trauma symptoms, suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviors across pre- post-treatment and by 1- and 2-year follow-up. Treatment appeared feasible with all patients completing the course and 11 out of 12 completing all follow-up assessments. All outcome measures showed a high retention rate and no drop-outs from the treatment. Large improvements over time and treatment gains were maintained at 2 years. There was significant reduction of borderline symptom severity, interpersonal problems and trauma symptoms from pre to 2-year follow-up. The results indicate that MCT may be applied to Borderline personality disorder and that future more definitive trials are warranted.

125,“Telling me not to worry…” Hyperscanning and neural dynamics of emotion processing during guided imagery and music,"To analyze how emotions and imagery are shared, processed and recognized in Guided Imagery and Music, we measured the brain activity of an experienced therapist (“Guide”) and client (“Traveler”) with dual-EEG in a real therapy session about potential death of family members. Synchronously with the EEG, the session was video-taped and then micro-analyzed. Four raters identified therapeutically important moments of interest (MOI) and no-interest (MONI) which were transcribed and annotated. Several indices of emotion- and imagery-related processing were analyzed: frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry, frontal midline theta, and occipital alpha activity. Session ratings showed overlaps across all raters, confirming the importance of these MOIs, which showed different cortical activity in visual areas compared to resting-state. MOI 1 was a pivotal moment including an important imagery with a message of hope from a close family member, while in the second MOI the Traveler sent a message to an unborn baby. Generally, results seemed to indicate that the emotions of Traveler and Guide during important moments were not positive, pleasurably or relaxed when compared to resting-state, confirming both were dealing with negative emotions and anxiety that had to be contained in the interpersonal process. However, the temporal dynamics of emotion-related markers suggested shifts in emotional valence and intensity during these important, personally meaningful moments; for example, during receiving the message of hope, an increase of frontal alpha asymmetry was observed, reflecting increased positive emotional processing. EEG source localization during the message suggested a peak activation in left middle temporal gyrus. Interestingly, peaks in emotional markers in the Guide partly paralleled the Traveler's peaks; for example, during the Guide's strong feeling of mutuality in MOI 2, the time series of frontal alpha asymmetries showed a significant cross-correlation, indicating similar emotional processing in Traveler and Guide. Investigating the moment-to-moment interaction in music therapy showed how asymmetry peaks align with the situated cognition of Traveler and Guide along the emotional contour of the music, representing the highs and lows during the therapy process. Combining dual-EEG with detailed audiovisual and qualitative data seems to be a promising approach for further research into music therapy.

126,Structural and functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex in burning mouth syndrome: An fMRI study,"Featuring a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites in the absence of observable lesions or laboratory findings, burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic intraoral pain disorder, which is one of the most common medically unexplained oral symptoms/syndromes. Previous studies have suggested that brain changes are involved in BMS; however, the small number of participants in these studies limited the conclusions that could be drawn. The present study aimed to further elucidate the brain anatomical and functional changes in BMS with a relatively large sample. Fifty-three patients (26 BMS patients and 27 gender- and age-matched controls) were recruited. Demographic information was collected via interviews. Visual analogue scale (VAS), anxiety, and depression scale were administered. Participants underwent an MRI scan (including one high-resolution structural scan, one diffusion tensor image, and one session of resting state scan) on the same day. The results showed that BMS patients had higher depression and anxiety levels than controls. BMS patients showed lower gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and increased functional connectivity between this region and the bilateral amygdala. Region of interest (ROI) analysis suggested that the functional connectivity between the bilateral VMPFC and amygdala correlated with the years of BMS illness in patients. The brain measures could predict the years of symptoms in the BMS group. These results suggest A potential neuromarker for the diagnosis and treatment of BMS.

127,Preliminary results from a randomized controlled study for an app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for depression and anxiety in cancer patients,"Cancer patients experience various psychological and social difficulties, the most common being depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for depression and anxiety in cancer patients. For this purpose, 63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday), a simple information-provision mobile-application-based program (HARUCard), or a waitlist control group. Self-report questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-Related Quality of Life Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and two computer tasks including the dot-probe task and the Implicit Association Test, were administered before and after 66 days of intervention. The results showed that the Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores of the cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday) group decreased significantly after the intervention compared to the attention control (HARUCard) and waitlist control groups. However, there were no significant changes in scores of the Health-Related Quality of Life Scale and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and the two computer tasks. Such results suggest that a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program may be an effective intervention for alleviating depression and anxiety, but not the general quality of life of cancer patients. Taking into consideration that psychosocial problems may not the topmost priority for cancer patients who are facing a chronic and possibly mortal disease, a mobile-application cognitive behavioral therapy program may be a possible solution for the alleviation of depression and anxiety in cancer patients who have many restraints in terms of time and space.

128,Investigating the protective role of mastery imagery ability in buffering debilitative stress responses,"Mastery imagery has been shown to be associated with more positive cognitive and emotional responses to stress, but research is yet to investigate the influence of mastery imagery ability on imagery’s effectiveness in regulating responses to acute stress, such as competition. Furthermore, little research has examined imagery’s effectiveness in response to actual competition. This study examined (a) whether mastery imagery ability was associated with stress response changes to a competitive stress task, a car racing computer game, following an imagery intervention, and (b) the effects of different guided imagery content on pre-task cognitive and emotional responses. In Session 1, 78 participants ( M age = 20.03 years, SD = 1.28) completed ratings of pre-task anxiety intensity and direction, confidence, and perceived control. Imagery ability was also assessed before completing the task. In Session 2, participants were randomly allocated to an imagery condition (positive mastery, negative mastery, relaxation) or control group (no imagery) before completing the task and outcome measures again. For the negative mastery group, greater positive mastery imagery ability was associated with greater perceived control and perceiving anxiety as more facilitative. Furthermore, mastery imagery ability moderated the relationship between anxiety intensity and direction. Altogether, results suggest that positive mastery imagery ability may act as a potential buffer against the effects of negative images.

129,Competition stress leads to a blunting of the cortisol awakening response in elite rowers,"Background: Anticipation of forthcoming demands is often met with biological up-regulation, for example, levels of the stress hormone cortisol are typically elevated immediately prior to an anticipated event. Similarly, the cortisol awakening response (CAR), a surge in cortisol in the period following waking, is elevated on days of anticipated demand and this is viewed as an adaptive response in the preparation for challenge. This study assessed the effects of competition as an anticipated challenge in elite rowers. Methods: Elite rowers ( N = 8) were assessed during two training and two competition weekends. Each assessment involved the measurement of self-reported competitive (cognitive and somatic) anxiety and salivary diurnal cortisol across 2 days representing a preparation day prior to either a training or competition day. Competitive anxiety was measured each morning and saliva samples were provided immediately upon waking and 30 min post waking (CAR) and before bed. Results: Self-reported cognitive and somatic anxiety levels were significantly greater during the competition phase compared with training. Additionally, levels of cognitive anxiety were greater on the day of competition compared with the preparation day. CAR magnitude was significantly reduced during the competition phase compared with training; however, there were no differences between preparation and event days. Conclusions: Reduced or blunted CARs are typically observed in chronically stressed populations and are characteristic of burnout and fatigue. While an increased CAR during competition may represent an adaptive response to challenge, blunted CARs and the concomitant increases in competitive anxiety observed here indicate maladaptive responding during a period where maximized functioning is critical.

130,Men scare me more: Gender differences in social fear conditioning in virtual reality,"Women nearly twice as often develop social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to men. The reason for this difference is still being debated. The present study investigates gender differences and the effect of male versus female agents in low (LSA) and high socially anxious (HSA) participants regarding the acquisition and extinction of social fear in virtual reality (VR). In a social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, 60 participants actively approached several agents, some of which were paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a verbal rejection and spitting simulated by an aversive air blast (CS +), or without an US (CS−). Primary outcome variables were defined for each of the 4 levels of emotional reactions including experience (fear ratings), psychophysiology (fear-potentiated startle), behavior (avoidance), and cognition (recognition task). Secondary outcome variables were personality traits, contingency ratings, heart rate (HR), and skin conductance response (SCR). As hypothesized, fear ratings for CS + increased significantly during acquisition and the differentiation between CS + and CS− vanished during extinction. Additionally, women reported higher fear compared to men. Furthermore, a clear difference in the fear-potentiated startle response between male CS + and CS− at the end of acquisition indicates successful SFC to male agents in both groups. Concerning behavior, results exhibited successful SFC in both groups and a general larger distance to agents in HSA than LSA participants. Furthermore, HSA women maintained a larger distance to male compared to female agents. No such differences were found for HSA men. Regarding recognition, participants responded with higher sensitivity to agent than object stimuli, suggesting a higher ability to distinguish the target from the distractor for social cues, which were on focus during SFC. Regarding the secondary physiological outcome variables, we detected an activation in HR response during acquisition, but there were no differences between stimuli or groups. Moreover, we observed a gender but no CS +/CS− differences in SCR. SFC was successfully induced and extinguished according to the primary outcome variables. VR is an interesting tool to measure emotional learning processes on different outcome levels with enhanced ecological validity. Future research should further investigate social fear learning mechanisms for developing more efficient treatments of SAD.

131,A randomized control trial evaluating an online mindful parenting training for mothers with elevated parental stress,"Objectives: The prevalence of maternal stress in early years of parenting can negatively impact child development. Therefore, there is a need for an early intervention that is easily accessible and low in costs. The current study examined the effectiveness of an 8-session online mindful parenting training for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress. Methods: A total of 76 mothers were randomized into an intervention ( n = 43) or a waitlist control group ( n = 33). The intervention group completed pretest assessment prior to the online intervention. Participants completed a post intervention assessment after the 10 weeks intervention and a follow-up assessment 10 weeks later. The waitlist group completed waitlist assessment, followed by a 10-week waitlist period. After these 10 weeks, a pretest assessment took place, after which the waitlist group participants also started the intervention, followed by the posttest assessment. Participating mothers completed questionnaires on parental stress (parent-child interaction problems, parenting problems, parental role restriction) and other maternal (over-reactive parenting discipline, self-compassion, symptoms of depression and anxiety) and child outcomes (aggressive behavior and emotional reactivity) while the non-participating parents (father or another mother) were asked to also report on child outcomes. Results: The online mindful parenting intervention was shown to be significantly more effective at a 95% level than a waitlist period with regard to over-reactive parenting discipline and symptoms of depression and anxiety (small and medium effect sizes), and significantly more effective at a 90% level with regard to self-compassion, and mother-rated child aggressive behavior and child emotional reactivity (small effect sizes). The primary outcome, parental stress, was found to have a 95% significant within-group effect only for the subscale parental role restriction (delayed small effect size improvement at follow-up). No significant improvements on child outcomes were found for the non-participating parent. Conclusion: To conclude, the results provide first evidence that an online mindful parenting training may be an easily accessible and valuable intervention for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress.

132,"Anxiety and performance in sex, sport, and stage: Identifying common ground","Anxiety has long been associated with diminished performance within a number of domains involving evaluative interpersonal interactions, including Sex, Sport, and Stage. Here, we pose three questions: (1) how do these disparate fields approach and understand anxiety and performance; (2) how does the understanding of the issue within one field offer insight to another field; and (3) how could each field benefit from the ideas and strategies used by the others. We begin with a short review of models of anxiety/arousal and performance and then explore definitions, models, presumed underlying physiological processes, and characterizing and influencing factors within each domain separately in a narrative review. This discussion is followed by a synthesis that identifies elements specific to and common across the various domains, with the latter captured in a model of essential characteristics. Concluding remarks note the potential value of promoting increased cross-disciplinary conversation and research, with each domain likely benefiting from the conceptualizations and expert knowledge of the others.

133,The role of allopregnanolone in pregnancy in predicting postpartum anxiety symptoms,"Postpartum depression is a serious illness affecting up to 15% of women worldwide after childbirth, and our understanding of its biology is limited. Postpartum anxiety is perhaps more prevalent and less understood. Prior studies indicate that allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, may play a role in reproductive mood disorders, including postpartum depression, but the exact nature of that role is unclear. Our own prior study in a group of psychiatrically ill women found that low allopregnanolone in the second trimester predicted the development of postpartum depression. In the present study, in both healthy and mood- and anxiety-disordered women who remained well throughout the perinatal period, we found that second trimester allopregnanolone predicted postpartum anxiety symptoms, with a similar trend toward the prediction of postpartum depressive symptoms (though without statistical significance). Both concurrent sleep and prior histories of mood and anxiety disorders contributed to the variance in mood and anxiety scores at 6 weeks postpartum. These findings confirm the importance of pregnancy allopregnanolone in postpartum psychiatric symptoms and point to future directions that may determine other important contributing factors.

A sample of 589 Chinese adolescents completed the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), the Irritability, Depression, and Anxiety Scale (IDAS), and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Results of structural equation modeling showed that (1) the total effects of gratitude on both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were all significant and (2) both positive and negative coping styles mediated the links between gratitude and two types of problem behaviors. Thus, cultivating gratitude and developing adaptive coping style may help adolescents rectify problem behaviors.

135,Personality traits and postnatal depression: The mediated role of postnatal anxiety and moderated role of type of birth,"This study investigated how personality traits are related to postnatal depression 2 weeks after giving birth and whether these relations are mediated by postnatal anxiety, measured after 3–4 days after giving birth and moderated by the type of birth. New mothers ( N = 672, Mage = 29.33) completed scales assessing their personality traits, postnatal anxiety, and postnatal depression 3 or 4 days after giving birth (T1). They also reported postnatal depression 2 weeks after giving birth (T2). Path analysis indicated that postnatal anxiety explained the link between personality traits (i.e., neuroticism) and postnatal depression 2 weeks after childbirth. The type of birth moderated the relation among, personality traits, postnatal anxiety and depression. Neuroticism and consciousness, in the natural birth’s group, and neuroticism and agreeableness, in the cesarean birth’s group, were associated with postnatal depression. Further, anxiety explained the relation between neuroticism and postnatal depression in both natural and cesarean birth groups. In addition, postnatal anxiety mediated the relation between extraversion and postnatal depression in the cesarean birth group. Our findings highlight that postnatal anxiety is a potential mechanism explaining how personality traits (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion) are related to postnatal depression, and that these relations may depend on the type of childbirth.

136,Advancing our understanding of psychological stress and coping among parents in organized youth sport,"The current study investigated psychological stress among parents of competitive British tennis players. Adopting a multipart concurrent mixed method design, 135 British tennis parents completed a cross sectional online questionnaire to examine their primary appraisals, emotions, and coping strategies associated with self-disclosed stressors. Hierarchical content analysis was conducted on open ended questionnaire responses to identify key stressors and coping strategies, and descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to explore the differences between various components of the process. The findings revealed a range of organizational, competitive, and developmental stressors. These stressors were predominantly appraised as harm or challenge, and anxiety and anger were the most prominent emotions that the parents experienced. Statistically, parents experienced greater anger in relation to competition (compared to organizational and developmental) stressors, whilst harm appraisal increased negative emotions, and challenge appraisal increased positive emotions. Findings also highlighted how parents used a number of mastery, internal regulation, and goal withdrawal coping strategies, which varied statistically in degrees of reported effectiveness. The contribution of these findings to the stress literature and their applied implications are discussed.

Hirsch ( Frontiers in Psychology , 2019[Jan][8], Vol 9[2692]). In the original article, there were some errors in the Title, Abstract, paragraph five of the Introduction section, and paragraph two of the Materials and Methods section. The article referred to “transgender and non-conforming” people and should instead have referred to “transgender and gender non-conforming” people. Additionally, there was an error in the Materials and Methods. The number of gay men should be “98” and the number of lesbian women should be “84.” The necessary corrections have been made to the original article. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-03724-001). In this study we sought to compare eating disorder attitudes and behaviors, and proneness to an eating disorder (“ED proneness”), between gay men, lesbian women, and transgender and non-conforming (TGNC) adults. A further aim was to identify and compare risk and protective factors, and examine a mediational model based on the interpersonal theory of eating disorders (IPT-ED), whereby the association between interpersonal factors and ED proneness would be mediated by psychological constructs pertaining to the self and negative affect. Data was obtained from a larger national study of health risk and protective factors among sexual minority and gender diverse populations. The sample included 97 gay men, 82 lesbian women, and 138 TGNC adults. Participants completed the National College Health Assessment, Eating Disorders Screen for Primary Care, Patient Health Questionnaire Depression scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 scale, Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, Negative Social Exchange subscale of the Multidimensional Health Profile, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, and Perceived Stigma Scale. There was a significant difference between groups in ED proneness, with lesbian women (66.7%) having a significantly higher percentage than gay men (47.6%). There was also a significant difference between groups in weight-based self-worth, with the lowest percentage in gay men (63%) and the highest percentage in lesbian women (82%), as well as dissatisfaction with eating patterns, with the highest percentage in TGNC adults (69.8%) and the lowest percentage in gay men (47.7%). There was a low percentage of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, with no significant difference between groups. Logistic regression analyses showed that the predictor variables of ED proneness were depression, perceived stigma, and self-compassion in gay men; depression in lesbian women; and self-compassion in the TGNC adults. Mediation analyses showed that thwarted belongingness (i.e., an unmet to belong) and perceived stigma had an indirect association with ED proneness that was mediated by self-compassion and depression (for perceived stigma alone) in gay men, depression in lesbian women, and self-compassion in TGNC adults. The interpersonal theory of eating disorders therefore extends to sexual minority and gender diverse populations; however, the results suggest a broadening of theoretical models and intervention programs to include the role of stigma and self-compassion.

138,Rs2572431 polymorphism on chromosome 8 is associated with individual differences in anxiety related coping modes,"Objective: The role of genetic factors in the interplay between anxiety-related coping and personality has been the subject of interest in numerous previous studies. The current study focused on anxiety-related coping modes, namely repression versus sensitization (i.e., cognitive avoidance versus vigilance), and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2572431. An association between this SNP and anxiety-related personality traits has previously been shown in a genome wide association study, thus further investigation of the relationship between this SNP and anxiety-related coping seems warranted. Methods: In the present study, N = 880 mostly Caucasian participants ( n = 269 males and n = 611 females; mean-age: 23.88, SD = 7.19) filled in a personality questionnaire assessing individual differences in cognitive avoidance and vigilance, and all participants were genotyped for rs2572431. Results: Participants homozygous for the T-allele in rs2572431 showed the highest vigilance scores in all scenarios tested. This is in line with findings from an earlier genome wide association study demonstrating that the T-allele is also associated with higher neuroticism scores. Conclusion: The current study yields evidence for the role of rs2572431 in the molecular genetic underpinnings of coping modes and, more broadly, for its connection with personality.

139,The role in road traffic accident and anxiety as moderators attention biases in Modified Emotional Stroop Test,"Introduction: According to the World Health Organisation, road accidents will be the most common cause of premature death by 2020. According to research, one in every five victims of accidents suffers from acute stress disorder and one in every four suffers from psychological problems up to 1 year after the event, including post-traumatic stress disorder. It was assumed that one of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining excessive arousal or anxiety is a dysfunction in cognitive processes occurring under the guise of selective attention disorders or a deficit in executive control. Materials and Methods: The research encompassed 157 individuals (a group of victims and perpetrators N = 90; M = 34.1, SD = 10.77; control group N = 67; M = 34.20, SD = 11.16). The participants, tested after road traffic accidents, were patients of Traumatology and Orthopedic wards in Warsaw who had been involved in a road traffic accident up to a month prior to the research. The state of their physical injuries and administered drugs were monitored so that this did not interfere with the tests the participants undertook on computer. In each situation, the decision was made by the doctor responsible for the patient in the hospital ward. The control group comprised people who drive regularly and in 5 years had not been involved in any road traffic incidents. The participants from both groups completed the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire on anxiety as a state and as a trait, as well as a modified computerized emotional Stroop test. This new version of the test enables a study of the process of the depth of coding of the stimuli associated with trauma. Results: The hypotheses were tested with the use of a series of correlation analyses, regression analyses with a stepwise method of entering predictors into the model, and mediation analyses with the use of the A. F. Hayes PROCESS macro. Differences were observed in the declarative level of anxiety as a state and the size of the interference effect depending on the person’s status in the accident. It was discovered that in the group of perpetrators, the longer the interference effect, the lower the declared level of anxiety as a state and they were significantly worse at remembering the stimuli associated with trauma. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms in victims and perpetrators of road traffic accidents measured by self-report questionnaires are consistent only among victims. In the case of perpetrators, an accurate measure of disorders is a study with the use of methods enabling the tracking of the functioning of unconscious processes.

140,Hypermentalizing in social anxiety: Evidence for a context-dependent relationship,"Social anxiety (SA) means fear of scrutiny and of others’ negative evaluation, thus indicating that hypermentalizing (HMZ) (i.e., the over-attribution of intentions and thoughts to others) might be the most common error of social cognition in SA. However, evidence for this is weak. One explanation is that HMZ is not stable in SA, but rather context-dependent. The first aim of the current study was testing this hypothesis. The second aim was analyzing whether the association between SA and HMZ is moderated by a negative self-image. One-hundred and thirteen young adults (85.8% females; M = 21.1 years old; SD = 2.7) were assessed on measures of SA, HMZ, and self-image. Given the over-representation of females, conclusions may not be safely extrapolated to males. Results revealed that HMZ is associated with SA only in the self-referential social situation [ B = 2.68 (95% CI: 0.72–4.65), p = 0.007]. This supports that HMZ is not global in SA (i.e., a stable cognitive style), but rather is active only in some contexts. Implications for the conceptualization and treatment of SA are discussed. Contrary to predictions, neither self-esteem, nor positive or negative self-schema moderated the association between SA and self-referential HMZ. This contradicts findings in the field of paranoid delusion and requires replication, including measures of implicit self-esteem.

141,Pre-specified anxiety predicts future decision-making performances under different temporally constrained conditions,"In real-life circumstances, people occasionally require making forced decisions when encountering unpredictable events and situations that yield socially and privately unfavorable consequences. In order to prevent future negative consequences, it is beneficial to successfully predict future decision-making behaviors based on various types of information, including behavioral traits and/or psychological states. For this prospective purpose, the present study used the Iowa Gambling Task, which simulates multiple aspects of real-life decision-making processes, such as choice preference, selection and evaluation of output feedback, and investigated how anxiety profiles predict decision-making performances under conditions with different temporal pressures on task execution. To conduct a temporally causal analysis, we assessed the trait and state anxiety profiles of 33 young participants prior to the task and analyzed their subsequent decision-making performances. We separated two disadvantageous card decks with high rewards and losses into high- and middle-risk decks, and calculated local performance indexes for decision-making immediately after salient penalty events for the high-risk deck in addition to traditional global performance indexes concerning overall trial outcomes such as final winnings and net scores. For global decision-making, higher trait anxiety predicted more risky choices solely in the self-paced condition without temporal pressure. For local decision-making, state anxiety predicted risk-taking performances differently in the self- and forced-paced conditions. In the self-paced condition, higher state anxiety predicted higher risk-avoidance. In the forced-paced condition, higher state anxiety predicted more frequent choices of the middle-risk deck. These findings suggest not only that pre-specified anxiety profiles can effectively predict future decision-making behaviors under different temporal pressures, but also newly indicate that behavioral mechanisms for moderate risk-taking under an emergent condition should be focused on to effectively prevent future unfavorable consequences when actually encountering negative events.

Tests of measurement invariance indicated that invariance of the two-factor model of the SAS held at every level. Therefore, we compared the statistical anxiety of online and traditional students. Results indicated that online and traditional statistics students reported comparable levels of anxiety with slightly less anxiety in terms of seeking help for traditional students. We concluded that online instruction is a viable form of statistics education at least for undergraduate students enrolled in the social sciences.

143,Effects of coping-related traits and psychophysiological stress responses on police recruits’ shooting behavior in reality-based scenarios,"Police officers are often required to perform under high-stress circumstances, in which optimal task performance is crucial for their and the bystanders’ physical integrity. However, stress responses, particularly anxiety and increased cortisol levels, shift attention from goal-directed to stimulus-driven control, leaving police officers with poor shooting performance under stress. Cardiac vagal activity and coping-related traits (i.e., self-control, sensation seeking) might help individuals to maintain performance under stress. So far, only few studies have integrated coping-related traits, psychophysiological stress markers and occupationally meaningful measures of behavior to investigate police officers’ work performance under stress. Therefore, the present study investigated 19 police recruits ( M age = 22.84, SD = 3.30) undergoing a reality-based shooting scenario in two experimental conditions in a within-design: low stress (LS) against a non-threatening mannequin, and high stress (HS), involving physical threat by an opponent. Psychological (i.e., anxiety, mental effort) and physiological stress responses (i.e., salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, cardiac vagal activity) as well as shooting accuracy were repeatedly assessed. It was hypothesized that under stress, police recruits would demonstrate elevated psychophysiological stress responses and impaired shooting performance. Elevated psychophysiological stress responses would negatively influence shooting performance, whereas self-control, sensation seeking and cardiac vagal activity would positively influence shooting performance. While recruits reported significantly higher anxiety and mental effort in the HS scenario, both scenarios elicited comparable physiological responses. Overall, shooting accuracy was low and did not significantly decrease in the HS scenario. Shooting performance was predicted by self-control in the LS scenario and by post-task cardiac vagal activity in the HS scenario. While increased anxiety hints at a successful stress manipulation, physiological responses suggest similar stress levels for both scenarios, diminishing potential behavioral differences between the scenarios. Performance efficiency decreased under stress, as indicated by increasing mental effort. Findings on self-control suggest that suppressing negative stress responses might lead to impaired goal-directed attention, resulting in performance decrements. For police research and training, high-realism scenarios afford an opportunity to investigate and experience psychophysiological stress responses.

One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.

145,Paternalism vs. autonomy: Are they alternative types of formal care?,"Paternalistic attitudes have been considered intrinsically wrong, protection (but never overprotection that is providing care without considering the receiver’s needs) may depend on the functionality of the older adults been cared for. Also, although the promotion of autonomy is intrinsically right, it may be adjusted to the individual baseline characteristics, taking into consideration that a very high level of autonomy demand could overcome the individual base line, producing anxiety, and suffering. Therefore, more research is needed to provide evidence regarding which mode of care is more beneficial and fitting in each context and our PACA instruments have been developed with this purpose.

146,Self-control in aiming supports coping with psychological pressure in soccer penalty kicks,"This study addressed the question whether coaches better allow athletes to self-control their decisions when under pressure or whether to impose a decision upon them. To this end, an experiment was conducted that manipulated the soccer kickers’ degree of control in decision-making. Two groups of elite under-19 soccer players ( n = 18) took penalty kicks in a self-controlled (i.e., kickers themselves decided to which side to direct the ball) and an externally controlled condition (i.e., the decision to which side to direct the ball was imposed upon the kickers). One group performed the penalty kick under psychological pressure (i.e., the present coaching staff assessed their performance), while the second group performed without pressure. Just before and after performing the kicks, CSAI-2 was used to measure cognitive and somatic anxiety and self-confidence. Further, the number of goals scored, ball placement and speed, and the duration of preparatory and performatory behaviors were determined. The results verified increased levels of cognitive and somatic anxiety after performing the kicks in the pressured group compared to the no-pressure group. In addition, degree of self-control affected the participants’ performance, particularly in the pressured group. They scored more goals and placed the kicks higher in the self-controlled than in the externally-controlled condition. Participants also took more time preparing and performing the run-up in the self-controlled condition. Findings indicate that increased self-control helps coping with the debilitating effects of pressure and can counter performance deteriorations. The findings are discussed within the framework of self-control theories, and recommendations for practitioners and athletes are made.

147,Episode of situated learning to enhance student engagement and promote deep learning: Preliminary results in a high school classroom,"Teaching is now experiencing a new centrality due to the fast socio-cultural transformations, the vertical growth of digital media and, therefore, the new ways children and young people learn. New paradigms and teaching methodologies are emerging to meet the new educational needs; among them, the “Episodes of Situated Learning” approach (EAS in Italian) was chosen for this study. This approach broadly refers to the “Flipped Class” model, in which the lesson structure reverses the traditional teaching/learning cycle with a positive outcome on engagement and learning. The present study aims to explore whether the EAS teaching methodology, according to literature about the Flipped Class model, has a positive outcome on student engagement, focusing on its emotional, cognitive and behavioral components. In particular, we hypothesize that the EAS teaching methodology changes teachers’ behavior in classroom, increasing their movements and body expression during the lesson. Moreover, we expect higher levels of self-efficacy and positive emotions and lower levels of perceived anxiety in teachers, thus improving students’ level of engagement. The research was conducted in a secondary school, in Milan, and includes a classroom of sixteen students and three teachers. We chose a quasi-experimental nested design, a mixed-method approach that combines the qualitative and quantitative collection and analysis of data, in order to reach, as far as possible, a holistic, effective and exhaustive representation of the studied phenomenon. Pre-post measures, including video-recording, systematic observation and questionnaires, of both students and teachers were collected during the 8 months of experimentation. This research project could foster positive outcomes for participants as well as the broader society, in which school dropout is increasing. Many authors positively associate low levels of students’ engagement to high rates of school dropout; for this reason, working on improving teaching methodologies and students’ engagement measurement, could be an effective way to enhance learning and opposing school dropout.

148,Social anxiety and pro-social behavior following varying degrees of rejection: Piloting a new experimental paradigm,"In general, human beings tend to try and reconnect after they have been socially rejected. It is not clear, however, which role the number of rejecters and rejection sensitivity plays. In addition, it is unclear whether the supposed pro-social behaviors are aimed at the rejecters or at innocent individuals. By means of a new paradigm, the present pilot study investigated compensatory behavior of individuals with varying degrees of social anxiety, following varying degrees of rejection. In addition, it was explored toward whom their behavior was directed: rejecters or innocent individuals. Female students ( N = 34) were assessed on their degree of social anxiety and then, based on a personal profile they wrote, they were either rejected by 1, 2, or 3 fictional other participants or completely accepted. Afterward, the participants had to explicitly rate the creativity of drawings made by the others and, in a pro-social reward paradigm, awarded the other participants money based on their creativity rating. In addition, implicit social approach tendencies toward photos of rejecters, acceptors, or innocent individuals were assessed by means of an approach-avoidance task. The results confirmed that people with a low degree of social anxiety respond to rejection in a compensatory pro-social manner explicitly as well as implicitly, but that people with a high degree of social anxiety fail to do so. With regard to sources of rejection, only implicit approach-avoidance tendencies reflected a distinction between rejecters and innocent individuals. Theoretical implications are discussed in the light of the small sample size and other limitations.

149,Anxiety as a common biomarker for school children with additional health and developmental needs irrespective of diagnosis,"Currently very little evidence is available regarding the biological characteristics and common comorbid behaviors that are associated with children characterized by learning difficulties who require additional support at school. These children are usually referred to as having Additional Health and Developmental Needs by the Australian Government and the associated public education system more broadly though the problems may arise from academic, social and/or emotional stressors and may or may not include children with clinically diagnosed Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety levels (Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale- Parent Report), autism traits (Autism Spectrum Quotient-Child Version) and sleep quality (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) in children with Additional Health and Developmental Needs without an intellectual disability, but with either a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ( N = 25), Speech and Language Impairment ( N = 37) or Other Diagnosis ( N = 22). Our results demonstrated that these children with Additional Health and Developmental Needs showed atypically high levels of anxiety and impaired sleep quality, with the ASD group reporting more impairments associated with comorbid anxiety and sleep quality than either of the other clinically diagnosed groups. In fact, greater anxiety level was associated with a greater number of autism traits and poorer sleep quality regardless of diagnostic group suggesting that anxiety is a common experience for children with Additional Health and Developmental Needs. It is suggested that assessment of anxiety, sleep behaviors and autism traits may be useful markers for early identification of children within this population, thus providing scope for early and targeted intervention.

150,A preliminary evaluation of transdiagnostic group metacognitive therapy in a mixed psychological disorder sample,"Objective: Comorbidity is common among anxiety and depression. Transdiagnostic treatment approaches have been developed to optimize treatment and offer a more unified approach suitable for individuals with comorbidities. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a transdiagnostic therapy for psychological disorder and is based on the metacognitive model. The present study is a service evaluation of the outcomes associated with group MCT delivered to unselected patients at a Danish outpatient clinic. Methods: A total of 131 self-diagnosed patients received 6 sessions of group MCT. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and metacognition was assessed using the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome-1 (CAS-1). Participants were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6 months follow-up as per usual clinic protocol. Linear mixed-effects regressions were used to assess the transdiagnostic effects of group MCT. Treatment effect sizes are reported for subgroups based on participant’s reason for seeking treatment (anxiety, depression, or comorbid). Effect sizes were not conducted for the depression subgroup given the limited number of participants. Clinically significant change is reported for all subgroups. Results: Group MCT was associated with large effect sizes for symptoms of anxiety and depression for patients seeking treatment for anxiety ( d = 1.68), or comorbid (1.82). In addition, 66.7% of patients were classified as recovered at post-treatment, and 12.9% were classified as improved. These results were largely maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: These preliminary findings support the continued use of group MCT in the current outpatient clinic and suggest that it may be an efficacious and cost-effective treatment when delivered in “transdiagnostic” groups.

151,Fifteen years controlling unwanted thoughts: A systematic review of the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ),"Thought control ability is a vulnerability factor implicated in the etiology and maintenance of emotional disorders. This manuscript aims to systematically review the use and psychometric performance of the Thought Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ), designed to assess people's ability to control unwanted thoughts. Three electronic databases were searched for papers administering the TCAQ published in indexed peer-reviewed journals. Data (participants characteristics, country, study design, etc.) were extracted from the results for qualitative synthesis. The TCAQ's content validity, dimensionality, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent/divergent validity, floor/ceiling effects, and interpretability were summarized. Two reviewers independently screened articles and assessed quality taking COSMIN criteria into account. Finally, the review included 17 papers. The TCAQ has been administered to healthy individuals, students, and adult patients, in six languages from nine countries. We found that the TCAQ, and its shorter versions, demonstrate robust reliability and adequate content validity. Of interest is the TCAQ's capacity to predict performance in diverse experimental tasks focused on thought control. The TCAQ unidimensionality has been supported in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Regarding construct validity, the TCAQ is significantly related to a wide range of psychopathological measures of anxiety, worry, depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, etc. However, as only a few of the included studies had a longitudinal design, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the measure's temporal stability. Moreover, psychometric aspects such as factorial invariance across different samples have not been analyzed. Despite these limitations, based on available psychometric evidence we can recommend using the TCAQ for measuring perceived control of unwanted thoughts.

152,Low perceived self-efficacy impedes discriminative fear learning,"Perceived self-efficacy refers to a subject’s expectation about the outcomes his/her behavior will have in a challenging situation. Low self-efficacy has been implicated in the origins and maintenance of phobic behavior. Correlational studies suggest an association between perceived self-efficacy and learning. The experimental manipulation of perceived self-efficacy offers an interesting approach to examine the impact of self-efficacy beliefs on cognitive and emotional functions. Recently, a positive effect of an experimentally induced increased self-efficacy on associative learning has been demonstrated. Changes in associative learning constitute a central hallmark of pathological fear and anxiety. Such alterations in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear may be related to cognitive and neurobiological factors that predict a certain vulnerability to anxiety disorders. The present study builds on previous own work by investigating the effect of an experimentally induced low perceived self-efficacy on fear acquisition, extinction and extinction retrieval in a differential fear conditioning task. Our results suggest that a negative verbal feedback, which leads to a decreased self-efficacy, is associated with changes in the acquisition of conditioned fear. During fear acquisition, the negative verbal feedback group showed decreased discrimination of fear responses between the aversive and safe conditioned stimuli (CS) relative to a group receiving a neutral feedback. The effects of the negative verbal feedback on the acquisition of fear discrimination learning were indexed by an impaired ability to discriminate the probability of receiving a shock during acquisition upon presentation of the aversive (CS+) relative to the safe stimuli (CS−). However, the effects of low self-efficacy on discrimination learning were limited to fear acquisition. No differences between the groups were observed during extinction and extinction retrieval. Furthermore, analysis of other outcome measures, i.e., skin conductance responses and CS valence ratings, revealed no group differences during the different phases of fear conditioning. In conclusion, lower perceived self-efficacy alters cognitive/expectancy components of discrimination during fear learning but not evaluative components and physiological responding. The pattern of findings suggests a selective, detrimental role of low(er) self-efficacy on the subject’s ability to learn the association between ambiguous cues and threat/safety.

153,Concrete vs. Abstract processing in repetitive negative thinking: Distinct functional effects on emotional reactivity and attentional control,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic process linked to emotional regulation impairment and involved in mood, anxiety, eating disorders and addictions. Attentional disengagement impairment is one of the factors hypothesized to be responsible for the recurrent and uncontrollable character of RNT. The aim of the present study was to empirically test this hypothesis with evaluation of disengagement from negative and RNT-related stimuli separately. Sixty participants were randomly allocated to one of three experimental conditions: abstract RNT, concrete RNT, and control condition (distraction). The change in their negative affect (PANAS) and their attentional disengagement impairment (exogenous cueing task) were measured. The analysis revealed that participants in abstract RNT condition presented higher emotional reactivity comparing to concrete or distraction conditions. The results indicated no differences between induction conditions in attentional disengagement. However, participants after concrete RNT induction had longer mean response times in exogenous cueing task comparing to control induction suggesting that they detected presented stimuli slower than participants in control condition. The results raised an important, from clinical point of view, question of distinctive impact of two types of RNT on emotional reactivity and attentional processes.

154,The role of perfectionism and controlling conditions in Norwegian elite junior performers’ motivational processes,"Conceptualized within the framework of self-determination theory, the aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between perfectionistic concerns and (a) controlled (non-self-determined) motivation and (b) performance anxiety through basic psychological need frustration (frustration of competence, autonomy, and realtedness), and if these relations would be moderated by controlling teaching/coaching conditions. We used a cross-sectional moderated mediation design and purposefully selected Norwegian elite junior performers ( N = 171; mean age = 17.3; SD age = 0.94) from talent development schools, who completed an online questionnaire to report their perceptions of the study variables. Associations were examined using structural equation modeling. The results showed that perfectionistic concerns were positively associated with controlling conditions, basic needs frustration, controlled motivation, and performance anxiety. Reported controlling teaching/coaching conditions moderated the positive indirect relationship between perfectionistic concerns and (a) controlled motivation and (b) performance anxiety through competence need frustration. Specifically, these indirect associations were evident for performers reporting moderate or high levels of controlling teaching/coaching conditions. In contrast, there were no indirect associations via competence need frustration for those performers who reported low levels of controlling conditions. In conclusion, the results indicate that perfectionistic concerns appear to be a vulnerability factor that exposes elite junior performers to higher risks of entering a debilitative motivational process. This seems especially likely when exposed to controlling teaching/coaching conditions. Coaches and teachers working with elite junior performers should avoid using controlling mechanisms and instead foster autonomous functioning.

155,All’s bad that ends bad: There is a peak-end memory bias in anxiety,"The peak-end memory bias has been well documented for the retrospective evaluation of pain. It describes that the retrospective evaluation of pain is largely based on the discomfort experienced at the most intense point (peak) and at the end of the episode. This is notable because it means that longer episodes with a better ending can be remembered as less aversive than shorter ones; this is even if the former had the same peak in painfulness and an overall longer duration of pain. Until now, this bias has not been studied in the domain of anxiety despite the high relevance of variable levels of anxiety in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we set out to replicate the original studies but with an induction of variable levels of anxiety. Of 64 women, half watched a clip from a horror movie which ended at the most frightening moment. The other half watched an extended version of this clip with a moderately frightening ending. Afterward, all participants were asked to rate the global anxiety which was elicited by the video. When the film ended at the most frightening moment, participants retrospectively reported more anxiety than participants who watched the extended version. This is the first study to document that the peak-end bias can be found in the domain of anxiety. These findings require replication and extension to a treatment context to evaluate its implications for exposure therapy.

156,Adolescents’ mindfulness and psychological distress: The mediating role of emotion regulation,"Mindfulness has been widely linked with psychological well-being in general population. There are emerging studies supporting the relationship between adolescents’ mindfulness and their mental health. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness may influence adolescents’ psychological distress have only recently been explored, and more related research is still needed. This study investigated the relationship between adolescents’ dispositional mindfulness and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The mediating variables were also explored in perspective of two common emotion regulation theories, which were measured through Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). DERS has been used as a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation difficulties. ERQ is also widely accepted to measure the emotion regulation process including dimensions of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Measures assessing mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological distress were administered to 1067 adolescents in mainland China. The results confirmed that adolescents’ dispositional mindfulness was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. DERS, especially the sub-dimensions of Acceptance and Strategies, significantly mediated the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Whereas, ERQ including subscales of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression exerted limited mediating effect. These findings provided insights for the potential underlying mechanism between adolescents’ mindfulness and psychological distress, demonstrating that DERS might be more pervasive than ERQ. Further research was suggested to explore other mediating variables underlying mindfulness and psychological distress among adolescents and develop mindfulness-based programs to improve adolescents’ mindfulness and emotion regulation ability.

158,"Modeling the relationships between metacognitive beliefs, attention control and symptoms in children with and without anxiety disorders: A test of the S-REF model","In the metacognitive model, attentional control and metacognitive beliefs are key transdiagnostic mechanisms contributing to psychological disorder. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relative contribution of these mechanisms to symptoms of anxiety and depression in children with anxiety disorders and in non-clinical controls. In a cross-sectional design, 351 children (169 children diagnosed with a primary anxiety disorder and 182 community children) between 7 and 14 years of age completed self-report measures of symptoms, attention control and metacognitive beliefs. Clinically anxious children reported significantly higher levels of anxiety, lower levels of attention control and higher levels of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs than controls. Across groups, lower attention control and higher levels of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs were associated with stronger symptoms, and metacognitions were negatively associated with attention control. Domains of attention control and metacognitions explained unique variance in symptoms when these were entered in the same model within groups, and an interaction effect between metacognitions and attention control was found in the community group that explained additional variance in symptoms. In conclusion, the findings are consistent with predictions of the metacognitive model; metacognitive beliefs and individual differences in self-report attention control both contributed to psychological dysfunction in children and metacognitive beliefs appeared to be the strongest factor.

159,The role of compassionate and self-image goals in predicting psychological controlling and facilitative parenting styles,"People enter into parental roles with a range of different motivations for parenting. To date, however, there is limited research assessing maternal motivations, concerns, and anxieties in their parenting styles. While some mothers are confident and child focused, others have concerns with performing parenting behaviors, and can be self-focused, shame prone, and self-judgmental. Two studies explored these two dimensions in relation to degree of controlling and facilitative parenting styles in the mothers of 3–9-year-old children. In study one, 151 mothers took part in an online survey measuring these two dimensions using the compassionate goals and self-image goals scales (Crocker and Canevello, 2008), in relation to facilitative and controlling parenting styles. As predicted, after controlling for child behavior, parental mental health, and parental self-efficacy, self-focused and shame avoidant concerns were associated with greater psychologically controlling parenting. In contrast a compassionate focused orientation was associated with greater facilitative parenting. In study two, 198 mothers were randomly assigned to either compassion focused goals, self-image goals, or control condition, which was manipulated by varying the instructions provided to participants. Emotional responses (e.g., angry, sad, and shame) to difficult parenting scenarios did not differ depending on whether participants were prompted with compassionate goal, self-image goal, or control condition instructions. The findings from study 1 demonstrate how goal motivation can influence parenting style, with the results from study 2 suggesting that instruction alone is insufficient to shift goal orientation.

160,Understanding mental health through the theory of positive disintegration: A visual aid,"The theory of positive disintegration (TPD) is a complex theory of personality development. The characteristics of this theory is that some signs of mental illness (e.g., neurosis, anxiety) along what is often considered a person’s flaws are seen as positive signs that a person is developing their personality toward their “personality ideal.” This visual tool may help disseminate some of the basic concepts of the TPD, a theory of personality development that will hopefully now receive more attention by theoreticians and practitioners alike. By considering persons in disintegration through the lens provided in the TPD,mental health practitioners could help those persons toward a positive, higher version of themselves. The TPD offers such an alternative view of mental health that all who are in contact with persons in disintegration should be acquainted with the fundamentals of the TPD.

161,Examining the hierarchical influences of the Big-Five dimensions and anxiety sensitivity on anxiety symptoms in children,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS), namely the fear of anxiety symptoms, has been described as a precursor of sub-threshold anxiety levels. Sexton et al. (2003) posited that increased AS would arise from an elevated neuroticism and that both would act as vulnerability factors for panic disorder (PD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms. Accordingly, this study aimed to (1) evaluate the applicability of this model to a pediatric population and (2) examine the influences of the other Big-Five personality dimensions on the four lower-order dimensions of AS (cognitive, physical, control, and physical) and on social phobia (SP), separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and depression symptoms. 200 children (104 girls) aged between 8 and 12 years old (mean age = 132.52 months, SD = 14.5) completed the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Silverman et al., 1991), the Big Five Questionnaire for Children (Barbaranelli et al., 2003), and the Revised’s Children Anxiety and Depression Scale (Chorpita et al., 2000). Regression analyses confirmed that AS and neuroticism together significantly predicted the presence of PD, OCD, and GAD symptoms but also SP, SAD, and depression symptoms. Moreover, neuroticism interacted with extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness to significantly predict SP, GAD, and depression. Surprisingly, the global AS score was only predicted by agreeableness, while AS dimensions also specifically related to openness. Finally, AS dimensions did not predict the presence of specific anxiety symptoms. To conclude, the predicting model of anxiety symptoms in children sets neuroticism and AS on the same level, with an unexpected influence of agreeableness on AS, raising the importance of other trait-like factors in the definition of such models. Moreover, AS should be considered as a unitary construct when predicting the presence of anxiety symptoms in children. Future interventions must consider these associations to help children detect and recognize the symptoms of their anxiety and help them to interpret them correctly.

162,A leak in the academic pipeline: Identity and health among postdoctoral women,"Several challenges (e.g., sexism, parental leave, the glass ceiling, etc.) disproportionately affect women in academia (and beyond), and thus perpetuate the leaky pipeline metaphor for women who opt-out of an academic career. Although this pattern can be seen at all levels of the academic hierarchy, a critical time for women facing such challenges is during the postdoctoral stage, when personal life transitions and professional ambitions collide. Using a social identity approach, we explore factors affecting the mental health of postdoctoral women, including identity development (e.g., as a mother, a scientist) and lack of control (uncertainty about one’s future personal and professional prospects), which likely contribute to the leak from academia. In this mixed-method research, Study 1 comprised interviews with postdoctoral women in North America ( n = 13) and Europe ( n = 8) across a range disciplines (e.g., psychology, physics, political science). Common themes included the negative impact of career uncertainty, gender-based challenges (especially sexism and maternity leave), and work-life balance on mental and physical health. However, interviewees also described attempts to overcome gender inequality and institutional barriers by drawing on support networks. Study 2 comprised an online survey of postdoctoral women ( N = 146) from a range of countries and academic disciplines to assess the relationships between social identification (e.g., disciplinary, gender, social group), perceived control (i.e., over work and life), and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction). Postdoctoral women showed mild levels of stress and depression, and were only slightly satisfied with life. They also showed only moderate levels of perceived control over one’s life and work. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that strongly identifying with one’s discipline was most consistently positively associated with both perceived control and mental health. Collectively, these findings implicate the postdoctoral stage as being stressful and tenuous for women regardless of academic background or nationality. They also highlight the importance of disciplinary identity as a potentially protective factor for mental health that, in turn, may diminish the rate at which postdoctoral women leak from the academic pipeline.

163,The effectiveness of art therapy for anxiety in adult women: A randomized controlled trial,"Objectives: Art therapy (AT) as a treatment option for anxiety is regularly employed in clinical practice, but scientific evidence for its effectiveness is lacking, since this intervention has hardly been studied. The aim was to study the effectiveness of AT on anxiety in adult women. The specific type of AT studied was anthroposophic AT. Methods: A RCT comparing AT versus a waiting list (WL) condition on anxiety symptom severity, quality of life, and emotion regulation. Factors influencing treatment outcome were additionally explored. Participants were women, aged 18–65 years, diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or panic disorder, with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. The trial was registered in the Dutch Trial Registration (NTR28143). Results: Fifty-nine women were included, of which 47 completed the trial. Both perprotocol and intention-to treat analyses demonstrated effectiveness of AT compared to WL, showing a reduction in anxiety, an increase in subjective quality of life (both with large effects) and an improvement in accessibility of emotion regulation strategies (medium effect). Treatment effects remained after 3 months follow-up. Improved acceptance of emotions and improved goal-oriented action are aspects of emotion regulation that are associated with the decrease in anxiety level. Conclusion: AT is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, improving quality of life and aspects of emotion regulation. Future RCTs should use active controls (treatment as usual) and study cost-effectiveness.

The major findings were that (a) three MA profiles were found in all three national samples, i.e., Low MA, Mid MA, and High MA profile, and (b) the percentages of students classified into each of the three MA profiles differed across the Finnish, Korean, and American samples, with United States having the highest prevalence of High MA, and Finland the lowest. Multi-group LPA also provided clear and useful latent profile separation. The High MA profile demonstrated significant poorer mathematics performance and lower mathematics interest, self-efficacy, and self-concept than the Mid and Low MA profiles. Same differences appeared between the Mid and Low MA profiles. The implications of the findings seem clear: (1) it is possible that there is some relative level of universality in MA among 15-year old students which is independent of cultural context; and (2) multi-group LPA could be a useful analytic tool for research on the study of classification and cultural differences of MA.

165,"Exposure to workplace bullying, distress, and insomnia: The moderating role of the miR-146a genotype","Several lines of evidence show that systematic exposure to negative social acts at the workplace i.e., workplace bullying, results in symptoms of depression and anxiety among those targeted. However, little is known about the association between bullying, inflammatory genes and sleep problems. In the present study, we examined the indirect association between exposure to negative social acts and sleep through distress, as moderated by the miR-146a genotype. The study was based on a nationally representative survey of 1179 Norwegian employees drawn from the Norwegian Central Employee Register by Statistics Norway. Exposure to workplace bullying was measured with the 9-item version of Negative Acts Questionnaire—Revised (NAQ-R) inventory. Seventeen items from Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) was used to measure distress. Insomnia was assessed with three items reflecting problems with sleep onset, maintenance of sleep and early morning awakening. Genotyping with regard to miR-146a rs2910164, previously linked to inflammatory processes, was carried out using Taqman assay. The data revealed that individuals systematically exposed to negative social acts at the workplace reported higher levels of sleep problems than non-exposed individuals. Moreover, the relationship between distress induced by exposure to negative social acts and insomnia was significantly stronger for individuals with the miR-146a GG genotype. Thus, the miR-146a genotype moderated the association between distress and insomnia among individuals exposed to negative social acts. The present report support the hypothesis that inflammation could play a role in stress-induced insomnia among individuals exposed to workplace bullying.

166,Narrative coherence and identity: Associations with psychological well-being and internalizing symptoms,"There are considerable differences in the ways in which individuals remember and try to make meaning out of past personal experiences. One autobiographical memory characteristic that has been receiving growing attention is narrative coherence, or the extent to which an individual is able to construct coherent accounts of their autobiographical memories. Previously, differences in narrative coherence have been found to be related to well-being, with more coherent individuals displaying higher levels of well-being. This study aimed to extend previous findings by examining the associations between narrative coherence, identity functioning, psychological well-being, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 395 American young adults (ages 18–30). We examined whether these associations differed within individuals as a function of the identity-relevance of the memory. In line with our prediction, narrative coherence was positively related to healthy identity functioning. However, the hypothesis that narrative coherence would be positively related to psychological well-being and negatively related to internalizing symptoms was only partially confirmed (i.e. only for personal growth and anxiety symptoms). These findings indicate that the relation between coherence and well-being might be more complex than originally assumed. Contrary to our predictions, it was not significantly more beneficial for an individual to narrate about a memory with high identity-relevance compared to a memory with low identity-relevance. Thus, it might be the individual’s general ability to include identity content within their narratives of personal experiences that moderates the association between coherence and well-being, rather than the identity-relevance of the specific memory. In the current study, we also found a significant gender effect, with women being more coherent than men. Furthermore, exploratory analyses indicated that being more coherence was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms and fewer identity-related struggles in men, but not in women. Possible explanations for the observed gender differences are discussed. Future longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to further clarify the link between narrative coherence, identity, and well-being.

167,"Effects of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) on symptom change, mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination in clients with depression, anxiety, and stress","Objectives: Over the past decade there has been an increasing interest in exploring self-compassion as a related and complementary construct to mindfulness. Increases in self-compassion may predict clinical outcomes after MBCT and cultivation of compassion toward self and others is central to CFT. This pilot study compared the impact of MBCT applying implicit self-compassion instructions and CFT employing explicit self-compassion instructions on symptom change, mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination. Method: This non-randomized wait-list controlled study ( N = 58) with two intervention arms (MBCT N = 20, CFT N = 18, Control N = 20) assessed the outcomes of clients with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms from before to after the interventions and at one month follow up (MBCT N = 17, CFT N = 13, Control N = 13). Results: Both treatments resulted in significant increases in mindfulness and self-compassion and decreases in rumination, depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, MBCT enhanced mindfulness for people who were initially high in rumination, whereas CFT enhanced mindfulness across the board. Conclusion: The findings suggest that both MBCT and CFT, and hence implicit or explicit self-compassion instructions, produce similar clinical outcomes with CFT enhancing mindfulness regardless of client's rumination level.

168,Does the disease of the person receiving care affect the emotional state of non-professional caregivers?,"Research on mental health of non-professional caregivers has focused on caregivers of people with specific diseases, especially dementia. Less is known about caregivers of people with other diseases. The aims of this study were (a) to determine the caregivers’ emotional state in a random sample of caregivers of people in situations of dependency, (b) to analyze the association between each disease of the care-recipient (a variety of 23 diseases included in the International Classification of Diseases) and the emotional state of the caregiver, and (c) based on the theoretical model, to analyze the relationship of the different study variables in the appearance of the emotional distress of the caregiver. A sample of 491 non-professional caregivers was selected randomly (89.0% women, average age 55.3 years). Trained psychologists collected sociodemographic and care-related characteristics and evaluated the global emotional distress, somatic symptoms, anxiety-insomnia, social dysfunction, depression, probable mental disorder case, self-esteem, and social support. It was found that (a) the caregivers showed moderate emotional distress, and 33.8% presented a probable mental disorder. (b) Caring for a care-recipient with cat’s cry syndrome or epilepsy was related to suffering from social dysfunction, and caring for a care-recipient with autism was related to having a probable mental health case. (c) Social support mediated the relationship between social class, daily hours of care, monthly family income, self-esteem and global emotional distress. There is an important impact on the emotional state of the caregivers. This impact was similar in caregivers of care-recipients with different diseases, except in caregivers caring for a care-recipient with cat’s cry syndrome or epilepsy (related to social dysfunction), and in caregivers caring for a care-recipient with autism (related to having a probable mental health case).

169,Intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety-related dispositions predict pain during upper endoscopy,"Although sedatives can defuse anxiety and relieve pain, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) still is uncomfortable and threatening for some patients. Identifying patients who tolerate digestive endoscopy less well remains difficult. Using a prospective design and a multimodal assessment of pain, the present study evaluated how anxiety-related variables predicted subsequent pain outcomes. Sixty-two consecutive patients referred for elective EGD were assessed for intolerance of uncertainty (IU), procedure-related worries, anxiety sensitivity and health distress before endoscopy. During endoscopy, a doctor rated patients’ pain behavior. After complete recovery from sedation, the patients retrospectively rated endoscopy pain and situation specific catastrophizing thoughts. Descriptive analyses showed that patients undergoing EGD for the first time were more distressed and anxious than patients accustomed to the procedure and needed a higher sedative dose. Notwithstanding sedation, the behavioral rating of pain was above the cut-off value for probable pain for more than half of the patients. IU assessed before endoscopy predicted situational pain catastrophizing (PC) and self-reported pain after endoscopy through procedure related worries. Situational PC not only mediated the effect of worry, but also female gender and younger age were associated with self-reported pain through increased catastrophizing thoughts. Health distress and anxiety sensitivity predicted PC only for women, younger patients, and those not accustomed to the procedure. Our study showed that psychological preparation before sedation is needed especially for first-timers, women, and younger patients, addressing maladaptive cognitive beliefs and acquainting patients with the somatic sensations that they might experience during the procedure.

170,Heterosis in COMT Val158Met polymorphism contributes to sex-differences in children’s math anxiety,"Math anxiety (MA) is a phobic reaction to math activities, potentially impairing math achievement. Higher frequency of MA in females is explainable by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The molecular-genetic basis of MA has not been investigated. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism, which affects dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, has been associated with anxiety manifestations. The valine allele is associated with lower, and the methionine allele with higher, dopamine availability. In the present study, the effects of sex and COMT Val158Met genotypes on MA were investigated: 389 school children aged 7–12 years were assessed for intelligence, numerical estimation, arithmetic achievement and MA and genotyped for COMT Val158Met polymorphism. The Math Anxiety Questionnaire (MAQ) was used to assess the cognitive and affective components of MA. All genotype groups of boys and girls were comparable regarding genotype frequency, age, school grade, numerical estimation, and arithmetic abilities. We compared the results of all possible genetic models: codominance (Val/Val vs. Val/Met vs. Met/Met), heterosis (Val/Met vs. Val/Val plus Met/Met), valine dominance (Val/Val plus Val/Met vs. Met/Met), and methionine dominance (Met/Met plus Val/Met vs. Val/Val). Models were compared using AIC and AIC weights. No significant differences between girls and boys and no effects of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on numerical estimation and arithmetic achievement were observed. Sex by genotype effects were significant for intelligence and MA. Intelligence scores were higher in Met/Met girls than in girls with at least one valine allele (valine dominance model). The best fitting model for MA was heterosis. In Anxiety Toward Mathematics, heterozygous individuals presented MA levels close to the grand average regardless of sex. Homozygous boys were significantly less and homozygous girls significantly more math anxious. Heterosis has been seldom explored, but in recent years has emerged as the best genetic model for some phenotypes associated with the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. This is the first study to investigate the genetic-molecular basis of MA.

171,Language as a threat: Multimodal evaluation and interventions for overwhelming linguistic anxiety in severe aphasia,"Linguistic anxiety (LA) is an abnormal stress response induced by situations that require the use of verbal behavior, and it is accentuated during language testing in persons with aphasia (PWA). The presence of LA in PWA may jeopardize the interpretation of cognitive evaluations, leading to biased conclusions about the severity of the language alteration and the effectiveness of the treatments. In the present study, we report the case of a woman (Mrs. A) with severe chronic mixed transcortical aphasia due to left frontal and parietal hemorrhages that partially spared the perisylvian area. Mrs. A was treated with the dopamine agonist Rotigotine alone and combined with Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT). Complementary evaluations included autonomic reactivity during the performance of different language tasks, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). We found that formal language testing in a clinical setting triggered a dramatic increase of automatic echolalia, perseverations and frustration, making the task completion difficult. The treatment improved aphasia, but gains were more robust when evaluation was performed by Mrs. A’s husband at home than by clinicians. Autonomic evaluation under Rotigotine revealed higher reactivity during tasks tapping an impaired function in comparison with a task evaluating a preserved function (verbal repetition). Baseline 18F-FDG-PET analysis showed decreased metabolic activity in left limbic-paralimbic areas, whereas rs-fMRI revealed compensatory activity in the right hemisphere. We also analyzed the different factors (e.g., premorbid personality traits, task difficulty) that may have contributed to LA in Mrs. A during language testing. Our findings emphasize the usefulness of implicating adequately trained laypersons in the evaluation and treatment of PWA showing LA. Further studies using multidimensional evaluations are needed to disentangle the interplay between anxiety and abnormal language as well as the neural mechanisms underpinning LA in PWA.

172,Psychiatric diagnoses differ considerably in their associations with alcohol/drug-related problems among adolescents. A Norwegian population-based survey linked with national patient registry data,"The aim of this study was to examine alcohol/drug use and problems across psychiatric diagnoses and to what extent associations between each psychiatric diagnosis and alcohol/drug use and problems were independent from the potential confounding effects of psychiatric comorbidity, socioeconomic status, sex and age. We used a dataset comprising a linkage between a large population-based and cross-sectional study among Norwegian adolescents (the youth@hordaland conducted in 2012) and national registry-based data on specialist mental health care use during the 4 years prior to the survey (2008 to 2011). The study sample included 16 to 19 year olds who participated in the youth@hordaland survey and consented to the linkage with patient registry data (n = 9,408). Among these, 853 (9%) had received specialist mental health care and comprised the clinical group, while the rest (n = 8,555) comprised the comparison group. The main outcome variables were several self-reported indicators for alcohol/drug use, including any alcohol use, frequent alcohol intoxication, high-level alcohol consumption, and lifetime illicit drug use, as well as one indicator for potential alcohol/drug-related problems: a positive CRAFFT-score. Adolescents receiving specialist mental health care (n = 853) reported more frequently alcohol/drug use and problems compared to adolescents not receiving these services (Cohens d’s ranging from 0.09 to 0.29, all p ≤ 0.01). Anxiety, depression, conduct disorders, eating disorders, ADHD, and trauma-related disorders were all associated with single measures of alcohol/drug use and problems, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.58 to 4.63, all p &lt; 0.05) in unadjusted models. Trauma-related disorders, depression and conduct disorders were also positively associated with higher scores on a combined indicator of alcohol/drug use and problems (ORs ranging from 1.89 to 3.15, all p &lt; 0.01), even after the full adjustment from psychiatric comorbidity and sociodemographic variables (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.61 to 2.79, p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that alcohol/drug use and problems were slightly more common among adolescents who received specialist mental health care during the past 4 years compared with the general adolescent population, and adolescents with trauma-related disorders, depression and conduct disorders were high-risk groups for alcohol/drug use and problems.

173,Can the testing effect for general knowledge facts be influenced by distraction due to divided attention or experimentally induced anxious mood?,"Studies on testing effect have showed that a practice test on study materials leads to better performance in a final test than restudying the materials for the same amount of time. Two experiments were conducted to test how distraction, as triggered by divided attention or experimentally induced anxious mood in the practice phase, could modulate the benefit of testing (vs. restudying) on the learning of interesting and boring general knowledge facts. Two individual difference factors (trait test anxiety and working memory (WM) capacity) were measured. Under divided attention, participants restudied or recalled the missing information in visually presented general knowledge facts, while judging whether auditorily presented items were from a pre-specified category. To experimentally induce anxious mood, we instructed participants to view and interpret negative pictures with anxious music background before and during the practice phase. Immediate and two-day delayed tests were given. Regardless of item type (interesting or boring) or retention interval, the testing effect was not significantly affected by divided (vs. full) attention or anxious (vs. neutral) mood. These results remained unchanged after taking into account the influences of participants’ trait test anxiety and WM capacity. However, when analyses were restricted to the study materials that had been learnt in the divided attention condition while participants accurately responded to the concurrent distracting task, the testing effect was stronger in the divided attention condition than in the full attention condition. Contrary to previous studies (e.g., Tse and Pu, 2012), there was no WM capacity × trait test anxiety interaction in the overall testing effect. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

174,Great expectations? Relation of previous experiences with social robots in real life or in the media and expectancies based on qualitative and quantitative assessment,"Social robots, which mostly look and behave like humans, are often perceived as somehow alive and treated similar to humans, despite the fact that they are non-living electronic devices. Based on considerations of the uncertainty reduction theory, the question arises what expectancies regarding social robots people have and what sources they use to achieve these expectancies. To receive an in-depth understanding of people’s expectancies regarding social robots and particularly how these expectancies are influenced by people’s experiences with real robots but also with fictional robots from media, thirteen semi-structured interviews and a quantitative online study ( n = 433) were conducted. Results indicate that people’s experiences with robots in the media lead to high expectations regarding the skills of robots, which in turn increase people’s general expectancies regarding social robots being part of the society as well as their personal lives. Furthermore, knowledge of negatively perceived fictional robots increases negative expectancies of robots becoming a threat to humans, while technical affinity reduces general robot anxiety.

175,Interdependent self-construal moderates relationships between positive emotion and quality in social interactions: A case of person to culture fit,"How emotion is experienced and expressed in social encounters can very much depend on a person’s cultural orientation and the two can affect the quality of social relationships. The present research examined how an interaction between cultural orientation (person) and emotion in social encounters (situation) can influence social interaction outcomes and by extent, cultural fit. For a period of seven days, participants ( N = 164) reported eight positive and eight negative emotions they experienced in naturally occurring social encounters together with indicators of quality of social interaction (satisfaction, attending to the other, perceiving others as emotionally more positive). Results from multilevel random coefficient analyses found that self-construal, interdependence in particular, moderated relationships between positive emotion and social interaction quality. At high levels of positive emotion, higher, compared to lower, interdependence was associated with lower attention to other and lower satisfaction with the encounter. At low levels of positive emotion, higher interdependence was associated with higher social interaction quality than persons lower in interdependence. These effects were more robust when social anxiety was controlled, and social anxiety was highly correlated with participants’ interdependent orientation. The results support socially situated accounts to emotion and cultural constructions of the self, and depict emotion in social interaction as an important indicator of cultural fit.

176,Insomnia as a partial mediator of the relationship between personality and future symptoms of anxiety and depression among nurses,"Background: This study investigates insomnia as a partial mediator in the relationship between personality and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: The study is based on partly longitudinal data from the ongoing cohort study “Survey of Shift work, Sleep, and Health” (SUSSH) among Norwegian nurses, a survey examining the work situation and health status of Norwegian nurses measured with annual questionnaires. The present study uses data collected in 2012 (Wave 4), 2013 (Wave 5), and 2014 (Wave 6). The final sample at Wave 6 consisted of 2002 participants, of which 91% were females. The questionnaires included items measuring, among others, demographic variables, work time schedule, insomnia (Bergen Insomnia Scale), personality (Mini-IPIP) and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results: Extraversion and conscientiousness had no significant direct or indirect association with insomnia, anxiety or depression. Neuroticism and insomnia had direct associations to future symptoms of anxiety and depression. Insomnia was also a significant partial mediator of the relationship between both neuroticism and anxiety, and neuroticism and depression, meaning that neuroticism had an indirect relation to symptoms of anxiety and depression through insomnia. When adjusting for previous symptoms of anxiety and depression at Wave 5, insomnia was no longer a significant mediator between neuroticism and anxiety, and only marginally mediated the relationship between neuroticism and depression. Conclusion: The results showed that insomnia may act as a mediator between neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety and depression, but the indirect relationship between neuroticism and anxiety and depression through insomnia is considerably weaker than the direct association. Hence, the mediating effect of insomnia should be interpreted with caution. The sample mainly consisted of female nurses, and the generalizability of the findings to male dominated occupations is limited. Findings from the present study highlight the importance of an integrated approach and strengthen the understanding of how personality and psychopathology are connected.

177,Assessing beliefs underlying rumination about pain: Development and validation of the Pain Metacognitions Questionnaire,"Metacognitions, which are beliefs about our own thinking processes, can modulate worry and rumination and thereby influence emotional distress. This study aimed to develop a self-report measure of unhelpful pain-related metacognitions which might serve as a clinical and research tool to better understand pain catastrophizing, a significant risk factor for adverse pain outcomes. Two phases of validation are presented. Phase 1 reports on how the Pain Metacognitions Questionnaire (PMQ) was empirically developed through a qualitative study of 20 people with chronic back ( n = 15) or knee ( n = 5) pain in secondary or tertiary care and then validated in a large internet sample of people experiencing pain ( N = 864). Rasch analysis yielded a 21-item scale with two dimensions (positive and negative metacognition) assessing how useful and problematic people believe rumination about pain to be, respectively. In Phase 2, further validation using a new sample ( N = 510) replicated initial findings. Both PMQ subscales have good retest reliability ( r = 0.76, r = 0.72) and internal consistency (0.86, 0.87). They correlate negatively with mindfulness and positively with pain intensity, disability, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, rumination, and metacognition. The PMQ also predicts unique variance in catastrophizing when other variables are controlled and predicts ‘patient’ status for pain catastrophizing. Sensitivity analysis yielded preliminary suggestions for clinically meaningful cut-offs. Unhelpful pain metacognitions can be validly and reliably measured using a self-report instrument. Future studies using the PMQ might shed new light on pain-related thinking processes to develop better interventions for people prone to worry and rumination about their pain.

178,"Evaluating mindful with your baby/toddler: Observational changes in maternal sensitivity, acceptance, mind-mindedness, and dyadic synchrony","Studies on the effectiveness of mindful parenting interventions predominantly focused on self-report measures of parenting, whereas observational assessments of change are lacking. The present study examined whether the Mindful with your baby/toddler training leads to observed changes in maternal behavior and mother–child interaction quality. Mindful with your baby/toddler is a 8- or 9-week mindful parenting training for clinically referred mothers of young children (aged 0–48 months), who experience parental stress, mother–child interaction problems, and/or whose children experience regulation problems. The study involved a quasi-experimental non-random design including a sample of 50 mothers who were diagnosed with a mood disorder ( n = 21, 42%), an anxiety disorder ( n = 7, 14%), post-traumatic stress disorder ( n = 6, 12%), or other disorder ( n = 7, 14%). Mothers completed a parental stress questionnaire and participated in home observations with their babies ( n = 36) or toddlers ( n = 14) during a waitlist, pretest, and posttest assessment. Maternal sensitivity, acceptance, and mind-mindedness were coded from free-play interactions and dyadic synchrony was coded from face-to-face interactions. Sensitivity and acceptance were coded with the Ainsworth’s maternal sensitivity scales. Mind-mindedness was assessed by calculating frequency and proportions of appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments. Dyadic synchrony was operationalized by co-occurrences of gazes and positive facial expressions and maternal and child responsiveness in vocal interaction within the dyad. Coders were blind to the measurement moment. From waitlist to pretest, no significant improvements were observed. At posttest, mothers reported less parenting stress, and were observed to show more accepting behavior and make less nonattuned comments than at pretest, and children showed higher levels of responsiveness. The outcomes suggest that the Mindful with your baby/toddler training affects not only maternal stress, but also maternal behavior, particularly (over)reactive parenting behaviors, which resulted in more acceptance, better attunement to child’s mental world, and more “space” for children to respond to their mothers during interactions. Mindful with your baby/toddler may be a suitable intervention for mothers of young children with (a combination of) maternal psychopathology, parental stress, and problems in the parent–child interaction and child regulation problems.

179,Children and adolescents mental health: A systematic review of interaction-based interventions in schools and communities,"Background: There is growing evidence and awareness regarding the magnitude of mental health issues across the globe, starting half of those before the age of 14 and have lifelong effects on individuals and society. Despite the multidimensional nature of this global challenge, which necessarily require comprehensive approaches, many interventions persist in seeking solutions that only tackle the individual level. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of evidence for positive effects in children and adolescents' mental health resulting from interventions conducted in schools and communities in which interaction among different agents is an integral component. Methods: An extensive search in electronic databases (Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify interventions in which interactions between peers, teachers, families or other community members or professionals played a role. Their effects on children and adolescents' mental health were also reviewed. We carried out a systematic review of papers published from 2007 to 2017. Eleven studies out of 384 met the inclusion criteria. Seven of the articles reviewed focus on interventions conducted in schools and promote supportive interactions involving students, teachers, families and mental health professionals. Four of the articles develop interventions that engage community members in dialogic interactions with children and adolescents. Results: Interventions in schools and communities implement strategies that foster supportive interactions among diverse actors including teachers, parents, community members, and other professionals. The effects of the mental health interventions reported on children and adolescents' problems include a decrease in disruptive behaviors and affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety, together with an increase in social skills, as well as an improvement in personal well-being. Conclusions: There is evidence of a positive effect on the mental health of children and adolescents, both in decreasing symptoms of mental disorder and in promoting emotional well-being. Whereas, interactions among different actors seem to be a relevant aspect across the interventions, more research is needed to conclude its effect on the outcomes of the studies reviewed.

180,The traumatic experience of breast cancer: Which factors can relate to the post-traumatic outcomes?,"Background: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is considered a positive outcome of struggling with a traumatic event, distinct, and opposite from negative outcomes, i.e., psychological distress. The present study aimed to shed light on the relationship between potentially relating factors (i.e., coping strategies, perceived social support, and attachment style) and both positive and negative psychological outcomes. Methods: A total of 123 breast cancer survivors were recruited, who completed a battery of self-report questionnaires, assessing PTG, psychological distress, coping strategies, perceived social support, and attachment style. Three regression analyses were run to evaluate whether relating factors were significant predictors of the positive and negative psychological outcomes. Results: The regression analyses showed that the “Fatalism” coping strategy and perceived social support were two significant predictors of PTG. Instead, the “Helpless-Hopeless” and “Anxious Preoccupation” coping strategies, as well as an insecure attachment style, were significant predictors of depression, while the “Anxious Preoccupation” coping strategy and an insecure attachment style were significant predictors of anxiety. Conclusions: The present findings showed that the factors underlying a positive or negative outcome are different and specific. While perceived social support and a fatalistic attitude seem to play a key role in the positive outcome, dysfunctional coping strategies, together with an insecure attachment style, appear to be related with negative psychological outcome. Considering these factors in clinical practice would help patients to give meaning to their traumatic experience, enhancing psychological growth.

181,Residential place attachment as an adaptive strategy for coping with the reduction of spatial abilities in old age,"This study intended to test whether attachment to one’s own residential place at neighborhood level could represent a coping response for the elderly (consistently with the “docility hypothesis;” Lawton, 1982), when dealing with the demands of unfamiliar environments, in order to balance their reduction of spatial abilities. Specifically, a sequential path was tested, in which neighborhood attachment was expected to play a buffer role between lowered spatial competence and neighborhood satisfaction. The participants ( N = 264), senior citizens (over 65-year-old), responded to a questionnaire including the measures of spatial self-efficacy, spatial anxiety, attitude toward wayfinding, residential attachment and residential satisfaction. Results from the mediation analysis showed that a lower perceived spatial self-efficacy is associated to a higher spatial anxiety, and both promote a more negative attitude toward wayfinding tasks in non-familiar places. This leads to a higher attachment to one’s own neighborhood, which in turn predicts a higher residential satisfaction. Thus, the “closure” response of becoming more attached to their residential place may be an adaptive strategy of the elderly for compensating the Person-Environment (P-E) mis-fit (Lawton and Nahemow, 1973) when they feel unable (or less able) to cope with the demands of unfamiliar environments.

182,Demographic and parental factors associated with developmental outcomes in children with intellectual disabilities,"The aim of the study was to examine the relation between demographic variables, parental characteristics, and cognitive, language and motor skills development in children with intellectual disabilities (ID). A sample of 89 children with ID, aged 20–47 months, completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development to measure cognitive, motor, and linguistic development. Parents were administered questionnaires about demographic information and parental anxiety, depression, parental stress, conjugality and familial functioning. Parenting behaviors (affection, responsiveness, encouragement, and teaching) were observed using the Spanish version of PICCOLO (Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes). A bivariate analysis showed that cognitive development in infants was significantly related to the mother’s and father’s responsiveness, and to the father’s teaching scores. Infant language development was related to a variety of maternal factors (educational level, anxiety, depression, maternal responsiveness) and to the father’s teaching scores. None of the factors were statistically related to child motor development. A multivariate regression analysis indicated that children’s cognitive development can be predicted by a linear combination of maternal responsiveness and paternal teaching scores. Language development can be predicted by a linear combination of maternal anxiety and responsiveness, and paternal teaching scores. The present study provides evidence of the importance of paternal involvement for cognitive and language development in children with intellectual disabilities, and contributes to the increasing literature about fathering.

183,Combining quantitative and qualitative data in the study of feeding behavior in male wistar rats,"The first step in a behavioral study is represented by the organization of a suitable ethogram, that is, a formal description of individual components of the behavior. Then, each component of such a behavioral repertoire can be quantified (e.g., how many times it occurs, its duration, percent distribution, latency, etc.). However, it is our contention that the possibility to describe the behavior of a living being by means of hundreds or even thousands of numbers concerning isolated components, disjointed from the comprehensive behavioral architecture, does not imply the possibility to use those numbers to reconstruct the meaning of behavior. Such a level of comprehension requires a qualitative approach based on the analysis of behavioral structure and its underlying dynamics. By means of synergic utilization of quantitative and qualitative data a more complete description of a given behavior becomes available. In present study we discuss results obtained from observations of feeding behavior in two groups of male Wistar rats: a control group, under standard diet, and a second group, under hyperglycidic one. Results have been presented both in terms of quantitative evaluations and in terms of structural/qualitative ones, the latter obtained by means of T-pattern detection and analysis. As to quantitative results, mean durations showed a significant reduction of Walking and Feeding and an increase of Hind-Paw Licking and Body Grooming; concerning mean occurrences, a significant increase of Front-Paw Licking, Hind-Paw Licking, and Body Grooming was present; percent distributions showed significant reductions for Walking and Feeding and a significant increase for all grooming activities. As to qualitative assessments, T-pattern analysis unveiled a clear-cut behavioral reorganization induced by the hyperglycidic diet. If on the one hand, 50 different T-patterns were detected in subjects under standard diet, on the other hand, 703 different T-patterns were discovered in animals under hyperglycidic treatment, with a highly significant increase of mean lengths and a significant reduction of mean occurrences of T-patterns. Synergic evaluation of results in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects shows, in rats fed with hyperglycidic diet, an increased anxiety condition, likely dependent on food-related stimuli and suggestive of a pervasive craving-related behavior.

184,What really matters for loneliness among left-behind children in rural China: A meta-analytic review,"In rural China, left-behind children are likely to suffer chronic loneliness. Research has identified a variety of factors that may be associated with loneliness among these children. A meta-analysis is needed to address the empirical inconsistencies and examine the strength of relations between different factors and loneliness. The current meta-analysis included 51 studies on predictors of loneliness published from 2008 to 2017. Results showed that one individual factor (social anxiety) is a key risk factor for loneliness, whereas eight individual (older age, self-esteem, resilience, extroversion) and contextual factors (family functioning, parent–child relationship, peer relationship, social support) serve as protective factors in predicting loneliness. In addition, boys were more likely to feel lonely than girls. Findings and implications of this study were discussed.

185,Enhanced memory for fair-related faces and the role of trait anxiety,"The current research examined whether fair consideration—a social norm that people inherently prefer to confirm—would modulate face recognition. Each neutral face was associated with fair or unfair offers via an economic decision task, the Ultimatum Game (UG) task. After the UG, participants were asked to identify the faces of proposers who made different offers. Enhanced memory was observed for fair-related compared to unfair-related faces. Furthermore, high trait anxiety was associated with reduced memory for fair-related faces. These results were further confirmed by signal detection theory. The current research provided initial evidence that people showed enhanced memory for faces that made fair offers from the economic decision task, and that high trait anxiety was associated with reduced fair-related memory. Possible neural mechanisms and the implication in economic and social situations have been discussed.

186,Psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2,"Competitive anxiety (CA) is an emotional reaction manifested at a somatic and/or cognitive level that regularly appears before or during sports competitions and can significantly impact an athlete’s performance. Given the scarcity of validated instruments available for evaluating the competitive-anxiety trait in the Brazilian context, this study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2). The study sample was composed of 238 professional and amateur athletes aged 13 years or older who practice different sports modalities. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed adequate fit indices of the original three-factor theoretical model of the SAS-2 after including a correlation between the errors for items 6 and 12 of the somatic anxiety subscale (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.08, WRMR = 1.04). For convergent and divergent validity, the SAS-2 subscales exhibited a positive and strong correlations with the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2R (CSAI-2R; r = 0.52–0.82), weak to moderate correlations with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – only the trait scale (STAI-T; r = 0.49–0.59), weak correlations with the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; r = 0.29–0.41) and weak to moderate correlations with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; r = 0.49–0.56). The SAS-2 was also able to discriminate among participants with and without social anxiety, general trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, thus confirming its discriminant validity. According to ROC curve analysis, the cutoff point at a score of 29 indicated the optimal balance of sensitivity (0.74) and specificity (0.82). The internal consistency (α = 0.73–0.86) and the test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.73–0.80) were satisfactory. These results indicated that the Brazilian version of the SAS-2 exhibited satisfactory psychometric performance and could be used in the Brazilian context.

187,Recovery after genocide: Understanding the dimensions of recovery capital among incarcerated genocide perpetrators in Rwanda,"Utilizing survey data from 302 men and women incarcerated in the Rwandan correctional system for the crime of genocide, and structured interviews with 75 prisoners, this mixed methods study draws on the concept of recovery capital to understand how individuals convicted of genocide navigate post-genocide healing. Genocide smashes physical and human capital and perverts social and cultural capital. Experiencing high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms with more than two-thirds of the sample scoring above typical civilian cut-off levels, raised levels of depression, and high levels of anxiety, and failing physical health, the genocide perpetrators require multiple sources of recovery capital to foster internal resilience as they look forward to rebuilding their own lives.

188,Exploring the role of meditation and dispositional mindfulness on social cognition domains: A controlled study,"Research suggests that mindfulness can induce changes in the social domain, such as enhancing emotional connection to others, prosocial behavior, and empathy. However, despite growing interest in mindfulness in social psychology, very little is known about the effects of mindfulness on social cognition. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between mindfulness and social cognition by comparing meditators with non-meditators on several social cognition measures. A total of 60 participants (meditators, n = 30; non-meditators, n = 30) were matched on sex, age, and ethnic group, and then asked to complete the following assessment measures: Mindful Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), Revised Eyes Test, Hinting Task, Ambiguous Intentions and Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP). The results showed that meditators reported higher empathy (except for the personal distress subscale), higher emotional recognition, higher theory of mind (ToM), and lower hostile attributional style/bias. The findings also demonstrated that dispositional mindfulness (both total score assessed with MAAS and mindfulness facets using the FFMQ) was associated with social cognition, although it was not equally correlated with all social cognition outcomes, and correlation patterns differ when analyses were conducted separately for meditators and non-meditators. In addition, results showed potential predictors for each social cognition variable, highlighting non-reactivity to inner experience as a key component of mindfulness in order to explain social cognition performance. In summary, the findings indicated that the meditator sample performed better on certain qualities (i.e., empathy, emotional recognition, ToM, hostile attributional style/bias) in comparison to non-meditators and, furthermore, support the notion that mindfulness is related to social cognition, which may have implications for the design of mindfulness-based approaches for use in clinical and non-clinical settings.

189,Emotional labor in knowledge-based service relationships: The roles of self-monitoring and display rule perceptions,"Focusing on knowledge-based service relationships, this study examined knowledge-based service workers’ (i.e., school teachers) emotional labor process and the consequential outcomes for their well-being. The study also examined the roles of two antecedents, namely, teachers’ perceptions of display rules and self-monitoring tendencies. A sample of 1,656 school teachers participated in the study. The results showed that self-monitoring generally had stronger, though maladaptive, effects than display rule perceptions on individuals’ use of emotional labor strategies (ELS) (i.e., surface acting and deep acting) and well-being (i.e., anxiety, depression, contentment, and enthusiasm). Both self-monitoring and display rule perceptions were positively related to two ELS. There were relatively stronger relationships between self-monitoring and surface acting, and between display rule perceptions and deep acting. Surface acting was positively related to anxiety and depression and negatively related to contentment and enthusiasm. Deep acting was positively related to anxiety, contentment, and enthusiasm. The examination of indirect effects showed that self-monitoring was positively related to anxiety and depression and negatively related to enthusiasm and contentment. Display rule perceptions were weakly, but positively, related to anxiety and depression. These results suggest that self-monitoring may be less beneficial than previously thought. Knowledge-based service workers’ display rule perceptions and deep acting may not necessarily be harmful to their well-being, but reflect their role identification and commitment. Theoretical contributions and practical suggestions of this study were discussed.

190,Enhancing psychological sexual health of people with spinal cord injury and their partners in an Italian Unipolar Spinal Unit: A pilot data study,"Like the slogan of the American Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine says, “No injury, no matter how serious, can take away your ability to have a relationship, experience love, and experience the attraction between two people.” However, people with spinal cord injury (SCI) have to fight with their own and societal attitudes and stereotypes that limit sexuality to the physiological functions of genitalia, phallocentric primacy of sexual pleasure, and sexual attractiveness of perfect bodies. The scope of the present study is to evaluate the impacts of a psychoeducational intervention in a personal growth group on the sexual life of seven people with SCI and four of their partners particularly their sexual interest and satisfaction, depression, and anxiety. Due to the small samples size, nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare pre- and post-outcome measures for all participants: patients and the partners group. Possible effects of gender were also considered. The effectiveness of the psychoeducational intervention was clearly apparent, showing a high effect size in improving sexual interest and satisfaction, and the opportunity and ability to enjoy sexuality. A reduction of anxiety was also observed for all participants, although it may not have been related to the psychoeducational intervention. Moreover, the intervention significantly improved the opportunity and ability to enjoy sexuality for the partner and patient group. No effect was found on depression. This was the first initiative in Italy aiming to address the sexual life and not only to cure the sexual dysfunction of people with SCI. The positive, clear evidence of the validity of the Love &amp; Life project’s intervention bodes well for new psychoeducational initiatives that in Italy meet the sexual needs of people with SCI and their partners, providing adequate education and psychological support, involving partners, and creating a space to talk among peers.

191,Diazepam reduces escape and increases closed-arms exploration in gerbils after 5 min in the elevated plus-maze,"Despite the wide implementation of the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents, the interpretation of these measures in gerbils has received limited attention. Here, male gerbils were treated with vehicle or diazepam, followed by a 20-min EPM session. EPM data were subjected to minute-by-minute, 5-min bins and factor analyses. During the first 5-min, gerbils avoided the closed arms in favor of the open arms and diazepam increased open-arms entries; furthermore, a single factor (escape behavior) explained all the analyzed measures. Only after 5-min, gerbils reduced open-arms exploration and three independent factors emerged for each subsequent 5-min bin. These findings suggest that EPM data from gerbils should be analyzed in at least two 5-min bins. Measures from the standard 5-min session seem to be related to an escape response from the EPM through the open arms. Once habituated, measures from the second 5-min bin seem to be related to a conflictive situation: keep trying to escape unsuccessfully (due to open-arms height) or seek protection in the closed arms (unsafe places). Diazepam seems to reduce this conflict by mitigating the escape response (Factor 1—Anxiety) and increasing closed-arms approach (Factor 2) and risk assessment (Factor 3). Unlike mice and rats, a decrease in open-arms exploration and an increase in risk assessment could be interpreted as an anxiolytic-like effect in gerbils.

192,Psychological demands of international rugby sevens and well-being needs of elite South African players,"Rugby sevens was included in the 2016 Olympic Games, with South Africa’s Blitzboks winning bronze. They also won the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 World Rugby Sevens Series. Whilst peak performance is paramount at the elite level there is a growing responsibility to address player well-being and off-the-field player needs. This study explored the psychological demands of international rugby sevens and the well-being needs of elite players. Twenty professional players (age range: 21–33 years) participated in semi-structured interviews. Qualitative content analysis yielded five categories of psychological demands: (1) tournament structure, (2) resilience, (3) cope with physicality, (4) perform when fatigued, and (5) perform under pressure. The prevailing team culture included: (1) team cohesion, (2) clear purpose, (3) work ethic, (4) team values, (5) happy environment, (6) relationships with coaching staff, and (7) faith. Various psychological skills [(1) goal-directed behavior, (2) compartmentalization, (3) deal with anxiety, (4) motivation, (5) imagery, and (6) self-confidence] and mental strategies [(1) coping, (2) “back-to-zero,” (3) creativity, and (4) cognitive triggers] utilized by the players are discussed. Their general well-being and individual needs were: (1) physical needs, (2) financial concerns/needs, (3) preparation for life after rugby career, (4) support structures, and (5) mental (ill) health. This information could be useful to develop an integrated sport psychological and well-being program aimed at improving performance and facilitating psychological well-being both during and after retirement from elite sport.

193,In the absence of effects: An individual patient data meta-analysis of non-response and its predictors in internet-based cognitive behavior therapy,"Background: Negative effects of psychological treatments have recently received increased attention in both research and clinical practice. Most investigations have focused on determining the occurrence and characteristics of deterioration and other adverse and unwanted events, such as interpersonal issues, indicating that patients quite frequently experience such incidents in treatment. However, non-response is also negative if it might have prolonged an ongoing condition and caused unnecessary suffering. Yet few attempts have been made to directly explore non-response in psychological treatment or its plausible causes. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been found effective for a number of diagnoses but has not yet been systematically explored with regard to those patients who do not respond. Methods: The current study collected and aggregated data from 2,866 patients in 29 clinical randomized trials of ICBT for three categories of diagnoses: anxiety disorders, depression, and other (erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, and gambling disorder). Raw scores from each patient variable were used in an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the rate of non-response on the primary outcome measure for each clinical trial, while its potential predictors were examined using binomial logistic regression. The reliable change index (RCI) was used to classify patients as non-responders. Results: Of the 2,118 patients receiving treatment, and when applying a RCI of z ≥ 1.96, 567 (26.8%) were classified as non-responders. In terms of predictors, patients with higher symptom severity on the primary outcome measure at baseline, Odds Ratio ( OR ) = 2.04, having a primary anxiety disorder ( OR = 5.75), and being of male gender ( OR = 1.80), might have higher odds of not responding to treatment. Conclusion: Non-response seems to occur among approximately a quarter of all patients in ICBT, with predictors related to greater symptoms, anxiety disorders, and gender indicating increasing the odds of not responding. However, the results need to be replicated before establishing their clinical relevance, and the use of the RCI as a way of determining non-response needs to be validated by other means, such as by interviewing patients classified as non-responders.

194,"Metacognition, hardiness, and grit as resilience factors in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations: A simulation study","Operators of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) face a variety of stress factors resulting from both the cognitive demands of the work and its broader social context. Dysfunctional metacognitions including those concerning worry may increase stress vulnerability, whereas personality traits including hardiness and grit may confer resilience. The present study utilized a simulation of UAS operation requiring control of multiple vehicles. Two stressors were manipulated independently in a within-subjects design: cognitive demands and negative evaluative feedback. Stress response was assessed using both subjective measures and a suite of psychophysiological sensors, including the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and hemodynamic sensors. Both stress manipulations elevated subjective distress and elicited greater high-frequency activity in the EEG. However, predictors of stress response varied across the two stressors. The Anxious Thoughts Inventory (AnTI: Wells, 1994) was generally associated with higher state worry in both control and stressor conditions. It also predicted stress reactivity indexed by EEG and worry responses in the negative feedback condition. Measures of hardiness and grit were associated with somewhat different patterns of stress response. In addition, within the negative feedback condition, the AnTI meta-worry scale moderated relationships between state worry and objective performance and psychophysiological outcome measures. Under high state worry, AnTI meta-worry was associated with lower frontal oxygen saturation, but higher spectral power in high-frequency EEG bands. High meta-worry may block adaptive compensatory effort otherwise associated with worry. Findings support both the metacognitive theory of anxiety and negative emotions (Wells and Matthews, 2015), and the Trait-Stressor-Outcome (TSO: Matthews et al., 2017a) framework for resilience.

195,Neural correlates of cognitive-attentional syndrome: An fMRI study on repetitive negative thinking induction and resting state functional connectivity,"Aim: Cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) is the main factor underlying depressive and anxiety disorders in the metacognitive approach to psychopathology and psychotherapy. This study explore neural correlates of this syndrome during induced negative thinking, abstract thinking, and resting states. Methods: n = 25 people with high levels of CAS and n = 33 people with low levels of CAS were chosen from a population-based sample ( N = 1225). These groups filled-in a series of measures of CAS, negative affect, and psychopathology; they also underwent a modified rumination induction procedure and a resting state fMRI session. Resonance imaging data were analyzed using static general linear model and functional connectivity approaches. Results: The two groups differed with large effect sizes on all used measures of CAS, negative affect, and psychopathology. We did not find any group differences in general linear model analyses. Functional connectivity analyses showed that high levels of CAS were related to disrupted patterns of connectivity within and between various brain networks: the default mode network, the salience network, and the central executive network. Conclusion: We showed that low- and high-CAS groups differed in functional connectivity during induced negative and abstract thinking and also in resting state fMRI. Overall, our results suggest that people with high levels of CAS tend to have disrupted neural processing related to self-referential processing, task-oriented processing, and emotional processing.

196,"Secondary traumatic stress: Relationship with symptoms, exhaustion, and emotions among cemetery workers","Background: Cemeteries workers are deserving of attention because they are exposed to various psychosocial risks: these workers are subject to painful contacts and daily exposed to a work content linked to death experiences and the emotions associated with them. Secondary trauma develops from this continuous contact with others’ suffering; operators working with this type of traumatic content and dynamic could suffer from emotional disorders (Figley, 1995). Therefore, the secondary traumatic stress (STS) is seen as an occupational risk factor (Bride et al., 2004) and cemetery workers are subject to this risk. Studies on this topic have focused on the operators of emergencies, social, and health sectors; little attention has been given to cemetery workers. Aim: The present study considers the relations between the dimensions composing the STS and the psychological and physical symptoms, the perception of exhaustion, and the positive and negative emotions at work in a group of cemetery workers. Moreover, differences among occupational tasks are explored considering the different possibilities of contact with clients and trauma contagion. Methods: The study included a qualitative phase (interviews and focus groups) and subsequently a quantitative phase (self-report questionnaire) and involved 114 participants in a cemetery organization in northern Italy, divided into technicians employees (TE), technicians and specialists of decoration and garden (TS), gravediggers (GR) administrative and front office employees (AFO). Levels of secondary trauma and psychophysical symptoms were assessed, and correlations were calculated in the total sample and for the different job categories of employees. Results: AFO and TS showed the highest levels of STS and psychophysical symptoms, in particular for symptoms related to anxiety, sadness, insomnia, and gastric and musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of considering the STS among also this category of workers, since they are exposed daily not only with death, but also with suffering people; grief and emotional skills are important to cope with these job characteristics cemetery workers are not trained on this. It is important to monitor symptomatic levels not only to avoid chronicity, but also to provide employees with psychological support and training about secondary trauma and its consequences.

197,Coach-created motivational climate and athletes’ adaptation to psychological stress: Temporal motivation-emotion interplay,"This two-wave study investigated the temporal interplay between motivation and the intensity and reported impact of athletes’ emotions in training settings. In total, 217 athletes completed self-report measures of motivational climate, motivation regulations, emotional states (i.e., pleasant states, anger, and anxiety) experienced before practice at two time points during a 3-month period. Latent change score modeling revealed significantly negative paths from task-involving climate at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of dysfunctional anxiety and anger, and significantly positive paths from ego-involving climate at time 1 to the latent change in dysfunctional anger (i.e., intensity and reported impact). The paths from controlled motivation at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of dysfunctional anxiety and vice versa were significantly positive. The path from controlled motivation at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of functional anger was significantly positive, but not vice versa. In addition, the paths from dysfunctional anger (i.e., intensity and reported impact) at time 1 to the latent change in motivation regulations were significant, but not vice versa. Overall, evidence provided suggested that the temporal interplay of motivation and emotions is contingent on the specific emotions. The findings highlight the role of coach-created motivational climate and the importance of identifying high levels of controlled motivation to help athletes better adapt to psychological stress.

198,Work-family conflict and mindful parenting: The mediating role of parental psychopathology symptoms and parenting stress in a sample of Portuguese employed parents,"Aims: The aims of the current study are to examine whether parents’ work-family conflict, emotional distress (anxiety/depressive symptoms and parenting stress) and mindful parenting vary according to the type of employment (full-time, part-time, and occasional), the type of work schedule (fixed, flexible, and shift), and the number of working hours per week and to explore whether parental emotional distress mediates the association between work-family conflict and mindful parenting dimensions. Methods: A sample of 335 employed parents (86.3% mothers) of children and adolescents between the ages of 1 and 19 years old completed a sociodemographic form and measures of work-family conflict, anxiety/depression symptoms, parenting stress, and mindful parenting. The differences in study variables among types of employment, work schedules and number of weekly working hours were analyzed. A path model was tested through structural equation modeling in AMOS to explore the indirect effect of work-family conflict on mindful parenting dimensions through anxiety, depression and parenting stress. The invariance of the path model across children’s age groups (toddlers, preschool and grade school children, and adolescents) and parents’ gender was also examined. Results: Parents with a shift work schedule, working full-time and 40 h or more per week, presented significantly higher levels of work-family conflict than those with a fixed or flexible schedule, working part-time and less than 40 h per week, respectively. Parents with a flexible work schedule presented significantly higher levels of self-regulation in parenting and of non-judgmental acceptance of parental functioning than parents with a shift work schedule. Higher levels of work-family conflict were associated with lower levels of mindful parenting dimensions through higher levels of anxiety/depression symptoms and parenting stress. The model was invariant across children’s age groups and parents’ gender. Discussion: Work-family conflict is associated with poorer parental mental health and with less mindful parenting. Workplaces should implement family-friendly policies (e.g., flexible work arrangements) that help parents successfully balance the competing responsibilities and demands of their work and family roles. These policies could have a critical impact on the mental health of parents and, consequently, on their parental practices.

199,Inhibited personality temperaments translated through enhanced avoidance and associative learning increase vulnerability for PTSD,"Although many individuals who experience a trauma go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the rate of PTSD following trauma is only about 15–24%. There must be some pre-existing conditions that impart increased vulnerability to some individuals and not others. Diathesis models of PTSD theorize that pre-existing vulnerabilities interact with traumatic experiences to produce psychopathology. Recent work has indicated that personality factors such as behavioral inhibition (BI), harm avoidance (HA), and distressed (Type D) personality are vulnerability factors for the development of PTSD and anxiety disorders. These personality temperaments produce enhanced acquisition or maintenance of associations, especially avoidance, which is a criterion symptom of PTSD. In this review, we highlight the evidence for a relationship between these personality types and enhanced avoidance and associative learning, which may increase risk for the development of PTSD. First, we provide the evidence confirming a relationship among BI, HA, distressed (Type D) personality, and PTSD. Second, we present recent findings that BI is associated with enhanced avoidance learning in both humans and animal models. Third, we will review evidence that BI is also associated with enhanced eyeblink conditioning in both humans and animal models. Overall, data from both humans and animals suggest that these personality traits promote enhanced avoidance and associative learning, as well as slowing of extinction in some training protocols, which all support the learning diathesis model. These findings of enhanced learning in vulnerable individuals can be used to develop objective behavioral measures to pre-identify individuals who are more at risk for development of PTSD following traumatic events, allowing for early (possibly preventative) intervention, as well as suggesting possible therapies for PTSD targeted on remediating avoidance or associative learning. Future work should explore the neural substrates of enhanced avoidance and associative learning for behaviorally inhibited individuals in both the animal model and human participants.

200,Appearance teasing and mental health: Gender differences and mediation effects of appearance-based rejection sensitivity and dysmorphic concerns,"Appearance teasing is a common phenomenon in social interactions, especially in adolescence. Several studies have shown its negative impact on mental health as well as on body image. While these findings prove stable in various contexts, less evidence is available for possible gender differences in these relationships. In particular, the role of two important body image variables—appearance-based rejection sensitivity (ARS) and dysmorphic concerns—and their contribution to mental health impairments has not been assessed in gender-specific process models. In a cross-sectional survey-study ( N = 501; 407 f, 94 m), we retrospectively assessed early appearance teasing experiences, as well as current ARS, dysmorphic concerns, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. We analyzed gender differences in these variables and their interrelations. We then examined the mediating role of ARS and dysmorphic concerns in explaining mental health variables in adulthood due to early appearance teasing in gender-specific serial-mediation models. The results show high ratios of early teasing experiences, but no significant gender difference regarding the frequency of early appearance teasing. While teasing experiences were significantly related to body image variables in adulthood in both genders ( r s &gt; 0.32; p s &lt; 0.010), we observed significant relations with mental health outcomes in women ( r s &gt; 0.30; p s &lt; 0.001) but not in men ( r s &lt; 0.20; p s &gt; 0.250). Serial mediation models show that ARS and dysmorphic concerns mediate the effects of appearance teasing on mental health in all outcomes in women (Δ R ² &gt; 0.17), but not in men (Δ R ² &lt; 0.03). Findings remained stable when controlling for Body-Mass-Index, age, and relationship-status. The findings show similar frequencies of appearance teasing and associated negative effects on body image in men and women. Specifically, in women, the effects of teasing on mental health were stronger and mediated by ARS and dysmorphic concerns. Overall, the results point to the relevance of ARS for etiological models of body image disorders and female mental health. However, men did not show the same relationships of teasing and mental health. Differential resilience factors regarding the negative effects of early appearance teasing could be an important target for future research.

The research sample ( N = 172, 83 men, 89 women) was created by quota sampling an adult Czech population. Morphological variables of the texts showing differences (M-W test) between the non-depressive and depressive groups were incorporated into predictive models. Results: Across all participants, the data best fit predictive models of depressivity using morphological characteristics from the informal text “letter from holidays” (Nagelkerke r ² = 0.526 for men and 0.670 for women). For men, models for the formal texts “cover letter” and “complaint” showed moderate fit with the data ( r ² = 0.479 and 0.435). The constructed models show weak to substantial recall (0.235—0.800) and moderate to substantial precision (0.571—0.889). Morphological variables appearing in the final models vary. There are no key morphological characteristics suitable for all models or for all genres. The resulting models’ properties demonstrate that they should be suitable for screening individuals at risk of depression and the most suitable genre is informal text (“letter from holidays”).

203,Psychological interventions for the fear of public speaking: A meta-analysis,"Background: Fear of Public Speaking (FoPS) or public speaking anxiety is a type of social anxiety and the single most commonly feared situation in the population. FoPS is disabling with negative occupational, academic, and social consequences, reported by up to one third of the population. FoPS in adolescence and adulthood is associated with an increased risk of developing generalized social anxiety disorder with further impairments. Since the last review on FoPS, a significant number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted assessing the effects of novel interventions with innovative modes of delivery. Objectives: The objectives of the present meta-analysis are to (1) examine the short and long-term effects of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS on FoPS and generalized social anxiety; (2) assess whether differences exist between technology-assisted modes of delivery (e.g., Internet-delivered therapies) and more traditional modes of delivering treatment (e.g., face-to-face therapies); (3) investigate whether differences in effect exist between theoretical frameworks; (4) inspect the differences in effect size between self-report measures and other measures (i.e., physiological and behavioral); (5) examine the effects of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS on secondary outcome measures (e.g., depression); and (6) investigate whether a “sleeper effect” is present for psychological interventions for FoPS and generalized social anxiety. Methods: The study investigates the effects of psychological interventions for FoPS through a quantitative meta-analysis of RCTs, using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 30 RCTs with 1,355 participants were included through systematic searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The majority of the studies investigated the effects of cognitive or behavioral interventions. Nearly half of the studies used active control groups (e.g., attention placebo), whereas the other half used passive (e.g., waitlist) controls. The overall effect of psychological interventions for FoPS across 62 interventions was 0.74 (Hedges g; 95% CI: 0.61–0.87) with low to moderate heterogeneity. No difference in effect was found across theoretical frameworks. The effects based on self-report measures were larger compared to physiological and behavioral outcomes. Effects were robust against both active and passive control groups. Furthermore, psychological interventions for FoPS had a small to moderate effect on generalized social anxiety disorder ( g = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.22–0.48). The effect of psychological interventions aimed at FoPS at follow-up was large ( g = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.90–1.31) and moderate to large for generalized social anxiety ( g = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59–0.80). A sleeper effect was found for cognitive and behavioral interventions, indicating that patients continued to improve after treatment termination. There were some indications of publication bias. Conclusions: Psychological interventions are effective in reducing FoPS. Interventions using technology-assisted modes of delivery are equally effective as traditional face-to-face interventions in reducing FoPS. This finding highlights an opportunity to increase access to evidence-based treatments through technology-delivered interventions, which can be implemented at schools, in primary care and specialist mental health care. Moreover, psychological interventions aimed at FoPS have an effect on generalized social anxiety. Further implications are discussed.

204,"Gender differences in generating cognitive reappraisals for threatening situations: Reappraisal capacity shields against depressive symptoms in men, but not women","Despite major research interest regarding gender differences in emotion regulation, it is still not clear whether men and women differ in their basic capacity to implement specific emotion regulation strategies, as opposed to indications of the habitual use of these strategies in self-reports. Similarly, little is known on how such basic capacities relate to indices of well-being in both sexes. This study took a novel approach by investigating gender differences in the capacity for generating cognitive reappraisals in adverse situations in a sample of 67 female and 59 male students, using a maximum performance test of the inventiveness in generating reappraisals. Participants’ self-perceived efficacy in emotion regulation was additionally assessed. Analyses showed that men and women did not differ in their basic capacity to generate alternative appraisals for anxiety-eliciting scenarios, suggesting similar functional cognitive mechanisms in the implementation of this strategy. Yet, higher cognitive reappraisal capacity predicted fewer depressive daily-life experiences in men only. These findings suggest that in the case of cognitive reappraisal, benefits for well-being in women might depend on a more complex combination of basic ability, habits, and efficacy-beliefs, along with the use of other emotion regulation strategies. The results of this study may have useful implications for psychotherapy research and practice.

205,"Facing anxiety, growing up. Trait emotional intelligence as a mediator of the relationship between self-esteem and university anxiety","The current study analyzed how trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) mediates the relationship between self-esteem and state anxiety and trait anxiety. The sample was composed of 153 undergraduate students from the University of Cádiz, Spain (71.9% women and 28.1% men). Students completed measures of self-esteem, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and trait EI. Mediation analyses were completed with three trait EI dimensions (EA, emotional attention; EC, emotional clarity; and MR, mood repair) as mediating variables, self-esteem as the independent variable, and state anxiety and trait anxiety as the dependent ones. Our results confirmed that self-esteem scores explained and predicted both, state and trait anxiety values (13% for state and 21% for trait anxiety). This explanatory capacity is increased by 8% when accounting for all trait EI dimensions. Considering state anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted through the increases in the levels of both, self-esteem and MR. Regarding trait anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted, in addition to an increment of self-esteem and MR values, by an increase of EC and a decrease of EA. Conversely, indirect effects revealed that higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse MR, which in turn would enhance both state and trait anxiety levels. Moreover, regarding trait anxiety higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse EC, therefore increasing trait anxiety levels. As shown, the negative association found between self-esteem and EA becomes a key element. The effect of self-esteem on EA and the influence that the latter had on EC and MR exerts an indirect mediated effect with the power to invert the influence that self-esteem wields on both types of anxiety. In this sense, the apparent protective role of self-esteem changed, turning into a risk factor that promotes higher anxiety values.

206,"The relationship between burnout, depression, and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Burnout is a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and reduced personal accomplishment. In the past years there has been disagreement on whether burnout and depression are the same or different constructs, as they appear to share some common features (e.g., loss of interest and impaired concentration). However, the results so far are inconclusive and researchers disagree with regard to the degree to which we should expect such overlap. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between burnout and depression. Additionally, given that burnout is the result of chronic stress and that working environments can often trigger anxious reactions, we also investigated the relationship between burnout and anxiety. Method: We searched the online databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar for studies examining the relationship between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, which were published between January 2007 and August 2018. Inclusion criteria were used for all studies and included both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, published and unpublished research articles, full-text articles, articles written in the English language, studies that present the effects sizes of their findings and that used reliable research tools. Results: Our results showed a significant association between burnout and depression ( r = 0.520, SE = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.492, 0.547) and burnout and anxiety ( r = 0.460, SE = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.421, 0.497). However, moderation analysis for both burnout–depression and burnout–anxiety relationships revealed that the studies in which either the MBI test was used or were rated as having better quality showed lower effect sizes. Conclusions: Our research aims to clarify the relationship between burnout–depression and burnout–anxiety relationships. Our findings revealed no conclusive overlap between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, indicating that they are different and robust constructs. Future studies should focus on utilizing more longitudinal designs in order to assess the causal relationships between these variables.

207,"Impact of place identity, self-efficacy and anxiety state on the relationship between coastal flooding risk perception and the willingness to cope","Inhabitants of coastal areas are constantly confronted with minor or major events such as storms, erosion or flooding. This article investigates the predictors of coping willingness among citizens exposed to coastal flooding. Coping can be defined as a set of cognitive and behavioral efforts to master, reduce or tolerate a given risk and these strategies are generally regrouped into two different categories: active coping strategies oriented toward the risk to reduce or master it, and passive coping strategies focused on the reduction of internal tensions such as anxiety or fear. In this paper, we focus especially on how place identity, perceived self-efficacy, anxiety-state and coastal flooding risk perception shape both active and passive coping willingness. Data were obtained from different areas at risk of coastal flooding located in France. The sample is composed of 315 adult participants (mean age = 47; SD = 15). Two competing models were tested using path modeling. We expected a direct relation between risk perception and the willingness to cope actively and that a higher perceived self-efficacy would increase active coping willingness. Concerning passive coping strategies, we expected that a higher anxiety-state increases passive coping willingness, and that place identity would act as a mediator and increases the relation between anxiety-state and passive coping willingness. Results suggest that place identity increased when the living place is threatened and that the use of passive coping strategies also increased. Also, we demonstrated a direct relation between risk perception and active coping willingness but it appeared that self-efficacy has no effect on this relation. Model fit indices suggest the good fit of our model and Bayesian model comparison reveals a very strong evidence of the best fit of this model compared to its saturated and independent equivalents.

208,"Personality traits and attitudes toward traffic safety predict risky behavior across young, adult, and older drivers","In the last few decades, several studies have investigated the role of personality traits and attitudes toward traffic safety in predicting driving behaviors in diverse types of drivers across several countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies so far have investigated the possible moderating role played by age in relation to predictors of accident risk. Answering this open question would provide information about the generalizability of the model across different subpopulations and would make possible the tailoring of the interventions to specific target groups. The study involved 1,286 drivers from three different age groups (young: n = 435; adult: n = 412; old: n = 439) which completed a questionnaire measuring drivers’ personality traits (i.e., anxiety, hostility, excitement seeking, altruism, normlessness), positive attitudes toward traffic safety, risky driving behaviors (i.e., errors, lapses, and traffic violations), accident involvement and number of traffic fines issued in the last 12 months. Multi-group Variance Based Structural Equation Modeling (VB-SEM) across the three age groups showed that the hypothesized model had a good fit with the data in all the three age groups. However, some pattern of relationships between the variables varied across the three groups, for example, if considering the direct effects of personality traits on risky driving behaviors, anxiety, altruism, and normlessness predicted violations only in young and adult drivers, whereas excitement seeking was associated with lapses only in young drivers; anxiety was a positive predictor of drivers’ errors, both in adult and older drivers, whereas excitement seeking predicted errors in adult and young drivers. On the other hand, attitudes significantly and negatively predicted violations and errors in all the three age groups, whereas they significantly and negatively predicted lapses only in young and older drivers. The results of the present study provided empirical basis to develop evidence-based road safety interventions differently tailored to the specific life’s stage of the drivers.

209,"Mindfulness and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population: The mediating roles of worry, rumination, reappraisal and suppression","The present study examined the effects of mindfulness on depression and anxiety, both direct and indirect through the mediation of four mechanisms of emotional regulation: worry, rumination, reappraisal and suppression. Path analysis was applied to data collected from an international and non-clinical sample of 1151 adults, including both meditators and non-meditators, who completed an online questionnaire battery. Our results show that mindfulness are related to lower levels of depression and anxiety both directly and indirectly. Suppression, reappraisal, worry and rumination all acted as significant mediators of the relationship between mindfulness and depression. A similar picture emerged for the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety, with the difference that suppression was not a mediator. Our data also revealed that the estimated number of hours of mindfulness meditation practice did not affect depression or anxiety directly but did reduce these indirectly by increasing mindfulness. Worry and rumination proved to be the most potent mediating variables. Altogether, our results confirm that emotional regulation plays a significant mediating role between mindfulness and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population and suggest that meditation focusing on reducing worry and rumination may be especially useful in reducing the risk of developing clinical depression.

210,Blue notes: Using songwriting to improve student mental health and wellbeing. A pilot randomised controlled trial,"Higher Education is a period of transition. Students try out identities, develop skills, and explore their shifting sense-of-self. Recent evidence suggests an increase in mental distress in this population, pressurising in-house support schemes. Therapeutic songwriting is a music therapy technique, which can reduce mental distress and improve social engagement in a range of clinical populations; yet it is also an accessible art form, possibly an ideal vehicle for supporting students in distress. This paper examines whether participation in a weekly songwriting program could make a suitable RCT to support wellbeing within the HE environment. We used a methodologically rigorous pre-registered parallel wait-list pilot RCT design. Trial registration: ISRCTN11180007. Participants self-identifying as stressed, anxious, or depressed, or with a pre-existing mental health condition, were randomly allocated to the experimental group (5 weeks, songwriting) ( n = 6) or to the wait-list control group (5 weeks, no intervention) ( n = 6). Measures were taken at baseline and at the start (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the intervention. Measures included: depression and anxiety scales, social identification, loneliness, and friendship. Change scores were calculated and a Mann–Whitney U revealed that depression levels in songwriters ( Mdn = -1.0) differed significantly from wait-list controls ( Mdn = 8.5) at T2, U = 5.00, z = -2.085, p &lt; 0.041, r = 2.66. Songwriters’ levels of social connection ( Mdn = 2.50) also differed significantly from wait-list controls ( Mdn = 3.00) at T2 U = 3.00, z = -2.441, p &lt; 0.015, r = 0.524. There were no other significant differences between control and intervention groups. A therapeutic songwriting intervention may have individual and group level benefits for a student population, alongside possible institutional benefits in student retention. Effects may be seen within depression and social connection metrics, and future RCTs should consider expanding measures for self-efficacy, social isolation, and wellbeing. This type of program illustrates a space for cost-effective, group, face to face additions institutional mental health support provision as part of a package of support for students.

211,"Interaction effects of life events and hair cortisol on perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents: Testing the differential susceptibility and diathesis-stress models","The differential susceptibility model and the diathesis-stress model on the interaction effect between the individuals’ traits and environmental factors will be conducive to understand in depth whether the psychophysiological traits are the risk factors of child development. However, there is no study focusing on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We examined whether the HPA activity serves as a physiological marker of the differential susceptibility model or the diathesis-stress model by exploring the interactive effect of life events and hair cortisol on perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. The participants were 324 students in senior high school. They reported their psychological states with questionnaires in their first semester after a 3-month adaptation period; 2 weeks later, they provided 1-cm hair segments closest to the scalp. We measured hair cortisol concentration as a biomarker of HPA activity using high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. There was a significant interaction effect of academic events and hair cortisol on adolescents’ perceived stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. We also observed a significant interaction between interpersonal events and hair cortisol on adolescents’ anxiety symptoms. Looking at the region of significance, proportion of interaction index, and proportion affected index, we found that adolescents with higher cortisol levels had a tendency to experience higher perceived stress and anxiety symptoms when they had high academic events scores, but lower perceived stress and anxiety symptoms when they had lower academic events scores. By contrast, adolescents with higher cortisol levels had a greater risk of experiencing high depressive symptoms only when they had higher academic events scores. Adolescents with higher cortisol levels also tended to have lower anxiety symptoms when they had higher interpersonal events scores, but greater anxiety symptoms when they had lower interpersonal events scores. These results suggested that HPA activity might serve as a biomarker of the differential susceptibility model for perceived stress and anxiety symptoms, while for depressive symptoms, it might serve as a marker of the diathesis-stress model.

212,Mediating effect of trait emotional intelligence between the Behavioral Activation System (BAS)/Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and positive and negative affect,"Gray (1970, 1981, 1987) proposed a behavioral motivation theory (Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory, RST), which describes the Behavioral Activation/Approach System (BAS) and the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). Some studies relate higher activation of BAS to positive affect, whereas BIS activation is linked to negative affect, particularly to high levels of anxiety and depression. Research data suggests that greater Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) influences optimal development of well-being and psychological adjustment, such as positive affective states. However, a recent study relates the motivational BIS/BAS systems with TEI, showing that high TEI is characterized by sensitivity to reward (BAS), and low TEI due to activation of the BIS system. The aim of this study was to explore how TEI may mediate the relationship between BIS/BAS sensitivity and positive and negative affect. Four-hundred and sixty-seven undergraduate students (385 females) were evaluated. TEI was evaluated with the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS). Affective states were measured with the Positive (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) Schedule, and BIS/BAS sensitivity was measured with The Sensitivity to Punishment (SP) and Sensitivity to Reward (SR) Questionnaire. The results reveal the influence of the two motivational systems on affective states, and show how this relationship is modified by and better explained through TEI. That is, a stronger approach to appetitive stimuli produces more positive affect, but a belief that one [does not] understand unpleasant emotions or that one analyzes them, or thinks that one cannot regulate or control emotions will reduce that positive state. Greater activation of inhibitory behaviors will produce greater negative affect, and this will increase when one perceives that one attends excessively to one's feelings or does not understand them or feels incapable of regulating them. Accordingly, although motivators could be a focus of interest for intervention, this study shows that the efficiency and profitability of these practical applications increases by adding TEI.

213,Identification of key genes and pathways in post-traumatic stress disorder using microarray analysis,"Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by impaired fear extinction, excessive anxiety, and depression. However, the potential pathogenesis and cause of PTSD are not fully understood. Hence, the purpose of this study was to identify key genes and pathway involved in PTSD and reveal underlying molecular mechanisms by using bioinformatics analysis. Methods: The mRNA microarray expression profile dataset was retrieved and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using GEO2R. Gene ontology (GO) was used for gene function annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway was performed for enrichment analysis. Subsequently, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis by the plugin MCODE were mapped by Cytoscape software. Finally, these key genes were verified in stress-exposed models by Real-Time quantitative (qRT-PCR). In addition, we performed text mining among the key genes and pathway with PTSD by using COREMINE. Results: A total of 1004 DEGs were identified. Gene functional annotations and enrichment analysis indicated that the most associated pathway was closely related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Using PPI network and module analysis, we identified a group of “seed” genes. These genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. In addition, text mining indicated that the altered CYP1A2, SYT1, and NLGN1 affecting PTSD might work via the Wnt signaling pathway. Conclusion: By using bioinformatics analysis, we identified a number of genes and relevant pathway which may represent key mechanisms associated with PTSD. However, these findings require verification in future experimental studies.

214,Understanding emotion inflexibility in risk for affective disease: Integrating current research and finding a path forward,"Emotion-related disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, eating, substance and some personality disorders) include some of the most common, burdensome, and costly diseases worldwide. Central to many, if not all of these disorders, may be patterns of rigid or inflexible emotion responses. Indeed, theorists point to emotion in-flexibility as a potential cause or maintaining factor in emotion-related diseases. Despite the increasing prominence of emotion inflexibility in theories of affective disease, a comprehensive review of the developing empirical literature has not yet been conducted. Accordingly, this review will examine the three dominant lines of inquiry assessing emotion flexibility. These include: (1) the capacity to use and vary deliberate emotion regulation strategies, (2) the context sensitivity of spontaneous emotional responses, and (3) flexibility in the appraisal of emotional events and experiences. Moreover, current evidence suggests that each of these three lines of research may converge to suggest the interplay of two key biological dimensions in emotion inflexibility, threat sensitivity, and cognitive control, known to be impaired in patients with affective disorders. In short, this developing body of work suggests a path by which future research could explicate and even exploit the ties between emotion inflexibility and affective disease, contributing to the development of improved models of risk, assessment, and intervention, with broad implications for psychological health.

215,Dyadic coping of kidney transplant recipients and their partners: Sex and role differences,"Background: Coping with stressful health issues—e.g., organ transplantation—can affect interpersonal relationships. Objective: The study examines individual and dyadic coping (DC) in kidney transplant recipients and their partners under consideration of sex and role differences. The Dyadic Coping Inventory allows analyzing partners’ perception of their own DC and also of their partner’s behavior and investigating different perspectives with three discrepancy indexes (similarity, perceived similarity, congruence). Methods: Fifty-six kidney transplant recipients and their partners completed self-report questionnaires ( N = 112) on DC, depression, anxiety, and relationship satisfaction. The average age of the patients was 58.1 years and of the partners 57.2 years; 64.3% of the patients were male; time since transplantation was on average 9.7 years. Results: (1) Individual and dyadic functioning: In couples with male patients female caregivers showed higher own supportive DC than the males. In couples with female patients, women reported higher own stress communication, supportive DC, total positive DC and total DC as well as depression compared to men. (2) Regarding the discrepancy indexes, in couples with male patients lower levels of similarity in DC reactions of the couple was associated with higher depression of the males as well as higher anxiety of the females. Moreover, lower comparability of the own DC with partner-perception was correlated with higher depression in males. In couples with female patients, higher comparability was associated with higher DC. Higher DC of the males was associated with lower own anxiety and better similarity in DC reactions. Lower levels of similarity of the male spouse showed correlations with higher depression and anxiety of the females. (3) Sex and role differences occurred. No significant differences between male patients and male partners occurred whereas female patients showed higher own stress communication, supportive DC, common DC, total positive DC, total DC and relationship satisfaction compared to female caregivers (role differences). The same differences were found comparing female with male patients. No differences occurred between male and female caregivers (sex differences). (4) Regarding male’s relationship quality, male’s DC total score and similarity index seem to be important predictors in couples with male patients. Discussion: The results demonstrate the relevance of DC in couples with kidney transplantation and show differences between males and females as well as between patients and partners.

216,Depression partially mediates the association between binge eating disorder and health-related quality of life,"Research has found that individuals with binge eating disorder (BED) report significantly worse health-related quality of life (HRQL) than those without eating disorders. Studies indicate that the association between BED and HRQL is largely accounted for by psychopathology (e.g., depression), rather than physiology [e.g., increased body mass index (BMI)]. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet investigated whether mental health symptoms could potentially mediate the relationship between BED and HRQL. To this aim, the present study compared a sample of adults who met DSM-5 criteria for BED ( n = 72) recruited from the community for a treatment trial and a community sample of individuals with no history of an eating disorder (NED; n = 79). Participants completed self-report measures of HRQL (Short-Form 6D), eating disorder psychopathology (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire), and anxiety and depressive symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory). Consistent with previous findings, the BED group reported significantly worse HRQL than the NED group after controlling for age, BMI, anxiety, depression, and eating disorder psychopathology. Moreover, depression partially mediated the relationship between BED diagnosis and HRQL. These results suggest that lessened HRQL may be partly explained by comorbid symptoms of depression in BED. Clinicians may find it helpful to specifically assess and treat depression in BED as a means of enhancing patients’ well-being. Future research should replicate these findings using longitudinal data that will allow for causal inferences.

217,"Tailoring self-help mindfulness and relaxation techniques for stroke survivors: Examining preferences, feasibility and acceptability","Objective: Studies on psychological techniques to reduce stroke-related anxiety and/or distress are limited. More scarce is research on tailoring such techniques to suit stroke survivors’ needs, including the needs of those with aphasia. To address this gap, we report two sequential studies. Study 1 explored preferred psychological techniques (i.e., mindfulness and relaxation) and ways to modify them for stroke survivors, including those with communication difficulties. Study 2 examined the feasibility and acceptability of these modified techniques with a new sample of survivors. Design: Mixed-methods using qualitative and quantitative approach in both studies. Participants: All participants were stroke survivors living in the community (Study 1: n = 13, median age = 61 years; Study 2: n = 38, median age = 67 years). Interventions and Procedures: Study 1: seven techniques representing commonly used types of mindfulness and relaxation were filmed on a professionally produced DVD. Participants feedback on how these techniques could be tailored to meet their needs, their preferences for techniques and reasons for likes and dislikes. Study 2: four favored techniques from study 1 were modified and re-filmed into a new DVD. A new group of participants were asked to practice them twice daily, five times a week for at least 4 weeks. They completed questionnaires at the start of the study (T1), returned approximately 4 weeks later completing the same measures ( n = 24 at T2). Focus group discussions/interviews were conducted at the end of T2 exploring the feasibility and acceptability of these techniques. Results: Four techniques were favored by participants in Study 1. After adaptation, these techniques were generally perceived as acceptable, user-friendly and beneficial to participants who participated in the focus groups /interviews in Study 2. A ‘once a day’ practice frequency could make practicing more feasible. Participants also preferred having choices- multiple techniques could be more useful than single technique. Conclusion: Tailoring psychological techniques for stroke survivors is beneficial. Tailored techniques in a self-help DVD format seemed feasible and acceptable, however, a less frequent practice would be easier for stroke survivors. Future studies should seek to recruit a more heterogenous sample as well as implementing strategies to increase the retention rate.

218,Executive control of emotional conflict,"Attentional networks and their interactions have been extensively studied through the Attentional Network Test for Interaction (ANTI). This task combines a spatial cueing paradigm with a flanker procedure and examines the efficiency and the interactions among the attentional networks (Alerting, Orienting and Executive control). However, the ANTI did not consider the effect of emotions on the attentional systems, although many studies have shown a relationship between emotion and Executive system. This study aims to analyze the executive system in an emotional context. We used a version of ANTI with arrows (ANTI-A) and an ANTI-Emotion (ANTI-E), where the arrows in the flanker task were replaced with neutral and threatening faces. One hundred and thirty-four university students performed both an ANTI-A and an ANTI-E. Results confirmed all the main effects and interactions for both the types of ANTI. Furthermore, the ANTI-E showed that the executive control of the conflict was harder when the target was neutral rather than when it was threatening. This difficulty in solving the flanker task could be due to the effect of distractors with a threatening valence. The ANTI-E could be allowed to verify how much attentional bias that characterizes people with emotional disorders (e.g., anxiety) may depend on altered executive control of the emotional conflict.

219,Internalizing profiles of homeless adults: Investigating links between perceived ostracism and need-threat,"Social ostracism among the homeless is a prevailing problem, yet few studies have focused on whether internalizing psychopathology moderates the links between feeling ostracized and perceiving threats to fundamental human needs. This study used a person-oriented approach to identify commonly occurring profiles of internalizing psychopathology characterized by symptoms of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression (Low, Medium, and High Internalizers) among homeless participants residing in London, United Kingdom ( N = 114; age range = 18–74; M age = 46; 25% women). Data on perceived ostracism (feeling ignored and daily discrimination) and need-threat (belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and feelings of control) was also collected. Controlling for the effects of age, living arrangement, gender, and time being homeless, feeling ignored was a significant predictor of need-threat, whereas daily discrimination was not. One significant interaction on the links between daily discrimination and need-threat emerged between Low and Medium Internalizers. For Medium Internalizers, high levels of daily discrimination were associated with high levels of need-threat. The effect was similar for High Internalizers and the opposite for Low Internalizers, though it was not significant within those groups. Taken together, these results indicate that differences in patterns of internalizing psychopathology should be taken into account when attempting to make homeless individuals feel more included in their surroundings.

220,Comparison of the video game functional assessment-revised (VGFA-R) and internet gaming disorder test (IGD-20),"Initially labeled as internet addiction in the mid-1990s (e.g., Griffiths, 1996; Young, 1996), researchers have since focused on how specific online activities result in negative consequences for those who overuse and have problems with online applications such as online gambling and online sex (Griffiths, 2000; Potenza, 2017). More recently, this has been applied to online problematic video game play, often used synonymously with terms such as online video game addiction, online gaming addiction, and Internet gaming disorder (IGD). With the publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), IGD was identified by the APA as warranting further study. The current proposed diagnostic criterion in the DSM-5 requires the presence of five of nine symptoms over a 12-month period. These include: (a) preoccupation or obsession with Internet games, (b) withdrawal symptoms when not playing Internet games, (c) an increasing need over time to spend more and more time playing video games, (d) failed attempts to stop or curb Internet gaming, (e) loss of interest in other activities such as hobbies, (f) continued overuse of Internet games even with knowledge of the impact of overuse on their life, (g) lying about extent of Internet game usage, (h) uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guilt, and (i) has lost or put at risk an opportunity or relationship because of Internet games (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). However, it is unclear if the disorder represents addiction to the internet or if IGD evaluates specific behaviors occurring within the context of the video gaming (Starcevic and Billieux, 2017; Young and Brand, 2017).

221,Emotional reactivity to incentive downshift in adult rats exposed to binge-like ethanol exposure during adolescence,"Alcohol use in adolescents is often characterized by binge-like ethanol consumption pattern, which is associated with long-term health consequences and even with important harms to his developing brain. Among this, ethanol exposure induces long-lasting alterations in anxiety-related neurobiological systems such as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or melanocortin system (MC). Recently, it has been demonstrated that adult rats exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure exhibited anxiogenic-like behavior. Given that it has been demonstrated that negative affective state is relevant to development of addictive behavior, it is tempting to suggest that increased risk of adult abusive alcohol use exhibited in rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence may be related with differences in anxiety-related behavior. We conducted a study investigating the emotional reactivity after a reward devaluation (12-to-1 pellet or 32-to-4% sucrose downshift) in adult rats exposed to binge-like ethanol exposure during adolescence. For this aim, adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ethanol (2.5 g/kg ip; AIE) or saline (AIS) for 2 consecutive days at 48-h intervals over a 14-day period (PND30-PND43). Following 25 free-ethanol days, adult rats were trained in consummatory and instrumental successive negative contrast task (cSNC and iSNC). Our data shows that both AIE and AIS groups exhibited suppression of the consummatory and instrumental behavior after reward devaluation relative to unshifthed control. Also, adult rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited a particularly strong negative affective state (lower sucrose consumption) with regards to the AIS group in the cSNC. This data demonstrated that adolescent binge-like ethanol exposure might trigger a greater emotional reactivity following incentive downshift, which might be linked to higher vulnerability to substance use disorder.

222,Stock market exposure and anxiety in a turbulent market: Evidence from China,"The stock market in China has experienced significant turbulence since July 2014, including a bull market. In this paper, we propose that exposure to stock (defined as the condition of being exposed to both stock and stock-related information) can induce anxiety disorder when the market is in a turbulent period. To examine this prediction, we designed two studies in which we operationalized exposure to stock in two different ways. In Study 1, a panel analysis of a longitudinal data set for the Chinese stock market from January 2014 to July 2015 demonstrated that exposure to stock had a significant positive impact on individuals’ anxiety disorder, even in a bull market. Study 2, employing priming experiments, further supported that a temporarily primed “stock mindset” subconsciously increased participants’ anxiety. In addition, Study 2 revealed that physical exercise helped attenuate the detrimental impact of exposure to stock on mental well-being. This research demonstrates the detrimental impact of exposure to a turbulent stock market—even a rising market—on individuals’ mental health. Furthermore, it identifies an effective way to buffer such impact, and suggests ways for social scientists to employ search engines and the related data sets to obtain psychological or behavioral information (especially emotions and emotion disorders) by examining longitudinal “Big Data.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2019
223,The role of experiential avoidance and parental control in the association between parent and child anxiety,"Parenting behavior and practices contribute to the intergenerational relationship between parent and child anxiety, with parental control being a consistent predictor of child anxiety. Parental experiential avoidance refers to how a parent copes with their internal world in the context of parenting. Little is known about how this relatively new parenting concept relates to child anxiety. The current study tested the indirect effect of parent anxiety on child anxiety through parental control and parental experiential avoidance; the indirect effect of parent anxiety on parental control through parental experiential avoidance; and the moderating effect of parental experiential avoidance on the relationship between parental control and child anxiety. Using a cross-sectional design, parents ( N = 85) from a community sample of 8–12-year-old children self-reported on a survey measuring parent anxiety, child anxiety, parental control, and parental experiential avoidance. A hierarchical regression indicated that parental experiential avoidance significantly predicted child anxiety and accounted for further variance in child anxiety, over, and above parental control. There was an indirect effect of parent anxiety on child anxiety through parental control and parental experiential avoidance. Parental experiential avoidance moderated the relationship between parental control and child anxiety, such that the relationship was only significant at high levels of parental experiential avoidance. The current study provides support for the role of parental experiential avoidance in an intergenerational understanding of anxiety. Future research should replicate the study with a clinical sample. Theoretical and practice implications are considered.

224,Riding the adolescence: Personality subtypes in young moped riders and their association with risky driving attitudes and behaviors,"The aim of the present study was to identify sub-types of moped riders based on a cluster analysis of specific personality characteristics (i.e., driving anger, anxiety, angry hostility, excitement-seeking, altruism, normlessness, and driving locus of control) within a large sample of Italian adolescents. The study had also the aim to compare the emerged sub-types of moped riders on measures of attitudes toward safe driving, risky driving behaviors (e.g., rule’s violations and speeding, not using helmet, drinking and driving, etc.), and self-reported tickets and accident involvement. One thousand two hundred seventy-three Italian high school students aged from 13 to 19 years (mean age = 15.43, SD = 0.98) with a valid driving license for moped participated to the study. Results revealed three sub-types of moped riders (namely risky, worried and careful moped riders), which differ significantly for risky driving behaviors, attitudes toward traffic safety, risk perception, and self-reported accident involvement. Importantly, the results of the present study showed that the personality and behavioral characteristics of the three sub-groups of moped riders substantially resembled those identified by previous studies with vehicle drivers of different ages; thus, empirically supporting the notion that certain combinations of personality characteristics are associated with risk driving tendencies and behaviors in both young moped riders and car drivers. Safe driving interventions can tackle risky driving beliefs and behavioral tendencies in young moped riders and car drivers by tailoring their messages according to the personality sub-types of the target groups.

225,Group metacognitive therapy for generalized anxiety disorder: A pilot feasibility trial,"Background: Individual metacognitive therapy (MCT) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is well established, but only one study has investigated the effectiveness of Group MCT (g-MCT) for GAD. The aim of the current study was therefore to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of g-MCT for GAD within a community mental health setting whilst addressing limitations evident in the previous study. Methods: The study used an open trial design, and 23 consecutively referred adults with GAD completed 10 sessions (90 min) of g-MCT, delivered by two therapists trained in MCT. Diagnoses were assessed by trained raters using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule-IV. All patients but one had previous psychosocial treatment, and 17 (73.9%) had at least one comorbid axis-I disorder. Self-reported symptoms were assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at pre- and post-treatment as well as 3-month follow-up. Feasibility was assessed using rates of patients who declined group treatment in favor of individual treatment, patients not able to attend due to pre-scheduled dates for sessions, and drop-out rate. Results: Of 32 eligible participants, six patients (19%) declined g-MCT in favor of individual MCT, and three (9%) were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. No patients dropped out during treatment, but two patients did not complete the self-report questionnaires at 3-month follow-up. g-MCT was associated with significant reductions in worry, anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs, and maladaptive coping. According to the standardized Jacobson criteria for recovery, 65.3% were recovered at post-treatment, whereas 30.4% were improved and 4.3% showed no change. At 3-month follow-up, the recovery rate increased to 78.3%. Moreover, recovery rates were comparable for patients with- and without comorbidity. Number of therapist hours per patient was 6.5 and the treatment has now been implemented as a standard treatment option at the clinic. Conclusion: g-MCT for GAD is an acceptable treatment which may offer a cost-effective alternative approach to individual MCT. Recovery rates and effect sizes suggested that g-MCT could be just as efficient as individual MCT and cognitive behavioral therapy.

226,Patients’ comprehension of mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy in an outpatient clinic for resistant depression: A cross-sectional study,"The current study investigated the comprehension of mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (MBCT) by patients with resistant depression at the Psychiatry Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was the first time the model was used in the institution to treat these patients. In this study, 45 patients were invited to participate in a baseline session of MBCT that consisted in the explanation of the model and experimental exercises conducted by two experienced therapists. Twenty eight patients accepted to participate. At the end of the intervention, the patients completed a self-administered questionnaire designed by our ambulatory to assess their understanding of the method’s goals. Patients with anxiety disorder was also accessed for group comparison. More than 75% of the patients rated the intervention as comprehensible and workable. Compared to patients with depression, patients with anxiety had a better understanding of the mindfulness framework (6.5%) and the meaning of cognitive behavioral therapy (17.6%). Patients that completed the intervention described the baseline session of MBCT as comprehensive and acceptable. These results may allow possible future developments in the practice of mindfulness as a treatment applicable in many condition and settings even in the Brazilian context.

227,Attitudes toward and familiarity with virtual reality therapy among practicing cognitive behavior therapists: A cross-sectional survey study in the era of consumer VR platforms,"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is an efficacious treatment for fear and anxiety and has the potential to solve both logistic issues for therapists and be used for scalable self-help interventions. However, VRET has yet to see large-scale implementation in clinical settings or as a consumer product, and past research suggests that while therapists may acknowledge the many advantages of VRET, they view the technology as technically inaccessible and expensive. We reasoned that after the 2016 release of several consumer virtual reality (VR) platforms and associated public acquaintance with VR, therapists’ concerns about VRET may have evolved. The present study surveyed attitudes toward and familiarity with VR and VRET among practicing cognitive behavior therapists ( n = 185) attending a conference. Results showed that therapists had an overall positive attitude toward VRET (pros rated higher than cons) and viewed VR as applicable to conditions other than anxiety. Unlike in earlier research, high financial costs and technical difficulties were no longer top-rated negative aspects. Average negative attitude was a larger negative predictor of self-rated likelihood of future use than positive attitude was a positive predictor and partially mediated the positive association between VRET knowledge and likelihood of future use, suggesting that promotional efforts should focus on addressing concerns. We conclude that therapist’s attitudes toward VRET appear to have evolved in recent years, and no longer appear to constitute a major barrier to implementing the next generation of VR technology in regular clinical practice.

228,Identifying predictors of stress and job satisfaction in a sample of merchant seafarers using structural equation modeling,"Background: Seafarers are amongst occupational groups with the highest risk for stress, a factor known to impact on mental health. Psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, suicide, and alcohol or drug dependence are recognized health problems within the maritime sector. The primary aim of this study was to identify which individual and occupational factors, known to impact on psychological functioning across the maritime industry and other sectors, best predict perceived stress and job satisfaction among a sample of merchant seafarers. Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted using a work experiences and attitudes questionnaire administered by a large shipping company to seafarers within their organization. Structural equation modeling was conducted using a proposed theoretical model of perceived stress and job satisfaction in a sample of merchant seafarers. Results: While the structural equation model produced acceptable fit to the sample data according to numerous goodness-of-fit statistics, the comparative fit index and Tucker-Lewis index results indicated less than satisfactory model fit. The model explained 23.8% of variance in the criterion variable of perceived stress, and the strongest predictive effect was for dispositional resilience. The model explained 70.6% of variance in the criterion variable of job satisfaction, and the strongest predictive effect was for instrumental work support. Conclusion: When addressing the psychosocial well-being of merchant seafarers, findings of this study suggest that dispositional resilience may be a particularly important factor with regards to perceived stress, while instrumental work support appears to be a critical factor in relation to job satisfaction. Importantly, however, an overall work environment that is perceived by employees as supportive, equal and just is a cornerstone for the psychosocial well-being of seafarers.

229,Evaluating the psychometric properties of the 7-item Persian Game Addiction Scale for Iranian adolescents,"The 7-item Gaming Addiction Scale (GAS) is a brief instrument based on DSM criteria to assess gaming addiction. Although the psychometric properties of the GAS have been tested using classical test theory, its psychometric properties have never been tested using modern test theory (e.g., Rasch analysis). The present study used a large adolescent sample in Iran to test the psychometric properties of the Persian GAS through both classical test and modern test theories. Adolescents ( n = 4442; mean age = 15.3 years; 50.3% males) were recruited from Qazvin, Iran. In addition to the GAS, all of them completed the following instruments: the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short Form (IGDS-SF9), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a generic quality of life instrument. Two weeks later, all participants completed the GAS again. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis were used to test the unidimensionality of the GAS. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to test the test-retest reliability, and a regression model was used to test the criterion-related validity of the GAS. Both CFA and Rasch analysis supported the unidimensionality of the GAS. Pearson correlations coefficients showed satisfactory test-retest reliability of the GAS ( r = 0.78 to 0.86), and the regression model demonstrated the criterion-related validity of the GAS (β = 0.31 with IGDS-SF9; 0.41 with PSQI). Based on the results, the Persian GAS is a reliable and valid instrument for healthcare providers to assess the level of gaming addiction among Persian-speaking adolescents.

230,Awareness of emotional expressions in cannabis users: An event-related potential study,"Cannabis use has been associated with anxiogenic effects when used in low frequency for a short duration, but cannabis can also have anxiogenic effects when used heavily for a long duration. Animal studies have indicated the neurobiological mechanisms related to cannabis and anxiety; however, research has been limited on the related neurocognitive mechanisms. Previous research has indicated that cannabis use is associated with alterations in event-related potentials (ERPs). The purpose of the current study was to examine anxiety related attentional processing of emotional expressions using ERP methods. We used a backward masking paradigm to restrict awareness of facial expressions (i.e., fearful, happy, and neutral). The results indicated that cannabis use was associated with differences in emotional processing. Specifically, the results suggested cannabis users had increased P1 amplitudes toward happy facial expressions compared to fearful and neutral. Additionally, cannabis users seemed to have reduced N170 hemisphere lateralization.

231,"Psychometric properties of the SAS, BAI, and S-AI in Chinese university students","Three widely-used self-report anxiety scales, including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the State Anxiety Inventory (S-AI), were used to simultaneously compare the psychometric properties via an item response theory (IRT) model with Chinese university students as the sample. Although these scales were probably to measure the same underlying construct, namely, anxiety, their psychometric properties were different. Results showed that the BAI’s measurement error was fewer than that of the other scales, with their anxiety severity ranging approximately from the 0.8 standard deviations below the mean to 3 standard deviations above the mean, while the S-AI’s measurement error was fewer than that of the other degrees of anxiety. The S-AI provided more information than the other scales when the student’s scale was less than approximately 0.8 standard deviations below the mean of anxiety severity. In general, the BAI showed better, for it provided more information than the other scales at the broadest range of anxiety severity. The SAS provided less information than the other scales at all anxiety severity range. In conclusion, BAI shows good psychometric quality. Finally, the three instruments were combined on a common scale by using IRT model and a conversion table was provided so as to achieve the transformation of each scale score.

232,Math anxiety in combination with low visuospatial memory impairs math learning in children,"Math anxiety impairs academic achievements in mathematics. According to the processing efficiency theory (PET), the adverse effect is the result of reduced processing capacity in working memory (WM). However, this relationship has been examined mostly with correlational designs. Therefore, using an intervention paradigm, we examined the effects of math anxiety on math learning. Twenty-five 5th graders underwent seven training sessions of multiplication over the course of 2 weeks. Children were faster and made fewer errors in solving trained problems than untrained problems after learning. By testing the relationship between math anxiety, WM, and math learning, we found that if children have little or no math anxiety, enough WM resources are left for math learning, so learning is not impeded. If they have high math anxiety and high visuospatial WM, some WM resources are needed to deal with math anxiety but learning is still supported. However, if they have high math anxiety and low visuospatial WM capacity, math learning is significantly impaired. These children have less capacity to learn new math content as cognitive resources are diverted to deal with their math anxiety. We conclude that math anxiety not only hinders children’s performance in the present but potentially has long-lasting consequences, because it impairs not only math performance but also math learning. This intervention study partially supports the PET because only the combination of high math anxiety and low WM capacity seems critical for hindering math learning. Moreover, an adverse effect of math anxiety was observed on performance effectiveness (response accuracy) but not processing efficiency (response time).

233,Brief metacognitive therapy for emotional distress in adult cancer survivors,"Background: Adult cancer survivors often experience substantial psychological morbidity following the completion of acute cancer treatment. Unfortunately, current psychological interventions are of limited efficacy. This study explored if metacognitive therapy (MCT); a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention was potentially efficacious and could be delivered effectively to adult cancer survivors with psychological morbidity. Methods: An open trial with 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluated the treatment effects of MCT in 27 consecutively referred individuals to a clinical psychology health service specializing in psycho-oncology. Each participant received a maximum of six 1-hour sessions of MCT. Levels of anxiety, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, post-traumatic stress symptoms, health related quality of life, and metacognitive beliefs and processes were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Results: MCT was associated with statistically significant reductions across all outcome measures which were maintained through to 6-month follow-up. In the ITT sample on the primary treatment outcome measure, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Total, 59% of participants met recovery criteria at post-treatment and 52% at 6-month follow-up, respectively. No participants significantly deteriorated. In the completer sample ( N = 20), 80% recovered at post-treatment and 70% at 6-month follow-up. MCT was acceptable to patients with approximately 75% of patients completing all treatment sessions. Conclusion: MCT, a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention can be delivered effectively to a heterogenous group of cancer survivors with promising treatment effects. Examining the efficacy of brief MCT against the current gold standard psychological intervention would be a valuable advance toward improving the quality of life of cancer survivors.

234,What lies beneath trait-anxiety? Testing the self-regulatory executive function model of vulnerability,"Vulnerability to psychological disorder can be assessed with constructs such as trait anxiety and neuroticism which among others are transdiagnostic risk factors. However, trait-anxiety and related concepts have been criticised because they don’t illuminate the etiological mechanisms of psychopathology. In contrast, the metacognitive (S-REF) model offers a framework in which metacognitive knowledge conceptualised in trait terms is part of a core mechanism underlying trait-anxiety and related constructs. The present study therefore set out to explore metacognitions as potential underlying factors in trait-anxiety (the propensity to depression and anxiety). Nine hundred and eighty two participants completed self-report measures of metacognitions and trait-anxiety at time 1, and 425 individuals completed the same measures 8 weeks later. At the cross-sectional level, metacognitions accounted for 83% of the variance in anxiety- and 64% of depression propensity. Furthermore, despite both domains of trait-anxiety showing high stability over time, negative- and positive metacognitive beliefs were significant prospective predictors of both domains of vulnerability. These findings suggests that metacognitive beliefs may be an underlying mechanism of vulnerability attributed to trait-anxiety with the implication that the metacognitive (S-REF) model informs conceptualization of psychological vulnerability, and that metacognitive therapy applications might be employed to enhance psychological resilience.

235,Identifying triggers of alcohol craving to develop effective virtual environments for cue exposure therapy,"Background: Many studies have indicated that alcohol craving is a core mechanism in the acquisition, maintenance, and precipitation of relapse in alcohol use disorder (AUD). A common treatment approach in AUD is cue exposure therapy (CET). New technologies like virtual reality (VR) have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of CET by creating realistic scenarios in naturalistic environments. In this study, we aimed to determine relevant triggers of alcohol craving in patients with AUD. Methods: We enrolled 75 outpatients diagnosed with AUD according to the DSM-5 criteria Participants completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test and a self-administered questionnaire to assess alcohol craving. The variables included in the craving questionnaire were as follows: presence of others, situations, time of the day, day of the week, mood, and type of alcoholic beverage. Results: Greater levels of alcohol craving were seen in many situations, including being at a party, in a restaurant, in a bar or pub, and at home. Drinking alone and drinking with two or more friends were equally associated with higher levels of craving. Drinking at night and drinking at weekends also emerged as triggers for alcohol craving. Emotional states like anxiety or tension, sadness, stress, frustration, or irritability were highly associated with urges to drink alcohol. The alcoholic drinks most highly associated with increased levels of craving were beer, wine, and whisky. Gender and age implications were discussed. Conclusion: This study is part of a larger project aiming to develop and validate CET based on VR technology for patients with AUD who are resistant to classical treatment. The identified triggers have been used to develop relevant VR environments for CET, and further research is ongoing to implement our findings.

236,Evaluation of a mindfulness-based intervention with and without virtual reality dialectical behavior therapy® mindfulness skills training for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in primary care: A pilot study,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a very prevalent disorder in primary care (PC). Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone ( B = -5.70; p &lt; 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI + VR DBT® Mindfulness skills ( B = -4.38; p &lt; 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts.

237,Health outcomes associated with internalizing problems in early childhood and adolescence,"Physical and mental health problems are becoming more common among the general population. Studies examining mental and physical health often indicate that mental illness early in life is associated with more detrimental health outcomes later. However, additional work is needed to better identity which psychological problems may contribute to poorer health outcomes. Given recent increases in childhood anxiety and depression specifically, it is beneficial to further investigate the relationship between internalizing problems, both early and later in life, and related health problems. Furthermore, little work has focused on studying internalizing problems in children as young as preschool-aged. Therefore, the current project used a longitudinal design to assess the effects of preschool and adolescent internalizing problems on health-related problems in adolescence. We analyzed data from 70 youth (47% male) who had been tested in our lab when they were 5 years old and then were administered questionnaires over a telephone interview when they were adolescents, between the ages of 12 and 20 years old. We used multi-informant measures, including parent-report at age 5 and youth-report at follow-up, 7 to 15 years later. Parents reported on children’s internalizing behavior problems and negative emotionality (NE). Youth reported on their own internalizing behavior problems as well as health problems, physical activity, and overeating behaviors. Path modeling was used to examine predictions of internalizing and health behaviors. At age 5, parent-reported NE and internalizing problems were related, in addition to 5-year-old internalizing predicting health problems and overeating at follow-up. At follow-up, youth-reported internalizing was positively related to health problems and negatively related to physical activity, suggesting some similarities and differences between parent and youth responses. Additionally, girls reported significantly higher rates of internalizing and health problems at follow-up. These results indicate a significant relationship between preschool-aged and adolescent internalizing problems and related health outcomes experienced in adolescence.

238,Dispositional affect as a moderator in the relationship between role conflict and exposure to bullying behaviors,"Stressors in the work environment and individual dispositions among targets have been established separately as antecedents and risk factors of workplace bullying. However, few studies have examined these stressors in conjunction in order to determine personal dispositions among targets as possible moderators in the work stressor–bullying relationship. The aim of the present study was to examine multiple types of dispositional affect among targets as potential moderators in the relationship between role conflict and exposure to bullying behaviors, employing two independent cross-sectional samples. The first sample comprised 462 employees from a Norwegian sea transport organization, where trait anger and trait anxiety were included moderators. The second sample was a nationwide probability sample of the Norwegian working population and comprised 1,608 employees randomly drawn from The Norwegian Central Employee Register, where positive and negative affect were included moderators. The results showed that trait anger, trait anxiety, and negative affect strengthened the positive relationship between role conflict and reports of bullying behaviors. Positive affect did not moderate this relationship. We conclude that the association between role conflict and bullying is particularly strong for those scoring high on trait anger, trait anxiety, and negative affect.

However, less is known about the relationships of state anxiety or everyday stress with WM performance in non-clinical populations. We investigated the associations between these two factors and three WM composites (verbal WM, visuospatial WM, and n-back updating performance) in a large online sample of non-depressed US American adults. We found a trend for a negative association between WM performance and anxiety, but not with stress. Thus, WM performance appears rather robust against normal variation in anxiety and everyday stress.

240,Shifting instead of drifting – improving attentional performance by means of the attention training technique,"Background: The Attention Training Technique (ATT) as part of Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) has shown to be a promising treatment element for several psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. ATT predicts improvements of the ability to shift attention away from internal and non-relevant stimuli (e.g., ruminative thoughts) toward the relevant stimuli and aims to increase attentional flexibility and control. The current study investigated the impact of the Attention Training Technique on attentional performance. Methods: Eighty-five healthy participants (29 in two doses ATT, 28 in four doses ATT and 28 in the control group; 18–37 years of age) were administered a test battery for attentional performance before and after an intervention of two doses ATT (23 min duration) vs. four doses of ATT (46 min duration) vs. a control condition (non-intervention audio file via headphones. The test battery measured selective attention, inhibition, working memory, and attentional disengagement and comprised the following tasks: dichotic listening, attentional bias, attentional network, stroop, 2-back and a 3-back. Results: After ATT (both two and four doses), reaction time during dichotic listening was significantly faster compared to the control condition. Furthermore, reaction time to neutral stimuli in the attentional bias task was faster after four-doses ATT compared to two doses ATT and the control condition. We found a trend toward a reduced stroop effect for both ATT conditions compared to control group. There were no effects of ATT with regard to the attentional network task, the 2-back or the 3-back task. Conclusion: This first empirical evidence suggests that ATT promotes specific attentional flexibility in healthy participants. Based on the same mechanism, ATT may have beneficial effects on attentional performance in clinical populations and might be a promising tool in both healthy and clinical participants.

241,Adverse behavioral changes in adult mice following neonatal repeated exposure to pain and sucrose,"Sucrose is recommended for the treatment of pain during minor procedures in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and is currently used worldwide as the standard of care. We recently reported that adult mice repetitively exposed to sucrose compared to water during the first week of life, irrespective of exposure to an intervention, had significantly smaller brain volumes in large white matter, cortical and subcortical structures (e.g., hippocampus, striatum, fimbria). These structures are important for stress regulation and memory formation. Here, we report the effects of repeated neonatal exposure to pain and sucrose on adult behavior in mice. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice ( N = 160, 47% male) were randomly assigned to one of two treatments (sucrose, water) and one of three interventions (needle-prick, tactile, handling). Pups received 10 interventions daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P6. A single dose of 24% sucrose or water was given orally 2 min before each intervention. At adulthood (P60-85) mice underwent behavioral testing to assess spatial memory, anxiety, motor function, pain sensitivity, and sugar preference. We found that mice that had received sucrose and handling only, had poorer short-term memory in adulthood compared to water/handling controls ( p &lt; 0.05). When exposed to pain, mice treated with repetitive sucrose or water did not differ on memory performance ( p = 0.1). A sugar preference test showed that adult mice that received sucrose before an intervention as pups consumed less sugar solution compared to controls or those that received water before pain ( p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant group differences in anxiety, motor, or pain sensitivity. In a mouse model that closely mimics NICU care, we show for the first time that memory in adulthood was poorer for mice exposed to pain during the first week of life, irrespective of sucrose treatment, suggesting that sucrose does not protect memory performance when administered for pain. In the absence of pain, early repetitive sucrose exposure induced poorer short-term memory, highlighting the importance of accurate pain assessment.

242,Investigating the effects of inhibition training on attentional bias change: A simple Bayesian approach,"Attention bias modification (ABM), in which participants are trained to direct attention away from negative information, has been shown to reduce anxiety. However, such findings have been inconsistent. Changes in attentional bias are often absent, suggesting need for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of ABM, as well as better statistical methods to analyze ABM data in order to reduce inferential error. In this study, we (a) compared inhibition control training to standard ABM training conditions, and (b) demonstrated the benefits of using simple Bayesian analyses to analyze ABM data. We recruited 116 participants and assessed their attentional bias prior to and after training, which involved practice avoiding negative stimuli, attending to negative stimuli, or avoiding a non-emotional, exogenous attentional cue (inhibitory control training). Our results suggested no impact of any of the training conditions on attentional bias. We further demonstrate Bayesian analyses may help control for both Type I and Type II error relative to a frequentist approach.

243,A longitudinal study of eating rituals in patients with anorexia nervosa,"Background: Eating rituals are any problematic behaviors involving food. They are usually observed in patients with anorexia nervosa, but research into these behaviors and their role in treatment outcomes is lacking. Objective: We set out to assess the presence of eating rituals in patients with anorexia nervosa treated by means of intensive enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT-E), in addition to their change over time and role as potential predictors of treatment outcome. Materials and Methods: Ninety adult female inpatients with anorexia nervosa were recruited. The Participants’ body mass index (BMI), and scores for Starvation Symptoms Inventory (SSI), Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were recorded, and a purpose-designed 9-item checklist of eating rituals was completed by trained dieticians during assisted eating—an integral part of the ICBT-E. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used at admission to identify the presence of coexisting axis I psychiatric disorders. All other tests were administered at baseline (admission), the end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. BMI, EDE, and BSI were also re-administered after 4 weeks of treatment in order to examine how refeeding affects these variables. Results: We found a correlation at baseline between eating rituals and both general and eating-disorder psychopathology scores. Eating rituals were also associated with the presence of at least one comorbid anxiety disorder. ICBT-E treatment was associated with a significant reduction in eating rituals, as well as a significant increase in BMI and improved eating-disorder and general psychopathology. However, our most relevant finding was that neither baseline eating ritual scores nor their change during treatment was associated with either BMI or general or eating-disorder psychopathology scores taken at either the end of therapy or at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: Neither the presence of nor change in eating rituals influence treatment outcomes in patients with anorexia nervosa.

244,Gender differences regarding the impact of math anxiety on arithmetic performance in second and fourth graders,"The development of math skills is crucial for adequate functioning in academic and professional settings as well as in daily life. A factor that has been shown to negatively influence performance and acquisition of math skills is math anxiety. With the high prevalence of math anxiety in society and the long lasting effects on math performance, it is important to study the relation between math anxiety and math performance in young children. Since math anxiety is often more pronounced in women than in men, it is essential to take the effect of gender into account. While the effect of gender on the relation between math anxiety and math performance has been studied in adults and adolescents, less research has focused on children, especially children at young ages. To fill this gap, the current study examined how the relation between math anxiety and math performance differed between boys and girls in early elementary school years. Math anxiety and math performance was assessed in 124 second- and fourth-grade children (67 girls and 57 boys). Although boys and girls showed more or less equal levels of math anxiety and performed similarly at the arithmetic task, correlation analyses showed that only in girls, math anxiety significantly correlated with math performance. Analyses investigating if math anxiety moderated the effect of gender and grade on math performance revealed significant differences between boys and girls. Higher levels of math anxiety only significantly and negatively moderated math performance in girls, with the greatest effect observed in 2nd grade girls. These findings highlight the importance of taking gender differences into account when studying the effect of math anxiety. The results showed that math anxiety is already negatively linked to math performance in girls as early as second grade. The present findings emphasize the importance of the early identification and remediation of math anxiety in girls to prevent long lasting effects. Possible causes for the gender related differences will be discussed.

245,The assessment of trait emotional intelligence: Psychometric characteristics of the TEIQue-Full Form in a large Italian adult sample,"Trait Emotional Intelligence (or trait emotional self-efficacy) is a constellation of emotional perceptions assessed through questionnaires and rating scales (Petrides et al., 2007b). This paper examined the psychometric features of the Trait Emotional Questionnaire Full Form (TEIQue-FF; Petrides, 2009b) in the Italian context. Incremental validity in the prediction of depression and anxiety was also tested with respect to the Big Five. Participants were 1343 individuals balanced for gender (690 females and 653 males) whose mean age was 29.65 years ( SD = 13.64, range 17–74 years). They completed a questionnaire battery containing the TEIQue and measures of the Big Five, depression, and anxiety (both trait and state). Results indicated that the performance of the TEIQue-FF in the Italian context was comparable to the original United Kingdom version as regards its reliability and factor structure. Moreover, the instrument showed incremental validity in the prediction of depression and state-trait anxiety after controlling for the Big Five.

246,A clinical-psychological perspective on somatization among immigrants: A systematic review,"Background: Somatic and psychopathological conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and somatization) are frequent among immigrants belonging to various ethnic groups. Worldwide findings on the epidemiology regarding specific mental conditions still vary with respect to different migration samples and migration contexts. This inconsistency also holds true in the incidence of somatization among migrants. We carried out a systematic review analyzing the relationship between migration and somatization by providing a qualitative data synthesis of original research articles on the topic. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of the literature on PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The articles were selected using multiple combinations of relevant search terms (e.g., defined somatization and related disorders, and migration status). Each database was searched systematically from January 2000 to December 2017. Results: The initial search identified 338 records, of which 42 research reports met the predefined inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Most studies ( n = 38; 90%) were cross-sectional. The main findings of this study are that migrants with somatization exhibited more psychological distress, had an increased perceived need for healthcare service utilization, and reported more post-migration living difficulties and/or post-traumatic stress disorder than those without somatization. It was also found that specific individual features mediate the association between somatization and migration. The prevalence and correlates of somatization were found to vary across the immigrant groups, depending on cultural variation in reasons for migration, stress exposure, explanatory models of illness, coping, and other individual variables. Conclusion: Somatization is a challenge for health professionals due to its vague nature. In this regard, clinical management of immigrant patients should include further efforts to address emotional distress, with special attention to social, cultural, and linguistic differences.

247,The Academic Anxiety Inventory: Evidence for dissociable patterns of anxiety related to math and other sources of academic stress,"Anxiety about mathematics can have detrimental effects on performance and understanding, yet little research has investigated how math anxiety is related to other types of anxiety. Here we develop the Academic Anxiety Inventory (AAI), an efficient and valid self-report measure designed to test math anxiety, as well as differentiate anxiety associated with mathematics from other contributions of anxiety across various academic domains. In Study 1, we isolated items that independently measure each domain of anxiety, reducing the overlapping variance between math anxiety and other constructs, and determining which components can or cannot be differentiated. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that the AAI is consistent and reliable for undergraduate and adolescent populations. In Study 3, anxiety-related performance deficits in a high school math class were associated with scores the AAI-Math subscale. In Study 4, the AAI-Math subscale was associated with perceptions of increased mathematical complexity, decreased estimations of accuracy, and increased negative emotion when participants viewed mathematical expressions. Across four studies, we demonstrate the AAI is a reliable and valid measure of math anxiety and other domains of academic anxiety, providing an efficient questionnaire to determine areas in which students may require extra support in order to reach their full potential.

248,Psychoanalysis and affective neuroscience. The motivational/emotional system of aggression in human relations,"This article highlights the evolutionary biological epistemology in Freud psychoanalytic theory. The concepts of aggressive and sexual drives are cornerstones of the psychoanalytic epistemological system, concerning the motivational/emotional roots of mental functioning. These biological roots of mental functioning, especially with regard to aggressive drive, have gradually faded away from psychoanalytic epistemology, as we show in this article. Currently, however, Neurosciences, and in particular Affective Neuroscience (Panksepp, 1998), can help us to have a better understanding of the biological roots of human mental functioning. The motivational/emotional systems studied by Affective Neuroscience can give a new epistemological foundation to the aggressive drive concept in psychoanalytic theory. Over the course of human evolution, motivational/emotional systems have played a role in social relationships and also in mental functioning. In this regard, among the various types of aggression (ANGER in Panksepp taxonomy 1998) that we consider in our article, inter-male aggression, also named Dominance motivational/emotional system , is that which regulates social interactions between sexually matured adults. This type of aggression acts in complementary connection with FEAR motivational/emotional system that regulate submissive behavior and social defeat, and the latter one is of the more important stressors. The interaction between aggression and FEAR motivational/emotional systems gives rise to agonistic behavior or dominance/submission motivational/emotional system, as we propose in our article. There is now a large literature that identifies in the dynamic of Competitive behavior , which is one of the main factors of mental illness. When social interactions activate the competitive behavior, the subject can perceive himself as “destined to victory” or “destined to defeat,” activating either behaviors or emotions connected to the Involuntary Defeat Strategy or Involuntary Dominant Strategy (Sloman, 2002), which we can find in many types of mental disorders, for example, mood disorders or anxiety disorders.

249,"The more similar, the healthier: The effect of perceived parent-child facial resemblance on parental physical health","Parent-child facial resemblance (PCFR) is one of the direct cues used to assess the genetic relationship between two individuals. Due to the inner fertilization of humans, fathers are liable to suffer from paternal uncertainty. When a father perceives low father-child facial resemblance, he would become anxious, which is detrimental to his immune system and physical health. For a mother, however, she can assure her genetic relationship to her children and does not need any external cues to verify her maternity. Thus, the mother-child facial resemblance does not influence the mothers’ physical health. To test these hypotheses, we examined the moderating effect of parental gender and the mediating effect of trait anxiety on the relationship between PCFR and physical health of parents. The results showed that fathers’ PCFR positively predicted their physical health, whereas the mothers’ PCFR failed to show any predicting effect on mothers’ physical health. Furthermore, trait anxiety mediated the relationship between fathers’ PCFR and their physical health. The implications for paternal uncertainty, gender difference, and public policy were discussed.

250,Psychopathology factors that affect the relationship between body size and body dissatisfaction and the relationship between body dissatisfaction and eating pathology,"Although high body mass index (BMI) alone does not invariably lead to body dissatisfaction (BD) and BD alone does not invariably lead to eating pathology (EP), research has suggested that there are clear relationships between each predictor and its respective criterion. We have a limited understanding of the factors that explain why some women at higher risk for BD (because of their BMI) do not report being dissatisfied with their bodies and why some women who are highly dissatisfied, do not engage in pathological eating behaviors. The present study examined such factors. A university sample of New Zealand women ( N = 166) completed the Personality Assessment Inventory (Morey, 1991) and questionnaires measuring BD and EP. The tendency to report lower BD than would be predicted by one’s BMI, and the tendency to report lower EP than would be expected based on one’s BD, were characterized by lower overall distress (i.e., lower levels of anxiety and depression) and greater mood stability compared to those who followed the predicted outcome. Greater understanding of the factors that protect high-risk women from BD and EP may contribute to prevention and intervention strategies.

In the original article, there was a mistake in Figure 1 and Figure 2 as published. The coefficients for the effects of the experimental intervention condition on thought related test anxiety were mistakenly reported as negative even though the coefficients for these effects are positive. The corrected Figure 1 and Figure 2 appear in the erratum. Because of the error mentioned above, a correction has been made to the Results, Model 1: Combined Analyses. A correction has also been made to the Results, Model 2: Differential Analyses. These corrections are explained in the corrigendum, and the original article has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-08619-001). Background and Objectives: Test anxiety can have undesirable consequences for learning and academic achievement. The control-value theory of achievement emotions assumes that test anxiety is experienced if a student appraises an achievement situation as important (value appraisal), but feels that the situation and its outcome are not fully under his or her control (control appraisal). Accordingly, modification of cognitive appraisals is assumed to reduce test anxiety. One method aiming at the modification of appraisals is inquiry-based stress reduction. In the present study ( N = 162), we assessed the effects of an inquiry-based short intervention on test anxiety. Design: Short-term longitudinal, randomized control trial. Methods: Focusing on an individual worry thought, 53 university students received an inquiry-based short intervention. Control participants reflected on their worry thought ( n = 55) or were distracted ( n = 52). Thought related test anxiety was assessed before, immediately after, and 2 days after the experimental treatment. Results: After the intervention as well as 2 days later, individuals who had received the inquiry-based intervention demonstrated significantly lower test anxiety than participants from the pooled control groups. Further analyses showed that the inquiry-based short intervention was more effective than reflecting on a worry thought but had no advantage over distraction. Conclusions: Our findings provide first experimental evidence for the effectiveness of an inquiry-based short intervention in reducing students’ test anxiety.

252,A descriptive mixed-methods analysis of sexual behavior and knowledge in very young children assessed for sexual abuse: The ASAC study,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a worldwide problem with serious consequences. We hypothesized that worrisome sexual behavior and knowledge would frequently be reported in children assessed after CSA. We therefore investigated (A) what types of sexual behaviors and knowledge were reported by parents of young children assessed for CSA; (B) in what cases such behaviors and knowledge were worrisome; and (C) how such children responded verbally and non-verbally during child interviews. We conducted a mixed-methods study, including qualitative inductive content analysis and quantitative analysis. It included 125 children (76 boys, 60.8%; median age 3.3 years, age range 0–11), all involved in the Amsterdam sexual abuse case (ASAC) and examined for highly suspected ( n = 71) or confirmed CSA ( n = 54). We identified themes from (1) the parent reports: sexual behavior (e.g., self-stimulation, touching others, imitation of sexual acts), fears and anxiety with regard to sexuality, and sexual utterances (sexual slang, references to sexual acts); and (2) the child interviews: behavioral reactions (avoidance, distractive behaviors), emotional reactions (anger, aggression), and verbal reactions (conspicuous utterances, refusal to talk about specific subjects). In 37% of the children the sexual behavior was deemed worrisome or very worrisome. Clinicians who assess children for CSA are advised to focus in particular on sexual behavior problems and inappropriate sexual knowledge.

According to the literature review, it seems that there is an important association between psychosocial factors, in particular on a cognitive level and disease progression. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize recent literature looking at the associations between psychosocial and neurocognitive factors and HCV. Methods: PubMed/Medline was systematically searched for psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with hepatitis C, treatment adherence, and patient wellbeing. Results: Patients present with a range of extrahepatic symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction. HCV’s impact on quality of life and wellbeing has serious clinical and social implications. Conclusion: Hepatitis C and its management continue to have a profound impact on health and psychologic wellbeing. Considering the serious extrahepatic implications for individuals, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay close attention to psychosocial and neurocognitive factors. The focus on combined clinical approaches could enhance understanding about the health and social impacts of hepatitis C along the life course.

254,The mediating effect of specific social anxiety facets on body checking and avoidance,"Objective: Body checking (BC) and avoidance (BA) form the behavioral component of body image disturbance. High levels of BC/BA have often been documented to hold a positive and potentially reinforcing relationship with eating pathology. While some researchers hypothesize, that patients engage in BC/BA to prevent or reduce levels of anxiety, little is known about the mediating factors. Considering the great comorbidity between eating disorders (ED) and in particular social anxieties, the present study investigated whether socially relevant types of anxiety mediate the relationship between eating pathology and BC/BA. Methods: 83 participants reporting an eating disorder and 323 healthy participants (14–25 years) took part in an online survey. Eating pathology was measured with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and Body Checking and Avoidance Questionnaire. Trait and social anxiety were assessed by means of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) and the Social Appearance and Anxiety Scale (SAAS). Separate mediation analyses were carried out with eating pathology as independent variable, BC/BA as dependent variable and STAI, FNE, and SAAS as mediating variables. Results: Anxieties correlated highly positive with eating pathology in both groups. SAAS mediated the relationship between ED pathology and BC/BA in participants with ED and mediated the relationship between ED pathology and BA in healthy participants. FNE mediated the relationship between eating pathology and BA for participants with eating pathology. Discussion: SAAS mediated the relationship between eating pathology and BC/BA. Being afraid of bodily evaluations may represent a particular relevant fear that triggers safety behaviors.

In the original article, there were some errors in the Title, Abstract, paragraph five of the Introduction section, and paragraph two of the Materials and Methods section.

Additionally, there was an error in the Materials and Methods. The number of gay men should be “98” and the number of lesbian women should be “84.” The necessary corrections have been made to the original article.] In this study we sought to compare eating disorder attitudes and behaviors, and proneness to an eating disorder (“ED proneness”), between gay men, lesbian women, and transgender and non-conforming (TGNC) adults. A further aim was to identify and compare risk and protective factors, and examine a mediational model based on the interpersonal theory of eating disorders (IPT-ED), whereby the association between interpersonal factors and ED proneness would be mediated by psychological constructs pertaining to the self and negative affect. Data was obtained from a larger national study of health risk and protective factors among sexual minority and gender diverse populations. The sample included 97 gay men, 82 lesbian women, and 138 TGNC adults. Participants completed the National College Health Assessment, Eating Disorders Screen for Primary Care, Patient Health Questionnaire Depression scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 scale, Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, Negative Social Exchange subscale of the Multidimensional Health Profile, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, and Perceived Stigma Scale. There was a significant difference between groups in ED proneness, with lesbian women (66.7%) having a significantly higher percentage than gay men (47.6%). There was also a significant difference between groups in weight-based self-worth, with the lowest percentage in gay men (63%) and the highest percentage in lesbian women (82%), as well as dissatisfaction with eating patterns, with the highest percentage in TGNC adults (69.8%) and the lowest percentage in gay men (47.7%). There was a low percentage of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, with no significant difference between groups. Logistic regression analyses showed that the predictor variables of ED proneness were depression, perceived stigma, and self-compassion in gay men; depression in lesbian women; and self-compassion in the TGNC adults. Mediation analyses showed that thwarted belongingness (i.e., an unmet to belong) and perceived stigma had an indirect association with ED proneness that was mediated by self-compassion and depression (for perceived stigma alone) in gay men, depression in lesbian women, and self-compassion in TGNC adults. The interpersonal theory of eating disorders therefore extends to sexual minority and gender diverse populations; however, the results suggest a broadening of theoretical models and intervention programs to include the role of stigma and self-compassion.

256,"Qualitative analysis of emotional distress in cardiac patients from the perspectives of cognitive behavioral and metacognitive theories: Why might cognitive behavioral therapy have limited benefit, and might metacognitive therapy be more effective?","Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alleviates emotional distress in mental health settings, but has only modest effects in cardiac patients. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) also alleviates depression and anxiety in mental health settings and is in its initial stages of evaluation for cardiac patients. Aim: Our objective is to compare how CBT and MCT models conceptualize cardiac patients' distress, and to explore why CBT has had limited benefit for cardiac patients and whether MCT has the potential to be more efficacious. Method: Forty-nine cardiac rehabilitation patients, who screened positively for anxiety and/or depression, provided semi-structured interviews. We analyzed transcripts qualitatively to explore the “fit” of patients' accounts of their distress with the main elements of cognitive behavioral and metacognitive theories. Four illustrative cases, representative of the diverse presentations in the broader sample, were analyzed in detail and are presented here. Results: Conceptualizing patients' distress from the perspective of CBT involved applying many distinct categories to describe specific details of patients' talk, particularly the diversity of their concerns and the multiple types of cognitive distortion. It also required distinction between realistic and unrealistic thoughts, which was difficult when thoughts were associated with the risk or consequences of cardiac events. From the perspective of MCT a single category—perseverative negative thinking—was sufficient to understand all this talk, regardless of whether it indicated realistic or unrealistic thoughts, and could also be applied to some talk that did not seem relevant from a CBT perspective. Discussion: Conceptualizing distress from the perspective of CBT presents multiple, diverse therapeutic targets, not all of which a time-limited therapy would be able to address. Given the difficulty of identifying them as unrealistic or not, thoughts about disease, death or disability may not be amenable to classic CBT techniques such as reality testing. MCT proved more parsimonious and, because it did not distinguish between realistic and unrealistic thoughts, might prove a better fit to emotional distress in cardiac patients.

296,Effectiveness of a School-Based Intervention on the Students' Mental Health After Exposure to War-Related Trauma.,"Background After the war, which was conducted against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among children and adolescents has increased. The counselling department at the Ministry of Education in the Gaza Strip applied a counselling program in schools in order to alleviate the effect of exposure to war. The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the counselling program after exposure to war-traumatic events among Palestinian children and adolescents in the Gaza Strip.
 Methods The sample consists of 572 students aged 12-18 years old. Of them, 331 (57.9%) were female and 241 (42.1%) were male. Traumatic events were measured by War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh). PTSD was measured by the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS). Anxiety symptoms were adapted from The Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and depression symptoms were measured by Child Depression Inventory. Repeated measures design was employed as the counselling program was applied in all the schools at the same time. Specifically, the data were collected from the participants before the application of the counselling program and 2 months later.
 Results After applying the school-based counselling program, the prevalence of PTSD (according to DSM-V) decreased from 57.5% to 45.6% among the children and adolescents who were exposed to war-traumatic events. In addition, PTSD symptoms, and emotional, somatic and cognitive functional impairment symptoms has decreased after the implementation of the counselling program especially amongst girls.

297,"Rationale, Methods, Feasibility, and Preliminary Outcomes of a Transdiagnostic Prevention Program for At-Risk College Students.","Purpose Early adulthood represents one period of increased risk for the emergence of a serious mental illness. The college campus provides a unique opportunity to assess and monitor individuals in this at-risk age group. However, there are no validated early detection programs that are widely implemented on college campuses. In an effort to address this gap, we designed and tested an early detection and prevention program tailored to college students. A transdiagnostic approach was employed because of evidence for shared risk factors across major mental illnesses.
 Design Single arm, prospective study evaluating outcomes following a 4-week intervention.
 Method Three in-person mental health screenings were conducted on the campus of one university. Undergraduate students with at least mildly elevated, self-reported levels of depressive or subclinical psychotic symptoms, who were not receiving treatment for these symptoms, were invited to participate in a 4-session workshop focused on increasing self- and other- awareness and emotion regulation using established mindfulness, self-compassion, and mentalization principles and experiential exercises. Symptoms, resilience-promoting capacities, and aspects of social functioning were assessed pre- and post- intervention.
 Results 416 students were screened and a total of 63 students participated in the workshop. 91% attended at least 3 of the 4 sessions. The majority of participants found the workshop interesting and useful and would recommend it to a friend. Significant pre-to-post reductions in symptoms (depression, anxiety, and subclinical psychotic symptoms, ps &lt; 0.004) and improvements in resilience-promoting capacities (self-compassion and self-efficacy, ps &lt; 0.006) and indices of social functioning (social motivation, activity, and a measure of comfort with the physical presence of others, ps &lt; 0.04) were observed. Moreover, the significant increases in resilience-promoting capacities correlated with the reductions in affective symptoms (ps &lt; 0.03).
 Conclusions These findings suggest that an on-campus mental health screening and early intervention program is feasible, acceptable, and may be associated with improvements in resilience-related capacities and symptom reductions in young adults with non-impairing, subclinical symptoms of psychopathology. Follow-up work will determine whether this program can improve both shorter and longer-term mental health and functional outcomes in this at-risk population.",2376216762.0, Journal Article,2019
298,"Psychological and Psychosocial Interventions for PTSD, Depression and Anxiety Among Children and Adolescents in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Meta-Analysis.","Background In low- and middle-income countries, rates of common mental health disorders are found to be very high among children and adolescents while individuals, particularly in these countries, face barriers to mental health care. In the recent years, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted that implemented and tested different psychological and psychosocial treatment approaches to treat common mental disorders. This review aims to analyze psychological interventions among children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries.
 Methods RCTs carried out in low- and middle-income countries on psychological and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents with symptoms of trauma- and stressor related disorders, depression or anxiety were identified in bibliographic databases. Databases were systematically searched until December 14, 2018. Effect sizes indicating differences between treatment and control groups at post-test were computed using a random-effects model. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
 Results Thirteen studies with a total of 2,626 participants aged between 5 and 18 years were included. Treatments varied between studies and number of treatment sessions ranged from 1 to 16. The pooled effect size, combining outcomes of depression, anxiety and PTSD of psychological or psychosocial intervention versus care-as-usual or a control conditions yielded a medium effect (g = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.27-0.98). Heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 94.41; 95% CI = 80-91). The beneficial effect of interventions increased after excluding outliers (g = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.37-1.07), while heterogeneity remained high (I2 = 86.12; 95% CI = 87-94).
 Conclusion High quality RCTs investigating the effect of psychological and psychosocial interventions on PTSD, depression and anxiety among children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries are scarce. Results of the available studies may suggest that psychological and psychosocial interventions might be more effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD compared to control conditions. Due to very high heterogeneity, this evidence must be considered with caution.",2371859689.0, Systematic Review,2019
299,Negative Effects of Latent Toxoplasmosis on Mental Health.,"Infection by the parasite Toxoplasma, which affects about 33% of world population, is associated with an increased risk of several mental health disorders, the most strongly with schizophrenia. It is unknown whether schizophrenia is associated with this infection the most strongly, or whether this association has just been the most intensively studied for historical reasons. We used the data from 6,367 subjects tested for toxoplasmosis who took part in an internet survey to search for associations of these infections with 24 mental health disorders and evidence of otherwise impaired mental health. The typical symptom associated with toxoplasmosis was anxiety, and the typical toxoplasmosis-associated disorders were autism (OR = 4.78), schizophrenia (OR = 3.33), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (OR = 2.50), obsessive compulsive disorder (OR = 1.86), antisocial personality disorder (OR = 1.63), learning disabilities (OR = 1.59), and anxiety disorder (OR = 1.48). Toxoplasmosis could play a substantial role in the etiopathogenesis of mental health disorders and its association with schizophrenia is the second strongest association, after autism.",2371854980.0, Journal Article,2019
300,"Migration and Mental Health in Mexico: Domestic Migrants, Return U.S. Migrants, and Non-Migrants.","In this paper, we use survey data from the Mexican Retrospective Demographic Survey (Encuesta Demográfica Retrospectiva) and National Survey of Households (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares) collected in 2017 to examine self-reports of depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and pain among domestic migrants, returned U.S. migrants, and non-migrants. Although self-reports do not always correspond to clinical diagnoses, they offer some insight into mental health, especially for those without a diagnosis because of limited access to services or stigma. Regression results reveal that domestic migrants, e.g., those who moved within Mexico, reported more anxiety, chronic fatigue, and pain, but risks for U.S. migrants were comparable to non-migrants, controlling for other characteristics. Findings from the decomposition analysis helps explain these findings. While domestic migrant vs. non-migrant differences result both from different migrant demographic attributes, such as age and gender, and differences in the effects of these characteristics between the groups, U.S. migrant vs. non-migrant differences in anxiety and pain emerge only after allowing for the relationship between each observed characteristic and the mental health outcome to vary. Thus, compared to domestic migrants, U.S. migrants are selected on characteristics associated with good mental health-they are positively selected-but those characteristics are not protective for them.",2369889459.0, Journal Article,2019
301,Attachment-Based Family Therapy for Adolescent Substance Use: A Move to the Level of Systems.,"This paper provides an account of the theoretical basis of a family-based intervention called Behaviour Exchange and Systems Therapy (BEST). The model described here has also been applied to adolescents with substance abuse and other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders in both children and adolescents. Evaluative studies of the model have been published including randomised clinical trials as well as qualitative analyses. The current paper discusses a theory of the family system as a discourse and represents an integration of aspects of attachment, psychoanalytic, and systems theories. Key concepts elaborated are the attachment-family system, the family as a single discourse, the use of segregation as a defense in relation to trauma and loss and its manifestation in a family narrative, and the role of the family secure base in affect regulation. The paper also briefly describes specific treatment techniques that are derived from the theoretical model. Our approach has wide application as a discourse focused treatment for children and adolescents using a family systems approach. Future work requires the comparison of this model to similar attachment-based models of intervention for children and families, further development and validation of measures able to be used for whole families in a clinical setting, and further empirical demonstration of treatment efficacy in a variety of clinical settings.",2369889042.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
302,Study Protocol: Transitions in Adolescent Girls (TAG).,"Background Despite recent studies linking pubertal processes to brain development, as well as research demonstrating the importance of both pubertal and neurodevelopmental processes for adolescent mental health, there is limited knowledge of the full pathways and mechanisms behind the emergence of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders in adolescence. The Transitions in Adolescent Girls (TAG) study aims to understand the complex relationships between pubertal development, brain structure and connectivity, the behavioral and neural correlates of social and self-perception processes, and adolescent mental health in female adolescents.
 Methods The TAG study includes 174 female adolescents aged 10.0 to 13.0 years, recruited from the local community in Lane County, Oregon, USA. The participants, along with a parent/guardian, will complete three waves of assessment over the course of 3 years; the third wave is currently underway. Each wave includes collection of four saliva samples (one per week) and one hair sample for the assessment of hormone levels and immune factors; an MRI session including structural, diffusion, resting-state functional and task-based functional scans; the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), a diagnostic interview on current and lifetime mental health; production of a short self-narrative video; and measurement of height, weight, and waist circumference. The functional MRI tasks include a self-evaluation paradigm and a self-disclosure paradigm. In addition, adolescents and their parents/guardians complete a number of surveys to report on the adolescent's pubertal development, mental health, social environment and life events; adolescents also report on various indices of self-perception and social-emotional functioning.
 Discussion The knowledge gained from this study will include developmental trajectories of pubertal, neurological, and social processes and their roles as mechanisms in predicting emergence of mental illness in female adolescents. This knowledge will help identify modifiable, developmentally specific risk factors as targets for early intervention and prevention efforts.",2369888642.0, Journal Article,2019
303,"Step-by-Step, an E-Mental Health Intervention for Depression: A Mixed Methods Pilot Study From Lebanon.","Background E-mental health is an established mode of delivering treatment for common mental disorders in many high income countries. However, evidence of its effectiveness in lower income countries is lacking. This mixed methods study presents lessons learned and preliminary data on the feasibility of a minimally guided e-mental health intervention in Lebanon. The aim was to pilot test Step-by-Step, a WHO guided e-mental health intervention, and research methods prior to future, controlled testing.
 Methods Participants were recruited using social media and advertisements in primary care clinics. Participants completed baseline and post-intervention questionnaires on depression symptoms (primary outcome, PHQ-8), anxiety symptoms, well-being, disability and self-perceived problem severity, and a client satisfaction questionnaire. In addition, seven completers, four drop-outs, 11 study staff, and four clinic managers were interviewed with responses thematically analyzed. Website analytics were used to understand participant behavior when using the website.
 Results A total of 129 participants signed up via the Step-by-Step website. Seventy-four participants started session 1 after completing pre-test questionnaires and 26 completed both baseline and post-intervention data. Among those who completed post-assessments, depression symptoms improved (PHQ-8 scores (t=5.62, p &lt; 0.001 two-tailed, df = 25). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed a significant difference between baseline and post-Step-by-Step scores on all secondary outcome measures. Client satisfaction data was positive. Interview responses suggested that the intervention could be made more appropriate for younger, single people, more motivating, and easier to use. Those who utilized the support element of the intervention were happy with their relationship with the non-specialist support person (e-helper), though some participants would have preferred specialist support. E-helpers would have liked more training on complex cases. Website analytics showed that many users dropped out before intervention start, and that some re-entered screening data having been excluded from the study.
 Conclusion Step-by-Step skills and techniques, model of service integration, and its non-specialist support element are acceptable. Though the sample was small and non-controlled and drop-out was high, results suggest that it may be effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and increasing well-being. Lessons learned will inform content revision, the development of an app version of Step-by-Step, and the research methodology of upcoming effectiveness studies.",2369887748.0, Journal Article,2019
304,Pregabalin Abuse in Combination With Other Drugs: Monitoring Among Methadone Patients.,"Introduction In recent years, there has been an increase in the non-medical use of psychoactive prescription drugs including pregabalin (PGB). Studies have shown that multiple drug users and patients in methadone treatment programs administered PGB at high dosages in order to achieve euphoria, reduce withdrawal symptoms, or potentiate the effects of methadone. For these reasons, accurate toxicological monitoring is required for these high-risk individuals.
 Materials and Methods The present study investigated whether PGB could be detected in the hair samples of 250 patients with a history of opiate dependency, and under toxicological surveillance assess their compliance with methadone maintenance therapy.
 Results Opiates were found in 54/250 of all hair samples, while cannabis was present in 74/250 patients, cocaine was detected in 21/250 patients, and benzodiazepines without prescription were identified in 49/250 patients. As expected, methadone was present in all 250 patients (100%). PGB without prescription was found in the hair samples of 35/250 patients (14%). Of these, 91.43% were male, 48.57% were &lt;30 y old, and 45.71% were between ages 30 and 50 y. There were no apparent associations among PGB use, daily methadone dosage, and duration of methadone maintenance therapy. Psychiatric comorbidities were present in 25.71% of the patients abusing PGB. Anxiety (55.56%) and depression (33.33%) were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders.
 Discussion Most of the patients taking PGB (57.14%) used other drugs (especially opiates) concurrently. The utility of hair analysis is explained by easy and rapid sample collection and the ability of the hair to reflect long-term drug use and incorporate drug metabolites. The findings of this study suggested that PGB has significant potential for abuse by high-risk populations such as opioid users and patients with dual diagnosis. These risks are particularly high in cases of poly-drug use and drug intake that are not in compliance with prescription guidelines.",2369887575.0, Journal Article,2019
305,A Public Health Perspective on Screening for Psychosis Within General Practice Clinics.,"Screening for major mental illness in adolescents and young adults has lagged behind screening for physical illness for a myriad of reasons. Existing pediatric behavioral health screening tools screen primarily for disorders of attention, disruptive behaviors, depression, and anxiety. A few also screen for substance use and suicide risk. Although it is now possible to reliably identify young people at imminent risk for a psychotic disorder, arguably the most severe of mental illnesses, general practitioners (GP) rarely screen for psychotic symptoms or recognize when to refer patients for a specialized risk assessment. Research suggests that barriers such as inadequate knowledge or insufficient access to mental health resources can be overcome with intensive GP education and the integration of physical and mental health services. Under the lens of two public health models outlining the conditions under which disease screening is warranted, we examine additional evidence for and against population-based screening for psychosis in adolescents and young adults. We argue that systematic screening within general health settings awaits a developmentally well-normed screening tool that includes probes for psychosis, is written at a sufficiently low reading level, and has acceptable sensitivity and, in particular, specificity for detecting psychosis and psychosis risk in both adolescents and young adults. As integrated healthcare models expand around the globe and psychosis-risk assessments and treatments improve, a stratified screening and careful risk management protocol for GP settings could facilitate timely early intervention that effectively balances the benefit/risk ratio of employing such a screening tool at the population level.",2362101612.0, Journal Article,2019
306,The Rage Attack Questionnaire-Revised (RAQ-R): Assessing Rage Attacks in Adults With Tourette Syndrome.,"Introduction Although defined by the presence of tics, most patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) also suffer from different psychiatric disorders. While much is known about clinical characteristics of comorbidities such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, and anxiety disorders, only very little is known about rage attacks. Most of this data is based on small studies in children. Until today no larger studies have been performed in adults with TS-most likely because of the lack of validated instruments. The aim of this study was to develop a new assessment and investigate rage attacks in a large sample of adults with TS and healthy individuals.
 Materials and Methods Based on a parent questionnaire for children with TS, we generated 27 items for a revised version of a rage attack questionnaire (RAQ-R) and tested factor structure, internal consistency, as well as convergent and discriminant validity. We used an online survey and included 127 patients with TS and 645 control subjects. In addition to the RAQ-R, we used several other self-assessments to measure tic severity, quality of life, as well as several psychiatric symptoms including ADHD, OCD, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.
 Results Based on expert option and statistical analyses [including item-total correlation, skewness, inter-item correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA)], we performed an item reduction resulting in a final, 22-items version of the RAQ-R (range, 0-66). Investigating internal consistency, discriminant validity, test reliability, and factor structure, the RAQ-R demonstrated good to excellent quality criteria. As assessed by RAQ-R, rage attacks were significantly more common in patients with TS compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). Rage attacks could be clearly differentiated from the phenomenon of impulsivity. Although rage attacks occurred more often in individuals with ADHD, they were also found in patients with ""TS only"", independently from comorbid ADHD, impulsivity, and OCD. Rage attacks were found to significantly influence patients' quality of life.
 Conclusions Thus, from our data based on a large sample it is suggested that rage attacks represent a discrete comorbidity in adults with TS.",2356572077.0, Journal Article,2019

308,"Bad Things Come to Those Who Do Not Wait: Temporal Discounting Is Associated With Compulsive Overeating, Eating Disorder Psychopathology and Food Addiction.","The tendency to act on immediate pleasure-driven desires, due to the devaluation of future rewards [a process known as temporal discounting (TD)], has been associated with substance use disorders (SUD) and with conditions characterised by compulsive overeating. The study involved a large inclusive participant sample (i.e., no diagnostic or exclusion criteria were applied). They were recruited/assessed online and we investigated whether TD was related to compulsive overeating and associated problems. Participants [N = 432, (48 males)] completed an online survey, which included a hypothetical monetary TD task, the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS). TD correlated with frequency of compulsive overeating and compensatory behaviours, with eating disorder psychopathology, with scores on the YFAS, and with body mass index (BMI). As our study shows that elevated rates of TD are associated with a range of behaviours/measures, we propose that it is more likely that elevated TD rates are a predisposing factor rather than a consequence of the behaviour, i.e., elevated rates of TD contribute to pathological eating-related behaviours; however, a bi-directional explanation is also possible. Future research should investigate whether interventions aimed at reducing TD have clinical potential for treating problematic eating behaviours.",2353012420.0, Journal Article,2019
309,Therapeutic Use of LSD in Psychiatry: A Systematic Review of Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials.,"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future.",2353008274.0, Systematic Review,2019
310,Development of a Psychological Intervention to Address Anxiety During Pregnancy in a Low-Income Country.,"Background: One in five women suffer from anxiety during pregnancy. Untreated anxiety is a risk factor for postnatal depression and is associated with adverse birth outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of prenatal anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), efforts to develop and evaluate context-specific interventions in these settings are lacking. We aimed to develop a culturally appropriate, feasible, and acceptable psychological intervention for perinatal anxiety in the context of a low-income population in Pakistan. Methods: We conducted this research in Rawalpindi District at the Obstetrics Department of the Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi Medical University a government facility catering to a mixture of low-income urban, peri-urban, and rural populations. We used a mixture of research methods to: a) investigate the clinical, cultural, and health-service delivery context of perinatal anxiety; b) select an evidence-based approach that suited the population and health-delivery system; c) develop an intervention with extensive reference documentation/manuals; and d) examine issues involved in its implementation. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, and analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Informed by the qualitative findings and review of existing evidence-based practices, we developed the ""Happy Mother, Healthy Baby"" intervention, which was based on principles of cognitive behavior therapy. Its evidence-based elements included: developing an empathetic relationship, challenging thoughts, behavior activation, problem solving, and involving family. These elements were applied using a three-step approach: 1) learning to identify unhealthy or unhelpful thinking and behavior; 2) learning to replace unhealthy or unhelpful thinking and behavior with helpful thinking and behavior; and 3) practicing thinking and acting healthy. Delivered by non-specialist providers, the intervention used culturally appropriate illustrations and examples of healthy activities to set tasks in collaboration with the women to encourage engagement in helpful behaviors. Feedback from the non-specialist providers indicated that the intervention was acceptable, feasible, and perceived to be helpful by the women receiving it. Conclusion: This new psychosocial intervention for perinatal anxiety, based on principles of cognitive behavior therapy and delivered by non-specialists, has the potential to address this important but neglected condition in LMICs.",2348796556.0, Journal Article,2019
311,Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy as a Prequel to Face-To-Face Therapy for Depression and Anxiety: A Naturalistic Observation.,"Background: The UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program is a stepped-care model treating individuals with depression and anxiety disorders. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is routinely offered to individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, but its applicability to individuals with severe clinical symptoms and requiring a high-intensity intervention is relatively unknown. The current study sought to investigate the potential impacts of using iCBT as a prequel for patients requiring high-intensity treatment (HIT; face-to-face) for depression and anxiety in IAPT. Methods: The study utilized an open study design. One hundred and twenty-four participants who were on a waiting list for high-intensity, face-to-face psychological treatment were offered iCBT. Psychometric data on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and functioning were collected from participants before starting and on finishing iCBT and at the point of service exit. Therapeutic alliance data were collected from patients and clinicians during treatment. Patient pathway data, such as number of treatment sessions and time in treatment, was also collected and incorporated into the analysis. Results: Significant reductions across primary outcome measures of depression and anxiety, as well as improved functioning, were observed from baseline to iCBT treatment exit, and from iCBT exit to service exit. Analysis of the therapeutic alliance data for patients and clinicians illustrated differences in outcome for those who dropped out and those who completed treatment. Discussion: This study illustrates the potential for using iCBT as a prequel to high-intensity therapy for depression and anxiety disorders and is the first of its kind to do so within IAPT stepped care. The results show that iCBT is a valuable option reducing waiting times and enhancing clinical efficiency. The study contributes to the well-established evidence on online psychological treatments worldwide, but further clinical and service development research is necessary to scale these treatments appropriately.",2348796458.0, Journal Article,2019
312,Stigmatizing Attitudes Towards Mental Disorders Among Non-Mental Health Professionals in Six General Hospitals in Hunan Province.,"Background: There have been few studies on the stigma associated with mental disorders among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in China. This study seeks to explore mental health-related stigma and the desire for social distance among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province in China. Methods: The study was carried out with 1123 non-mental health professionals in six general hospitals in Hunan Province by using a questionnaire with a case vignette describing either schizophrenia, depression, or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Questions were asked about the attitudes of participants and other people towards individuals with mental disorders and the willingness to come into contact with them. Results: The people described in the vignette were considered dangerous by 84.4% of participants for schizophrenia, 72.0% of participants for depression, and 63.1% of participants for GAD. Besides being dangerous, people with schizophrenia were perceived as unpredictable and as the least suitable for voting for as a politician or employing. Around 50% of participants believed the problems described in the vignette were due to personal weakness. Over 70% of the non-mental health professionals were not willing to have the people described in the vignette marry into their family. The participants had gained their mental health-related knowledge mainly through the media, mostly from newspapers. Conclusions: The current study found a significant stigma towards individuals with mental disorders and a desire for social distance from such people among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province. Anti-stigma interventions should focus on addressing non-mental health professionals' beliefs on dangerousness and unpredictability.",2348796267.0, Journal Article,2019
313,Body Image and Body Avoidance Nine Years After Bariatric Surgery and Conventional Weight Loss Treatment.,"Recently, there has been an increasing focus on body image dissatisfaction (BID), both as a motivational factor for seeking bariatric surgery and as a factor influencing weight loss outcome after surgery. Although associations have been reported between BID, emotional distress and successful weight loss, conclusions are limited due to methodological issues such as non-weight-specific assessment tools for body image and neglect of behavioral components (e.g. body avoidance, BA). The present study seeks to report on BID and BA 9 years after bariatric surgery using a cross-sectional data set from the 9-year follow-up assessment of the Essen-Bochum Obesity Treatment Study (EBOTS). In total, N = 291 participants of the original EBOTS sample were included in the present analyses (N = 78 bariatric surgery patients, SURG; N = 124 patients of a conventional treatment program, CONV; and N = 83 individuals with obesity not seeking treatment, OC). Current body image facets (BID and BA) were captured at the 9-year follow-up assessment via silhouette scales adapted for use in samples with obesity. Moreover, BID was assessed retrospectively to obtain baseline attitudes. Possible influences of eating disorder symptoms and depression/anxiety were controlled for and assessed via standardized self-report measures. The results imply an improvement in BID in the SURG group, but not in the CONV and OC groups. The level of BA in relation to clothing was significantly higher in the CONV group compared to both the SURG and OC group. Current BID as well as BA were positively associated with current body weight as well as depression, anxiety, and levels of disinhibited eating. A positive change from baseline to current levels of BID was associated with successful weight loss, independently of treatment. The findings emphasize the role of the different components of body image after surgery for mental health features, and suggest a robust relationship between BID and weight loss (success). Thus, it might be helpful to address BID in treatment. However, further research, particularly in the form of prospective studies, is necessary to determine the direction of influence.",2348221828.0, Journal Article,2019
314,Anxiety and Depression Profile Is Associated With Eating Disorders in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Objective: To compare the prevalence of anxiety and depression states and eating disorders (EDs) between patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy volunteers without IBS. Methods: IBS patients according to Rome III criteria referred to our tertiary care center for therapeutic management and matched volunteers without IBS were prospectively included. EDs were screened by Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food-French version (SCOFF-F) questionnaire. IBS symptom severity (IBS symptom severity score), stool consistency (Bristol stool scale), anxiety and depression levels (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), and quality of life (validated Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index) were assessed by validated self-questionnaires. Results: IBS (228) patients and healthy volunteers (228) were included. Mean age was 42.5 ± 13.9 years with mainly women (76.7%). Among IBS patients, 25.4% had positive SCOFF-F compared to 21.1% of volunteers. IBS patients more frequently had a lower body mass index (BMI) than volunteers (p &lt; 0.0001). IBS patients with ED had poorer quality of life and more stressful life events (p = 0.02) than IBS patients without ED. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in IBS patients with ED than in volunteers without ED, respectively (19.0% vs 1.9%, p=0.00, and 60.3% vs 19.7%, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The prevalence of ED assessed with positive SCOFF-F questionnaire was not significantly different between IBS patients and healthy volunteers. The combination of IBS and ED was associated with higher levels of anxiety or depression and poorer quality of life.",2344227013.0, Journal Article,2019
315,Dysfunction in Serotonergic and Noradrenergic Systems and Somatic Symptoms in Psychiatric Disorders.,"Somatic symptoms include a range of physical experiences, such as pain, muscle tension, body shaking, difficulty in breathing, heart palpitation, blushing, fatigue, and sweating. Somatic symptoms are common in major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and some other psychiatric disorders. However, the etiology of somatic symptoms remains unclear. Somatic symptoms could be a response to emotional distress in patients with those psychiatric conditions. Increasing evidence supports the role of aberrant serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in somatic symptoms. The physiological alterations underlying diminished serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) signaling may contribute to impaired signal transduction, reduced 5-HT, or NE release from terminals of presynaptic neurons, and result in alternations in function and/or number of receptors and changes in intracellular signal processing. Multiple resources of data support each of these mechanisms. Animal models have shown physiological responses, similar to somatic symptoms seen in psychiatric patients, after manipulations of 5-HT and NE neurotransmission. Human genetic studies have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms risk loci associated with somatic symptoms. Several neuroimaging findings support that somatic symptoms are possibly associated with a state of reduced receptor binding. This narrative literature review aimed to discuss the involvement of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms. Future research combining neuroimaging techniques and genetic analysis to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of somatic symptoms and to develop novel treatment strategies is needed.",2340048167.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
316,Therapeutic Potential of Exogenous Ketone Supplement Induced Ketosis in the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Review of Current Literature.,"Globally, psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are becoming more prevalent. Although the exact pathological alterations are not yet clear, recent studies have demonstrated that widespread changes of very complex metabolic pathways may partially underlie the pathophysiology of many psychiatric diseases. Thus, more attention should be directed to metabolic-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence from numerous studies suggests that administration of exogenous ketone supplements, such as ketone salts or ketone esters, generates rapid and sustained nutritional ketosis and metabolic changes, which may evoke potential therapeutic effects in cases of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including psychiatric diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the current information on ketone supplementation as a potential therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders. Ketone supplementation elevates blood levels of the ketone bodies: D-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. These compounds, either directly or indirectly, beneficially affect the mitochondria, glycolysis, neurotransmitter levels, activity of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), and histone deacetylase, as well as functioning of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. The result of downstream cellular and molecular changes is a reduction in the pathophysiology associated with various psychiatric disorders. We conclude that supplement-induced nutritional ketosis leads to metabolic changes and improvements, for example, in mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes, and suggest that development of specific adjunctive ketogenic protocols for psychiatric diseases should be actively pursued.",2340043082.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
317,Negative Life Events and Problematic Internet Use as Factors Associated With Psychotic-Like Experiences in Adolescents.,"Objectives: Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) and problematic internet use (PIU) are common in adolescents. However, little is known about the association between PLEs and PIU among adolescents. The present study examined the associations between PLEs and PIU and negative life events among adolescents. Methods: In total, 1,678 adolescents attending high school were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. They completed self-reported assessments of PLEs using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) and measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, internet use, and negative life events using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Korean Scale for Internet Addiction (K-scale), and the Lifetime Incidence of Traumatic Events for Children (LITE-C), including cybersexual harassment and school violence. Results: A total of 1,239 subjects (73.8%) scored at least 1 on the PQ-16. The mean total and distress PQ-16 scores were significantly higher in students who used mental health services. The total and distress prodromal questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) scores were positively correlated with the CES-D, STAI-S, STAI-T, LITE-C, and K-scale scores but negatively correlated with the RSES score. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that PLEs were significantly associated with a high K-scale score and the incidence of negative life events, such as LITE-C, cybersexual harassment, and bully-victims. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PIU and negative life experiences were significantly associated with PLEs in adolescents. Assessment and therapeutic intervention with regard to internet use as a coping strategy for stress are needed to prevent the development of clinical psychotic symptoms.",2340039220.0, Journal Article,2019
318,High Exploratory Phenotype Rats Exposed to Environmental Stressors Present Memory Deficits Accompanied by Immune-Inflammatory/Oxidative Alterations: Relevance to the Relationship Between Temperament and Mood Disorders.,"Low-exploratory (LE) and high-exploratory (HE) rodents mimic human depressive and hyperthymic temperaments, respectively. Mood disorders (MD) may be developed by the exposure of these temperaments to environmental stress (ES). Psychiatric symptoms severity in MD patients is related to the magnitude of memory impairment. Thus, we aimed at studying the consequences of the exposure of LE and HE male Wistar rats, during periadolescence, to a combination of ES, namely, paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) and unpredictable stress (US), on anxiety-related behavior in the plus maze test, working (WM) and declarative memory (DM) performance. We also evaluated hippocampal immune-inflammatory/oxidative, as consequences of ES, and prevention of ES-induced alterations by the mood-stabilizing drugs, lithium and valproate. Medium exploratory (ME) control rats were used for comparisons with HE- and LE-control rats. We observed that HE-controls presented increased anxiolytic behavior that was significantly increased by ES exposure, whereas LE-controls presented increased anxiety-like behavior relative to ME-controls. Lithium and valproate prevented anxiolytic alterations in HE+ES rats. HE+ES- and LE+ES-rats presented WM and DM deficits. Valproate and lithium prevented WM deficits in LE-PSD+US rats. Lithium prevented DM impairment in HE+ES-rats. Hippocampal levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) increased four-fold in HE+ES-rats, being prevented by valproate and lithium. All groups of LE+ES-rats presented increased levels of GSH in relation to controls. Increments in lipid peroxidation in LE+ES- and HE+ES-rats were prevented by valproate in HE+ES-rats and by both drugs in LE+ES-rats. Nitrite levels were increased in HE+ES- and LE+ES-rats (five-fold increase), which was prevented by both drugs in LE+ES-rats. HE+ES-rats presented a two-fold increase in the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression that was prevented by lithium. HE+ES-rats showed increased hippocampal and plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-4. Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) was increased in HE+ES- and LE+ES-rats, while tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) was increased only in HE+ES-rats. Altogether, our results showed that LE- and HE-rats exposed to ES present distinct anxiety-related behavior and similar memory deficits. Furthermore, HE+ES-rats presented more brain and plasma inflammatory alterations that were partially prevented by the mood-stabilizing drugs. These alterations in HE+ES-rats may possibly be related to the development of mood symptoms.",2336980392.0, Journal Article,2019
319,A Proof-of-Mechanism Study to Test Effects of the NMDA Receptor Antagonist Lanicemine on Behavioral Sensitization in Individuals With Symptoms of PTSD.,"Background: Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a heightened sensitivity to subsequent stressors, addictive drugs, and symptom recurrence, a form of behavioral sensitization. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are involved in the establishment and activation of sensitized behavior. Objective: We describe a protocol of a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 1b proof-of-mechanism trial to examine target engagement, safety, tolerability, and possible efficacy of the NMDAR antagonist lanicemine in individuals with symptoms of PTSD (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS-5] score ≥ 25) and evidence of behavioral sensitization measured as enhanced anxiety-potentiated startle (APS; T-score ≥ 2.8). Methods: Subjects (n = 24; age range 21-65) receive three 60-min intravenous infusions of placebo or 100 mg lanicemine over 5 non-consecutive days. Primary endpoint is change in APS from pre-treatment baseline to after the third infusion. NMDAR engagement is probed with resting state EEG gamma band power, 40 Hz auditory steady state response, the mismatch negativity amplitude, and P50 sensory gating. Change in CAPS-5 scores is an exploratory clinical endpoint. Bayesian statistical methods will evaluate endpoints to determine suitability of this agent for further study. Conclusion: In contrast to traditional early-phase trials that use symptom severity to track treatment efficacy, this study tracks engagement of the study drug on expression of behavioral sensitization, a functional mechanism likely to cut across disorders. This experimental therapeutics design is consistent with recent NIMH-industry collaborative studies, and could serve as a template for testing novel pharmacological agents in psychiatry.

320,Specialized Therapeutic Assessment-Based Recovery-Focused Treatment for Young People With Self-Harm: Pilot Study.,"Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people worldwide. Self-harm is the strongest predictor of death by suicide. There is increasing evidence that psychological therapies are efficacious in treating self-harm in adolescents. However, studies so far have predominantly focused on highly selective groups of adolescents and have investigated interventions that require intensive training and considerable expense. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of a novel psychological therapy package, Specialized Therapeutic Assessment-Based Recovery-Focused Treatment (START) that consists of Therapeutic Assessment followed by treatment in one of three modules, depending on adolescents' needs and preferences: Solution Focused Brief Therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), or Mentalization Based Treatment. Adolescents (12-17) with at least one self-harm episode in the previous 6 months referred for community treatment, who had no intellectual disability, psychosis or autism were eligible for START. The primary outcome measure was the number of self-harm (regardless of suicidal intent) episodes 6 months before and 6 months after commencing START. Secondary outcomes included measures of psychopathology, functional impairment and family satisfaction. Results: Twenty-one consecutively referred adolescents were recruited and 15 received a therapeutic module of START: three received Solution Focused Brief Therapy, nine CBT, and three Mentalization Based Treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of self-harm episodes from a mean of 7.93 (SD = 12.26) to 1.00 (SD = 1.47), p &lt; 0.02 following START. There was also a significant reduction in self-harm episodes, Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale scores and a statistically significant improvement in Children Global Assessment Scale scores for the CBT group alone. There were no significant differences in any other outcomes. Most families were somewhat or very much satisfied with the intervention. Conclusion: The results show that START was associated with a reduction in self-harm and depression and anxiety symptoms, which could indicate that START should be rigorously studied in a randomized control trial (RCT). However, the model had difficulties in its implementation, with CBT being only module that was offered to enough young people to allow before and after analysis. CBT appears to be the most promising module in treating adolescents with self-harm referred to community mental health services.",2336253986.0, Journal Article,2019
321,Crystal Methamphetamine Use in Sexual Settings Among German Men Who Have Sex With Men.,"Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable subgroup for problems with substance use, including crystal methamphetamine. Drug use in sexual settings, commonly referred to as ""chemsex,"" has been an issue of growing concern in MSM communities. Recreational drugs commonly associated with chemsex include crystal methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL), mephedrone, and ketamine. Drug use in sexual settings is correlated with sexual practices associated with the acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and hepatitis C. Adverse mental health outcomes are often reported at higher rates among MSM who use methamphetamine. Methods: This paper refers to a subset of participants from the German Chemsex Survey, an MSM-community recruited, self-completed online survey with a self-selected convenience sample. Participants who used crystal methamphetamine for sex (n = 130) were compared to participants who did not use drugs for sex (n = 177). The survey comprised 420 different items considering recreational substance use, substance use in sexual settings, harm reduction strategies, mental health, sexual transmitted infections, and mental health care service utilization. Results: A total of 1,583 men started the survey; 1,050 participants provided information on substance use. Twenty-seven percent of participants used crystal methamphetamine in the last 12 months, and of those, 89% used methamphetamine in a sexual setting and 50% reported injecting methamphetamine. Regarding mental health, participants who reported methamphetamine use in sexual settings were more likely to report symptoms of depression, somatization, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the German male general population. Participants who reported methamphetamine use for sex were more likely to report symptoms of major depression, being HIV positive, and taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) than participants who did not report methamphetamine use. Most participants used harm reduction practices to reduce the risks associated with using methamphetamine in sexual settings. Conclusion: Crystal methamphetamine is used in the context of sexual activities by German MSM. Poorer mental health status than in the male general population was observed. MSM who used methamphetamine in this study seemed to be aware of potential health risks associated with their substance use and utilized harm reduction strategies and biomedical HIV prevention strategies like PrEP.",2330060394.0, Journal Article,2019
322,Feasibility of Implementing a Family-Based Inpatient Program for Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background: Manualized Family Based Therapy (FBT) is the treatment of choice for adolescent anorexia nervosa, but it is an outpatient treatment. Very little research has examined whether or how the principles of FBT might be successfully adapted to an inpatient setting, and there is little other evidence in the literature to guide us on how to best treat children and adolescents with eating disorders (EDs) while in hospital. This paper describes and provides treatment outcomes for an intensive inpatient program that was designed for the treatment of adolescents less than 18 years of age with severe anorexia nervosa, based on the principles of FBT. Each patient's family was provided with FBT adapted for an inpatient setting for the duration of the admission. Parents were encouraged to provide support for all meals in hospital and to plan meal passes out of hospital. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted that examined the outcomes of 153 female patients admitted over a 5-year period. Outcome data focused primarily on weight change as well as psychological indicators of health (i.e., depression, anxiety, ED psychopathology). Results: Paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections showed significant weight gain associated with a large effect size. In addition, patients showed improvements in scores of mood, anxiety, and ED psychopathology (associated with small to medium effect sizes), though they continued to display high rates of body dissatisfaction and some ongoing suicidality at the time of discharge. Conclusion: This study shows that a specialized inpatient program for adolescents with severe EDs that was created using the principles of FBT results in positive short-term medical and psychological improvements as evidenced by improved weight gain and decreased markers of psychological distress.",2328347094.0, Journal Article,2019
323,Depressive Symptom Network Associated With Comorbid Anxiety in Late-Life Depression.,"Background: Depression and anxiety are the most common comorbid psychiatric disorders in the elderly. Psychiatrists have been reporting worsened depression symptoms and prognosis by comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, it is still unclear how anxiety affects the course of depression in the elderly. The aims of this study are (1) to identify the symptom network in late-life depression (LLD), and (2) to examine the role of anxiety in LLD with a network perspective. Methods: The study analyzed 776 community-based participants who were clinically diagnosed with depression and enrolled in Suwon Geriatric Mental Health Center. Network analysis was used to investigate the relationships between the symptoms of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The depression sample was divided into groups of low and high anxiety according to the Beck Anxiety Index. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize the effects of depression severity on the network. Network comparison test (NCT) were carried out to compare the global connectivity, global strength, and specific edge strength between the two subgroups. Results: Reported sadness, pessimistic thinking, and suicidal ideation are the core symptoms of LLD in terms of node strength. The MADRS sum score [mean (SD) 28.10 (9.19) vs 20.08 (7.11); P &lt; .01] was much higher in the high anxiety group. The NCT before PSM showed the high anxiety group had significantly higher global strength (P &lt; .01). However, the NCT after PSM did not reveal any statistical significance both in global structure (P = .46) and global strength (P = .26). A comparison between centrality indices showed a higher node strength of vegetative symptoms in the high anxiety group and this also remained after PSM. Conclusion: Based on the statistical analysis, anxiety worsens the severity of depression in the elderly. However, NCT after PSM revealed comorbid anxiety does not change the global structure and strength of the depression symptom network. Therefore, anxiety may affect LLD in a way of worsening the severity, rather than changing psychopathology. Additionally, the study revealed the centrality of vegetative symptoms was low in LLD but increased substantially in patients with comorbid anxiety.",2324923085.0, Journal Article,2019
324,The Digital Psychiatrist: In Search of Evidence-Based Apps for Anxiety and Depression.,"One of the biggest growth areas in e-mental health resources has been the development and use of mobile mental health apps for smartphones and tablet devices. Such apps are being downloaded at increasing rates, but there have been questions about their efficacy and the research methodologies used to examine this. A review of the major app marketplaces, the Apple App Store and Google Play store, was conducted to locate apps claiming to offer a therapeutic treatment for depression and/or anxiety, and have research evidence for their effectiveness, according to their app store descriptions. App store descriptions were also analyzed to determine whether the app had been developed with mental health expert input; whether they had been developed in association with a government body, academic institution, or medical facility; and, whether or not they were free to download. Overall, 3.41% of apps had research to justify their claims of effectiveness, with the majority of that research undertaken by those involved in the development of the app. Other results indicated that 30.38% of shortlisted apps claimed to have expert development input; 20.48% had an affiliation with a government body, academic institution, or medical facility; and, 74.06% were free to download. Future research must consider other methodologies that may facilitate more research being completed on a greater number of apps, and future development needs to incorporate greater levels of input by mental health experts. Ways in which app stores could play a key role in encouraging more scientific research into the effectiveness of the mental health apps they sell are discussed.",2322139307.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
325,Altered Electroencephalographic Resting-State Large-Scale Brain Network Dynamics in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder Patients.,"Background: Neuroimaging studies provided evidence for disrupted resting-state functional brain network activity in bipolar disorder (BD). Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies found altered temporal characteristics of functional EEG microstates during depressive episode within different affective disorders. Here we investigated whether euthymic patients with BD show deviant resting-state large-scale brain network dynamics as reflected by altered temporal characteristics of EEG microstates. Methods: We used high-density EEG to explore between-group differences in duration, coverage, and occurrence of the resting-state functional EEG microstates in 17 euthymic adults with BD in on-medication state and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Two types of anxiety, state and trait, were assessed separately with scores ranging from 20 to 80. Results: Microstate analysis revealed five microstates (A-E) in global clustering across all subjects. In patients compared to controls, we found increased occurrence and coverage of microstate A that did not significantly correlate with anxiety scores. Conclusion: Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for altered large-scale brain network dynamics in BD patients and suggest the increased presence of A microstate to be an electrophysiological trait characteristic of BD.",2322138711.0, Journal Article,2019
326,Could Animal-Assisted Therapy Help to Reduce Coercive Treatment in Psychiatry?,"For psychiatric patients, compulsory admission and coercive measures can constitute distressing and sometimes traumatizing experiences. As a consequence, clinicians aim at minimizing such procedures. At the same time, they need to ensure high levels of safety for patients, staff and the public. In order to prevent compulsory measures and to favor the use of less restrictive alternatives, innovative interventions improving the management of dangerous situations are needed. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is being applied in a variety of diagnoses and treatment settings, and could have the potential to reduce aggression and psychopathology. Therefore, AAT might be of use in the prevention and early treatment of aggression, and might constitute a promising component of treatment alternatives to forced interventions. To our knowledge, no study evaluating the effect of AAT on compulsory measures in persons with psychiatric diseases has been published up to date. This narrative expert review including a systematic literature search examines the published literature about the use of AAT in psychiatry. Studies report reduced anxiety and aggressiveness as well as positive effects on general wellbeing, self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness. Although literature on the applicability of AAT as a component of preventive or de-escalating treatment settings is sparse, beneficial effects of AAT have been reported. Therefore, we encourage examining AAT as a promising new treatment approach to prevent compulsory measures.",2321676971.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
327,What Works and What Doesn't Work? A Systematic Review of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Young People.,"Background: A major challenge in providing mental health interventions for young people is making such interventions accessible and appealing to those most in need. Online and app-based forms of therapy for mental health are burgeoning. It is therefore crucial to identify features that are most effective and engaging for young users. Objectives: This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of digital mental health interventions and their effectiveness in addressing anxiety and depression in young people to determine factors that relate to outcomes, adherence, and engagement with such interventions. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken, including a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials that compared use of a digital intervention for depression in young people to a no-intervention control group, and 6 comparing the intervention to an active control condition. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of 41 studies was also performed. Results: The pooled effect size of digital mental health interventions on depression in comparison to a no-intervention control was small (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55), while the pooled effect size of studies comparing an intervention group to an active control showed no significant differences (Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI -.04 to 0.31). Pooled effect sizes were higher when supervision was involved (studies with no-intervention controls: Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; studies with active control: Cohen's d = 0.49, 95% CI -0.11, 1.01). Engagement and adherence rates were low. Qualitative analysis revealed that users liked interventions with a game-like feel and relatable, interactive content. Educational materials were perceived as boring, and users were put off by non-appealing interfaces and technical glitches. Conclusions: Digital interventions work better than no intervention to improve depression in young people when results of different studies are pooled together. However, these interventions may only be of clinical significance when use is highly supervised. Digital interventions do not work better than active alternatives regardless of the level of support. Future interventions need to move beyond the use of digital educational materials, considering other ways to attract and engage young people and to ensure relevance and appeal.",2321676830.0, Systematic Review,2019
328,Co-Morbidity of DSM-IV Personality Disorder in Major Depressive Disorder Among Psychiatric Outpatients in China: A Further Analysis of an Epidemiologic Survey in a Clinical Population.,"Introduction: It is common that personality disorder (PD) co-occurs with major depressive disorder (MDD). In the current literature, there is a dearth of information on the co-occurrence of PD and MDD among Chinese population. Materials and Methods: 609 individuals were randomly sampled from outpatients diagnosed as MDD in Shanghai Mental Health Center. Co-morbidity of PDs was assessed using the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire Fourth Edition Plus (PDQ-4+) and eligible subjects were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II (SCID-II). The score of PDQ-4+ and the rate of SCID-II PD between subjects diagnosed with MDD and those with anxiety disorders (AD) were compared. Results: Two hundred fifty-eight outpatients (42.36%) with MDD were recognized to possess at least one criterion of diagnosis for PD, according to the DSM-IV. The most prevalent PD was depressive PD (14.61%), followed by avoidant (11.49%) and borderline (11.49%) PD. Cluster C PDs (anxious and panic PD) were the most common PD types (12.12%) when compared to other clusters. Compared to patients with AD, individuals with MDD were significantly more likely to have paranoid PD (6.6% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.011), borderline PD (11.5% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.000), passive-aggressive PD (5.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.007), and depressive PD (14.6% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.000). Discussion: The finding indicates that there is a high prevalence of PD among patients with MDD. More significant co-morbidity rates of PDs in MDD have been found when compared with AD. Further studies for the longitudinal impact of the PD-MDD co-morbidity are in need.",2321674789.0, Journal Article,2019
329,Kundalini Yoga Meditation Versus the Relaxation Response Meditation for Treating Adults With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often a life-long disorder with high psychosocial impairment. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only FDA approved drugs, and approximately 50% of patients are non-responders when using a criterion of 25% to 35% improvement with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). About 30% are non-responders to combined first-line therapies (SRIs and exposure and response prevention). Previous research (one open, one randomized clinical trial) has demonstrated that Kundalini Yoga (KY) meditation can lead to an improvement in symptoms of obsessive-compulsive severity. We expand here with a larger trial. Design: This trial compared two parallel run groups [KY vs. Relaxation Response meditation (RR)]. Patients were randomly allocated based on gender and Y-BOCS scores. They were told two different (unnamed) types of meditation would be compared, and informed if one showed greater benefits, the groups would merge for 12 months using the more effective intervention. Raters were blind in Phase One (0-4.5 months) to patient assignments, but not in Phase Two. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome variable, clinician-administered Y-BOCS. Secondary scales: Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (clinician-administered), Profile of Mood Scales, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Clinical Global Impression, Short Form 36 Health Survey. Results: Phase One: Baseline Y-BOCS scores: KY mean = 26.46 (SD 5.124; N = 24), RR mean = 26.79 (SD = 4.578; N = 24). An intent-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward for dropouts showed statistically greater improvement with KY compared to RR on the Y-BOCS, and statistically greater improvement on five of six secondary measures. For completers, the Y-BOCS showed 40.4% improvement for KY (N = 16), 17.9% for RR (N = 11); 31.3% in KY were judged to be in remission compared to 9.1% in RR. KY completers showed greater improvement on five of six secondary measures. At the end of Phase Two (12 months), patients, drawn from the initial groups, who elected to receive KY continued to show improvement in their Y-BOCS scores. Conclusion: KY shows promise as an add-on option for OCD patients unresponsive to first line therapies. Future studies will establish KY's relative efficacy compared to Exposure and Response Prevention and/or medications, and the most effective treatment schedule.

330,Approaching Cognitive Behavior Therapy For Generalized Anxiety Disorder From A Cognitive Process Perspective.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with uncontrollable worry at its core, is a common psychological disorder with considerable individual and societal costs. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended as the first-line treatment for GAD; however, further investigation into its effectiveness in routine clinical care is indicated and improvement is required in treatment outcomes for worry. Improvements to CBT need to be guided by experimental research that identifies key mechanisms maintaining core aspects of the disorder. This paper summarizes how theory-driven experimental research guided selection and refinements of CBT techniques originally developed by Borkovec and Costello, to target key cognitive processes that maintain worry in GAD. Hirsch and Mathews' model specifies three key research-supported processes that maintain uncontrollable worry in GAD: implicit cognitive biases such as negative interpretation bias and attention bias, generalized verbal thinking style, and impaired ability to re-direct attentional control away from worry. Specific CBT techniques outlined in this paper aim to target these key processes. Clinical data from clients treated using our refined CBT protocol for GAD in a routine clinical care service with a special interest in anxiety disorders were collected as part of service procedures. Large pre-to-posttreatment effect sizes were obtained for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and worry (PSWQ) (d=.90-2.54), and a moderate effect size was obtained for quality of life (WASA; d=.74). Recovery was indicated for 74% of cases for anxiety, 78% for depression, and 53% for worry. These findings exceeded most previous effectiveness studies in routine care and were in-line with GAD efficacy trials. This paper also outlines the application of specific clinical techniques selected, adapted or developed to target key cognitive mechanisms which maintain worry in GAD.",2320383130.0, Journal Article,2019
331,Predictors of Adherence to Treatment in Behavioral Health Therapy for Latino Immigrants: The Importance of Trust.,"A complex array of barriers to care influence patients' adherence to behavioral healthcare services. Understanding barriers to care is critical to ensure sufficient dosage of treatment. This study assessed the influence of perceived barriers on Latino migrants' prospective adherence to treatment for co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders as part of a clinical trial. Eligible participants (18-70 years-old) were recruited from community-based settings and classified according to their intervention session attendance. Baseline assessments included socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics (i.e., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use), psychosocial and cultural factors (i.e., ethnic identity, health literacy, discrimination), and perceived attitudinal and structural barriers to care. Treatment involved 10-sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and mindfulness (Integrated Intervention for Dual problems and Early Action) and emphasized participant's engagement in treatment. We used multinomial logistic regression models to examine the association between barriers to care reported at baseline, sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial and cultural factors, clinical factors, and treatment adherence. Mistrust in previous behavioral health treatment(s) was the reported barrier significantly associated with completion of the program after adjusting for clinical, psychosocial, and cultural factors, with those expressing mistrust in previous treatment(s) showing higher rates of completion compared to those who did not report this barrier. Evidence-based and culturally-tailored interventions provided by ethnically matched providers may overcome cultural mistrust and increase adherence to behavioral health care among Latino immigrants.",2320383012.0, Journal Article,2019
332,Epigenetic Modifications in Stress Response Genes Associated With Childhood Trauma.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may be referred to by other terms (e.g., early life adversity or stress and childhood trauma) and have a lifelong impact on mental and physical health. For example, childhood trauma has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The heritability of ACE-related phenotypes such as PTSD, depression, and resilience is low to moderate, and, moreover, is very variable for a given phenotype, which implies that gene by environment interactions (such as through epigenetic modifications) may be involved in the onset of these phenotypes. Currently, there is increasing interest in the investigation of epigenetic contributions to ACE-induced differential health outcomes. Although there are a number of studies in this field, there are still research gaps. In this review, the basic concepts of epigenetic modifications (such as methylation) and the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the stress response are outlined. Examples of specific genes undergoing methylation in association with ACE-induced differential health outcomes are provided. Limitations in this field, e.g., uncertain clinical diagnosis, conceptual inconsistencies, and technical drawbacks, are reviewed, with suggestions for advances using new technologies and novel research directions. We thereby provide a platform on which the field of ACE-induced phenotypes in mental health may build.",2320379948.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
333,Duloxetine in Psychiatric Disorders: Expansions Beyond Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,"Background: Duloxetine hydrochloride (DUL) is an antidepressant included in the pharmacological class of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this review was to elucidate current evidences on the use of DUL in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed database was searched from January 1, 2003, to September 30, 2018, using 11 key terms related to psychiatric disorders (""persistent depressive disorder,"" ""dysthymic disorder,"" ""bipolar disorder,"" ""seasonal affective disorder,"" ""obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" ""social phobia,"" ""panic disorder,"" ""posttraumatic stress disorder,"" ""schizophrenia,"" ""eating disorders,"" ""sexual disorders,"" ""personality disorders"") and one key term related to duloxetine (""duloxetine hydrochloride""). Article titles and abstracts were scanned to determine relevance to the topic. For additional studies, the authors also examined the reference lists of several of the included papers. Results: Duloxetine may be an effective treatment for mood spectrum disorders, panic disorder, several symptom clusters of borderline personality, and as add-on drug in schizophrenia. Modest or conflicting results have been found for the efficacy of duloxetine in obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating, and sexual disorders. Conclusion: Major limitations of the reviewed studies were short trial duration, small sample sizes, and the lack of control groups. Defining the potential role of DUL in the treatment of psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder needs further randomized, placebo-controlled studies.",2316778744.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
334,Mental Imagery and Brain Regulation-New Links Between Psychotherapy and Neuroscience.,"Mental imagery is a promising tool and mechanism of psychological interventions, particularly for mood and anxiety disorders. In parallel developments, neuromodulation techniques have shown promise as add-on therapies in psychiatry, particularly non-invasive brain stimulation for depression. However, these techniques have not yet been combined in a systematic manner. One novel technology that may be able to achieve this is neurofeedback, which entails the self-regulation of activation in specific brain areas or networks (or the self-modulation of distributed activation patterns) by the patients themselves, through real-time feedback of brain activation (for example, from functional magnetic resonance imaging). One of the key mechanisms by which patients learn such self-regulation is mental imagery. Here, we will first review the main mental imagery approaches in psychotherapy and the implicated brain networks. We will then discuss how these networks can be targeted with neuromodulation (neurofeedback or non-invasive or invasive brain stimulation). We will review the clinical evidence for neurofeedback and discuss possible ways of enhancing it through systematic combination with psychological interventions, with a focus on depression, anxiety disorders, and addiction. The overarching aim of this perspective paper will be to open a debate on new ways of developing neuropsychotherapies.",2315527120.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
335,Clinical Effects of Mindfulness-Based Intervention in Patients With First Episode Psychosis and in Individuals With Ultra-High Risk for Transition to Psychosis: A Review.,"Objectives: Recent clinical studies and meta-analyses have reported the clinical effects of mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary treatment for patients with schizophrenia, but their possible efficacy in patients with first episode of psychosis (FEP) and in individuals with ultra-high risk (UHR) of transition to psychosis is less clear. Here, we investigated the current evidence on the usefulness of mindfulness-based interventions in these two populations. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Among the 102 references retrieved, 9 responded to the inclusion criteria (8 in FEP patients and 1 in UHR individuals). In FEP patients, mindfulness interventions are well-tolerated and have a satisfactory level of adherence. The clinical benefits consist primarily of reduced anxiety and sadness and improved quality of life. None of the studies reported any increase in positive symptoms. Conclusion: Future sham-controlled studies with large sample sizes are needed to definitively conclude on the clinical interest of mindfulness-based interventions in FEP patients and UHR individuals as well as to understand their underlying mechanisms of action.",2315526678.0, Systematic Review,2019
336,Response and Remission Rates in Internet-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) was developed over 20 years ago and has since undergone a number of controlled trials, as well as several systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, the crucial question of response rates remains to be systematically investigated. The aim of this individual patient meta-analysis (IPDMA) was to use a large dataset of trials conducted in Sweden to determine reliable change and recovery rates across trials for a range of conditions. Methods: We used previously collected and aggregated data from 2,866 patients in 29 Swedish clinical trials of ICBT for three categories of conditions: anxiety disorders, depression, and others. Raw scores at pre-treatment and post-treatment were used in an IPDMA to determine the rate of reliable change and recovery. Jacobson and Truax's, (1991) reliable change index (RCI) was calculated for each primary outcome measure in the trials as well as the recovery rates for each patient, with the additional requirement of having improved substantially. We subsequently explored potential predictors using binomial logistic regression. Results: In applying an RCI of z = 1.96, 1,162 (65.6%) of the patients receiving treatment were classified as achieving recovery, and 620 (35.0%) were classified as reaching remission. In terms of predictors, patients with higher symptom severity on the primary outcome measure at baseline [odds ratio (OR) = 1.36] and being female (OR = 2.22) increased the odds of responding to treatment. Having an anxiety disorder was found to decrease the response to treatment (OR = 0.51). Remission was predicted by diagnosis in the same direction (OR = 0.28), whereas symptom severity was inversely predictive of worse outcome (OR = 0.81). Conclusions: Response seems to occur among approximately half of all clients administered ICBT, whereas about a third reach remission. This indicates that the efficacy of ICBT is in line with that of CBT based in prior trials, with a possible caveat being the lower remission rates. Having more symptoms and being female might increase the chances of improvement, and a small negative effect of having anxiety disorder versus depression and other conditions may also exist. A limitation of the IPDMA was that only studies conducted in Sweden were included.",2313649575.0, Systematic Review,2019
337,Effects of Opioid Dependence on Visuospatial Memory and Its Associations With Depression and Anxiety.,"Introduction: The cognitive impact of opioid dependence is rarely measured systematically in everyday clinical practice even though both patients and clinicians accept that cognitive symptoms often occur in the opioid-dependent population. There are only a few publications which utilized computerized neuropsychological tests to assess possible impairments of visuospatial memory in opioid-dependent individuals either receiving opioid replacement therapy (ORT) or during subsequent short-term abstinence and the effects of anxiety and depression. Methods: We assessed a cohort of 102 participants, comprising i) a stable opioid-dependent group receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) (n = 22), ii) a stable opioid-dependent group receiving buprenorphine (BMT) (n = 20), iii) a current abstinent but previously opioid-dependent group (ABS) (n = 8), and iv) a control group who have never been dependent on opioids. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery (CANTAB) neuropsychological tasks undertaken by participants included: Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS), Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM), Spatial Recognition Memory (SRM), and Paired Associate Learning (PAL) tasks. Three clinical measures were used to assess the severity of anxiety and depressive illness: Hospital Anxiety Scale-Hospital Anxiety Depression (HADA)-(HADD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (self-report) (ISD-SR). Results: The methadone- and buprenorphine-treated groups showed significant impairments (p &lt; 0.001) in visuospatial memory tasks but not the abstinent group. Impairments in visuospatial memory strongly correlated with higher mood and anxiety symptom severity scores (p &lt; 0.001). Discussion: These results are broadly consistent with previous studies. Uniquely, though, here we report a strong relationship between visuospatial memory and depression and anxiety scores, which might suggest common illness mechanisms.",2313649477.0, Journal Article,2019
338,Impact of a Terrorist Attack on the Mental Health of Directly Exposed French Adolescents: Study Protocol for the First Step of the AVAL Cohort Study.,"Background: Several terrorist attacks have recently taken place in France and Europe. Various studies have shown a high prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders among the victims of these attacks. Nevertheless, research in this field is scarce and no cohort study has been conducted yet to evaluate the impact of a terrorist attack on teenagers directly exposed to this type of events. Therefore, we decided to work on the AVAL (Adolescents Victimes de l'Attentat de Londres) cohort study in order to measure the psycho-traumatic impact of this attack and to describe these adolescents' health care pathways. Material and method: The 53 students of a French high school who were directly exposed (criterion A1 of PTSD in DSM-5) to the terrorist attack perpetrated in London on March 22, 2017 constitute the target population of this monocentric cross-sectional observational study. We decided not to include the three students who were physically wounded and, therefore, didn't have the same sensorial exposition. The primary endpoint will be the prevalence of PTSD 12 to 15 months after the attack, measured by the PCL-5 (Post-traumatic stress disorder Check-List for DSM-5) global severity score: the diagnosis of PTSD will be retained when the score is &gt; 32. We will also use an extensive battery of clinical tests to assess the prevalence of anxiety disorders, mood disorders, sleep disorders, addictions, suicide risk, and alterations in social, family, and school functioning 12 to 15 months after the attack. We will also describe these adolescents' health care pathways since the attack and collect data from the clinical evaluation performed during the initial intervention of the medico-psychological emergency cell within 10 days after the attack. Discussion: The findings of this study are intended to provide epidemiological data about the psycho-traumatic impact of a terrorist attack on the mental health of directly exposed adolescents and to describe these adolescents' health care pathways, thus contributing to improve the immediate, post-immediate, and delayed response strategies after a major psycho-traumatic event involving adolescents (and in particular after terrorist attacks), as well as the identification and psychiatric care of the young survivors requiring specialized care. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03493243. Ethics and Dissemination: The regional ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest IV-Nantes) approved the study protocol (Reference 10/18_3). All participants (and their legal guardians, for minors) must sign the informed consent to participate. The protocol was presented at the French congress of psychiatry in Nantes (France) in November 2018. After study completion, the results will be published and detailed in Marion Grenon's MD thesis in psychiatry.",2313649426.0, Journal Article,2019
339,Methylphenidate Dose-Dependently Affects Aggression and Improves Fear Extinction and Anxiety in BALB/cJ Mice.,"Overt aggression, increased anxiety, and dysfunctional fear processing are often observed in individuals with conduct disorder (CD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methylphenidate (MPH), a psychostimulant increasing dopamine and noradrenaline tone, is effective in reducing aggression in both CD and ADHD individuals. However, it is unclear to which extent these effects of MPH are dose dependent. Here, the effects of acute intraperitoneal MPH (3 and 10 mg/kg) on aggression, anxiety, social behavior, and fear extinction were investigated in BALB/cJ mice. Previous studies in BALB/cJ mice have revealed high levels of aggression and anxiety that are associated with reduced top-down cortical control. Administration of 3 mg/kg MPH prolonged the attack latency and prevented escalation of aggression over time compared to vehicle-treated mice, while 10 mg/kg MPH increased number of bites and attacks. In addition, 3 mg/kg MPH decreased social interaction slightly. A strong anxiolytic effect was found after administration of both the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses in the elevated plus maze and the open-field test. In addition, while vehicle-treated BALB/cJ animals showed intact freezing, both doses of MPH decreased freezing to the unconditioned stimulus in a fear-conditioning paradigm. A long-lasting effect on fear extinction was visible after treatment with the 10 mg/kg dose. The data support a role for MPH in the regulation of anxiety, fear processing, and aggression in BALB/cJ mice, with the latter effect in a dose-dependent manner. The findings provide a further context for examining the effects of MPH in clinical disorders such as ADHD and CD.",2313649389.0, Journal Article,2019
340,Using Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy to Enhance Treatment of Anxiety Disorders: Identifying Areas of Clinical Adoption and Potential Obstacles.,"Despite strong evidence of effectiveness, exposure therapy is an underutilized treatment for anxiety disorders at a time when effective treatment for anxiety is greatly needed. The significant worldwide prevalence and negative impact of anxiety are documented and highlight the importance of increasing therapist and patient use of effective treatment. Obstacles to the use of exposure therapy are explored and steps to lessen these obstacles are proposed. In particular, virtual reality (VR) technology is discussed as a way to increase the availability of exposure therapy. Incorporating VR in therapy can increase the ease, acceptability, and effectiveness of treatment for anxiety. VR exposure therapy (VRET) permits individualized, gradual, controlled, immersive exposure that is easy for therapists to implement and often more acceptable to patients than in vivo or imaginal exposure. VR is presented as a scalable tool that can augment access to and effectiveness of exposure therapy thus improving treatment of anxiety disorders. VR also has the potential to help with assessment and with therapist training standardization. The authors advocate for providing continuing education in VRET to practicing clinicians and including training in exposure therapy and VRET in training programs. Ongoing development of VR applications for clinical use is encouraged, especially when developed in collaboration with software developers, clinical users, therapists who are experienced in VRET, and researchers.",2313649367.0, Journal Article,2019
341,Neuroimaging Studies in Patients With Mental Disorder and Co-occurring Substance Use Disorder: Summary of Findings.,"Introduction: More than half of psychiatric patients have comorbid substance use disorder (dual diagnosis) and this rate, confirmed by many epidemiological studies, is substantially higher compared to general population. Combined operation of self-medication mechanisms, common etiological factors, and mutually causative influences most likely accounts for comorbidity, which, despite its clinical prevalence, remains underrepresented in psychiatric research, especially in terms of neuroimaging. The current paper attempts to review and discuss all existing methodologically sustainable structural and functional neuroimaging studies in comorbid subjects published in the last 20 years. Methods: Performing a systematic PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases search with predefined key-words and selection criteria, 43 structural and functional neuroimaging studies were analyzed. Results: Although markedly inconsistent and confounded by a variety of sources, available data suggest that structural brain changes are slightly more pronounced, yet not qualitatively different in comorbid patients compared to non-comorbid ones. In schizophrenia (SZ) patients, somewhat greater gray matter reduction is seen in cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal and frontotemporal cortex, limbic structures (hippocampus), and basal ganglia (striatum). The magnitude of structural changes is positively correlated to duration and severity of substance use, but it is important to note that at least in the beginning of the disease, dual diagnosis subjects tend to show less brain abnormalities and better cognitive functioning than pure SZ ones suggesting lower preexisting neuropathological burden. When analysing neuroimaging findings in SZ and bipolar disorder subjects, dorsolateral prefrontal, cingular, and insular cortex emerge as common affected areas in both groups which might indicate a shared endophenotypic (i.e., transdiagnostic) disruption of brain networks involved in executive functioning, emotional processing, and social cognition, rendering affected individuals susceptible to both mental disorder and substance misuse. In patients with anxiety disorders and substance misuse, a common neuroimaging finding is reduced volume of limbic structures (n. accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala). Whether this is a neuropathological marker of common predisposition to specific behavioral symptoms and drug addiction or a result from neuroadaptation changes secondary to substance misuse is unknown. Future neuroimaging studies with larger samples, longitudinal design, and genetic subtyping are warranted to enhance current knowledge on comorbidity.",2313649042.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
342,Treatment of Resistant Depression: A Pilot Study Assessing the Efficacy of a tDCS-Mindfulness Program Compared With a tDCS-Relaxation Program.,"Background: This pilot study explores a therapeutic setting combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for patients with drug-resistant depression. tDCS has shown efficacy for depression treatment and improvement could be maintained with the combination with mindfulness, which has shown depression relapse-prevention properties. Methods: Thirty-one treatment-resistant depressed patients have been assigned to our experimental treatment condition [tDCS combined with MBCT (n = 15)] or to a control condition [tDCS combined with relaxation (n = 16)]. Patients have completed both an intensive treatment block (eight consecutive days) and a single remind session 2 weeks after the intensive treatment. Clinical (depression, anxiety, and rumination) and cognitive (general cognitive functioning, mental flexibility, and working memory) symptoms of depression have been assessed through different questionnaires at baseline (t0), after the first block of treatment (t1), and after the remind session (t2). Results: Results seem to indicate a positive impact of both treatment conditions on clinical and cognitive symptoms of depression at t1. However, the treatment condition combining tDCS with mindfulness has been found to better maintain clinical improvements at t2 regarding some clinical [Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Sadness and Anger Ruminative Inventory (SARI)] and cognitive variables (Digit Span-F and Digit Span-B). Conclusion: Based on the current observations, a multi-disciplinary treatment approach combining tDCS and MBCT might be effective in resistant depressed patients in the long run, even though further clinical research is necessary.",2313648926.0, Journal Article,2019
343,Emotion Regulation Among Adolescents With Pediatric Depression As a Function of Anxiety Comorbidity.,"Background: Both depression and anxiety (two of the most common internalizing psychopathologies among youths) are associated with difficulties in emotion regulation (ER). Little is known about whether anxiety as a comorbid condition has an effect on the habitual use of different ER strategies in youngsters with depression histories. We aimed 1) to compare ER in adolescents with histories of childhood onset major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety and 2) to examine whether certain ER response clusters (Cognitive, Social, and Behavioral/Physical) characterize comorbid children and adolescents. Methods: We analyzed data on 217 youth (11-18 years old) with depression history: 85 subjects with lifetime anxiety comorbidity (comorbid group) and 132 without lifetime anxiety (non-comorbid group). Psychiatric diagnosis was established by a comprehensive Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV-based diagnostic procedure. ER strategies were examined via the self-rated ""Feelings and Me"" Child version questionnaire (FAM-C). Results: The comorbid group used maladaptive ER strategies significantly more frequently than the non-comorbid youngsters. The Behavioral/Physical and Social ER skills, especially those reflecting social withdrawal and self-harm, were responsible for the higher maladaptive scores. Limitations: Because our study is a cross-sectional analysis, we have no information about the development or the onset of maladaptive ER strategies. Therefore, we were unable to examine whether maladaptive ER was a risk factor or a consequence of the internalizing psychopathology and comorbidity. Conclusions: Comorbid anxiety worsens the impaired use of ER strategies in depression-prone youths. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore the causal role of dysfunctional ER in the development of internalizing psychopathology.",2309491675.0, Journal Article,2019
344,Changes in Global and Nodal Networks in Patients With Unipolar Depression After 3-Week Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment.,"Objectives: Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy has been applied in depressive disorders, but its neurobiological effect has not been well understood. Changes in cortical source network after treatment need to be confirmed. The present study investigated the effect of 3-week rTMS therapy on the symptom severity and cortical source network in patients with unipolar depression. Methods: Thirty-five patients with unipolar major depressive disorder participated in the study. High-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS was applied at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during 3 weeks (five consecutive weekdays every week). Clinical symptoms were examined using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety. The resting state electroencephalography was recorded with 62 scalp channels before and after rTMS treatment. Results: Clinical symptoms significantly improved after rTMS treatment in both the active (p = 0.001) and sham groups (p = 0.002). However, an increased cortical source network in global and nodal levels was observed only in the active group after a 3-week treatment. Conclusions: The present study indicates that rTMS treatment leads to improved symptoms in patients with unipolar depression. Furthermore, treatment outcome of real effect was assured in changes of cortical source network.",2309490305.0, Journal Article,2019
345,"Anxiety-Related Coping Styles, Social Support, and Internet Use Disorder.","Objective: The Internet can offer a seemingly safe haven for those being disappointed by relationships in the ""offline world"". Although the Internet can provide lonely people with opportunities to seek for help and support online, complete withdrawal from the offline world comes with costs. It is discussed if people can even become ""addicted"" to the Internet. Of note, meanwhile, many researchers prefer the term Internet use disorder (IUD) instead of using the term ""Internet addiction"". To illustrate the importance of one's own social network supporting a person in everyday life, we investigated, for the first time to our knowledge, how social resources in terms of quality and quantity might represent a buffer against the development of IUD. Furthermore, anxiety related coping styles are investigated as a further independent variable likely impacting on the development of an IUD. Method: In the present work, N = 567 participants (n = 164 males and n = 403 females; Mage = 23.236; SDage = 8.334) filled in a personality questionnaire assessing individual differences in cognitive avoidant and vigilant anxiety processing, ergo, traits describing individual differences in everyday coping styles/modes. Moreover, all participants provided information on individual differences in tendencies toward IUD, the perceived quality of social support received, and the size of their social network (hence a quantity measure). Results: Participants with larger social networks and higher scores in the received social support reported the lowest tendencies toward IUD in our data. A vigilant coping style was positively correlated with tendencies toward IUD, whereas no robust associations could be observed between a cognitive avoidant coping style and tendencies toward IUD. Hierarchical linear regression underlined an important predictive role of the interaction term of vigilance in ego-threat scenarios and perceived quality of social support. Conclusion: The current study not only yields support for the hypothesis that the size of one's own social network as well as the perceived quality of social support received in everyday life present putative resilience factors against developing IUD. It also supports the approach that special coping styles are needed to make use of the social support offered.",2307398933.0, Journal Article,2019
346,"Mental Health Effects in Primary Care Patients 18 Months After a Major Wildfire in Fort McMurray: Risk Increased by Social Demographic Issues, Clinical Antecedents, and Degree of Fire Exposure.","Objectives: To assess prevalence of likely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in patients attending the only out-of-hours primary care clinic in Fort McMurray some 18 months following a major fire. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was used to collect data through self-administered paper-based questionnaires to determine likely PTSD, MDD, and GAD using the PTSD Checklists for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 5, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9, and GAD-7, respectively, from residents of Fort McMurray who were impacted by the wildfires. This was carried out eighteen (18) months after a major wildfire, which required the rapid evacuation of the entire city population (approximately 90,000 individuals). Results: We achieved a response rate of 48% and results from the 290 respondents showed the 1 month prevalence rate for likely PTSD was 13.6%, likely MDD was 24.8%, and likely GAD was 18.0%. Compared to self-reported prevalence rates before the wildfire (0%, 15.2%, and 14.5% respectively), these were increased for all diagnoses. After controlling for other factors in a logistic regression model, there were statistically significant associations between individuals who had likely PTSD, MDD, and GAD diagnoses and multiple socio-demographic, clinical, and exposure-related variables as follows: PTSD: History of anxiety disorder and received counselling had odds ratios (ORs) of 5.80 and 7.14, respectively. MDD: Age, witnessed the burning of homes, history of depressive disorder, and receiving low level support from friends and family had ORs of 2.08, 2.29, 4.63, and 2.5, respectively. GAD: Fearful for their lives or the lives of friends/family, history of depressive disorder, and history of anxiety disorder had ORs of 3.52, 3.04, and 2.68, respectively. There were also associations between individuals with a likely psychiatric diagnosis and those who also had likely alcohol or drug abuse/dependence. Conclusion: Our study suggests there are high prevalence rates for mental health and addiction conditions in patients attending the out-of-hours clinic 18 months after the wildfires, with significant associations between multiple variables and likely PTSD, MDD, and GAD. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of population-based mental health interventions on the long-term mental health effects of the wildfires.",2306494360.0, Journal Article,2019
347,Are Individual Learning Experiences More Important Than Heritable Tendencies? A Pilot Twin Study on Placebo Analgesia.,"Objective: Predicting who will be a placebo responder is a prerequisite to maximize placebo effects in pain treatment and to minimize them in clinical trials. First evidence exists that genetics could affect placebo effects. However, a classical twin study to estimate the relative contribution of genetic influences compared to common and individual environmental influences in explaining interindividual differences in placebo responsiveness has yet not been performed. Methods: In a first explorative twin study, 25 monozygotic (MZ) and 14 dizygotic (DZ) healthy twin pairs (27.5 ± 7.7 years; 73% female) were conditioned to the efficacy of a placebo analgesic ointment with an established heat pain paradigm on their non-dominant arm. Placebo analgesia was then tested on their dominant arm. Furthermore, warmth detection thresholds (WDTs) and heat pain thresholds (HPTs) were assessed, and participants filled in questionnaires for the assessment of psychological traits such as depression, anxiety, optimism, pain catastrophizing, and sensitivity to reward and punishment. Their expectations were determined with a visual analog scale. Results: There was a small but significant placebo analgesic effect in both MZ and DZ twins. Estimates of heritability were moderate for WDT only but negligible for HPT, the conditioning response, and placebo analgesia. Common environment did not explain any variance, and the individual environment explained the largest parts. Therefore, the placebo analgesia response can be seen as influenced by individual learning experiences during the conditioning procedure, whereas other variables assessed were not associated. Conclusions: Compared to the individual learning experience, genetic influences seem to play a minor role in explaining variation in placebo analgesia in this experimental paradigm. However, our results are restricted to placebo effects through conditioning on pain in healthy volunteers and should be replicated in larger samples and in patients. Furthermore, potential gene-environment interactions should be further investigated.",2306490136.0, Journal Article,2019
348,"The Independent and Cumulative Effects of Sibling and Peer Bullying in Childhood on Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal Ideation, and Self-Harm in Adulthood.","Sibling and peer bullying are reported as the most frequent forms of violence experienced across childhood. There is now ample evidence indicating an association between sibling and peer bullying, with those reporting sibling bullying at an increased risk of peer bullying. While there is convincing evidence of a causative association between peer bullying and a range of mental health outcomes, sibling bullying continues to receive far less attention. The aim of this study was to explore whether sibling bullying roles (non-involved, victim, bully-victim, bully) in middle childhood were independently associated with clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety and reports of suicidal ideation and self-harm in early adulthood. We further tested whether there was a cumulative relationship between involvement in sibling and peer bullying victimization. This study was based on up to 3,881 youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth-cohort based in the United Kingdom. Sibling and peer bullying was assessed via self-report when youth were 12 years of age, while depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm were assessed via self-administered computerized interviews at 24 years of age. Involvement as a sibling bully-victim was associated with clinical diagnosis of depression (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.33-2.72), while sibling victims were at increased odds of both suicidal ideation (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-1.98) as well as suicidal self-harm (OR = 2.20, 95% CI, 1.36-3.58) in early adulthood, even after accounting for concurrent peer bullying and a range of other pre-existing childhood confounders. Sibling and peer bullying were further associated in a homotypic manner. A dose-response relationship of bullying in the home and school across mental health outcomes was found. Youth victimized by both their siblings and peers displayed the highest odds of developing clinical depression, suicidal ideation, and self-harm. Children bullied at home and at school had no safe place to escape the bullying and torment. Our findings highlight the need for intervention studies tailored toward reducing sibling bullying, as these may hold large promise for alleviating a range of adverse outcomes, including the prevention of peer bullying, which may be contingent on early bullying experiences in the home environment.",2306223103.0, Journal Article,2019
349,"Implementing a Need-Adapted Stepped-Care Model for Mental Health of Refugees: Preliminary Data of the State-Funded Project ""RefuKey"".","Introduction: Refugees have been shown to be a rather vulnerable population with increased psychiatric morbidity and lack of access to adequate mental health care. By expanding regional psychosocial and psychiatric-psychotherapeutic care structures and adapting psychiatric routine care to refugees' needs, the state-funded project ""refuKey"" based in Lower Saxony, Germany, pursues to ease access to mental health care and increase service quality for refugees. A stepped-care treatment model along with intercultural opening of mental health care services is proposed. Methods: The project is subject to a four-part evaluation study. The first part investigates the state of psychiatric routine care for refugees in Lower Saxony by requesting data from all psychiatric clinics, participating and non-participating ones, regarding the numbers of refugee patients, their diagnoses, settings of treatment, etc. The second part explores experiences and work satisfaction of mental health care professionals treating refugees in refuKey cooperation clinics. The third part consists of interviews and focus group discussions with experts regarding challenges in mental health care of refugees and expectations for improvement through refuKey. The fourth part compares mental health parameters like depression, anxiety, traumatization, somatization, psychoticism, quality of life, as well as ""pathways-to-care"" of refuKey-treated refugees before and after treatment and, in a follow-up, to a non-refuKey-treated refugee control group. Results: RefuKey-treated refugees reported many mental health problems and estimated their mental health burden as high. The symptoms decreased significantly over the course of treatment. Mental health in the refuKey sample was strongly linked to post-migration stressors. Discussion: The state of mental health care for refugees is discussed. Implications for the improvement and the need for adaptation of routine mental health care services are drawn.",2305796689.0, Journal Article,2019
350,"Low Self-Esteem and Its Association With Anxiety, Depression, and Suicidal Ideation in Vietnamese Secondary School Students: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Background: There is a correlation between self-esteem in adolescents and risks and protective factors for their health and welfare. The study was conducted to determine the prevalence of low self-esteem and sociodemographic features related to anxiety, depression, educational stress, and suicidal ideation in secondary school students in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed for this study with participation of 1,149 students in Cantho City in Vietnam. A structured questionnaire was applied to ask about self-esteem, depression, anxiety, educational stress, and suicidal ideation. Results: Students with low self-esteem were detected at a prevalence of 19.4%. High educational stress and physical and emotional abuse by parents or other adults in the household were major risk factors correlated to low self-esteem, while a protective factor for low self-esteem was attending supplementary classes. An association among lower self-esteem and increased anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation was detected. Conclusions: Self-esteem is associated with anxiety, depression, and academic stress, which significantly affect students' quality of life and links to suicidal ideation. These results therefore suggested the need for a school-based or web-based provision aimed at proactively increasing students' self-esteem and skills for dealing with academic stress.",2305796193.0, Journal Article,2019
351,The Optical-Coenaesthetic Disproportion Hypothesis of Feeding and Eating Disorders in the Light of Neuroscience.,"This article builds on and extends the 'optical-coenaesthetic disproportion' (OCDisp) hypothesis of feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) matching data obtained through clinical research with laboratory evidence from neuroscience and neuropsychological studies. The OCDisp hypothesis, developed through the assessment in clinical setting of bodily experience using the IDentity and EAting (IDEA) disorder questionnaire, argues that in persons with FED the internal perception of one's embodied self (i.e., coenaesthesia) is deeply affected (their possibility to feel themselves is weakened or threatened by coenaesthopathic and emotional paroxysms; their bodily feelings are discontinuous over time), and as a compensation to it, these persons experience their own body as an object that is looked at by others. To FED persons, their body is principally given to them as an object 'to be seen.' The other's look serves as an optical prosthesis to cope with hypo- and dis-coenaesthesia and as a device through which persons with FED can define themselves and attenuate the anxiety produced by the conflicts between being-oneself and being-for-others. After describing the OCDisp hypothesis, we will gather evidence supporting it with neuroscience studies on FED. Our focus will be on data pointing to dampened multisensory integration of interoceptive and esteroceptive signals, demonstrating a predominance of the visual afferents toward signals arising within the body. In the final part of the article, we will show consistencies but also draw distinctions between our clinical hypothesis and neuroscience-based data and hypotheses and draft a potential agenda for translational research inspired by these.",2305475159.0, Journal Article,2019
352,Self-Rated Effectiveness of Microdosing With Psychedelics for Mental and Physical Health Problems Among Microdosers.,"Background: There is a growing interest in the use of psychedelic substances for health related purposes, including symptom relief for disorders like anxiety, depression, and pain. Although the focus of recent clinical trials has been on high doses of these substances, anecdotal evidence suggests that low (micro) doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing with psychedelics for symptomatic relief is lacking. The present study aimed to investigate, by means of an online questionnaire, the self-rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP) for mental and physiological disorders compared to the conventional prescribed treatment and to regular doses of psychedelics. Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, had experience with microdosing and were diagnosed with at least one mental or physiological disorder by a medical doctor or therapist (N = 410; 7.2%) were included in the analyses. Odds ratio were calculated to compare the SRE of MDP with conventional treatment, and regular psychedelic doses for mental and physiological diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions (""Did it work,"" ""Symptom disappear,"" ""Quality of life improved""). Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was significantly higher compared to that of conventional treatments for both mental and physiological diagnoses; and that these effects were specific for ADHD/ADD and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher, regular psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, while for physiological disorders no difference was shown. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physiological diagnoses is higher compared to conventionally offered treatment options, and lower than regular ('full') psychedelic doses. Future RCTs in patient populations should objectively assess the effectivity claims of psychedelics, and whether these are dose related, disorder specific, and superior to conventional treatments.",2299775421.0, Journal Article,2019
353,Interval Training Improves Depressive Symptoms But Not Anxious Symptoms in Healthy Women.,"Background: Despite important advances in the relationship between exercise and mood disorders, especially regarding moderate-intensity continuous training, there is a lack of information about the chronic effects of interval training protocols. We compared the effects of two different interval training protocols [sprint interval training (SIT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)] on depressive and anxious symptoms in healthy women. Methods: Thirty-six women were randomly allocated to HIIT (n = 18) or SIT (n = 18) groups and performed 24 training sessions over 8 weeks (thrice a week). Levels of state-trait anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory, respectively, before and after training intervention. Results: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal a significant effect of time (p &gt; 0.05), group intervention (p &gt; 0.05), or time × group interaction (p &gt; 0.05) on state-trait anxiety; however, two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of time on depressive symptoms (p = 0.025) but not group effect (p = 0.548) or time × group interaction (p = 0.373). Depressive symptoms of the participants in both HIIT and SIT groups were reduced from baseline, (ΔHIIT) -17.5 ± 27.9% and (ΔSIT) -28.6 ± 47.5%, respectively. Conclusion: HIIT and SIT groups similarly improved depressive symptoms but not anxiety levels in healthy and physically active young adult women.",2299775389.0, Journal Article,2019
354,"Methodology of ""14-7"" Program: A Longitudinal Follow-Up Study of the Pediatric Population and Their Families Exposed to the Terrorist Attack of Nice on July 14th, 2016.","Introduction: After a traumatic event, children and adolescents may present several clinical consequences, the most common being Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Most children and adolescents with PTSD have comorbid disorders, such Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, depression, attachment and anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances and behavior problems. However, epidemiological studies on the development of PTSD and other psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents as a consequence of a terrorist attack and mass murder are lacking. Long-term follow-up of exposed children and adolescents will help identify risk and protective factors of developing psychiatric and psychological conditions after exposure to traumatic events or situations. The main objective of this article is to present the methodology of ""14-7"" program. The aim of ""14-7"" program is to characterize the risk and protective psychosocial factors affecting the clinical evolution of a pediatric population sample, exposed to the terrorist attack of July 14th, 2016 in Nice. Method and Analysis: ""14-7"" program is a multicentre longitudinal cohort study. Major inclusion criteria are children and adolescents exposed to the terrorist attack and aged under 18 years on July 14th, 2016. These children and adolescents will be compared to a non-exposed to the ""14-7"" terrorist attack group, matched on age and gender. Participants will be assessed at baseline (T1), 2 years (T2) and 5 years (T3) after the initial assessment (T1), and every 5 years until they are 25 years old. Multiple domains are assessed: 1) mental health disorders, 2) intensity of PTSD symptoms, 3) intensity of comorbid symptoms, 4) quality of the parent-child relationship, 5) intelligence quotient, 6) parental symptoms. We will also establish a biological collection of saliva samples, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and actigraphy data collection. Main analyses comprise analyses of variance and regression analyses of predictors of clinical evolution over time. Ethics and Dissemination: The National Ethics Committee ""NORD OUEST III"" approved the ""14-7"" Program protocol (number 2017-A02212-51). All patients and their caregivers signed informed consent on enrolment in the ""14-7"" Program. Inclusions started on November 21st, 2017. Three hundred thirty-five individuals have been included (191 children and adolescents, 144 parents).

355,Enhancing Autonomy-Connectedness in Patients With Anxiety Disorders: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Autonomy-enhancing treatment (AET) is a person-centered, gender-sensitive treatment, targeting transdiagnostic personal autonomy deficits. The current study was set up as a first pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the preliminary efficacy of AET. Earlier small non-controlled plots showed AET to be feasible and acceptable. In the current study (Trial Code 3513), patients receiving 15-session group-based AET (N = 43) were compared with those in a waitlist control condition (N = 40). Both the intention-to-treat and completers analyses suggested a larger decrease in agoraphobic symptoms in the experimental treatment than in the waitlist condition. In both analyses, effect sizes were small. The completers analyses showed additional beneficial effects in two of three autonomy-connectedness components, as well as psychoneuroticism, anxiety, and depression, which disappeared after correcting for multiple testing. AET may alleviate agoraphobic symptoms in a patient sample with severe anxiety. Future research, including more stringent inclusion criteria and follow-up assessment, is needed to further evaluate whether AET may serve as a promising alternative or addition to existing approaches.

356,Internet-Based Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders in Latin America: A Scoping Review.,"Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of mental disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost mental health care in a variety of contexts. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for prevention, treatment, and management of mental disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL). Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America for prevention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of mental disorders. Included studies mainly targeted depression (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and mental health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but overall, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols. Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions.",2299768927.0, Systematic Review,2019
357,Surgery Under General Anesthesia Alleviated the Hyperactivity but Had No Effect on the Susceptibility to PND in ADHD Rats.,"Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a typical neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, particularly in children. Recent studies demonstrated a close relationship between the development of ADHD and surgery under general anesthesia. However, few studies illustrated if ADHD symptoms changed after surgery. Meanwhile, whether these individuals with natural neural impairment were sensitive to postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) still remain unclear. Methods: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were utilized as spontaneous ADHD animal model and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as non-ADHD animal model. We evaluated the variation of neurocognitive function and locomotor activity of the rats undergoing experimental laparotomy with general anesthesia by isoflurane. Neurocognitive function was assessed by fear conditioning test for contextual memory and Morris water maze (MWM) for spatial memory. Depressive-like behavior after surgery was detected by forced swim test, and open-field test and elevated plus maze test were utilized to evaluate locomotor activities and anxiety. Furthermore, we compared electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in ADHD and WKY rats under free-moving conditions. Afterward, c-Fos staining was also utilized to detect the excitatory activity of neurons in these rats to explore the neural mechanism. Results: Locomotor activity of SHR assessed by average speed and number of line crossings in the open-field test decreased 1 week after surgery under general anesthesia, but there was no difference concerning anxiety levels between SHR and WKY rats after surgery. This phenomenon was also paralleled with the change in EEG signal (delta band 0∼3 Hz). Surgery under general anesthesia had no effect on spatial and contextual memory, while it improved spontaneous depression in SHR. The expression of c-Fos was downregulated for at least 1 week in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) area of ADHD rats' brain after surgery. Conclusion: ADHD rats were not sensitive to PND. Surgery with general anesthesia could partly improve the hyperactivity symptom of ADHD rats. This mechanism was related to the suppression of neural activity in the cerebral NAc of ADHD rats induced by general anesthetics.",2297127569.0, Journal Article,2019
358,"Testing a Neuro-Evolutionary Theory of Social Bonds and Addiction: Methadone Associated With Lower Attachment Anxiety, Comfort With Closeness, and Proximity Maintenance.","Evidence from non-human mammals for the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in prosocial behavior is reasonably extensive and robust; however, studies in humans are lacking. This study tests the neuro-evolutionary hypothesis that exogenous opiates, including morphine, heroine, and methadone, decrease separation anxiety and proximity by hijacking the neuro-peptide endogenous opioid system modulating social bonds. Participants were 486 subjects, 43% male, with ages between 18 and 62 years (M = 26.4; SD = 9.4), divided in three naturalistic groups: 1: addicts in drug-free treatment; 2: addicts in methadone programs; 3: normative non-clinical controls. Instruments: 1) Adult Attachment Scale (AAS) composed of three subscales: Anxiety about being rejected (α = 0.83), Comfort with Intimacy (α = 0.68), and Comfort Depending on Others (α = 0.70). 2) Caregiving Questionnaire composed of four subscales: Proximity Maintenance: (α = 0.83), Sensitivity: (α = 0.76), Controlling Caregiving (α = 0.77) and Compulsive Caregiving (α = 0.68). Results: Multivariate Analysis of Co-variance (MANCOVA) models were computed; gender, age, and education were included in the models. Methadone patients and drug-free treatment addicts were equivalent and reported significantly lower Comfort Depending on Others, Comfort with Intimacy, and Caregiving Proximity. However, methadone users reported significantly lower Anxiety about being rejected than drug-free addicts and were equivalent to non-clinical controls. In addition, correlations between the methadone intake dose and the questionnaires' scales showed that dose was significantly and negatively correlated with Comfort with Closeness (rs = -0.36; p &lt; 0.01) and with Caregiving Proximity (rs = -0.28; p &lt; 0.05).",2297127515.0, Journal Article,2019
359,Psychiatric and Cognitive Aspects of Phenylketonuria: The Limitations of Diet and Promise of New Treatments.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism due to mutations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Reduced PAH activity results in significant hyperphenylalaninemia, which leads to alterations in cerebral myelin and protein synthesis, as well as reduced levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline in the brain. When untreated, brain development is grossly disrupted and significant intellectual impairment and behavioral disturbance occur. The advent of neonatal heel prick screening has allowed for diagnosis at birth, and the institution of a phenylalanine restricted diet. Dietary treatment, particularly when maintained across neurodevelopment and well into adulthood, has resulted in markedly improved outcomes at a cognitive and psychiatric level for individuals with PKU. However, few individuals can maintain full dietary control lifelong, and even with good control, an elevated risk remains of-in particular-mood, anxiety, and attentional disorders across the lifespan. Increasingly, dietary recommendations focus on maintaining continuous dietary treatment lifelong to optimize psychiatric and cognitive outcomes, although the effect of long-term protein restricted diets on brain function remains unknown. While psychiatric illness is very common in adult PKU populations, very little data exist to guide clinicians on optimal treatment. The advent of new treatments that do not require restrictive dietary management, such as the enzyme therapy Pegvaliase, holds the promise of allowing patients a relatively normal diet alongside optimized mental health and cognitive functioning.",2297126057.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
360,ERP Evidence for Inhibitory Control Deficits in Test-Anxious Individuals.,"Introduction: Individuals with test anxiety [i.e., high test anxiety (HTA)] always treat tests/examinations as a potential threat. This cognitive mode impairs these individuals' ability of inhibitory control and leads to a high level of anxiety. However, characterizing aspects of HTA's impaired inhibitory control ability are unclear and need to be studied. Methods: Forty-six participants were recruited and divided into a HTA (N = 26) and low test anxiety (LTA; i.e., healthy control; N = 20) group. Self-reports (Test Anxiety Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for negative emotions) were obtained. An emotional Stroop (ES) task and a numerical Stroop (NS) task, causing different types of interferences, were used for assessing the emotional and cognitive aspects of attentional control ability (behavioral data). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were registered to further assess processing stages related to different aspects of attentional control ability. Results: Compared with the LTA group, the HTA group has inhibitory control deficits of both emotional (see ERP components P1-P2-N2 and P3) and cognitive (see ERP component P3) interference. Compared with the LTA group, the HTA doesn't have lower accuracy in neither ES nor NS but displays longer reaction times only in ES. Additionally, the HTA group's ES results also show that (1) the degree of emotional interference indicates the level of an individual's anxiety, and (2) the ERP component P2 may serve as an index of the level of test anxiety. Conclusion: HTA individuals have extensive inhibitory deficits for both emotional and cognitive aspects; however, impairment impacts more on emotional aspects than on cognitive aspects. Additionally, as compared to NS, the negative impact of more impaired processing stages on task performance is more substantial in ES.",2297125443.0, Journal Article,2019
361,"Caregiver Burdens Associated With Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Caregiver Survey of Experiences, Attitudes, and Perceptions.","Background: Previous qualitative studies indicate high caregiver burden associated with providing care for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). In this study, we report the first quantitative data to characterize the burdens of caring for a person living with TRS. To better understand the potential added burdens of persistent positive symptoms, we compared the self-reported burdens of caregiving for people living with TRS versus caregiving for those whose positive schizophrenia symptoms respond to treatment (comparator group). Methods: Non-professional adult caregivers providing ≥20 h/week of care to individuals with schizophrenia completed an online survey. Allocation to the TRS or comparator groups was based on caregiver report. TRS was defined as failure of ≥2 separate antipsychotics and at least moderate severity in two of four persistent core positive symptoms despite medication adherence. Care recipients in the comparator schizophrenia group had no clinically significant positive symptoms. Results: One hundred seventy seven caregivers (n = 100 TRS group, n = 77 comparator group) completed the online survey. Caregivers in both groups reported high levels of every day involvement in most aspects of daily life, including assistance with basic tasks, housekeeping, and in providing emotional support. There were no significant differences between groups on overall social life or health. However, caregivers of people living with TRS were significantly more likely to be experiencing stress (76% vs. 53%) and anxiety (58% vs. 43%). Relevant differences between caregiver groups were also noted for mean number of hours spent per week on direct care (TRS group vs. comparator group: 61.1 h/week vs. 39.7 h/week, respectively) and time spent ""on call"" (162.8 h/week vs. 121.6 h/week). Amongst the caregivers in the TRS group, correlation analyses revealed moderate positive correlations between the reported burden of individual persistent positive symptoms with overall caregiver burden. Conclusion: Our findings show that caring for a person living with TRS places considerable burden on caregivers' lives, with the severity of the disease (and especially severity of positive symptoms) driving further burden, as highlighted by a number of quantitative differences between the TRS and comparator groups.",2297125383.0, Journal Article,2019
362,Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Self-Harm Behaviors in Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome.,"Introduction: Major symptoms of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) are tics, but in 90% of cases, psychiatric comorbidities occur. Self-harm behaviors (SHBs) could result from deliberate action and unintentional injury from tics. Methods: We examined 165 consecutive GTS patients aged 5 to 50 years (75.8% males). The median duration of GTS was 14 years (interquartile range, 9-22 years). The patients were evaluated for GTS and comorbid mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Self-harm behavior was diagnosed during the interview. To determine a direct relationship between SHB and clinical variables, we conducted two analyses, at the time of evaluation and lifetime. We also compared the group of children and adults with SHB. We also tried to distinguish between deliberate (non-tic-related SHB) and accidental (tic-related SHB). Results: Lifetime SHB was reported by 65 patients (39.4%), and in 55 of the cases, it was present at the time of evaluation. The age at the onset of SHB was reported in 55 of the cases (84.6%), and the median was 10 years (interquartile range, 7-13 years). In 30 of the patients (46.2%), SHB was evaluated as mild; in 26 (40%), as moderate; and in only 9 cases (13.9%), as severe. In the multivariable analysis for the predictor of lifetime SHB, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p = 0.016) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; p = 0.042) were determined as risk factors, while for current SHB, only tic severity (p &lt; 0.0001) was statistically significant. When comparing predictors of SHB for children and adults, tic severity was determined as predictor for lifetime SHB in children (p &lt; 0.0001), while the anxiety disorder was associated with lifetime SHB in adults (p = 0.05). Similarly, tic severity was a predictor of current SHB in the children group (p = 0.001), but this was not confirmed for adults. The group of patients with tic-related and non-tic-related SHB did not differ. Conclusions: Self-harm behavior appears mostly in children and adolescents and rarely begins in adulthood. Self-harm behavior is associated mainly with tic severity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Clinical correlates of SHB are age related and differ at different points of life. Tic severity is the main factor associated with SHB in children. In the adult group, anxiety disorder and other psychiatric comorbidities may play the most important role.",2296126428.0, Journal Article,2019
363,"Significant PTSD and Other Mental Health Effects Present 18 Months After the Fort Mcmurray Wildfire: Findings From 3,070 Grades 7-12 Students.","Background: The May 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada forced evacuation of the population of 88,000 individuals and destroyed 10% of the homes. Youth are particularly impacted by disaster. Methods: Eighteen months after the wildfire, Fort McMurray Public and Catholic Schools surveyed 3,252 of the 4,407 students in Grades 7-12 to determine possible long-term psychological impacts. The survey included validated measurement scales for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, quality of life, self-esteem, and resilience. Data analysis was possible for only 3,070 students, i.e., 70% of the total student population. Anonymized data were analyzed to compare students who directly experienced lesser or greater impact from the wildfire, with greater impact defined as personally seeing the fire or having one's home destroyed. Also, students with greater or lesser scores on the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) were compared. Results: Of the 3,070 students, 37% met criteria for probable PTSD; 31% met criteria for probable depression, and 17% for probable depression of at least moderate severity; 27% of students met criteria for probable anxiety, and 15% for probable alcohol or substance use disorder; 46% of all students met criteria for one or more probable diagnosis of PTSD, depression, anxiety, or alcohol/substance abuse, and this included students who were both present and not present in Fort McMurray at the time of the wildfire. Students with greater impact from the wildfire exhibited significantly higher scores on measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol/substance use. They also had lower self-esteem and quality of life scores. Students with lower resilience scores exhibited a similar pattern. Conclusions: These findings highlight first the negative impact of disasters on youth mental health, particularly for those who directly experience wildfire, and second the role of resilience on youth mental health, with lower resilience associated with substantially lower mental health outcomes. These results emphasize the need for long-term mental health supports for youth post-disaster, with specific focus on increasing youth resilience, which may serve as a protective factor against effects of disaster on mental health.",2296126097.0, Journal Article,2019
364,Altered Interoceptive Processing in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-A Heartbeat-Evoked Potential Research.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. The brain's dysfunctional processing of interoceptive information is increasingly recognized as an important component of anxiety disorders. However, the neural mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In the present study, patients with GAD and healthy control participants underwent an eyes-closed (EC) resting state (interoception) and eyes-open (EO) resting state (exteroception) without paying conscious attention to heartbeat. Electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded at the same time. The results show that in healthy controls, the heartbeat-evoked brain potential (HEP) was modulated by the conditions, with a significantly higher amplitude under EC than EO, while this was not the case in GAD patients. Further analysis revealed that the dysfunction of HEP modulation in GAD patients may be attributed to excessive interoceptive processing under EO, with a marginally higher HEP in GAD than in the healthy controls. Finally, the right prefrontal HEP amplitude during EC condition was significantly correlated with the severity of the patients' anxiety symptoms. Our results suggest that altered cortical processing of interoceptive signals may play an important role in the pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder.",2296125994.0, Journal Article,2019
365,"rTMS Reduces Psychopathological Burden and Cocaine Consumption in Treatment-Seeking Subjects With Cocaine Use Disorder: An Open Label, Feasibility Study.","Introduction: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) currently represents a notable public health concern, linked with significant disability, high chances of chronicity, and lack of effective pharmacological or psychological treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is supposed to be a potential therapeutic option for addictive disorders. Aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of rTMS on (1) cocaine craving and consumption and (2) other comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Methods: Twenty treatment seeking CUD subjects underwent 2 weeks of intensive rTMS treatment (15Hz; 5 days/week, twice a day for a total of 20 stimulation sessions) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, followed by 2 weeks of maintenance treatment (15Hz, 1 day/week, twice a day). Sixteen patients completed the study. Patients were evaluated at baseline (T0), after 2 weeks of treatment (T1), and at the end of the study (T2; 4 weeks), with the following scales: Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and the Insomnia Severity Index. Results: After four weeks of rTMS treatment, 9 out of 16 subjects (56.25%) had a negative urinalysis test, with a significant conversion rate with respect to baseline (Z = -3.00; p = 0.003). Craving scores significantly improved only at T2 (p = 0.020). The overall psychopathological burden, as measured by the SCL-90 Global Severity Index (GSI), significantly decreased during the study period (Z = -2.689; p = 0.007), with a relevant improvement with regards to depressive symptoms, anhedonia, and anxiety. Subjects exhibiting lower baseline scores on the SCL-90 were more likely to be in the positive outcome group at the end of the study (Z = -3.334; p = 0.001). Discussion: Findings from this study are consistent with previous contributions on rTMS use in subjects with cocaine use disorder. We evidenced a specific action on some psychopathological areas and a consequent indirect effect in terms of relapse prevention and craving reduction. A double-blind, sham-controlled, neuro-navigated rTMS study design is needed, in order to confirm the potential benefits of this technique, opening new scenarios in substance use disorders treatment.",2296125993.0, Journal Article,2019
366,Do Primary Emotions Predict Psychopathological Symptoms? A Multigroup Path Analysis.,"Background: Research involving animal models has repeatedly proposed dysregulations in subcortically rooted affective systems as a crucial etiological factor in the development of a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, empirical studies with human participants testing these hypotheses have been sparse. Associations between primary emotions systems and different psychiatric symptoms were investigated in order to gain insights into the influence of evolutionary-rooted primary emotions on psychopathology. Material and Methods: The community sample included 616 adults (61.9% female). 243 reported a psychiatric lifetime diagnosis. By applying path analysis, we estimated paths between SEEKING, ANGER, FEAR, SADNESS, CARE, and PLAY (Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales; ANPS) and symptoms of substance abuse (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test; ASSIST) as well as depression, anxiety, and somatization (Brief Symptom Inventory; BSI-18). To examine the moderator effects of gender and psychiatric lifetime diagnosis, multigroup analysis was applied. Results: Substance abuse was associated with male sex (β = -.25), SADNESS (β = .25), and ANGER (β = .10). Depression was associated with SADNESS (β = .53), FEAR (β = .10), SEEKING (β = -.10), and PLAY (β = -.15). Anxiety was linked to SADNESS (β = .33), FEAR (β = .21) and PLAY (β = -.10). Somatization was associated with SADNESS (β = .26) and PLAY (β = -.12; all p &lt; .001). Multigroup analysis revealed no differences in paths between tested groups (all p &gt; .01). The model explained 14% of the variance of substance abuse, 52% of depression, 32% of anxiety, and 14% of somatization. Conclusions: The results further our understanding of the differential role of primary emotions in the development of psychopathology. In this, the general assumption that primary emotion functioning might be a valuable target in mental health care is underlined.",2296125964.0, Journal Article,2019
367,A Pilot Digital Intervention Targeting Loneliness in Youth Mental Health.,"Background: Loneliness is an emerging issue for young people, but yet many interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on providing social opportunities. While these sorts of interventions may appear to increase social connections, loneliness is more related to quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus, interventions addressing loneliness should focus on maximizing the quality of current relationships. Together with youth consumers both with mental ill health and those without, we developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program delivers positive psychology content designed to improve relationship quality. We tested the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of the program in lonely young people with or without a mental health diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. We used a mixed method study design to triangulate pilot quantitative and qualitative data in young people with and without social anxiety disorder (SAD). Method: Nine participants with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (M age = 21.00; SD = 1.41) and 11 participants with no mental health conditions (M age = 20.36; SD = 2.16) completed the +Connect digital intervention. Results: Those with social anxiety disorder reported less acceptable ratings on outcomes. Feasibility ratings, measured by uptake and app completion, met a priori threshold criteria in both groups. Those with social anxiety disorder yielded more attrition, with almost double the attrition rate compared with those without the disorder. There were no safety issues elicited during the pilot study. In terms of outcomes, exploratory analyses indicated that the app itself is likely to be beneficial rather than cause harm. Our qualitative data indicated both groups reported no negative outcomes and noted that positive outcomes were driven by three processes: reflection, learning, and real-life application. Further exploratory data on usability indicated room for improvement in terms of giving more support for different components of the app (i.e., challenges). Conclusion: The pilot findings of this proof-of-concept app indicates some promise in terms of a second iterative version of +Connect.",2288721121.0, Journal Article,2019
368,"Smooth Sailing: A Pilot Study of an Online, School-Based, Mental Health Service for Depression and Anxiety.","Background: Schools play an important role in supporting young people's mental health, but face challenges identifying and responding to students in need of care. To assist secondary schools, the Black Dog Institute has developed an online, school-based, mental health service (Smooth Sailing). Delivered in the classroom, Smooth Sailing uses a website to screen, assess, allocate, and deliver care for depression and anxiety. The service is based on the principles of stepped care, offering treatments with varied intensity and follow-up by a school counselor when necessary. The current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of this new type of service among secondary school students. Methods: Between February and June 2017, a single-arm, pre-post, pilot study was conducted among students from four NSW secondary schools. Schools were given access to the service for 6 weeks. Feasibility measures (consent rates and step allocations), acceptability measures (service use and satisfaction) and safety measures (deterioration in help-seeking intention scores and mental health symptoms) were assessed at baseline and completion of the 6-week trial period. Results: A total of 59 students took part in the service pilot (mean age, 14.57 years; SD, 0.89 years; range, 13-16 years). At baseline, 18.64% of students were found to require follow-up from the school counselor, and 80% of these were new cases. Although completion of the online modules was low, service satisfaction was high. At 6 weeks, the mean scores for help-seeking, depression, and anxiety remained relatively stable or improved. Conclusions: The current study presents important findings for the development and implementation of an online mental health service that screens students' mental health and allocates care accordingly, all within the school setting. Although the findings provide some support for the feasibility, acceptability, and safety, service improvements are needed. The modifications outlined are likely to improve the quality of the service and its effectiveness.

369,Heterogeneity in Disordered Gambling: Decision-Making and Impulsivity in Gamblers Grouped by Preferred Form.,"Background: Previous research has indicated that disordered gamblers display deficits in impulsivity and risky decision-making, compared to healthy control groups. However, disordered gamblers are not a homogenous group, and differences in performance on neurocognitive tasks may be related to the form of gambling in which an individual chooses to engage. The present study used neurocognitive tasks and questionnaire measures to ascertain group differences in gamblers grouped by preferred form of gambling. Method: Treatment-seeking pathological gamblers from the National Problem Gambling Clinic, London (n = 101), completed a neurocognitive assessment comprising the Cambridge gamble task (CGT), the stop-signal task (SST), a probabilistic reversal learning task (PRL), and the Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire, as well as questionnaire measures of gambling severity, impulsivity, depression, and anxiety. Analyses compared gamblers who favored fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) (the modal form) to gamblers who preferred other forms of gambling (non-FOBT). Results: The FOBT group showed impaired decision-making under risk on the CGT compared to the non-FOBT group, choosing the likely option less on more uncertain decisions. The FOBT group made fewer perseverative errors on the PRL task, had lower depression and anxiety scores, and were less likely to have a family history of problem gambling than the non-FOBT group. Discussion: Decision-making and cognitive flexibility differences between gamblers grouped by gambling type supports preferred form as an important source of heterogeneity in gambling disorder. Decision-making strategies and risk attitudes should be considered when approaching cognition-focused treatment strategies, allowing interventions to be targeted at specific cognitive deficits.",2284561135.0, Journal Article,2019
370,Development of a Moderated Online Intervention to Treat Social Anxiety in First-Episode Psychosis.,"Background: It is well established that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a significant clinical problem for individuals with a psychotic disorder. Comorbid social anxiety in individuals with psychosis has been associated with poorer premorbid functioning, increased depression, and a reduced quality of life. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended for people with psychosis as a first-line psychological treatment; however, its focus and evaluation primarily revolves around reducing psychotic symptoms and not necessarily targeting comorbid social anxiety symptoms. We developed a novel online social cognitive behavioral intervention (entitled EMBRACE) specifically designed to treat social anxiety symptoms in first episode psychosis (FEP). Methods: The key clinical and engagement features of the intervention were established through integrating evidence-based material derived from 1) CBT-based treatment models for SAD, 2) relevant literature findings related to psychosis and its clinical correlates (e.g., shame, social rank, and its relationship with social anxiety and paranoia), 3) feedback from youth focus groups in order to inform a user-centered intervention design, and 4) a highly multidisciplinary collaborative development approach to design therapy comics. Results: A detailed description of the final version of the 12-week online social intervention to treat social anxiety in FEP is presented. Conclusion: The EMBRACE intervention was designed to provide young people with the necessary skills and confidence to overcome social anxiety within a supportive, safe online space. By design, it allows young people the opportunity to practice their newly learnt skills to connect with others and in doing so, learn to embrace their true authentic selves.",2283310443.0, Journal Article,2019
371,Psychological Implications of Unemployment Among Bangladesh Civil Service Job Seekers: A Pilot Study.,"Background: Recent trends suggest that university graduates seeking jobs are more susceptible to common mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or stress. However, the mental health issues among unemployed graduates has not been explored in Bangladesh yet. Aims: This study aimed to assess for the first time the prevalence and associated risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) job seekers. Three hundred four graduates residing in Rajshahi, Bangladesh, who were preparing to attend the 40th BCS examination, the most sought-after employment opportunity in the country, were surveyed. Methods: Measures included socio-demographics, field of study, and career-related variables, and the Bangla Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and binary logistic regression with ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" and ""stress"" as the dependent variables were carried out to identify the factors associated with these. Results: Overall, the prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress was 49.3%, 53.6%, and 28.3%, respectively, with no detectable differences between genders. Insecurity related to a BCS job (OR = 0.41; CI = 0.26-0.65, p &lt; 0.001; ref: job insecurity), family and social pressure to obtain a BCS job (OR = 4.58; CI = 1.67-12.56, p &lt; 0.001), and stress (OR = 8.33; CI = 4.47-15.51, p &lt; 0.001) emerged as independent predictors for depression. In addition, having part-time job was associated with anxiety (OR = 2.38; CI = 1.34-4.23, p = 0.003), and security in a BCS job and serving the nation through this job were negatively associated with stress (OR = 0.59; CI = 0.35-0.98, p = 0.042 vs. OR = 0.59; CI = 0.36-1.00, p = 0.05). Conclusion: The relatively high rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among graduate job seekers should prompt implementation of market force initiatives that incorporate interventions related to the major risk factors uncovered herein.",2281849291.0, Journal Article,2019
372,Psychometric Properties of the Short Form of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) in Chinese Breast Cancer Survivors.,"Objective: Currently, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is emerging as an important issue for long-term breast cancer survivors and is associated with lower quality of life and functional impairment. Given that there is a dearth of research regarding the FCR of Chinese breast cancer survivors, this study investigated whether the short form of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) could detect high FCR and explored the level and characteristics of FCR in breast cancer survivors. Methods: Two hundred forty patients who had undergone successful breast cancer surgery in China submitted their survey through a website. The participants' demographic and medical data, level of FCR, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed. Results: Two hundred seven patients with ages ranging from 19 to 60 years completed the questionnaires. The mean FCR score of the total sample was 18.39. A cutoff score of 12 or higher on the short form of the FCRI was optimal for the detection of high FCR with a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 35%, and the PPV (positive predictive values) and NPV (negative predictive values) were 44% and 98%, respectively. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was 83%. A total of 159 breast cancer survivors (76.81%) experienced high FCR levels (FCR score &gt; 12), characterized by lower functional and overall health than survivors with a low FCR (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The short form of the FCRI is capable of detecting high FCR and is therefore able to assist Chinese breast cancer survivors in receiving appropriate care for reducing FCR.",2280549045.0, Journal Article,2019
373,Similar but Different: Psychological and Psychopathological Features of Primary and Secondary Hikikomori.,"Recently, there has been an increase in reports of hikikomori around the globe, and Ukraine is not an exception. The development of hikikomori is often spurred by a history of aversive or traumatic childhood experience, for example, dysfunctions between parents or between a parent and a child (ambivalent attachment) and difficulties at school (peer rejection). Previously described models of hikikomori development mostly were based on research of mixed cohorts of patients (with and without psychiatric comorbidity). To test whether there was a difference in psychological and psychopathological features between primary hikikomori (HG1, n = 13) and secondary hikikomori (HG2, n = 22) cases comorbid with neurotic, somatoform, and stress-related disorders (F40-48, ICD-10), they were compared with each other and with a healthy control group (CG, n = 28). Sociodemographic data, alexithymia [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-26)], traumatic life events [life experience questionnaire (LEQ)], hostility [Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI)], quality of life [Chaban Quality of Life Scale (CQLS)], and personality traits (Leonhard-Schmieschek Questionnaire) were evaluated. No relevant or statistically significant differences have been found between primary and secondary hikikomori cases, except for greater hostility in the latter. When compared with the healthy control group, the primary hikikomori cases were found to have higher frequency of alexithymia, life span traumatic events (7 ± 3.6), as well as higher levels of resentment and verbal hostility, and a bigger aggression index. In secondary hikikomori cases, higher irritability and resentment have been observed, with more dysthymia, excitability, and anxiety; and although the frequency of psychological traumas was lower (5.5 ± 4), it was still significant. Primary and secondary hikikomori had largely similar characteristics in the Ukrainian sample studied, but more studies with larger samples are needed to validate generalizability of the findings.",2280548989.0, Journal Article,2019
374,"A Pilot Study About the Dysfunction of Adipose Tissue in Male, Sleep Apneic Patients in Relation to Psychological Symptoms.","Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its cardiometabolic alterations are closely associated with visceral obesity. Patients with OSA frequently present with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Although these subjective symptoms of OSA are the result of complex biological dysregulation, it remains unclear if they have a direct effect on the dysfunction of adipose tissue. Methods: In a pilot, prospective, randomized study, we evaluated 10 recently diagnosed male patients with severe OSA by full polysomnography (PSG) and 4 male non-apneic subjects matched for age and body mass index (BMI) with abdomen adipose tissue biopsies. Subjects with diabetes/prediabetes and cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases and who are current smokers were excluded. All patients underwent anthropometric measurements and completed the following questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D). Fasting venous blood samples were collected on the day after PSG, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., after an overnight fast. Fat biopsies were performed at the same time periods and adipose tissue samples of 300 mg were obtained from abdominal fat. Fat cell size, extent of fibrosis, vascularity, leukocyte common antigen inflammatory infiltration, and tissue macrophage accumulation were microscopically evaluated. Results: The mean age of the group was 47.4 ± 13.8 years, with mean BMI of 35.8 ± 4.8 kg/m2 and mean apnea-hypopnea index of 79.4 ± 46.1 events per hour of sleep (severe OSA). HADS-A and HADS-D scores were 5.8 ± 2.3 (3.0-8.0) and 4.7 ± 2.3 (2.0-8.0), respectively. HADS-A score correlated positively with macrophage accumulation in fat biopsy (r = 0.82, p = 0.047), whereas ESS, FSS, and HADS-D did not. Severity of fibrosis correlated largely with waist circumference (r = -0.66, p = 0.038) and neck circumference (r = -0.790, p = 0.006). Respiratory events correlated negatively with the extent of vascularization of adipose tissue (r = -0.614, p = 0.05). Conclusions: In the preliminary results of our pilot study, we assessed that the symptoms of anxiety mainly contribute to macrophage accumulation, whereas the increased number of respiratory events reduces the extent of vascularization in visceral fat in OSA. Based on this observation, further larger studies are required to verify if anxious OSA patients are more vulnerable to the metabolic manifestations of the syndrome.",2272737759.0, Journal Article,2019
375,Mothers With Postpartum Psychiatric Disorders: Proposal for an Adapted Method to Assess Maternal Sensitivity in Interaction With the Child.,"About 15% of mothers suffer from postpartum psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or psychosis. Numerous studies have shown maternal caregiving behavior to be negatively affected under these circumstances. The current study sets out to shed light on specific caregiving behaviors of affected mothers in the context of parental mental illness at an early stage. There are several methods to assess maternal caregiving behavior in terms of sensitivity. However, all of them have limitations regarding the peculiarities of mothers with postpartum disorders, that is, changes in affect regulation, and the early onset of the disorder postpartum. With the current study, we provide an adapted method to assess maternal sensitivity based on methods recently approved in attachment research. Two groups of mothers, who were either healthy or had different postpartum disorders, were recorded on video during interactions with their infants. Behaviors were rated regarding responsiveness, promptness, appropriateness, intrusiveness, and positive and negative affect. A first analysis revealed an increased number of deficits on all subscales in mothers with postpartum psychiatric disorders as compared to healthy mothers. Depressive mothers with a single diagnosis had lower scores in responsiveness, promptness, and appropriateness and higher scores on intrusiveness as compared to those in healthy mothers. Here, maternal behavior appears more parent-centered, whereas affect seemed to be relatively unharmed. Moreover, as compared to healthy mothers, mothers with comorbid depression and anxiety symptomatology achieved lower scores on responsiveness, appropriateness, and positive affect and higher scores on intrusiveness and negative affect. It is suggested, that increased deficits are related to the severity of illness in mothers with comorbidities. Results on promptness indicate that these mothers are still capable of maintaining higher vigilance to infant cues. Variance in maternal behavior was relatively high in clinical mothers, showing that some of them are well capable of behaving in a sensitive manner toward their child. One strength of our adapted method is that particular aspects of sensitive parent-child interactions are assessed separately. This may shed light on specific behavior patterns of different postpartum psychiatric disorders, which may in turn relate to specific child outcomes. The manual is open for usage, while reliability testing is required.",2270017844.0, Journal Article,2019
376,New Frontiers in Anxiety Research: The Translational Potential of the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis.,"After decades of being overshadowed by the amygdala, new perspectives suggest that a tiny basal forebrain region known as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may hold key insights into understanding and treating anxiety disorders. Converging research indicates that the amygdala and BNST play complementary but distinct functional roles during threat processing, with the BNST specializing in the detection of a potential threat to maintain hypervigilance and anxiety, while the amygdala responds to the perceived presence of an aversive stimulus (i.e., fear). Therefore, given that human anxiety is largely driven by future-oriented hypothetical threats that may never occur, studies involving the BNST stand at the forefront of essential future research with the potential to bring about profound insights for understanding and treating anxiety disorders. In this article, we present a narrative review on the BNST, summarizing its roles in anxiety and the stress response and highlighting the most recent advances in the clinical realm. Furthermore, we discuss oversights in the current state of anxiety research and identify avenues for future exploration.",2268574461.0, Journal Article,2019
377,No Reason to Feel Sick? Nocebo Responses in the Placebo Arms of Experimental Endotoxemia Studies.,"Adverse side effects are reported by a large proportion of patients undergoing medical treatment in clinical practice or clinical trials. Nocebo effects, induced by negative treatment expectancies, can contribute to negative patient-reported outcomes but have rarely been studied in the context of inflammatory or immune-related conditions. Based on perceived treatment allocation, we herein analyzed nocebo responders in the placebo arms of randomized controlled double-blind experimental endotoxemia studies. We hypothesized that nocebo responders would report more bodily sickness symptoms and greater mood impairment. Out of N = 106 participants who had all received placebo injection, N = 20 (18.9%) wrongly believed they had received endotoxin and were thus considered as nocebo responders. Nocebo responders reported significantly more bodily sickness symptoms, suggesting that the perception of bodily symptoms affected perceived treatment allocation. Against our expectations, we did not find differences between nocebo responders and controls in psychological or physiological parameters. However, exploratory correlational analysis within nocebo responders revealed that more pronounced bodily sickness symptoms in response to placebo were associated with greater state anxiety and negative mood, as well as with the psychological traits catastrophizing and neuroticism. Our findings support that negative affectivity and personality-related factors may contribute to the reporting of sickness symptoms. Nonspecific symptoms experienced by patients undergoing pharmacological treatments or in randomized controlled trials can be misinterpreted and/or misattributed as unwanted side effects affecting perceived treatment allocation and presumably treatment satisfaction or its perceived efficacy. More nocebo research in the context of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions is warranted.",2268573915.0, Journal Article,2019
378,Psychometric Evaluation of the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) as a Depression Severity Scale in Chinese Patients With Coronary Artery Disease. Findings From the MEDEA FAR-EAST Study.,"Background: It is highly recommended that all patients with coronary artery disease should be screened for depression. The Major Depression Inventory (MDI) is a widely used self-rating scale for the assessment of depression but is not valid in Chinese language. The present study was designed to assess the reliability and validity of a version of the MDI translated into Chinese among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: Data were derived from the ""Multicenter Delay in Patients Experiencing Acute Myocardial Infarction in Shanghai"" (MEDEA FAR-EAST) study. Using a cross-sectional study design, the Chinese version of the MDI was administered to a total of 267 inpatients. The internal consistency reliability of the MDI scale was evaluated based on the Cronbach's coefficient and the binary coefficient for the whole scale. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the internal consistency of the MDI. To examine discriminant validity, we analyzed the correlation of the MDI score with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) scale scores. Results: The Chinese version of the MDI showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.909, split-half reliability = 0.866). We identified one factor that explained 52% of the variance, which indicated that the MDI has satisfactory structural validity. The correlations of the MDI scores with the GAD-7 scores (r = 0.425) and the WHO-5 scores (r = -0.365) were moderate, suggesting that the MDI has acceptable discriminant validity. Conclusions: The MDI was proved to be a highly reliable and satisfactory valid diagnostic screening tool to assess depression in Chinese cardiac patients.",2268573864.0, Journal Article,2019
379,A Literature Overview of Virtual Reality (VR) in Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Recent Advances and Limitations.,"In this paper, we conduct a literature survey on various virtual reality (VR) treatments in psychiatry. We collected 36 studies that used VR to provide clinical trials or therapies for patients with psychiatric disorders. In order to gain a better understanding of the management of pain and stress, we first investigate VR applications for patients to alleviate pain and stress during immersive activities in a virtual environment. VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that, exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression, cognition, even social functions. We review empirical evidence from VR-based treatments on psychiatric illnesses such as dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), schizophrenia and autism. Through cognitive training and social skill training, rehabilitation through VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Recent advances in VR technology also demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive and functional impairments in dementia. In terms of the different types of VR systems, we discuss the feasibility of the technology within different stages of dementia as well as the methodological limitations. Although there is room for improvement, its widespread adoption in psychiatry is yet to occur due to technical drawbacks such as motion sickness and dry eyes, as well as user issues such as preoccupation and addiction. However, it is worth mentioning that VR systems relatively easily deliver virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. In the future, VR systems may become an innovative clinical tool for patients with specific psychiatric symptoms.",2268573757.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
380,Problem Behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Considering Core Symptom Severity and Accompanying Sleep Disturbance.,"In addition to the core symptoms that define autism spectrum disorder (ASD), many individuals experience broader problem behavior at a level significant enough for families to seek further clinical assessment and intervention. We define ""problem behavior"" as any significant emotional or behavioral issue captured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) including anxiety, depression, withdrawal, somatic complaints, problems with socialization, thought or attention, rule-breaking, and aggression. While greater ASD symptom severity and accompanying sleep disturbance have each been linked with more severe problem behavior, there is little understanding about how these two key factors interact; that is, it is unclear whether the severity and type of sleep disturbance an individual experiences differentially influences the relationship between ASD symptom severity and problem behavior. The aim of the current study was, thus, to explore whether the link between greater ASD symptom severity and clinically elevated problem behavior is moderated by the presence/degree of accompanying sleep disturbance. Forty males with ASD, aged 5-12, participated in the study. The Social Responsiveness Scale, CBCL, and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire were administered to obtain information about ASD symptom severity, problem behavior, and sleep habits, respectively. Results indicated that the relationship between ASD symptom severity and problem behavior differed among individuals with ASD depending on the degree of sleep disturbance they experienced. Specifically, there was a significant positive relationship between ASD symptom severity and problem behavior for individuals with no sleep disturbance or milder sleep disturbance (i.e., in these cases, individuals with severe ASD symptoms experienced clinically elevated problem behavior, while those with milder ASD symptoms experienced milder problem behavior). In contrast, there was no significant relationship between ASD symptom severity and problem behavior for individuals with moderate-to-severe sleep disturbance; rather, clinically significant problem behavior was apparent across all individuals irrespective of ASD symptom severity. Follow-up analyses indicated that disturbances in sleep duration, disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness were related to clinically elevated problem behavior even among those with milder ASD symptoms. These findings emphasize the importance of routinely assessing for accompanying sleep disturbance in this population regardless of whether individuals present with mild, moderate, or severe ASD.",2266349423.0, Journal Article,2019
381,"Associations Between Anxiety, Body Mass Index, and Sex Hormones in Women.","Background: Several studies have shown a positive association between anxiety and obesity, particularly in women. We aimed to study whether sex hormone alterations related to obesity might play a role in this association. Patients and methods: Data for this study were obtained from a population-based cohort study (the LIFE-Adult-Study). A total of 3,124 adult women (970 premenopausal and 2,154 postmenopausal) were included into the analyses. The anxiety symptomatology was assessed using the GAD-7 questionnaire (cut-off ≥ 10 points). Sex hormones were measured from fasting serum samples. Results: We did not find significant differences in anxiety prevalence in premenopausal obese women compared with normal-weight controls (4.8% vs. 5.5%). Both obesity and anxiety symptomatology were separately associated with the same sex hormone alteration in premenopausal women: higher total testosterone level (0.97 ± 0.50 in obese vs. 0.86 ± 0.49 nmol/L in normal-weight women, p = 0.026 and 1.04 ± 0.59 in women with vs. 0.88 ± 0.49 nmol/L in women without anxiety symptomatology, p = 0.023). However, women with anxiety symptomatology had non-significantly higher estradiol levels than women without anxiety symptomatology (548.0 ± 507.6 vs. 426.2 ± 474.0 pmol/L), whereas obesity was associated with lower estradiol levels compared with those in normal-weight group (332.7 ± 386.5 vs. 470.8 ± 616.0 pmol/L). Women with anxiety symptomatology had also significantly higher testosterone and estradiol composition (p = 0.006). No associations of sex hormone levels and BMI with anxiety symptomatology in postmenopausal women were found. Conclusions: Although both obesity and anxiety symptomatology were separately associated with higher testosterone level, there was an opposite impact of anxiety and obesity on estradiol levels in premenopausal women. We did not find an evidence that the sex hormone alterations related to obesity are playing a significant role in anxiety symptomatology in premenopausal women. This could be the explanation why we did not find an association between obesity and anxiety. In postmenopausal women, other mechanisms seem to work than in the premenopausal group.",2264216504.0, Journal Article,2019
382,Diminished Value Discrimination in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Prospect Theory Model of Decision-Making Under Risk.,"Introduction: It has been hypothesized that people diagnosed with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit behavioral aberrations when faced with the potential for negative outcomes, but the specific cognitive aspects of decision-making that may be altered have not been systematically studied in clinical populations. Here, we studied decision-making in a clinical cohort using a task that allows for examination of the decision weights and values associated with different choice outcomes. Methods: Patients diagnosed with OCD (n = 10), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 15), social anxiety disorder (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 20) were given a decision-making task and choices were modeled using a cumulative prospect theory framework. Results: We found OCD patients to have lower value discrimination than controls, as well as less optimal performance on the task, an effect that was mostly driven by trials with only positive outcomes. Discussion: Our results shed light on the cognitive processes that drive altered decision-making under risk in OCD. Specifically, they demonstrate that OCD patients have diminished sensitivity to positive outcomes, which might be associated with risk aversion and altered learning of gain. These findings also extend prior reports, suggesting that altered cognitive processing during decision-making is linked to altered perception of value, but not probability, in these patients.",2263323900.0, Journal Article,2019
383,Assessment of Moral Injury in Veterans and Active Duty Military Personnel With PTSD: A Review.,"Background: Moral injury (MI) involves distress over having transgressed or violated core moral boundaries, accompanied by feelings of guilt, shame, self-condemnation, loss of trust, loss of meaning, and spiritual struggles. MI is often found in Veterans and Active Duty Military personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MI is widespread among those with PTSD symptoms, adversely affects mental health, and may increase risk of suicide; however, MI is often ignored and neglected by mental health professionals who focus their attention on PTSD only. Methods: A review of the literature between 1980 and 2018 conducted in 2018 is presented here to identify scales used to assess MI. Databases used in this review were PsychInfo, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar. Search terms were ""moral injury,"" ""measuring,"" ""screening,"" ""Veterans,"" and ""Active Duty Military."" Inclusion criteria were quantitative measurement of MI and health outcomes, Veteran or Active Duty Military status, and peer-review publication. Excluded were literature reviews, dissertations, book chapters, case reports, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 730 studies identified, most did not meet eligibility criteria, leaving 118 full text articles that were reviewed, of which 42 did not meet eligibility criteria. Of the remaining 76 studies, 34 were duplicates leaving 42 studies, most published in 2013 or later. Of 22 studies that assessed MI, five used scales assessing multiple dimensions, and 17 assessed only one or two aspects (e.g., guilt, shame, or forgiveness). The remaining 20 studies used one of the scales reported in the first 22. Of the five scales assessing multiple dimensions of MI, two assess both morally injurious events and symptoms and the remaining three assess symptoms only. All studies were cross-sectional, except three that tested interventions. Conclusions: MI in the military setting is widespread and associated with PTSD symptom severity, anxiety, depression, and risk of suicide in current or former military personnel. Numerous measures exist to assess various dimensions of MI, including five multidimensional scales, although future research is needed to identify cutoff scores and clinically significant change scores. Three multidimensional measures assess MI symptoms alone (not events) and may be useful for determining if treatments directed at MI may both reduce symptoms and impact other mental health outcomes including PTSD.",2259919814.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
384,Information Needs of Patients About Immunosuppressive Medication in a German Kidney Transplant Sample: Prevalence and Correlates.,"Background: Worldwide clinical guidelines for the care of kidney transplant (KT) recipients recognize the importance of health care providers imparting appropriate immunosuppressive medication (ISM) information for the facilitation of safe medication self-management. The extent of medication information made available is, however, not necessarily what patients require to know about their prescribed medicines. A useful indicator for determining the quality of prescription practice is to what degree the provided information meets the personal needs of patients. No previous studies have focused on the ISM information needs of KT patients. This study aims to investigate how satisfied KT patients are with the provided ISM information and to examine the association between satisfaction levels and socio-demographic, psychosocial, and transplant-related variables. Materials and Methods: KT patients (n = 440) were asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires to evaluate the variables adherence, ISM experience, perceived social support, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and transplant-related information (e.g., donation type). ISM information needs were assessed with the Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS-D). Results: On average, 35.9% of the answers to the SIMS-D items indicated dissatisfaction with the received information; dissatisfaction was more prevalent for the SIMS-D subscale ""potential problems"" (46.1%) than the SIMS-D subscale ""action and usage"" (26.7%). On an individual item level, the dissatisfaction with information concerning ISM side effects on drowsiness (57.1%) and sex life (56.3%) was most notable. Higher satisfaction with ISM information was correlated with higher age, better adherence, higher perceived social support, and lower anxiety levels. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that adherence, perceived social support, and age were independently associated with ISM information satisfaction. No associations were found with sex, educational level, partnership status, symptoms of depression, experience of side effects, and transplant-related variables. Discussion: The data indicate that a substantial proportion of KT patients have unmet ISM information needs, especially with regard to potential problems of ISM. Dissatisfaction with ISM information is a potential amendable risk factor for KT patients engaging in non-adherent behavior, thus justifying further research in this area. ISM information should be tailored to meet the individual needs of KT patients in order to promote optimal medication self-management and adherence behavior.",2259919220.0, Journal Article,2019
385,"Type D Personality, Concomitant Depressive and Anxiety Disorders, and Treatment Outcomes in Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders: An Observational Longitudinal Cohort Study.","Objective: To establish the prevalence of Type D personality in patients with somatic symptoms and related disorders and to evaluate the association of Type D personality with treatment outcomes. This study explores the effect of Type D personality and its two traits, negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). Methods: In this longitudinal observational cohort study, we assessed the prevalence of Type D in 212 patients presenting themselves at a clinic in Tilburg, the Netherlands. We explored psychological and physical treatment outcomes of a multimodal treatment tailored to patient needs in relation to Type D scores. We explored the differences with regard to physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression. We also explored the differences between patients with and without Type D personality who completed treatment with regard to the baseline scores of physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression. We explored the association between Type D personality and treatment outcome using the traditional dichotomous method and the dimensional method (with main effects of NA and SI, and the interaction of NA × SI). Results: Of the 212 patients with Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD), those with Type D personality (181: 61.8%) had experienced significantly higher levels of depression [t = 4.404, p &lt; .001] and anxiety [t = 3.757, p &lt; .001]. Of the 212, 187 patients completed treatment. Mean scores improved significantly for the whole patient group after treatment with regard to depression (p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001), and physical symptoms (p &lt; .001). At baseline, patients with Type D personality had significantly higher scores in anxiety [F = 15.707, p &lt; .001] and depression [F = 19.392] than patients without Type D personality who completed treatment. After controlling for the high baseline scores with regard to physical symptoms, anxiety, or depression, only the effect of Type D personality on remission of anxiety was significant (OR = .33, p = 0.39). Neither NA and SI nor the interaction of NA × SI was associated with the treatment outcome. Conclusions: This study shows that Type D personality occurs frequently in patients with SSRD. Type D personality only decreases the probability of remission of anxiety as a treatment outcome, and both NA and SI play a role in this. Type D personality did not decrease remission either of physical symptoms or of depression. Hence, both NA and SI factors may be expressions of anxiety mostly in type D.",2259912200.0, Journal Article,2019
386,The Altered Somatic Brain Network in State Anxiety.,"Highly anxious individuals often show excessive emotional arousal, somatic arousal, and characteristics of mental illness. Previous researches have extensively investigated the emotional and cognitive biases of individuals with high anxiety, but overlooked the spontaneous brain activity and functional connections associated with somatic arousal. In this study, we investigated the relationship between state anxiety and the spontaneous brain activity of the somatosensory cortex in a non-clinical healthy population with state anxiety. Furthermore, we also explored the functional connections of the somatosensory cortex. We found that state anxiety was positively correlated with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) of somatic related brain regions, including the right postcentral gyrus (somatosensory cortex) and the right precentral gyrus (somatic motor cortex). Furthermore, we found that state anxiety was positively correlated with the connections between the postcentral gyrus and the left cerebellum gyrus, whereas state anxiety was negatively correlated with the connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and brain regions including the left inferior frontal cortex and left medial superior frontal cortex. These results revealed the association between the anxious individuals' body-loop and state anxiety in a healthy population, which revealed the importance of somatic brain regions in anxiety symptoms and provided a new perspective on anxiety for further study.",2259362353.0, Journal Article,2019
387,Frustration Tolerance and Personality Traits in Patients With Substance Use Disorders.,"Previous research has suggested the prevalence of certain personality traits, some of which are related to a disorganized attachment, in substance abuse disorders. Further, frustration tolerance (FT) has been proposed as an important factor in addiction, both at the inception-following the ""self-medication"" hypothesis-and regarding treatment compliance. In turn, an inadequate response to frustrating events has been also associated with a disrupted attachment. Our goal is to explore the mediational role of FT in the relationship between personality traits and two different treatments for substance addiction: therapeutic community (TC) and ambulatory treatment (AT). Eighty-four subjects with substance abuse disorder were recruited in total (22 female), including 46 volunteers (13 female) in TC and 38 (9 female) in AT. They were assessed with Rosenzweig's test for FT and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III) test to evaluate personality factors. By comparing with a control sample (335 volunteers, 268 female), we found that FT was lower in patients. Between therapeutic groups, FT was significantly lower in TC. Depressive, antisocial, sadistic, negativistic, schizotypal, borderline, paranoid, anxiety, dysthymia, alcohol use, drug use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), thought disorder, and delusional disorder traits were suggestive of pathology in the clinical samples and were significantly different between control, AT, and TC groups. Further, anxiety and PTSD traits were higher in TC than in AT. A mediational analysis revealed that the effect of anxiety and PTSD scales on therapeutic group was partially mediated by FT. In conclusion, FT and its interplay with personality traits commonly related to disorganized attachment (anxiety and PTSD) might be important factors to consider within therapeutic programs for persons with substance addiction.",2250625604.0, Journal Article,2019
388,Placebo Effect in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety.,"The aim of this review is to evaluate the placebo effect in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Antidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin or norepinephrine in the brain. However, analyses of the published and the unpublished clinical trial data are consistent in showing that most (if not all) of the benefits of antidepressants in the treatment of depression and anxiety are due to the placebo response, and the difference in improvement between drug and placebo is not clinically meaningful and may be due to breaking blind by both patients and clinicians. Although this conclusion has been the subject of intense controversy, the current article indicates that the data from all of the published meta-analyses report the same results. This is also true of recent meta-analysis of all of the antidepressant data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the process of seeking drug approval. Also, contrary to previously published results, the new FDA analysis reveals that the placebo response has not increased over time. Other treatments (e.g., psychotherapy and physical exercise) produce the same benefits as antidepressants and do so without the side effects and health risks of the active drugs. Psychotherapy and placebo treatments also show a lower relapse rate than that reported for antidepressant medication.",2250620747.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
389,Three Weeks of rTMS Treatment Maintains Clinical Improvement But Not Electrophysiological Changes in Patients With Depression: A 6-Week Follow-Up Pilot Study.,"Our previous study demonstrated that 3 weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) increases P200 amplitudes and improves the symptoms of depression and anxiety in depression patients. In the present study, we investigated whether 3 weeks of rTMS treatment maintained the P200 amplitude in patients with depression at 6 weeks of follow-up. We measured the 6-week maintenance effects of rTMS using clinical questionnaires and an auditory oddball paradigm. Twenty-one patients with medication-resistant major depression participated in this pilot study. All patients underwent rTMS treatment for 3 weeks; they completed clinical ratings and performed the auditory oddball task at the pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-week follow-up visit (3 weeks after finishing rTMS treatment). The results revealed an increase in P200 amplitudes as well as improvements in the symptoms of depression and anxiety by 3 weeks of rTMS treatment. Furthermore, the results demonstrated maintenance effects on clinical ratings at 6-week follow-up. Depression and anxiety scales showed improvements in post-treatment and maintenance effects at the 6-week follow-up. Although P200 amplitude showed a significant main effect for 3 time points (baseline, post-treatment, and 6-week follow-up visit), at 2 time point comparisons, P200 amplitudes significantly increased in post-treatment compared to those of the baseline condition but did not show the maintenance effects of long-term rTMS at the 6-week follow-up compared to those of the baseline condition (  p = .173, Bonferroni correction). Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for P200 showed significant activation in the left middle frontal gyrus in post-treatment but no significant activation at the 6-week follow-up. Moreover, the amplitudes of overall topographic distribution were reduced at 6 weeks of follow-up. The 3 weeks of rTMS treatment induced the maintenance of the improvements in the symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, considering the results of the event-related potential (ERP) and sLORETA, 3 weeks of rTMS treatment may not be sufficient to maintain this improvement, implying that a treatment period of more than 3 weeks may be required to reveal the electrophysiological maintenance effect of rTMS.",2246241473.0, Journal Article,2019
390,Long-Lasting Sex-Specific Effects Based On Emotion- and Cognition-Related Behavioral Assessment of Adult Rats After Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder From Different Lengths of Maternal Separation.,"Adverse early life stress is a major cause of vulnerability to various mental disorders in adulthood, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent studies have suggested that early life stress can help the body adapt optimally when faced with stressful trauma in adult life. An interaction may exist between early life stress (e.g., childhood trauma) and vulnerability to PTSD. This study aimed to evaluate emotion-related behaviors and verify the long-lasting effects of cognitive aspects of PTSD after exposure to severe adverse early life stress, such as long-term separation. Adverse early life stress was simulated by subjecting rats to 3 or 6 consecutive hours of maternal separation (MS) daily, from postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 14. Single-prolonged stress (SPS) was simulated on PND 80 to imitate other adulthood stresses of PTSD with gender divisions (M-MS3h-PTSD, F-MS3h-PTSD, M-MS6h-PTSD, F-MS6h-PTSD, M-PTSD, and F-PTSD). After the MS and PTSD sessions, behavioral tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of these treatments, which included an open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), water maze test (WMT), and forced swimming test (FST) to detect anxiety-like behavior (OFT and EPMT), memory behavior (WMT), and depressive behavior (FST). The M-MS3h-PTSD group had fewer time entries into the open arms of EPMT than the F-MS3h-PTSD group, and the M-MS6h-PTSD group demonstrated fewer up-right postures in the OFT than the F-MS6h-PTSD group. The M-MS3h-PTSD group exhibited more exploratory behavior than the M-MS6h-PTSD and M-PTSD groups in the OFT. Less exploratory behavior was observed in the F-MS3h-PTSD group than in the F-MS6h-PTSD group, which demonstrated significantly increased freezing times in the FST compared to the F-PTSD group. The WMT revealed significant differences in learning and memory performance between the M-MS3h-PTSD group and other treatment groups, which were not found in the female rats. These findings demonstrate that an early stressful experience, such as MS, may be involved in helping the body adapt optimally when faced with additional trauma in adulthood, although mild early life stress might benefit learning and memory among males.",2246241382.0, Journal Article,2019
391,Mood Disorders and Severity of Addiction in Alcohol-Dependent Patients Could Be Mediated by Sex Differences.,"Background: Alcohol dependence is highly prevalent in the general population; some differences in alcohol use and dependence between women and men have been described, including outcomes and ranging from biological to social variables. This study aims to compare the severity of alcohol dependence with clinical and psychopathological characteristics between sexes. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in alcohol-dependent outpatients; the recruitment period was 7 years. The assessment of these patients was carried out by obtaining sociodemographic characteristics and using the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Axis I and II (SCID-I and SCID-II), European version of the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scales. Variables were compared and analyzed. Results: The sample was composed of 178 patients (74.2% males and 25.8% females) with a mean age of 46.52 ± 9.86. No sociodemographic differences were found between men and women. Females had a higher rate of suicide attempts and depression symptoms at the treatment onset. When results of EuropASI were compared, females had worse psychological and employment results than males. According to consumption variables, males had an earlier onset of alcohol use, had more regular alcohol use, and develop alcohol dependence earlier than females. Conclusions: According to results, there are sex-dependent differences (severity and other variables such as mood or suicide) in alcohol dependence. Thus, this may implicate the need of future specific research and treatment programs based on the specific necessities of each sex.",2243486673.0, Journal Article,2019
392,Psychometric Properties of the German Version of the Pulmonary-Specific Quality-of-Life Scale in Lung Transplant Patients.,"The Pulmonary-Specific Quality-of-Life Scale (PQLS) is a validated self-report questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with end-stage lung disease awaiting lung transplantation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the PQLS. One hundred and forty patients awaiting lung transplantation (55% men) with a median age of 53 years [Interquartile range (IQR) 13] answered the PQLS. A group of the participants (n = 43) was evaluated again 1 year later after transplantation. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the PQLS was conducted to test the three-factor structure of the PQLS. We examined the internal consistency of the scales using Cronbach's α. Convergent validity was explored through correlations with generic measures of HRQoL [Short-Form 8 Health Survey (SF-8), 10-item quality of life (QoL) scale], measures of depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Scale), and measures of lung disease severity (supplemental oxygen use, stairway steps). In the group of 43 patients assessed before and after transplantation, sensitivity to change was explored. The CFA confirmed the three-factor model with an acceptable fit. The PQLS total and the three subscale scores ""task interference,"" ""psychological,"" and ""physical"" showed acceptable internal consistency. The PQLS and its subscales showed a significant negative correlation with the 10-item QoL measure and the physical component score of the SF-8, whereas the mental component score of the SF-8 showed a significant negative correlation only with the PQLS subscale ""psychological."" Negative correlation was found due to the opposed alignment of the PQLS compared to the 10-item QoL and the SF-8. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly and positively correlated with the subscale ""psychological."" Measures of lung disease severity also exhibited a significant positive correlation with the subscales ""task interference"" and ""physical"" but not ""psychological."" In patients 1 year after a successful transplantation, the PQLS scores were significantly reduced by 50%. The three-factor structure of the PQLS could be replicated using CFA. The results indicate good reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the German version of the PQLS.",2243486188.0, Journal Article,2019
393,Preliminary Evidence for the Cognitive Model of Auditory Verbal Hallucinations in Youth With Borderline Personality Disorder.,"Objectives: This is the first study to explore cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to voices in youth with borderline personality disorder (BPD) compared with those with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZ), and to examine if negative appraisals of voices predict depression and anxiety across the groups. Methods: The sample comprised 43 outpatients, aged 15-25 years, who reported auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) and were diagnosed with either Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) BPD or SZ. Data were collected using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales, the revised Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire, the Voice Rank Scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Results: Youth with BPD did not differ from youth with SZ in beliefs about the benevolence or malevolence of voices. Youth with BPD appraised their voices as more omnipotent and of higher social rank in relation to themselves, compared with youth with SZ. In both diagnostic groups, beliefs about malevolence and omnipotence of voices were correlated with more resistance toward voices, and beliefs about benevolence with more engagement with voices. In addition, perceiving the voices as being of higher social rank than oneself and negative voice content were both independent predictors of depression, irrespective of diagnostic group. In contrast, negative appraisals of voices did not predict anxiety after adjusting for negative voice content. Conclusions: This study replicated the link between negative appraisals of voices and depression that has been found in adults with SZ in a mixed diagnostic youth sample. It, thus, provides preliminary evidence that the cognitive model of AVH can be applied to understanding and treating voices in youth with BPD.",2234486191.0, Journal Article,2019
394,"Depression and Anxiety as Key Factors Associated With Quality of Life Among Lung Cancer Patients in Hai Phong, Vietnam.","Background: Cancer is a leading cause of death. People living with cancer experience a variety of symptoms that might profoundly affect their quality of life (QoL). Objective: The study aims to identify factors associated with the QoL of patients with lung cancer at the oncology department of Viet Tiep Hospital, Hai Phong city, Vietnam in 2018. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from lung cancer inpatients in Hai Phong city, Vietnam. The EQ-5D-5L and the EuroQol (EQ)-visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) were used to assess health-related quality of life (QoL). A multivariable regression analysis was performed on the EQ-5D utility score and the EQ VAS score as dependent variables, and socioeconomic, social support, and psychological factors as potential predictors. Results: A total of 125 lung cancer patients were enrolled in this study. The highest proportion of respondents reporting any problems was in anxiety/depression (92.8%), pain/discomfort (81.2%), usual activities (75.2%), and mobility (60%) dimensions, while the lowest percentage was in self-care dimension (40.8%). The multivariate analyses showed that a low QoL score was significantly associated with depression, incapacity to pay, low response to treatment, and presence of side effects. Conclusion: QoL of lung cancer patients is associated with anxiety/depression and other factors that can be modified by specific interventions. It is therefore possible to take care of psychological aspects to improve the QoL of Vietnamese people suffering from this condition.",2234480732.0, Journal Article,2019
395,Psychometric Properties and Factor Structure of the Chinese Version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in People Living With HIV.,"The population of people living with HIV (PLWH) is growing in number and usually results in mental health problems that impact their quality of life. Therefore, valid instruments and screening methods for psychological disorders are of great significance. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) reveals good psychometric properties, but shows ambiguous results in factor structure. This study aims to evaluate psychometric properties in terms of the internal reliability and structure validity of the Chinese version of the HADS (C-HADS) in a large sample of PLWH in China. The C-HADS was administered to 4,102 HIV-infected adults at an HIV clinic in China. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to examine the factor structure. Measurement invariance was assessed across gender and course of infection. Internal reliability was also assessed. A bifactor model with anomalous loadings of items 7, 8, and 10 fits the data best and holds measurement invariance across gender and course of infection. Internal reliability was good with all Cronbach's alphas &gt; 0.70 and Spearman's ρ between 0.30 and 0.70. The C-HADS has good psychometric properties in terms of internal reliability and structure validity of a bifactor model. The C-HADS is recommended to be used as a total scale that measures general psychological distress, instead of anxiety and depression separately, when applied to PLWH. Further studies are needed to evaluate criterion validity, the cutoff score, and the effect of wording and scoring of the HADS.",2234480583.0, Journal Article,2019
396,Mindfulness-Based Social Cognition Training (SocialMind) for People With Psychosis: A Feasibility Trial.,"Introduction: Difficulties in social functioning are common among people with psychosis. Negative symptoms such as blunted affect or social withdrawal are often linked to these difficulties and worsen real-life outcomes. One important dimension associated with social functioning is social cognition, which refers to the psychological processes that are necessary to perceive, encode, store, retrieve, and regulate social information. Mindfulness-based interventions for people with psychosis are safe and effective in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms; however, no mindfulness-based interventions addressing social cognition have yet been developed. Method: A pilot, single-arm, nonrandomized, noncontrolled feasibility trial is proposed. The main objectives are to assess the tolerability of mindfulness-based social cognition training (SocialMind) and to test the feasibility of a further randomized controlled trial. Results: A final sample of 25 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was included. Attrition rate was lower than usual for this population, and most participants completed the training. No adverse effects were identified in terms of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, dissociative and psychotic symptoms, or state of anxiety during the sessions. Conclusion: This is the first implementation of SocialMind, which is the first mindfulness-based social cognition training. It is well tolerated by participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and a further randomized controlled trial is proposed for people who have suffered their first episode of psychosis within the past 5 years.

397,Infant Social Avoidance Predicts Autism but Not Anxiety in Fragile X Syndrome.,"Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety are three of the most common childhood psychiatric disorders. Early trajectories of social avoidance have been linked with these psychiatric disorders in previous studies, but it remains unclear how social avoidance differentially predicts comorbid disorders in a high-risk genetic subgroup. Here, we delineate the association between trajectories of social avoidance from infancy and subsequent ASD, ADHD, and anxiety outcomes at preschool in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a well-characterized single-gene disorder highly associated with social avoidance as well as elevated rates of ASD, ADHD, and anxiety. Method: Males with FXS (n = 78) aged 4-62 months participated in a longitudinal study resulting in 201 assessments. The Social Avoidance Scale (SAS) documented socially avoidant behaviors from infancy in three domains-physical movement, facial expression, and eye contact during both the first minute and the last hour of an interaction. ASD, ADHD, and anxiety symptom outcomes at preschool were measured via parent-report questionnaires. Results: Increased social avoidance across infancy and preschool predicted elevated ASD symptom severity but reduced ADHD and anxiety symptom severity in males with FXS. Conclusion: ASD, ADHD, and anxiety symptoms relate inconsistently to social avoidance behaviors, providing new insight toward the debate of independence or overlap among these disorders in FXS and other disorders (i.e., ASD). The results suggest that the nuanced profile of the developmental and temporal aspects of social avoidance may inform more the accuracy of differential diagnoses of comorbid psychiatric disorders in FXS.",2232122383.0, Journal Article,2019
398,"Depression, Anxiety and Their Correlates Among Patients With HIV in South Ethiopia: An Institution-Based Cross-Sectional Study.","Background: Depressive and anxious symptoms are more regularly seen in HIV-infected people than in the general population. This investigation planned to evaluate the magnitude and factors related to depressive and anxiety symptoms among HIV patients in South Ethiopia, 2018. Methods: This was an institution-based cross-sectional study directed among 363 HIV-infected individuals who had a customary visit at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital and Yirgalem Hospital, Ethiopia, who were incorporated into the study through systematic sampling techniques. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) was utilized to take a look at anxious and depressive symptoms. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 37.66 years (SD ±10.03). The prevalence of depression and anxiety were 32.0% and 34.4%, respectively. Patients who were living alone [AOR = 1.94, (95% CI: 1.06, 3.56)], had poor social support [AOR = 5.57, (95% CI: 1.20, 10.84)] or had HIV-related perceived stigma [AOR = 2.35, (95% CI: 1.44, 3.84)] were more likely to have depression as compared to their counterparts. Those with a previous history of mental illness [AOR = 3.36, (95% CI: 1.31, 8.61)] and poor social support [AOR = 6.67, (95% CI: 1.47, 10.33)] were more likely to have anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in the current study was high. Concerned health departments of the country should create guidelines to screen and treat depression and anxiety among HIV patients. Further research on hazard factors of depression and anxiety ought to be examined to strengthen and expand these findings.",2232122324.0, Journal Article,2019
399,Exploring the Relationship Between the Acceptability of an Internet-Based Intervention for Depression in Primary Care and Clinical Outcomes: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background: Depression is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy for depression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (IBI) for depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and satisfaction and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data were based on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized controlled trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation and satisfaction scales (six-item scales regarding treatment logic, satisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasantness), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondary outcome measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expectations and satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in expectations and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex: women have greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to ""usefulness for the patient"" were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the treatment is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue in the field of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the treatment offered.

400,"Mobile Intervention for Individuals With Psychosis, Dual Disorders, and Their Common Comorbidities: A Literature Review.","Over 50% of people diagnosed with a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, will meet criteria for a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This dual disorder often starts during youth and leads to significant societal costs, including lower employability rates, more hospitalizations, and higher risk of homelessness and of suicide attempts when compared to those with a serious mental illness without substance misuse. Moreover, many individuals presenting with comorbid disorders also present with other psychological difficulties as well, such as personality disorders or anxiety and depression, also known as complex comorbid disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments that focus on core difficulties found in people with complex dual disorders, such as emotional regulation, are direly needed. Emotional regulation skills can help reduce distress related to psychotic symptoms and maintain abstinence in substance use disorders. New technologies in the field of communications have developed considerably over the past decade and have the potential to improve access to such treatments, a major problem in many health care settings. As such, this paper aims at: presenting core difficulties present in many individuals with dual disorders, reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the use of mobile applications in mental health and addictions, and presenting the development and potential of a new application for emotional regulation for people with dual disorders.",2232107360.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
401,Managing Distress Using Mobile Prescriptions of Psychological Pills: A First 6-Month Effectiveness Study of the PsyPills App.,"Background: Although numerous mental health apps are commercially available, only a few of them have been empirically tested. PsyPills is an interactive and personalized mobile application, based on emotion regulation research and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy principles, that can function as a stand-alone intervention aimed at offering immediate stress relief. Objective: In this paper, we describe the newly developed PsyPills app and present data obtained at 6 months after its release regarding its effectiveness for stress management. Methods: 115 users aged 15-79 years old (M = 39.01, SD = 13.49) accessed the app during the first 6 months after its release and were thus included in the study. Distress and specific cognitive processes were collected using visual analog scale measures. Results: Most users accessed the app with the purpose of searching anxiety relief and most often reported work-related distress. Seventy-Four users accessed PsyPills between 1 and 11 times (M = 2.68, SD = 2.59), and received 258 psychological prescriptions in total. PsyPills was effective in terms of reducing the frequency of dysfunctional emotions, such that significantly more users reported feeling functional emotions after accessing the application and reading its personalized prescriptions than those reporting not being able to change it [χ2 (1, N = 52) = 52.00 p &lt; 0.001]. Using reminders of the psychological pill at specific times during the day made the PsyPills app more effective. Conclusions: Based on initial data on its first 6-month usage, the PsyPills app appears to be promising in terms of offering stress relief. However, future studies need to use golden standard design and investigate its efficacy as an adjunctive intervention.",2232106209.0, Journal Article,2019
402,Use of Gabapentin in the Treatment of Substance Use and Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Objective: Gabapentin (GBP) is an anticonvulsant medication that is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS) and posttherapeutic neuralgia. GBP is commonly prescribed off-label for psychiatric disorders despite the lack of strong evidence. However, there is growing evidence that GBP may be effective and clinically beneficial in both psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. This review aimed to perform a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed published literature on the efficacy of GBP in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. Methods: This review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE literature databases were screened and filtered by using specific search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The full texts of selected studies were subsequently retrieved and reviewed. The search terms generated 2,604 results from the databases. After excluding all duplicates, 1,088 citations were left. Thereafter, we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria; a total of 54 papers were retained for detailed review. Results: This literature review concludes that GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of various forms of anxiety disorders. It shows some effectiveness in bipolar disorder as an adjunctive therapeutic agent, while the evidence for monotherapy is inconclusive. In substance use disorders, GBP is effective for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) with mild to moderate severity; it reduces cravings, improves the rate of abstinence, and delays return to heavy drinking. GBP may have some therapeutic potential in the treatment of opioid addiction and cannabis dependence, but there is limited evidence to support its use. No significant benefit of GBP has been conclusively observed in the treatment of OCD, PTSD, depression, or cocaine and amphetamine abuse. Conclusion: GBP appears to be effective in some forms of anxiety disorders such as preoperative anxiety, anxiety in breast cancer survivors, and social phobia. GBP has shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, the literature suggests that GBP is effective as an adjunctive medication rather than a monotherapy. More clinical trials with larger patient populations are needed to support gabapentin's off-label use in psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. It is worth noting that numerous clinical studies that are discussed in this review are open-label trials, which are inherently less rigorously analyzed. Therefore, more extensive investigations are required to examine not only the efficacy of GBP, but also its safety and tolerance.",2232101500.0, Systematic Review,2019
403,Abnormal Alterations of Regional Spontaneous Neuronal Activity in Inferior Frontal Orbital Gyrus and Corresponding Brain Circuit Alterations: A Resting-State fMRI Study in Somatic Depression.,"Background: Major depressive disorders often involve somatic symptoms and have been found to have fundamental differences from non-somatic depression (NSD). However, the neural basis of this type of somatic depression (SD) is unclear. The aim of this study is to use the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses to examine the abnormal, regional, spontaneous, neuronal activity and the corresponding brain circuits in SD patients. Methods: 35 SD patients, 25 NSD patients, and 27 matched healthy controls were selected to complete this study. The ALFF and seed-based FC analyses were employed, and the Pearson correlation was determined to observe possible clinical relevance. Results: Compared with NSD, the SD group showed a significant ALFF increase in the right inferior temporal gyrus; a significant ALFF decrease in left hippocampus, right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and left thalamus; and a significant decrease in the FC value between the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus and the left inferior parietal cortex (p &lt; 0.05, corrected). Within the SD group, the mean ALFF value of the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus was associated with the anxiety factor scores (r = -0.431, p = 0.010, corrected). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abnormal differences in the regional spontaneous neuronal activity of the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus were associated with dysfunction patterns of the corresponding brain circuits during rest in SD patients, including the limbic-cortical systems and the default mode network. This may be an important aspect of the underlying mechanisms for pathogenesis of SD at the neural level.",2232060498.0, Journal Article,2019

However, the effects on depression, anxiety, and stress are unclear. This study assessed the effectiveness of meditation, yoga, and mindfulness on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in tertiary education students. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, PsycINFO and identified 11,936 articles. After retrieving 181 papers for full-text screening, 24 randomized controlled trials were included in the qualitative analysis. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis amongst 23 studies with 1,373 participants. Results: At post-test, after exclusion of outliers, effect sizes for depression, g = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), anxiety g = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), stress g = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) were moderate. Heterogeneity was low (I 2 = 6%). When compared to active control, the effect decreased to g = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). No RCT reported on safety, only two studies reported on academic achievement, most studies had a high risk of bias. Conclusions: Most studies were of poor quality and results should be interpreted with caution. Overall moderate effects were found which decreased substantially when interventions were compared to active control. It is unclear whether meditation, yoga or mindfulness affect academic achievement or affect have any negative side effects.",2231949591.0, Systematic Review,2019
405,Psychiatric Comorbidity in Neurological Disorders: Towards a Multidisciplinary Approach to Illness Management in the United Arab Emirates.,"Aim: To determine the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in undiagnosed patients attending neurological services, and detect rates of referral to and attendance of psychiatric services. Methods: Depressive symptoms and anxiety were assessed in 395 adult patients with primary diagnoses of neurological disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item depression scale (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7) were administered. Demographic details of the patients were recorded. Referral to and attendance of psychiatric services were recorded for patients scoring within the clinical range of depression and anxiety disorders (scores &gt; 10). Results: There was a 39% prevalence rate of depressive symptoms, 34% rate of anxiety, and 35.4% concurrent rate of both disorders in this cohort. The referral rate to psychiatric services was 33.6%, and attendance rate was 47.8%. There was significant association between severity of psychiatric symptoms and referral to psychiatric services, as well as significant association between comorbid psychiatric symptoms and attendance to psychiatric services. Conclusion: Our results indicate similar prevalence rates of comorbid psychiatric symptoms to studies carried out in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and relatively high attendance and referral rates to psychiatric services. Implications: The results shed light on the clinical profile of patients in this region and support the need for integrated collaborative medical services. Moreover, findings have important implications for health care policies pertaining to resource distribution and funding.",2231913848.0, Journal Article,2019
406,Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) Overexpression and Juvenile Immune Activation Cause Sex-Specific Schizophrenia-Related Psychopathology in Rats.,"Synaptic pruning is a critical refinement step during neurodevelopment, and schizophrenia has been associated with overpruning of cortical dendritic spines. Both human studies and animal models implicate disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene as a strong susceptibility factor for schizophrenia. Accumulating evidence supports the involvement of DISC1 protein in the modulation of synaptic elimination during critical periods of neurodevelopment and of dopamine D2-receptor-mediated signaling during adulthood. In many species, synaptic pruning occurs during juvenile and adolescent periods and is mediated by microglia, which can be over-activated by an immune challenge, giving rise to overpruning. Therefore, we sought to investigate possible interactions between a transgenic DISC1 model (tgDISC1) and juvenile immune activation (JIA) by the bacterial cell wall endotoxin lipopolysaccharide on the induction of schizophrenia-related behavioral and neurochemical disruptions in adult female and male rats. We examined possible behavioral aberrations along three major symptom dimensions of schizophrenia including psychosis, social and emotional disruptions, and cognitive impairments. We detected significant gene-environment interactions in the amphetamine-induced locomotion in female animals and in the amphetamine-induced anxiety in male animals. Surprisingly, gene-environment interactions improved social memory in both male and female animals. JIA alone disrupted spatial memory and recognition memory, but only in male animals. DISC1 overexpression alone induced an improvement in sensorimotor gating, but only in female animals. Our neurochemical analyses detected sex- and manipulation-dependent changes in the postmortem monoamine content of animals. Taken together, we here report sex-specific effects of environment and genotype as well as their interaction on behavioral phenotypes and neurochemical profiles relevant for schizophrenia.",2231900336.0, Journal Article,2019
407,Moderating Effect of Mindfulness on the Relationships Between Perceived Stress and Mental Health Outcomes Among Chinese Intensive Care Nurses.,"This study aimed to explore the potential moderating effect of mindfulness and its facets on the relationships among perceived stress and mental health outcomes (burnout, depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being) among Chinese intensive care nurses. A total of 500 Chinese intensive care nurses completed self-report measures of mindfulness, burnout syndromes, perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regressions were applied for data analysis. Mindfulness moderated the effects of perceived stress on emotional exhaustion (the core component of burnout syndrome), depression, anxiety, positive affect, and negative affect but not on the other two dimensions of burnout and life satisfaction. Further analyses indicated that the ability to act with awareness was particularly crucial in improving the effects of perceived stress on depression. These results further broaden our understanding of the relationships between perceived stress and burnout, depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being by demonstrating that mindfulness may serve as a protective factor that alleviates or eliminates the negative effects of perceived stress on depression, anxiety, burnout syndrome, and subjective well-being and may instigate further research into targeted mindfulness interventions for Chinese intensive care nurses.",2231899181.0, Journal Article,2019
408,Anxiety in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: Risk Factors and Effects on Functional Status.,"Background: Anxiety is prevalent after a stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of poststroke anxiety (PSA) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and neuroimaging risk factors for development of PSA and examine the effects of PSA on activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL) in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: Two hundred nineteen patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited to the study. A series of comprehensive assessments, including Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Lawton ADL Scale, and the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) Scale, were conducted in the acute stage and 3 months after stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging assessment focused on evaluation of infarctions, white matter lesions, and brain atrophy. Results: In the acute stage and 3 months after stroke, 34 (16%) and 33 (15%) patients had PSA, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that HDRS (OR = 1.269, 95% CI = 1.182-1.364, P &lt; 0.001) and acute infarcts in cerebral hemispheric white matter (CHWM; OR = 2.902, 95% CI = 1.052-8.007, P = 0.040) were significant correlates of PSA in the acute stage of stroke. Three months after stroke, these correlates remained significant predictors, along with male sex. Multiple linear regressions showed that age, NIHSS, HARS, and HDRS in the acute stage were significant predictors for both ADL and SSQOL at 3 months after stroke. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are the major correlates of PSA while more severe PSA is associated with poorer ADL and health-related QOL. Acute lesions involving CHWM may correlate with PSA in ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate neurologic deficits, supporting a lesion-location hypothesis in PSA.",2231897535.0, Journal Article,2019
409,Prevalence of Anxiety Symptoms and Their Association With Loss Experience in a Large Cohort Sample of the Oldest-Old. Results of the AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe Study.,"Background: Anxiety in adults is a common mental health problem. However, studies on anxiety in the oldest-old are lacking. We sought to identify the age- and gender-specific prevalence of anxiety symptoms in a large sample of general practice patients. Furthermore, we investigated relevant associations of anxiety specifically with respect to recent experience of loss. Methods: Based on the German Study on Ageing, Cognition and Dementia in general practice patients, a sample of 897 patients aged 82 years and older was assessed. Anxiety was assessed using the short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI-SF). For the assessment of loss, patients were asked whether there were cases of death in their closer social environment since the last assessment. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were run. Results: Of the oldest-old individuals (aged 82+ years, mean age: 86.8), 14.5% (95% CI 12.4-16.8) suffered from anxiety symptoms. Highest prevalence rates were found for 82- to 85-year-old women (17.2%, 95% CI 12.6-22.1) and for 86- to 90-year-old patients (both sexes) in general (15.9%, 95% CI 12.6-19.2). Older individuals who experienced cases of death in their close social environment within the last 18 months had almost twice the odds [odds ratio (OR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-3.17] of reporting anxiety compared to those without a recent loss. As expected, depression and impaired cognitive status were associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms. No relation was found between social network, gender, age, frailty, or physical illness and anxiety in regression analysis. Conclusions: This study provides for the first time age- and gender-specific prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms and associated risk factors among a large population-based sample of oldest-old primary care attenders. Anxiety is highly prevalent in individuals aged 82 years and older. Depression, impaired cognitive status, and recent experience of loss are associated with late-life anxiety. Our findings support the idea that recent experience of loss should be taken seriously in the context of clinical practice with respect to diagnosing and treating anxiety in old age.",2231857614.0, Journal Article,2019

411,Technology and College Student Mental Health: Challenges and Opportunities.,"In recent years, there has been an increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other mental illnesses in college student populations. Simultaneously, there has been a steady rise in the demand for counseling services. These trends have been viewed by some as a mental health crisis requiring prompt investigation and the generation of potential solutions to serve the needs of students. Subsequently, several studies linked the observed rise in symptoms with the ubiquitous rise in use of personal computing technologies, including social media, and have suggested that time spent on these types of technologies is directly correlated with poor mental health. While use of personal computing technologies has dramatically shifted the landscape in which college students connect with one another and appears to have some detriments to mental health, the same technologies also offer a number of opportunities for the enhancement of mental health and the treatment of mental illness. Here, we describe the challenges and opportunities for college student mental health afforded by personal computing technologies. We highlight opportunities for new research in this area and possibilities for individuals and organizations to engage with these technologies in a more helpful and wellness-promoting manner.",2217469230.0, Journal Article,2019
412,Capturing the Severity and Impairment Associated With Depression: The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) Validation in a Spanish Clinical Sample.,"Background: The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) is a self-report scale designed to evaluate the severity and functional impairment associated with depression. Objective: This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the online version of the ODSIS in Spanish outpatients with depression and anxiety disorders. Method: Patients with a main diagnosis of a depressive (n = 283) or anxiety disorder (n = 191) and a mean age of 38.15 (SD = 12.06) were evaluated with a clinical diagnostic interview and measures assessing depression, anxiety, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. Factorial structure, internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity and cutoff scores were analyzed. Results: Consistent with previous validations of the instrument, Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a unidimensional factor structure. Furthermore, the results obtained supported the internal consistency and construct validity of the ODSIS scores. A score of 5 was found to meet the criteria used in this study for the optimal cutoff score. Conclusion: The results obtained in this study show that the Spanish version of the ODSIS delivered online is an adequate tool to assess the depression-related severity and impairment in a brief and easy fashion.",2216285787.0, Journal Article,2019
413,"The Relationship Among Gastrointestinal Symptoms, Problem Behaviors, and Internalizing Symptoms in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder.","Background: Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have co-occurring gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but the etiology is poorly understood. These GI symptoms often coincide with problem behaviors and internalizing symptoms, which reduces the quality of life for these individuals. Methods: This study examined the relationships among GI problems, problem behaviors, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 340 children and adolescents with ASD who are patients at the University of Missouri Thompson Center for Autism &amp; Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Results: The majority of patients experienced constipation (65%), about half experienced stomachaches or stomach pain (47.9%), and others experienced nausea (23.2%) or diarrhea (29.7%). Young children with aggressive problem behaviors were 11.2% more likely to have co-occurring nausea; whereas, older children showed more complex relationships between internalizing symptoms and GI symptoms. Older children with greater anxiety symptoms were 11% more likely to experience constipation, but 9% less likely to experience stomachaches. Older children with greater withdrawn behavior were 10.9% more likely to experience stomachaches, but 8.7% less likely to experience constipation. Older children with greater somatic complaints were 11.4% more likely to experience nausea and 11.5% more likely to experience stomachaches. Conclusions: Results suggest that the presentation of externalizing problem behavior and internalizing symptoms associated with GI problems differs between young children and older children with ASD. Therefore, behavior may have different relationships with GI symptoms at different ages, which may have implications for the treatment of and clinical approach to GI disturbances in ASD.",2216281324.0, Journal Article,2019
414,Children of Mentally III Parents at Risk Evaluation (COMPARE): Design and Methods of a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Study-Part I.,"Objectives: Mental disorders are frequent, associated with disability-adjusted life years, societal, and economic costs. Children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI) are at an increased risk to develop disorders themselves. The transgenerational transmission of mental disorders has been conceptualized in a model that takes parental and family factors, the social environment (i.e., school, work, and social support), parent-child-interaction and possible child outcomes into account. The goal of the ""Children of Mentally Ill Parents At Risk Evaluation"" (COMPARE) study will thus be twofold: (1) to establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the aim of interrupting the intergenerational transmission of mental disorders in COPMI, (2) to test the components of the trans-generational transmission model of mental disorders. Methods: To implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT: comparison of parental cognitive behavioral therapy/CBT with CBT + Positive Parenting Program) that is flanked by four add-on projects that apply behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuro-imaging methods to examine potential moderators and mediators of risk transmission (projects COMPARE-emotion/-interaction/-work/-school). COMPARE-emotion targets emotion processing and regulation and its impact on the transgenerational disorder transmission; COMPARE-interaction focuses especially on the impact of maternal comorbid diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders and will concentrate on different pathways of the impact of maternal disorders on socio-emotional and cognitive infant development, such as parent-infant interaction and the infant's stress regulation skills. COMPARE-work analyzes the transmission of strains a person experiences in one area of life to another (i.e., from family to work; spill-over), and how stress and strain are transmitted between individuals (i.e., from parent to child; cross-over). COMPARE-school focuses on the psychosocial adjustment, school performance, and subjective well-being in COPMI compared to an adequate control group of healthy children. Results: This study protocol reports on the interdisciplinary approach of COMPARE testing the model of the transgenerational transmission of mental disorders. Conclusion: The combination of applied basic with clinical research will facilitate the examination of specific risk transmission mechanisms, promotion, dissemination and implementation of results into a highly important but largely neglected field.

415,Sex-Gender Comparisons in Comorbidities of Children and Adolescents With High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Over the last few years, new studies focused their attention on the gender-related features in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFA), often leading to controversial results. Another interesting aspect of these subtype of patients is linked to the complexity of clinical presentation, where besides core symptoms, other co-occurrence disorders may complicate the diagnostic evaluation. Therefore, we retrospectively studied 159 HFA patients, male and female, investigating their comorbidities and to find any gender difference. For each patient, were evaluated the presence/absence, type and gender distribution of psychopathological comorbidities, according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The total sample was divided in 100 male and 59 female patients, age and intelligence quotient matched. In our sample, the psychiatric comorbidities observed were Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Depressive Disorders, Bipolar Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Anorexia Nervosa. No statistical significant differences were found between male and female HFA patients comorbidities except for Anorexia Nervosa. In both male and female patients, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders were found in high percentage. In conclusion, our investigation showed that a statistical significant difference of comorbidity between male and female HFA patients was found only for AN diagnosis. However, the question about the distinction between female and male HFA patients remains quite interesting and an open area of research for future studies.",2207942144.0, Journal Article,2019
416,"Effects of Probiotics on Cognitive Reactivity, Mood, and Sleep Quality.","Recent demonstration that probiotics administration has positive effects on mood state in healthy populations suggests its possible role as an adjunctive therapy for depression in clinical populations and as a non-invasive strategy to prevent depressive mood state in healthy individuals. The present study extends current knowledge on the beneficial effects of probiotics on psychological well-being, as measured by changes in mood (e.g., cognitive reactivity to sad mood, depression, and anxiety), personality dimensions, and quality of sleep, which have been considered as related to mood. For this double-blind, placebo-controlled study 38 healthy volunteers assigned to an experimental or control group assumed a daily dose of a probiotic mixture (containing Lactobacillus fermentum LF16, L. rhamnosus LR06, L. plantarum LP01, and Bifidobacterium longum BL04) or placebo, respectively, for 6 weeks. Mood, personality dimensions, and sleep quality were assessed four times (before the beginning of the study, at 3 and 6 weeks, and at 3 weeks of washout). A significant improvement in mood was observed in the experimental group, with a reduction in depressive mood state, anger, and fatigue, and an improvement in sleep quality. No between-groups differences were found. These findings corroborate the positive effect of probiotics on mood state and suggest that probiotics administration may improve psychological well-being by ameliorating aspects of mood and sleep quality.",2207942074.0, Journal Article,2019
417,Psychopathological Correlates and Emotion Regulation as Mediators of Approach and Avoidance Motivation in a Chinese Military Sample.,"Background: Approach and avoidance motivation have been thoroughly studied in common mental disorders, which are prevalent in the military context. Approach/avoidance motivational dispositions underlie emotion responses and are thought to influence emotion dysregulation. However, studies on the mediating role of emotion regulation (ER) between motivational dispositions and mental disorders have been insufficient. We examined the psychopathological correlates of motivational dispositions and explored the mediating role of ER. Methods: The Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales and measures of mood disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD) were administered to a nonclinical sample of 3,146 Chinese military service members. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Armymen (ERQ-A) (Chinese version) was used to measure ER styles. We examined the reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Approach/avoidance motivations were correlated with symptoms of mood disorders. Mediation analysis was conducted to confirm the mediating role of ER between motivation and mood disorders. Results: The results showed acceptable internal reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Gender (female), family status (single-parent family), and social relationships (having fewer good friends) were significant predictors of high BIS sensitivity. More years of education, an older age, being an only child and being in a single-parent family all significantly predicted high BAS sensitivity. The BIS/BAS scales were predictive of various DSM-V-based mental disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD). Immersion exacerbated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on depressive/PTSD symptoms, while reinterpretation and talking out alleviated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on these symptoms. Conclusions: Motivational dispositions have an impact on mood symptoms under specific conditions. ER strategies (immersion, reinterpretation, and talking out) were shown to be partial mediators between approach/avoidance motivation and mood disorders. These findings highlight the importance of ER in altering the impact of motivational dispositions on mood disorders and as a promising target of psychotherapies.",2207160831.0, Journal Article,2019

Most clinical MDMA research in patients to date has focused on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this review paper other potential therapeutic applications for MDMA therapy are described, including contemporary studies treating anxiety associated with autism and the authors' ongoing study exploring the potential role for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to treat alcohol use disorder. MDMA therapy for PTSD is now entering the final Phase 3 stage of drug development, with a target set for licensing by the FDA and EMA in 2021. This means that if clinical efficacy criteria are achieved, MDMA would become a medicine.",2204688965.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
419,Can a Brief Relaxation Exercise Modulate Placebo or Nocebo Effects in a Visceral Pain Model?,"Translational research aiming to elucidate mediators and moderators of placebo and nocebo effects is highly relevant. This experimental study tested effects of a brief progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercise, designed to alter psychobiological stress parameters, on the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects in a standardized psychosocial treatment context. In 120 healthy volunteers (60 men, 60 women), pain expectation, pain intensity, and pain unpleasantness in response to individually-calibrated rectal distensions were measured with visual analog scales during a baseline. Participants were then randomized to exercise PMR (relaxation group: N = 60) or a simple task (control group: N = 60), prior to receiving positive (placebo), negative (nocebo) or neutral suggestions regarding an intravenous administration that was in reality saline in all groups. Identical distensions were repeated (test). State anxiety, salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were assessed repeatedly. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance, planned Bonferroni-corrected group comparisons, as well as exploratory correlational and mediation analyses. Treatment suggestions induced group-specific changes in pain expectation, with significantly reduced expectation in placebo and increased expectation in nocebo groups. PMR had no discernable effect on pain expectation, state anxiety or cortisol, but led to significantly lower heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Relaxation significantly interacted with positive treatment suggestions, which only induced placebo analgesia in relaxed participants. No effects of negative suggestions were found in planned group comparisons, irrespective of relaxation. Exploratory correlation and mediation analyses revealed that pain expectation was a mediator to explain the association between treatment suggestions and pain-related outcomes. Clearly, visceral pain modulation is complex and involves many cognitive, emotional, and possibly neurobiological factors that remain to be fully understood. Our findings suggest that a brief relaxation exercise may facilitate the induction of placebo analgesia by positive when compared to neutral treatment suggestions. They underscore the contribution of relaxation and stress as psychobiological states within the psychosocial treatment context-factors which clearly deserve more attention in translational studies aiming to maximize positive expectancy effects in clinical settings.",2204688311.0, Journal Article,2019
420,The Association Between the Sedative Loads and Clinical Severity Indicators in the First-Onset Major Depressive Disorder.,"Background: High sedative use in a major depressive episode may imply specific clinical features. This study aims to examine the correlation between sedative use and clinical severity indicators in the initial treatment phase of first-onset major depressive disorder. Methods: A study cohort in the first episode of major depressive disorder was used to conduct pharmacological dissection. All participants had at least a 2-year follow-up period with a complete treatment record. The defined daily dose of antidepressants and augmentation agents were calculated as the antidepressant load and augmentation load, respectively. Sedative use, which was calculated as the equivalent dosage of lorazepam, were defined as the sedative load. These psychotropic loads were measured monthly and the averaged psychotropic loads for each day were obtained. Results: A total of 106 individuals (75.5% female) were included. The mean duration of disease course in participants was 5.5 ± 3.5 years. In the multiple regression analysis, after controlling for other classes of psychotropics and comorbid anxiety disorders, the sedative load independently correlated with higher number of antidepressants used, higher number of antidepressant used with an adequate dose and duration, more psychiatric emergency and outpatient visits within 2 years of disease onset. Conclusion: High loading of sedatives correlated with several indicators of clinical severity in major depressive disorder. The sedative load may be used as a specifier to identify subgroups in patients with major depressive disorder.",2202196709.0, Journal Article,2019
421,The Psychometric Properties and Clinical Utility of the Korean Version of GAD-7 and GAD-2.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common but serious form of anxiety disorder. Despite this, the rate of GAD recognition in primary care remains low in both Western and Eastern countries. The GAD-7 and GAD-2 were developed to efficiently identify people with GAD, and their reliability and validity have been well-documented in Western countries. The GAD-7 and GAD-2 have also been widely utilized to screen for other anxiety disorders; however, their diagnostic utility has not been fully justified with empirical support, especially in East Asian samples. In this study, we examined the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these screening tools for identifying individuals with GAD or other anxiety disorders, and recommended screening cutoff scores for GAD and other anxiety disorders for use in Korea. Based on the rigorous standard suggested by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, a total of 1,157 participants randomly recruited from the community completed the GAD-7, GAD-2, and other anxiety and depression measures in a counter-balanced order. All participants were assessed, and their psychiatric diagnosis confirmed through a structured clinical interview conducted by independent clinicians blinded to the results of the self-report questionnaires. The GAD-7 and GAD-2 both showed excellent reliability and validity. Notably, both the GAD-7 and GAD-2 demonstrated acceptable diagnostic accuracy in detecting GAD with similar recommended cut-off scores as those reported in Western countries, but unacceptable diagnostic accuracy for other anxiety disorders. We conclude that given their brevity, the GAD-7 and GAD-2 can be well-utilized to identify people with GAD for preventative evaluation and treatment in Korea. Use of the GAD-7 and GAD-2 for screening other anxiety disorders should be cautioned.",2202194465.0, Journal Article,2019
422,Problematic Use of Mobile Phones in Australia…Is It Getting Worse?,"Rapid technological innovations over the past few years have led to dramatic changes in today's mobile phone technology. While such changes can improve the quality of life of its users, problematic mobile phone use can result in its users experiencing a range of negative outcomes such as anxiety or, in some cases, engagement in unsafe behaviors with serious health and safety implications such as mobile phone distracted driving. The aims of the present study are two-fold. First, this study investigated the current problem mobile phone use in Australia and its potential implications for road safety. Second, based on the changing nature and pervasiveness of mobile phones in Australian society, this study compared data from 2005 with data collected in 2018 to identify trends in problem mobile phone use in Australia. As predicted, the results demonstrated that problem mobile phone use in Australia increased from the first data collected in 2005. In addition, meaningful differences were found between gender and age groups in this study, with females and users in the 18-25 year-old age group showing higher mean Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) scores. Additionally, problematic mobile phone use was linked with mobile phone use while driving. Specifically, participants who reported high levels of problem mobile phone use, also reported handheld and hands-free mobile phone use while driving.",2198560170.0, Journal Article,2019
423,"Short-Term Effects of a Multidimensional Stress Prevention Program on Quality of Life, Well-Being and Psychological Resources. A Randomized Controlled Trial.","It is well-documented that university students have an increased risk in developing psychological problems because they face multiple stressors. Cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based stress prevention programs were shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in university students. However, little is known of their effect on resource activation. Additionally, most validated interventions are unidimensional, i.e., including one stress-coping approach. In this study, we investigated the short-term effects of a multidimensional stress prevention program on students' quality of life, psychological symptoms and resources, and resilience factors against stress. Using an experimental design, 64 healthy undergraduate students (56 women), between 18 and 34 years old (M = 21.34, SD = 2.53), from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, were randomly allocated either to the intervention or the wait-list control group. The intervention group participated in a multidimensional stress prevention program, integrating mindfulness-based activities, cognitive and behavioral strategies, social skills, and emotional regulation exercises. The program consisted of eight 2-h weekly sessions. Before and after the intervention, participants completed self-reported questionnaires evaluating quality of life; psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and interpersonal problems; as well as psychological resources like self-efficacy, sense of coherence, self-compassion, and social support, presented online. A standardized clinical interview was performed at pre- and post-measurement times. To analyze the sort-term effects of the program, we used mixed, two-factorial ANOVAs (per-protocol analyses). In accordance with our hypotheses, our results showed significant reduction of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, interpersonal problems, and symptoms of pain; a significant increase in quality of life, sense of coherence, and self-compassion in students who participated in the intervention program compared to the control group, (all p &lt; 0.05). No significant results were found for symptoms of depression, social anxiety, self-efficacy, and social support. These preliminary findings indicate specific short-term effects of our multidimensional stress prevention program on psychological symptoms and on quality of life as well as promising effects on psychological resources and factors associated with resilience against stress. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of the intervention as well as the effects in clinical samples.",2198559613.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
424,Parental Perspectives on Psychiatric Comorbidity in Preschoolers With Autism Spectrum Disorders Receiving Publicly Funded Mental Health Services.,"An increased prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity (PC) in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is consistently reported. While several studies have examined PC in school-aged children, adolescents and adults with ASD, investigations on PC in preschoolers are less common. In this study, we explore the prevalence and the type of PC in a sample of 989 preschoolers with ASD through the DSM-Oriented Scales (DOS) of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 1½-5) and their possible links with the core features of ASD and cognitive functioning. Results indicated that 37.8% of the sample had at least one PC in addition to ASD; these subjects displayed significantly higher Total score (p = 0.02) and Social Affect score (p = 0.003) on the ADOS-based calibrated severity scores (CSS), as well as lower (p ≤ 0.0001) performance IQ (pIQ) compared to ASD individuals without PC. As far as the specific DOS, Affective Problems (AP) were detected in 23.4% of the whole sample, ADHD Problems (ADHD) in 17.3%, Anxiety Problems (AXP) in 16.7%, and Oppositional Problems (OP) in 7.9%. These different comorbidities were isolated in 195 subjects (Mono-comorbid group: 19.7% of the whole sample), while 179 subjects (18.1% of the whole sample) had two or more types of PC (Multi-comorbid group). One-way ANOVA revealed that subjects with multi-comorbidity have statistically significant lower pIQ and higher Total score and Social Affect score on CSS-ADOS. Specific differences for each type of comorbidity and gender differences were also discussed. Taken together, results indicate a considerable presence of PC in preschoolers with ASD that should be accurately considered during the assessment and diagnosis process in order to plan a tailored intervention based not only on core symptoms of ASD, but also on comorbid psychiatric condition since preschool age.",2198558040.0, Journal Article,2019
425,Decreased Response to Positive Facial Affect in a Depressed Cohort in the Dorsal Striatum During a Working Memory Task-A Preliminary fMRI Study.,"People with depression have shown alterations in processing emotional information and working memory functionality. There is some evidence that emotional content may interact with working memory update processes, however neurological correlates are current unknown. In this preliminary study we utilized a novel version of the emotional variant of the n-back working memory task in fMRI. We examined BOLD response of 14 healthy controls and 13 depressed participants in response to happy, sad, and neutral displays of facial affect. No accuracy or reaction time differences were found between the two groups. The depressed group showed significantly decreased BOLD response to happy faces compared to the control group areas of the dorsal striatum and anterior cingulate. Significant, moderate, positive associations were found between right caudate activation with anxiety score and anterior cingulate activation with depression score in those with depression. Our novel task was able to elicit group level differences in emotional processing during working memory update. These results suggest those with depression fail to differentiate between positive emotional stimuli and stimuli with no emotional content.",2194587440.0, Journal Article,2019
426,Altered Brain Signal Variability in Patients With Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by a chronic, continuous symptom of worry and exaggerated startle response. Although functional abnormality in GAD has been widely studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the dynamic signatures of GAD are not fully understood. As a vital index of brain function, brain signal variability (BSV) reflects the capacity of state transition of neural activities. In this study, we recruited 47 patients with GAD and 38 healthy controls (HCs) to investigate whether or not BSV is altered in patients with GAD by measuring the standard deviation of fMRI signal of each voxel. We found that patients with GAD exhibited decreased BSV in widespread regions including the visual network, sensorimotor network, frontoparietal network, limbic system, and thalamus, indicating an inflexible brain state transfer pattern in these systems. Furthermore, the correlation between BSV and trait anxiety score was prone to be positive in patients with GAD but negative in HCs. The opposite relationships between BSV and anxiety level in the two groups indicate that the brain with moderate anxiety level may stay in the most stable rather than in the flexible state. As the first study of BSV in GAD, we revealed extensively decreased BSV in patients with GAD similar to that in other mental disorders but with a non-linear relationship between BSV and anxiety level indicating a novel neurodynamic mechanism of the anxious brain.",2194142031.0, Journal Article,2019
427,Augmenting Mental Health in Primary Care: A 1-Year Study of Deploying Smartphone Apps in a Multi-site Primary Care/Behavioral Health Integration Program.,"Background: Integrating behavioral health (BH) services into primary care is an evidence-based intervention that can increase access to care, improve patient outcomes, and decrease costs. Digital technology, including smartphone apps, has the potential to augment and extend the reach of these integrated behavioral health services through self-management support impacting lifestyle behaviors. To date, the feasibility and acceptability of using mental health mobile apps within an integrated primary care setting has not yet been explored as part of routine clinical care. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to (a) test the feasibility of using mental health applications to augment integrated primary care services; (b) solicit feedback from patients and providers to guide implementation, and (c) develop a mental health apps toolkit for system-wide dissemination. Methods: Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) is a safety-net healthcare system that includes three community hospitals and 12 Primary Care (PC) clinics serving nearly 150,000 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients around Boston. To select and disseminate mental health apps, a four-phase implementation was undertaken: (1) Evaluation of mental health mobile applications (2) Development of an apps toolkit with stakeholder input, (3) Conducting initial pilot at six primary care locations, and (4) Rolling out the app toolkit across 12 primary care sites and conducting 1-year follow-up survey. Results: Among BH providers, 24 (75%) responded to the follow-up survey and 19 (83%) indicated they use apps as part of their clinical care. Anxiety was the most common condition for which app use was recommended by providers, and 10 (42%) expressed interest in further developing their knowledge of mental health apps. Among patients, 35 (65%) of participants provided feedback; 23 (66%) reported the tools to be helpful, especially for managing stress and anxiety. Conclusions: Our findings indicate mental health apps are applicable and relevant to patients within integrated primary care settings in safety-net health systems. Behavioral health providers perceive the clinical value of using these tools as part of patient care, but require training to increase their comfort-level and confidence applying these tools with patients. To increase provider and patient engagement, mobile apps must be accessible, simple, intuitive and directly relevant to patients' treatment needs.",2193172144.0, Journal Article,2019
428,Sex-Specific Involvement of Estrogen Receptors in Behavioral Responses to Stress and Psychomotor Activation.,"Fluctuating hormone levels, such as estradiol might underlie the difference in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders observed in women vs. men. Estradiol exert its effects primarily through binding on the two classical estrogen receptor subtypes, alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ). Both receptors have been suggested to a have role in the development of psychiatric disorders, however, most of the current literature is limited to their role in females. We investigated the role of estrogen receptors on cognition (novel-object recognition), anxiety (open-field test, elevated-plus maze, and light/dark box), stress-responsive behaviors (forced-swim test, learned helplessness following inescapable shock, and sucrose preference), pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in both male and female mice either lacking the ERα or ERβ receptor. We found that female Esr1 -/- mice have attenuated pre-pulse inhibition, whereas female Esr2 -/- mice manifested enhanced pre-pulse inhibition. No pre-pulse inhibition difference was observed in male Esr1 -/- and Esr2 -/- mice. Moreover, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was decreased in male Esr1 -/-, but not Esr2 -/- mice, while female Esr1 -/- and Esr2 -/- mice showed an enhanced response. Genetic absence of ERα did not alter the escape capability or sucrose preference following inescapable shock in both male and female mice. In contrast, female, but not male Esr2 -/- mice, manifested decreased escape failures compared with controls. Lack of Esr2 gene in male mice was associated with decreased sucrose preference following inescapable shock, suggesting susceptibility for development of anhedonia following stress. No sucrose preference differences were found in female Esr2 -/- mice following inescapable shock stress. Lastly, we demonstrated that lack of Esr1 or Esr2 genes had no effect on memory and anxiety-like behaviors in both male and female mice. Our findings indicate a differential sex-specific involvement of estrogen receptors in the development of stress-mediated maladaptive behaviors as well as psychomotor activation responses suggesting that these receptors might act as potential treatment targets in a sex-specific manner.",2191012054.0, Journal Article,2019
429,Psychiatric Symptom Profiles Predict Functional Impairment.,"Objective: Mental illness often interferes with daily functioning and an individual's pattern of psychiatric signs and symptoms may predict risk of future disability. Understanding the linkage between psychiatric symptoms and impaired functioning is critical for accurate rehabilitation planning and legal assessment. Here, we investigated the stability of functional impairment measures over 18 months and their association with psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, we developed a clinical self-report measure that allows estimation of functional impairment levels over 18 month observation periods. Methods: Consecutively treated outpatients and daycare patients (N = 155) from several psychiatric units in Switzerland completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, Multidimensional Inventory for Dissociation, Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and WHO Disability Assessment Schedule at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 month follow-up examinations. The association between symptoms functional impairment over time was investigated using longitudinal linear mixed models. Penalized regression was used to identify questionnaire items that best predicted functional impairment. Results: We found high stability in the extent of functional impairment over 18 months. Fear of negative evaluation, fatigue, concentration problems, negative alterations in mood, and dissociative symptoms showed the strongest association with functional impairment measures. The empirically derived scale for functional impairment prediction explained between 0.62 and 0.77 of the variance in disability across various life domains. Conclusion: Given the capability for somatic and mental symptoms associated with social anxiety, depression, and dissociation to predict future disability, these symptoms have strong potential for guiding rehabilitation planning and prognostic evaluation in insurance medicine. The Functional Impairment Prediction Scale may serve as a valuable, empirical-based extension in legal assessments of how work capacity is affected by psychological factors.",2190091696.0, Journal Article,2019
430,Trauma Exposure and Mental Health Problems Among Adults in Central Vietnam: A Randomized Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Background: There is relatively little evidence about the psychological and social impacts of trauma exposure in the general population in East Asian countries. Vietnam has a long history of war and poverty, is prone to natural disasters and has high mortality related to traffic accidents. The mental health systems may be inadequate to cope with the resultant trauma. Objectives: This research examines the lifetime prevalence of single and multiple traumas and the association between trauma exposure and depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a randomly selected sample of the adult population in Thua Thien-Hue province in central Vietnam. Methods: Six hundred and eight Vietnamese adults aged 18 years or older participated in the survey. The main tools in the face-to-face interview included the Life Event Checklist (LEC) to measure trauma exposure, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV (PCL-IV). Hierarchical multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between trauma exposure and mental health. Results: Forty seven percent of the participants experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime and about half of these people were exposed to multiple traumas. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms among the total sample was 12.7, 15.5, and 6.9%, respectively. Prevalence of PTSD among those reporting trauma exposure was 14.8%. Exposure to a higher number of trauma types was associated with increased risk of having depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Interpersonal traumas were strongly associated with symptoms of all three mental disorders while non-interpersonal traumas were only associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings indicate high burden of lifetime trauma and mental ill health in the adult population of central Vietnam and show a cumulative effect of multiple traumas on symptoms of the three mental disorders. Interpersonal trauma appears to have a more harmful effect on mental health than non-interpersonal trauma. Efforts to improve mental health in Vietnam should focus on reducing risk of preventable interpersonal trauma in every stage of life, and more broadly, ensure greater availability of trauma-sensitive mental health programs and services.",2190091594.0, Journal Article,2019
431,"Common and Specific Functional Activity Features in Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder.","Objectives: Schizophrenia (SZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD) are serious mental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. They share common clinical and biological features. However, there are still only few studies on the common and specific brain imaging changes associated with the three mental disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the common and specific functional activity and connectivity changes in SZ, MDD, and BD. Methods: A total of 271 individuals underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging: SZ (n = 64), MDD (n = 73), BD (n = 41), and healthy controls (n = 93). The symptoms of SZ patients were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were used to evaluate the symptoms of MDD patients. The BDI, BAI, and Young Mania Rating Scale were used to evaluate the symptoms of MDD and BD patients. In addition, we compared the fALFF and functional connectivity between the three mental disorders and healthy controls using two sample t-tests. Results: Significantly decreased functional activity was found in the right superior frontal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the insula was found in SZ, MDD, and BD. Specific fALFF changes, mainly in the ventral lateral pre-frontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus were found for SZ, in the left motor cortex and parietal lobe for MDD, and the dorsal lateral pre-frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex in BD. Conclusion: Our findings of common abnormalities in SZ, MDD, and BD provide evidence that salience network abnormality may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these three mental disorders. Meanwhile, our findings also indicate that specific alterations in SZ, MDD, and BD provide neuroimaging evidence for the differential diagnosis of the three mental disorders.",2188586067.0, Journal Article,2019
432,"The Effects of Acupuncture on Glutamatergic Neurotransmission in Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Literature.","Neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are diseases that are directly or indirectly associated with cerebral dysfunction and contribute significantly to disability in adult populations worldwide. Important limitations surround the currently available pharmacologic agents for neuropsychiatric disorders and, moreover, many patients fail to respond to these therapies. Acupuncture might be a complementary therapy for neuropsychiatry disorders. In this review, we investigate the current evidence for the treatment efficacy of acupuncture in depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and AD. Secondly, we review recent advances in understanding of the dysregulated glutamate system underlying the pathophysiology of these disorders. Finally, we discuss the ways in which acupuncture treatment can potentially modulate glutamate receptors and excitatory amino acid transporters. We conclude that the treatment effects of acupuncture may be underpinned by its intervention in the dysregulated glutamate system. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to clarify the possible mechanisms of acupuncture in these neuropsychiatric disorders and to establish protocols for treatment guidelines.",2186626883.0," Journal Article , Review",2019
433,"""…and How Are the Kids?"" Psychoeducation for Adult Patients With Depressive and/or Anxiety Disorders: A Pilot Study.","Depressive and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and form a substantial burden for individuals and their family members. A recent study showed that approximately two-thirds of the children of patients with severe depressive and/or anxiety disorders develop one of these disorders themselves before 35 years of age. In the Netherlands, various preventive interventions are available for children of parents with mental illnesses. However, the actual reach of interventions is small (&lt; 1% of all children participate). A major barrier appeared to be parents' hesitancy to let children participate in preventive programs. In order to address this barrier, we designed a pilot study to implement a psychoeducation program on parenting and mental illnesses. The main aim of this study was to investigate how a preventive family-focused approach can be embedded in routine adult psychiatric care. The pilot started in April 2017 and has ended in September 2018. It was conducted in the University Center Psychiatry (UCP) in Groningen, The Netherlands. This article describes the implementation process so far. The main intervention was a monthly organized group-psychoeducation called ""parenting and a mental illness,"" which could be attended by parents currently treated in the UCP. In 18 months, implementation activities were divided in four phases; (1) Creating awareness, (2) Adoption of the intervention, (3) Implementation and evaluation, and (4) Continuation phase. The program development process was evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative data. Based on the pilot study we were able to make recommendations for the further implementation of this approach so that more parents can be reached in future. Further study with follow-up activities is needed to measure the effects of the psychoeducation, for instance on parenting functioning and the quality of the parent-child interaction.",2186143131.0, Journal Article,2019
434,The Influence of Expectancy Level and Personal Characteristics on Placebo Effects: Psychological Underpinnings.,"Placebo effects benefit a wide range of clinical practice, which can be profoundly influenced by expectancy level and personal characteristics. However, research on the issue of whether these factors independently or interdependently affect the placebo effects is still in its infancy. Here, we adopted a 3-day between-subject placebo analgesia paradigm (2-day conditioning and 1-day test) to investigate the influence of expectancy levels (i.e., No, Low, and High) and personal characteristics (i.e., gender, dispositional optimism, and anxiety state) on placebo effects in 120 healthy participants (60 females). Our results showed that the reduction of pain intensity in the test phase was influenced by the interaction between expectancy and gender, as mainly reflected by greater reductions of pain intensity in females at Low expectancy level than females at No/High expectancy levels, and greater reductions of pain intensity in males than in females at High expectancy level. Additionally, the reduction of pain unpleasantness was not only modulated by the interaction between expectancy and gender, but also by the interaction between expectancy and dispositional optimism, as well as the interaction between expectancy and anxiety state. Specifically, participants who were more optimistic in Low expectancy group, or those who were less anxious in High expectancy group showed greater reductions of pain unpleasantness. To sum up, we emphasized on regulating the expectancy level individually based on the assessment of personal characteristics to maximize placebo effects in clinical conditions.",2186142193.0, Journal Article,2019
435,Long-Term NMDAR Antagonism Correlates Weight Loss With Less Eating.,"Memantine hydrochloride is an uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist for treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have shown that memantine can significantly correct the binge-like eating behavior in human and animal models. People with overeating behavior are more likely to be obese. Therefore, we suppose that memantine would be a good candidate for the treatment of obesity. In this study, memantine was shown to increase weight loss in obese mice induced by high fat diet. Memantine was shown to decrease food intake without inducing abdominal discomfort and anxiety, suggesting that this compound would be a good candidate drug for obesity control.",2185874134.0, Journal Article,2019
436,School Bullying Among Left-Behind Children: The Efficacy of Art Therapy on Reducing Bullying Victimization.,"Background: Left-behind children (LBC) are becoming a widespread phenomenon and face higher risks of psychological and educational problems. Our study aimed to explore school bullying in LBC and examine the effectiveness of art therapy intervention for reducing bullying victimization affecting LBC in rural areas. Methods: A total of 603 children, including 272 LBC and 331 non-LBC, were sampled from 6 rural schools. Questionnaires regarding school life satisfaction, children's social anxiety, self-esteem, and school bullying were used to assess the psychological and school behavior status of these children. One Hundred and Eighty LBC who were victims of school bullying were then selected and randomly assigned to 3 groups to evaluate the effects of art therapy intervention. The interventions of art therapy and general counseling were conducted in 6 sessions over 3 months. Results: Our results demonstrated LBC experienced more bullying victimization than non-LBC. Left-behind boys were more likely to be bullied than left-behind girls. LBC &gt; 12 years old, LBC whose parents are divorced, separated, or widowed, were more vulnerable to being bullied. School bullying of LBC was affected by social anxiety scores and school life satisfaction. The bullying victimization of LBC in the art therapy group was significantly improved. Conclusions: LBC suffered more school bullying than did non-LBC. Art therapy can effectively help LBC in rural primary schools to reduce their vulnerability to bullying.",2185562668.0, Journal Article,2019
437,Changes in the Use of Emergency Care for the Youth With Mental Health Problems Over Decades: A Repeated Cross Sectional Study.,"To understand whether changes exist in the types of youths mental health problems addressed in emergency in a context of increasing demand, we conducted a retrospective chart review in an emergency care outpatient unit. Data from children and adolescents admitted at four different time periods (years 1981, 1992, 2002, and 2017) were compared to determine trends in terms of patients' characteristics, nature of the mental health problems and final care decisions. Between 1981 and 2017 there was a 3.85 times increase in the annual number of patients presenting to the emergency consultations. The proportion of youths being referred for anxiety or depressive symptoms sharply increased over time, while no differences were found for the proportion of aggressive behaviors and suicidal attempts. Anxiety disorders became the most frequent discharge psychiatric disorder in youths admitted in the emergency unit, rising from 5% in 1981 to 34% in 2017. Significant changes were also observed in the source of referral to the emergency unit; in particular emergency consultations in 2017 were about twice as likely as in 1981 to be requested directly by the family. This data suggested that the increased use of emergency services observed over the last decades is associated with significant changes in the patient and his/her family's demands about mental health difficulties. Such findings are worth considering for mental health interventions that aim to address the emergency overcrowding issue.",2184527562.0, Journal Article,2019
438,Mental Health Literacy of Youth That Have a Family Member With a Mental Illness: Outcomes From a New Program and Scale.,"A program evaluation examined mental health literacy levels and coping outcomes for youth (ages 10-16), before and at the end of their participation in a manualized, school-based mental health literacy program called Youth Education and Support (YES). Most of the youth reportedly had a parent or other family member with a mental health disorder such as depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse. The mental health literacy levels of program participants from pre to post were evaluated with the developing Knowledge of Mental Illness and Recovery (K-MIR) scale. This scale was validated using item-response theory, demonstrating good psychometric properties. Youth answered two coping questions about their use of positive coping during the program and coping skills compared from pre to post intervention. Findings revealed that youth levels of mental health literacy increased significantly from pre to post program participation. Over 90% of the youth reported an improved use of positive coping strategies from pre to post intervention. The program appeared to deliver enhanced levels of literacy and coping for this sample of youth. The scale appeared to be appropriate to measure youth mental health literacy. Recommendations for practice, policy, and research are offered.",2183652863.0, Journal Article,2019
7,"Changes in trauma-potentiated startle, skin conductance, and heart rate within prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD in high and low treatment responders","While exposure-based psychotherapy is recommended as a first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) given strong evidence for its effectiveness, some patients fail to receive full benefit. Psychophysiological data may be important complementary indices for investigating variability in treatment response and changes over the course of treatment. The focus of the present investigation was to examine change in psychophysiological indices pre- to post-treatment and to investigate if changes differed for high versus low PTSD treatment responders. Participants included veterans with primary PTSD diagnoses who received a two-week intensive prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Psychophysiological assessment included trauma-potentiated startle, heart rate, and skin conductance recordings during presentation of three standard virtual reality (VR)-based, trauma-relevant scenes presented through a head mounted display. Results indicate that 48.6% were classified as high treatment responders (≥ 50% reduction in PCL-5 from baseline). Trauma-potentiated startle was observed in all patients at pre-treatment, F = 13.58, p &lt; .001, in that startle magnitude was increased during VR stimuli relative to baseline regardless of responder status. However, in high treatment responders, there was an interaction of VR with time, F = 14.10, p = .001; VR scenes did not potentiate startle post-treatment. Specifically, high treatment responders were less reactive to trauma stimuli following PE treatment. There was no effect of time in the low responder group. Heart rate reactivity data revealed a significant main effect of treatment, F = 45.7, p = .035, but no significant interaction with responder status. Skin conductance reactivity did not significantly change from pre to post-treatment. These results suggest that trauma-potentiated startle may represent an objective marker of fear- and anxiety-related symptom reduction that is sensitive to both traditional outpatient as well as intensive treatment approaches.

8,Changes in dosing and dose timing of d-cycloserine explain its apparent declining efficacy for augmenting exposure therapy for anxiety-related disorders: An individual participant-data meta-analysis,"The apparent efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing exposure treatment for anxiety disorders appears to have declined over the past 14 years. We examined whether variations in how DCS has been administered can account for this “declining effect”. We also investigated the association between DCS administration characteristics and treatment outcome to find optimal dosing parameters. We conducted a secondary analysis of individual participant data obtained from 1047 participants in 21 studies testing the efficacy of DCS-augmented exposure treatments. Different outcome measures in different studies were harmonized to a 0-100 scale. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, in participants randomized to DCS augmentation (n = 523), fewer DCS doses, later timing of DCS dose, and lower baseline severity appear to account for this decline effect. More DCS doses were related to better outcomes, but this advantage leveled-off at nine doses. Administering DCS more than 60 minutes before exposures was also related to better outcomes. These predictors were not significant in the placebo arm (n = 521). Results suggested that optimal DCS administration could increase pre-to-follow-up DCS effect size by 50%. In conclusion, the apparent declining effectiveness of DCS over time may be accounted for by how it has been administered. Optimal DCS administration may substantially improve outcomes.

9,But what will the results be?: Learning to tolerate uncertainty is associated with treatment-produced gains,"The current study examined the association between changes in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and treatment outcomes for anxious youth. Participants were youth ages 7 to 17 who received cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety ( N = 73). Youth and their primary caregivers completed a diagnostic interview and self- and parent-report measures at pre- and post-treatment, including the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUS-C/P; Przeworski, 2006), the Coping Questionnaire (CQ-C/P; Kendall, 1994) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-C/P; March et al., 1997). Hierarchical regression analyses evaluated the role of change in IU (the IUS-C/P) in predicting changes in functional impairment, coping efficacy, and anxiety severity post-treatment, controlling for demographic variables (age and gender), and baseline levels of IU, anxiety severity, functional impairment, and coping efficacy. Results demonstrated that treatment was associated with improvements across child-, parent- and clinician-report, and decreased IU from pre- to post-treatment was associated with (a) decreased functional impairment, (b) increased coping efficacy and (c) decreased anxiety severity. The findings indicate that a greater reduction in IU over treatment is associated with better outcomes in children and adolescents with anxiety across informants, suggesting the possibility that an increased focus on IU during treatment for youth anxiety may improve treatment outcomes. Future research should assess the causality of this relationship.

10,The association between prenatal maternal anxiety disorders and postpartum perceived and observed mother-infant relationship quality,"Introduction: Prenatal maternal anxiety disorders have been associated with adverse outcomes in offspring including emotional, behavioral and cognitive problems. There is limited understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these associations, although one possible candidate is an impaired mother-infant relationship. The authors investigated whether prenatal anxiety disorders were associated with poorer postpartum mother-infant relationship quality, measured by maternal self-reported bonding and observed mother-infant interactions. Methods: A cohort of 454 pregnant women recruited from an inner-city maternity service in London (UK) were assessed for mental disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and followed up at mid-pregnancy and 3-months postpartum. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and mid-pregnancy (using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). At three months postpartum, women were assessed for self-reported bonding difficulties (using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire) and a subsample (n = 204) participated in video-recorded mother-infant interaction, coded using the Child-Adult Relationship Experimental Index by an independent rater. Results: Prenatal anxiety disorders were associated with higher perceived bonding impairment, but not associated with observed poor mother-infant interaction quality. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with lower maternal sensitivity. Conclusions: Interventions for anxiety disorders in the perinatal period could be tailored to address anxieties about mother-infant relationship and co-morbid depressive symptoms.

11,Social problem solving in social anxiety disorder,"Successful social problem solving requires both an adaptive orientation toward the problem and the necessary skills to generate relevant and effective solutions. Surprisingly few studies have examined social problem solving in the context of social anxiety. We examined social problem solving in 38 participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in comparison to 30 healthy control (HC) participants with no history of anxiety problems. Participants rated their problem solving attitudes and abilities (i.e., problem orientation ) and then generated solutions to hypothetical interpersonal problems from both their own perspective and that of an objective other. These solutions were coded for effectiveness and relevance, as well as the degree to which the solution was active versus passive. Participants with SAD exhibited a more negative problem orientation than HC participants. Furthermore, although SAD and HC participants demonstrated no overall differences in generating relevant and effective solutions to interpersonal problems, utilizing a personal perspective facilitated the generation of more active solutions for HC participants, but less active solutions for those with SAD. Findings illuminate new research directions regarding social problem solving in social anxiety, with potential implications for applied intervention.

12,"Effortful control, interpretation biases, and child anxiety symptom severity in a sample of children with anxiety disorders","Introduction: Effortful control—the ability to inhibit impulsive reactions in favor of more adaptive responses—is negatively related to child anxiety severity. One potential explanation is that greater effortful control may “slow down” automatic, threat-laden interpretations, thereby lowering children’s anxiety. The present investigation tested this hypothesis by examining associations between effortful control (and its subcomponents) and anxiety symptom severity, mediated by interpretation biases, in a diverse sample of clinically anxious youth. Method: Participants ( N = 105; M age = 10.09 years, SD = 1.22; 56.7% female; 49% ethnic minority) completed a diagnostic interview; self-report measures of temperament, anxiety, and interpretation biases; a performance-based measure of interpretation biases; and a parent–child interaction task for which an index of behavioral anxiety was computed. Results: Significant indirect effects were found for effortful control, attentional control, and inhibitory control on child self-reported anxiety severity by way of self-reported (but not behaviorally-indexed) interpretation biases. Models predicting behaviorally-indexed child anxiety severity were not significant. Discussion: Greater effortful control may result in enhanced attentional capacities that allow children to assess automatic cognitions more objectively, potentially lowering their anxiety. Future work should evaluate whether targeting malleable temperamental constructs, such as effortful control, leads to clinically meaningful reductions in interpretation biases and child anxiety symptoms.

13,"Reassurance seeking in the anxiety disorders and OCD: Construct validation, clinical correlates and CBT treatment response","Background: Reassurance seeking has been hypothesized to be a key factor in the maintenance of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders according to contemporary cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches. The present study sought to examine the structure, clinical correlates, and malleability of reassurance seeking in the context of CBT treatment. Methods: Treatment-seeking participants ( N = 738) with DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) completed the Reassurance Seeking Scale (RSS) with other symptom measures prior to and following CBT treatment. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis supported a three factor solution: the need to seek excessive reassurance regarding decisions, attachment and the security of relationships, and perceived general threat and anxiety. The RSS was moderately correlated with general measures of anxiety and depression as well as disorder-specific symptom scales. Further, CBT was found to produce changes in reassurance seeking across CBT treatments and these reductions were significantly associated with disorder-specific clinical improvement. Conclusion: Reassurance seeking appears to be a common factor across anxiety disorders and its reduction in CBT treatment is associated with improved clinical outcomes.

14,Examining the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of anxiety sensitivity on indicators of disease severity among patients with inflammatory arthritis,"Few studies have investigated anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the context of inflammatory arthritis (IA), despite evidence of a relationship between AS and pain. This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between AS and indicators of IA severity in 148 participants with IA. AS and its factors (social, physical, cognitive) were self-reported. Arthritis severity was physician-assessed (disease activity scales) and self-reported (physical function; pain and fatigue). Cross-sectional correlations assessed the association between AS and arthritis severity outcomes. Longitudinal multivariable mixed-effect regressions assessed the association of AS total and AS factors at each visit with disease severity outcomes. All AS factors were significantly and positively correlated (at the same visit) with function, pain, and fatigue. AS total significantly predicted pain, fatigue, and function. Cognitive AS significantly predicted fatigue, and physical AS significantly predicted pain and fatigue. Social AS significantly predicted pain, fatigue, function and weighted joint count (articular burden). AS is associated with several indicators of disease severity among those with IA; unique findings emerged across factors with the broadest disease impact by social AS. The AS factors, especially social AS, may contribute to the development and severity of IA symptoms, which may have implications for interventions.

15,Processes in cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder: Predicting subsequent symptom change,"Although cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, little is known about the processes during treatment that bring about change. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the proposed processes of change according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder predicted subsequent symptom reduction in CBT delivered as therapist-guided bibliotherapy. We analyzed data from patients with social anxiety disorder ( N = 61) who participated in an effectiveness trial of CBT in primary care. Seven putative processes and outcome (i.e., social anxiety) were assessed on a weekly basis throughout treatment. We used linear mixed models to analyze within-person relations between processes and outcome. The results showed a unidirectional effect of reduced avoidance on subsequent decrease in social anxiety. Further, we found support for reciprocal influences between four of the proposed processes (i.e., estimated probability and cost of adverse outcome, self-focused attention, and safety behaviors) and social anxiety. The remaining two processes, (i.e., anticipatory and post-event processing) did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but were predicted by prior symptom reduction. The findings support that several of the change processes according to the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder are involved in symptom improvement.

16,Neural responses to social evaluation: The role of fear of positive and negative evaluation,"One of the core features of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the persistent fear of being evaluated. Fear of evaluation includes fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Few studies have examined the relationship between self-reported FNE and FPE and neural responses to simulated negative and positive social evaluation. In the current study, 56 participants, 35 with SAD and 21 healthy controls, completed questionnaires to assess dimensions of social anxiety including FNE and FPE, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants also completed a social evaluation task, which involved viewing people delivering criticism and praise, and a control task, which involved counting asterisks, during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although whole-brain analyses did not reveal significant associations between self-reported constructs and neural responses to social evaluation, region of interest analyses for the sample as a whole revealed that both FNE and social anxiety symptoms were associated with greater neural responses to both criticism and praise in emotion-processing brain regions, including the amygdala and anterior insula. There were no significant associations between FPE or depressive symptoms and neural responses to criticism or praise for the sample as a whole. Future research should examine the relationship between FNE, FPE, and neural responses to self-referent social evaluation in an unselected sample to assess a full range of fear of evaluation.

17,Problematic driving in former service members: An evaluation of the Driving Behavior Survey in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Despite high levels of traffic-related mortality, injury, and impairment among former service members, measures validated to assess problematic driving in this population remain limited. The current study examined characteristics of the Driving Behavior Survey (DBS) in male veterans (76.3% White; age: M = 56.4, SD = 12.3) meeting criteria for PTSD. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable fit of a 3-factor model specifying dimensions of anxiety-based performance deficits, exaggerated safety/caution, and hostile/aggressive driving behavior. Concurrent associations with indices of anxiety, depression, trauma history, and clinician-rated PTSD were consistent with small ( r = .10–.29) to medium ( r = .30–.49) effects. Discriminative validity was noted through elevations in performance deficit ( d = .26), safety/caution ( d = .50), and hostile/aggressive ( d = .39) scales relative to published data from student drivers. Scores comparable to civilian motorists with accident-related PTSD help to qualify the severity of problematic driving behavior in trauma-exposed veterans.

The publisher regrets that several errors were made during the production process, most notably several relating to the authors and their respective affiliations. In addition, two references were inadvertently omitted from the original paper. The correct affiliations and the omitted references are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-27063-009). Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence rate of 12.1%. It is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of one or more social situations (e.g., talking to a stranger or peer, going to a party) or performance activities (e.g., giving a speech) in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people, and may face possible scrutiny by others. These difficulties in interpersonal interactions experienced by individuals with SAD result in significant impairment in almost all facets of daily life, including relationships, work, and studies. Considering the large body of research on SAD, and despite accumulating data about gender differences in other disorders there is a paucity of research directly examining gender differences in SAD. However, a recent review of the literature found gender differences in a number of domains of SAD and stressed the need for more research on the topic as gender differences can have substantial clinical implications. The present study is focused on identifying and elucidating gender differences in pretreatment clinical severity, treatment seeking, attrition and treatment response in SAD.

19,Rural living environment predicts social anxiety in transgender and gender nonconforming individuals across Canada and the United States,"Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals frequently confront discrimination, rejection, and violence. Such experiences may put TGNC individuals at risk for minority stress and associated psychiatric symptoms. Protective factors like social support, pride in one’s gender identity, or connectedness to similar others may make TGNC individuals less vulnerable to psychiatric symptoms, and the presence of risk and protective factors may vary depending on living environment. This study examined the relationship of living environment (urban vs. suburban vs. small-town/rural) to social anxiety (SA) in a sample of 902 TGNC individuals who participated in the Trans Health Survey. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in SA across living environments. Those living in small-town/rural environments reported significantly higher levels of SA compared to those living in urban environments. There was a trend-level difference in SA in suburban compared to urban environments. Linear regression analyses revealed that living environment significantly moderated the relationship between social support and SA. Higher social support was more protective against elevated SA in urban and suburban than in small-town/rural environments. This study is the first to demonstrate the experience of elevated SA among TGNC individuals living in rural environments. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.

20,The impact of uncontrollability beliefs and thought-related distress on ecological momentary interventions for generalized anxiety disorder: A moderated mediation model,"This study was a secondary analysis of LaFreniere and Newman (2016), a randomized controlled trial comparing two ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): The worry outcome journal (WOJ) and thought log (TL). We predicted that higher thought-related distress would be a mediator by which higher uncontrollability beliefs (UB) would hinder the efficacy of the WOJ, but not the TL. Fifty-one undergraduates who met GAD criteria underwent one of the EMIs for 10 days. WOJ users tracked worries, associated distress, interference, expected outcome probabilities, and whether their worries came true four times/day. TL users tracked general thoughts, associated distress, and interference four times/day. Bootstrapping path analysis was used to analyze moderated mediation models. Higher UB predicted higher thought-related distress for both EMIs. Higher UB also predicted reduced efficacy of the WOJ at post-trial and of both EMIs at 30-day follow-up. However, for WOJ users, when higher initial UB levels predicted higher thought-related distress early in treatment, participants reported greater levels of worry at post-trial and follow-up. In contrast, UB’s effect on the TL group at post-trial and follow-up was not mediated by early distress. Thought-related distress appears to be a mechanism by which UB impedes the WOJ intervention.

21,"Examining a novel, parent child interaction therapy-informed, behavioral treatment of selective mutism","Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new therapy for children with selective mutism (SM) that combines Parent-Child Interaction Therapy principles and behavioral techniques. Method: Children aged 4–10 with a primary diagnosis of SM were eligible to participate. Comorbidity was allowed with the exception of autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, mania or psychosis. Of 54 potentially eligible participants, 33 met inclusion/exclusion criteria of which 31 families consented (94%). Following assessment, children were waitlisted for an average of 4 months before receiving 16 sessions of weekly therapy at an outpatient psychiatry clinic of a children’s hospital in Vancouver, Canada; all children completed treatment. Assessments were conducted at time of referral (baseline), pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 month follow up, and 1 year follow up. Two did not complete follow up assessments (93% retention). Results: Results showed significant and large (Cohen’s d = 1.80) gains in speaking behaviors across contexts from pre- to post-treatment. Gains were maintained at 3-months and 1-year post-treatment. Statistically significant and large improvements were also found in post-treatment teacher and parent reports of child anxiety as well as a behavioral measure of the child speaking to an unknown adult. Parents reported high satisfaction with treatment. None of the potential predictors of treatment response examined were found to be significant. Conclusions: PCIT-SM appears to be an effective treatment for children aged 4–10 with SM.

22,Changes in post-event processing during cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder: A longitudinal analysis using post-session measurement and experience sampling methodology,"Purpose: Post-event processing (PEP) is posited to be an important factor in the maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. Previous research has demonstrated that general PEP tendencies are sensitive to treatment. However, it remains unclear how momentary PEP following social interactions changes over the course of treatment for social anxiety disorder. The purpose of the present study was to examine how both momentary and general PEP change over the course of treatment, and how such changes predict treatment outcome. Method: Participants (N = 60) with social anxiety disorder were enrolled in group cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants completed measures of PEP and social anxiety symptom severity at five time points over treatment. A subset (N = 33) also completed repeated experience sampling measurements of PEP following social interactions across the course of treatment. Results: Both general and momentary PEP decreased over the course of treatment. Decreases in both types of PEP predicted lower social anxiety symptom severity following treatment. Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrate that momentary experiences of PEP can be influenced by treatment, and can in turn impact treatment outcome. The findings have significant clinical and theoretical implications.

23,Prevalence and correlates of generalized anxiety disorder in Singapore: Results from the second Singapore Mental Health Study,"The aim of this paper is to report findings on the epidemiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using data from the Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) 2016, and draw comparisons with results from the first SMHS in 2010. Singapore residents aged 18 years and above participated in the household survey where the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 was administered to assess the prevalence of GAD and other mental health conditions. The findings revealed that the lifetime prevalence of GAD was 1.6% among the Singapore general population in 2016, an increase from the 0.9% in 2010. More lifetime GAD cases were reported across several sociodemographic groups including age and employment status. Lifetime GAD was significantly associated with higher odds of several comorbid psychiatric conditions (OR = 3.8–9.3, p &lt; 0.05). Treatment seeking behavior did not differ significantly when compared to SMHS 2010 and there was still a considerable treatment gap among individuals with GAD. Future intervention programs to reduce anxiety and encourage help-seeking behavior could be implemented at institutes of higher learning and workplace settings to reach the targeted audience.

24,Pupil dilation to emotional expressions in adolescent social anxiety disorder is related to treatment outcome,"Atypical attention to potential social threats, such as emotional faces, may be one of the core mechanisms underlying social anxiety disorder (SAD). Pupil dilation is an index of locus coreuleus-noradrenergic activity, and closely linked to attention. In the present study, pupil dilation was studied in adolescents with SAD ( N = 26; 22 Female) before the onset of a 12-week cognitive behavioral treatment, and in healthy controls ( N = 23). Stimuli were faces with angry or happy emotional expressions. Contrary to our hypothesis, the SAD group did not show hyper-responsiveness to angry compared to happy faces. Instead, an atypical time course of the pupil dilation response was found, resulting in an attenuated response during late time stages. Larger pupil dilation amplitude to happy faces before treatment was related to worse treatment response. These results contribute significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adolescent SAD.

25,Childhood adversities and psychopathology among military veterans in the US: The mediating role of social networks,"Childhood adversities can impact negatively on psychological health across the lifespan. Many military veterans have a history of adverse childhood experiences, which when combined with deployment related traumas, can lead to high levels of psychopathology. Social networks can however be protective. The current study aimed to identify typologies of childhood adversity in U.S. military veterans ( n = 3092) and explore relationships between the adversity typologies and PTSD, mood and anxiety disorders, utilising data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III). The mediating role of quality and quantity of social networks were examined. Latent class analysis identified four adversity classes; 1) baseline, 2) household dysfunction, 3) maltreatment, and 4) multi-adversity. Individuals in the adversity classes (2–4), especially those who experienced multi-adversity had higher rates of psychopathology. The quality of social networks played an important mediating role, while quantity of networks did not. Those who experienced adversity were less likely to have supportive social networks, therefore adversity had both a direct and indirect impact on psychopathology. The findings highlight the importance of developing and maintaining social networks following military life. Recommendations include interpersonal skills training and programmes which may help them engage back into the community and enhance relationships.

26,Sex differences in the etiology of disgust sensitivity: A preliminary behavioral genetic analysis,"Evidence suggests that Disgust Sensitivity (DS) is a personality trait that may confer risk for the development of some anxiety-related disorders. To examine the origins of this trait we administered the DS subscale of the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised to 90 monozygotic and 90 dizygotic twin pairs, of which 55% were women. The DS subscale consists of two dimensions; Somatic Disgust and Ruminative Disgust. Biometrical modeling techniques were used to estimate heritability of the DS dimensions by sex. For women, each dimension was influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. More specifically, 40.1% of the variance in DS was observed to be due to additive genetic factors and the remaining variance due to non-shared environment. Correlations among DS dimensions for women could be explained by genetic and environmental factors influencing the two dimensions. For men, the two dimensions were influenced by environmental but not genetic factors. These findings suggest that the etiology of DS is complex and arises as a function of dimension-specific and non-specific etiologic factors that vary as a function of sex. The implication of these findings for the sex differences in the etiology of some anxiety-related disorders are discussed.

27,"Self- and other-perceptions of interpersonal problems: Effects of generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression","Despite attention on overlap and distinction between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), interpersonal specificity (distinct, prototypical interpersonal features) between the disorders has been understudied. There is emerging evidence for such specificity (e.g., Erickson et al., 2016), but most studies relied on self-report, and not all studies controlled for shared variance between the disorders, complicating interpretation of findings. The present study extended the literature by examining unique interpersonal correlates of GAD, SAD, and MDD symptoms on self- and informant-report, and how self-informant agreement (both mean-level and correlation) in perception of interpersonal affiliation, dominance, and distress varied as a function of the symptoms. 369 college-aged participants (43% with clinical-level symptoms for at least one of the disorders (GAD, SAD, MDD), 57% non-disordered) and up to three of their significant others rated participants’ interpersonal problems (interpersonal behaviors that were difficult to engage in or engaged in excessively). We found evidence for exploitable tendencies in GAD, socially avoidant and nonassertive tendencies in SAD, and coldness in MDD based on self-report, but not on informant-report. Although self-other correlation was positive across outcomes, participants endorsed higher affiliation and interpersonal distress and lower dominance relative to informants. GAD, SAD, and MDD symptoms showed distinct moderating effects on these self-informant discrepancies. GAD symptoms predicted over-endorsing affiliation, SAD predicted under-endorsing dominance and affiliation, and MDD predicted no discrepancies in affiliation and dominance. The results speak to potential differentiation of the disorders based on distinct patterns of self-other discrepancy in interpersonal perceptions.

28,“Fear guides the eyes of the beholder”: Assessing gaze avoidance in social anxiety disorder via covert eye tracking of dynamic social stimuli,"Gaze avoidance is an important feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and may serve as a biobehavioral marker of SAD. The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend findings on gaze avoidance in SAD via eye tracking during a computerized social simulation. Patients with SAD ( n = 27) and a (sub)sample of demographically-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 22) completed a computerized, dynamic social simulation task involving video clips of actors giving positive and negative social feedback to the participant. All participants were unknowingly eye tracked during the simulation, and post-study consent was obtained to examine responses. Consistent with the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model of social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to positive social feedback, and fear of negative evaluation related systematically to state anxiety in response to negative social feedback. Moreover, compared to HCs, SAD patients exhibited significantly greater global gaze avoidance in response to both the positive and negative video clips. Our results provide strong additional support for gaze avoidance as a biobehavioral marker of SAD, as well as additional support for the BFOE model. Implications for the assessment and treatment of SAD are discussed.

29,Enhanced cognitive control over task-irrelevant emotional distractors in generalized anxiety disorder versus obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined in part by excessive and uncontrollable worry. However, little is known about cognitive control abilities in adults with GAD. The present study examined cognitive control over negative and neutral material in a mixed clinical sample of adults with GAD and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder and a comparison healthy control sample. Participants completed a novel emotional variant of the AX-CPT (eAX-CPT) to index proactive and reactive cognitive control in the presence of negative and neutral distractor stimuli. Participants with GAD demonstrated enhanced cognitive control specifically over negative emotional distractors, relative to neutral distractors (within-subjects) and relative to OCD and controls (between-subjects). Findings were specific to GAD versus trait worry; however, higher trait worry predicted better cognitive control in GAD only. These findings are inconsistent with deficit-based cognitive models of GAD and may be better accounted for by models that conceptualize worry as an intentional (albeit maladaptive) cognitive control or emotion regulation strategy that is actively maintained by individuals with GAD in order to avoid engaging with more distressing emotional information.

30,Measuring treatment outcome in patients with anxiety disorders: A comparison of the responsiveness of generic and disorder-specific instruments,"Background: For routine outcome monitoring, generic (i.e., broad-based) and disorder-specific instruments are used to monitor patient progress. While disorder-specific instruments may be more sensitive to therapeutic change, generic measures can be applied more broadly and allow for an assessment of therapeutic change, irrespective of a specific anxiety disorder. Our goal was to investigate whether disorder-specific instruments for anxiety disorders are a valuable (or even necessary) addition to generic instruments for an appropriate assessment of treatment outcome in groups of patients. Methods: Data were collected from 2002 to 2013 from psychiatric outpatients in treatment for Social Phobia (SP; n = 834), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD; n = 661), Panic Disorder (PD; n = 944), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD; n = 460), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; n = 691). Instruments used were the generic Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), The Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ), and several disorder-specific instruments (e.g., Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Social Phobia Scale, Panic Appraisal Inventory, etc.). Responsiveness (i.e., sensitivity to therapeutic change) was examined through correlational analyses, effect sizes (ES), and analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results: The MASQ appeared generally more responsive than the BSI, except for the BSI Anxiety subscale for PD. Disorder-specific measures equaled the MASQ and BSI in responsiveness. When statistically significant differences occurred, the ES was small. Discussion/conclusions: For most anxiety disorder groups (i.e., SP, PD and OCD), the MASQ or BSI was equally suited as disorder-specific instruments to detect change at group level. Exceptions are GAD and PTSD. These findings suggest limited incremental information value of disorder-specific instruments over the MASQ and BSI for measuring change.

A phrasing error has been discovered in one of the items of the self-report instrument used as a primary outcome measure in the trial. Consequently, the item is perceived as one that should be reverse-coded (the Swedish equivalent of the word “not” was omitted), yet the total scores used for analyses and reported in the publication were not adjusted for this error. The results of reverse-coding the item and calculating new total scores for each individual and time point are discussed in this corrigendum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-36762-001). Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common condition which can be treated effectively with exposure therapy. However, inherent difficulties in stimuli presentation and control limits dissemination and the therapeutic potential. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to resolve these issues and provide a scalable platform for self-help interventions. No previous study has examined whether this can be achieved using the first generation of consumer VR hardware and software. In the current trial, n = 25 + 25 participants were randomized to either one-session therapist-led VR exposure therapy for PSA followed by a four-week internet-administered VR to in-vivo transition program, or a waiting-list. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (within Cohen’s d = 1.67) decreases in self-reported PSA. The waiting-list was then given access to an internet-administered, self-led version of the same VR exposure therapy to be conducted at home, followed by the same transition program. Dual-slope mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (d = 1.35) decreases in self-reported PSA. Results were maintained or improved at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. We show for the first time that low-cost, off-the-shelf consumer VR hardware and software can be used to conduct exposure therapy for PSA, both in the traditional, previously impractical one-session format, and in a novel self-led, at-home format.

32,"Safety behaviors, experiential avoidance, and anxiety: A path analysis approach","Avoidance has long been viewed as an etiological mechanism of anxiety disorders. Of more recent focus within this literature is the distinction between avoidance that is trait-based (experiential avoidance) versus contextual (safety behaviors). Whereas both experiential avoidance and safety behaviors have been studied within anxiety research, no known studies have evaluated the direct and indirect relationships of these forms of avoidance in predicting critical outcomes, particularly in conjunction with symptom severity. To address this gap, the current study assessed social anxiety and panic symptoms, experiential avoidance, use of preventive and restorative safety behaviors, and quality of life to determine the direct and indirect contributions of trait-based and contextual avoidance in predicting clinically relevant outcomes via path analysis. U.S. adults with elevated social anxiety or panic symptoms ( n = 254) were recruited online. Results from path analysis showed that, across groups, the relationship between symptoms and quality of life was indirectly accounted for by use of preventive safety behaviors. Further, for participants with panic symptoms (but not for those with social anxiety symptoms), experiential avoidance predicted quality of life even after accounting for use of preventive safety behaviors. The results of this study indicate that trait-based and contextual avoidance contribute significantly to clinically relevant outcomes.

34,External validation of the international risk prediction algorithm for the onset of generalized anxiety and/or panic syndromes (the Predict A) in the US general population,"Introduction: Multivariable risk prediction algorithms are useful for making clinical decisions and health planning. While prediction algorithms for new onset of anxiety disorders in Europe and elsewhere have been developed, the performance of these algorithms in the Americas is not known. The objective of this study was to validate the PredictA algorithm for new onset of anxiety and/or panic disorders in the US general population. Methods: Longitudinal study design was conducted with approximate 2-year follow-up data from a total of 24 626 individuals who participated in Wave 1 and 2 of the US National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and who did not have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder in the past year at Wave 1. The PredictA algorithm was directly applied to the selected participants. Results: Among the participants, 5.4% developed GAD and/or panic disorder over two years. The PredictA algorithm had a discriminative power (C-statistics = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.61; 0.64), but poor calibration (p &lt; 0.001) with the NESARC data. The observed and the mean predicted risk of GAD and/or panic disorders in the NESARC were 5.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Particularly, the observed and predicted risks of GAD and/or panic disorders in the highest decile of risk score in the NESARC participants were 13.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The PredictA algorithm has acceptable discrimination, but the calibration with the NESARC data was poor. The PredictA algorithm is likely to underestimate the risk of GAD/panic disorders in the US population. Therefore, the use of PredictA in the US general population for predicting individual risk of GAD and/or panic disorders is not encouraged.

35,An integrative review of the vigilance-avoidance model in pediatric anxiety disorders: Are we looking in the wrong place?,"Enduring cognitive models of anxiety posit that negative biases in information processing are implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and recurrence of anxiety disorders in youth and adults. Specifically, the vigilance-avoidance model of attention is an influential hypothesis proposed to explain anxious individuals’ attentional patterns. The vigilance-avoidance model posits that anxious individuals, relative to nonanxious individuals, initially orient more quickly to threatening stimuli and then later avoid threatening stimuli. However, a large body of empirical research examining attentional mechanisms in anxious individuals uses paradigms that do not allow the measurement of the time course of attention. Furthermore, existing reviews that examine the time course of attention only include studies with adults. We systematically review in depth the literature that compares anxious and non-anxious children that takes advantage of research designs that allow the examination of the time course of attention. Across studies, there is not robust support for the vigilance-avoidance model in samples of anxious youth. Future research examining attention biases across time should employ tasks that more directly measure multiple stages of attention, in order to assess if vigilance-avoidance patterns emerge based on sample characteristics or task variables, and to inform intervention efforts.

36,Heart rate variability in patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder remains stable during CBT but increases following in-vivo exposure,"Patients with anxiety disorders have a lower heart rate variability (HRV) than healthy controls. Low HRV is associated with cardiovascular disease and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The aim of the present study was to investigate if HRV in patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder can be influenced by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 73 patients with agoraphobia with or without panic disorder were included in the study. Heart rate (HR) and HRV were recorded at rest before and after CBT and during in-vivo exposure. No changes in HR and HRV were observed throughout therapy. During in-vivo exposure HRV increased significantly and HR exhibited a tendency to decrease. Despite clinical improvement of anxiety symptoms, ANS activity at rest did not seem to be influenced by CBT. However, during in-vivo exposure, HRV changed significantly, indicating a higher parasympathetic activity at the end of exposure.

37,The efficacy of interventions for test-anxious university students: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Test anxiety (TA) is highly distressing and can significantly undermine academic performance. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for university students with TA have been conducted, but there has been no systematic review of their efficacy. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy of interventions for test-anxious university students in: (i) reducing TA, and (ii) improving academic performance. We searched for RCTs published in English language peer-reviewed journals. Forty-four RCTs met our eligibility criteria ( n = 2,209). Interventions were superior to control conditions at post-treatment for reducing TA ( g = −0.76) and improving academic performance ( g = 0.37). Interventions were superior to control conditions at follow-up. Subgroups analyses found most support for behaviour therapy. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, study skills training, and combined psychological and study skills training interventions show promise but lack evidence for their longer-term efficacy, and results are based upon a small number of studies. Evidence of publication bias was found and poor quality of reporting meant that confidence in results should be moderated. Future RCTs should be conducted and reported with greater rigour, have larger samples, and examine newer interventions.

38,An initial review of residual symptoms after empirically supported trauma-focused cognitive behavioral psychological treatment,"Objective: Although residual symptoms remain following clinical treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little is known about the characteristics of these residual symptoms. We aimed to determine the type, severity, and frequency of symptoms that remain after trauma-focused psychotherapy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of 51 randomized controlled trials of empirically supported psychosocial interventions for PTSD (68 total treatment arms). Outcomes included: 1) PTSD symptoms and 2) conditions commonly comorbid with PTSD: depression, anxiety, and quality of life impairment. Results: In general, the results revealed that participants who completed PTSD treatment continued to report residual PTSD symptoms: 31% reported clinical symptom levels, and 59% reported subthreshold levels at posttreatment, particularly within the hyperarousal cluster. Residual symptoms also emerged for depression (19% clinical), anxiety (55% clinical), and quality of life (36% clinical). Few differences emerged across treatment types, but differential patterns were revealed for sample/trauma types. Conclusions: Results suggest a need for focused research attention to and clinical assessment of individual residual symptoms following empirically supported treatment for PTSD to determine whether further treatment sessions are warranted.

39,Preference trial of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy comparing standard weekly versus optional weekly therapist support,"Emerging evidence from research trials suggests that Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) produces similar symptom improvements whether patients receive weekly therapist support ( standard support ) or therapist support only when requested ( optional support ). It remains unknown, however, how many patients receiving ICBT as part of routine clinical care would prefer optional support compared to standard support and how outcomes compare when patients select their preferred treatment option. In this uncontrolled trial, we investigated patient preference and outcomes for standard versus optional support among patients with depression and or anxiety who were offered an 8-week transdiagnostic ICBT intervention in routine care. Of 401 patients accepted for ICBT, 22% selected optional support and 78% selected standard support. At assessment, patients who selected optional support had lower symptoms of anxiety and panic than patients who selected standard support. At post-treatment, both groups achieved similar large improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression, with improvements sustained at 3-month follow-up. Patients receiving optional support sent and received fewer messages compared to patients receiving standard support. This study demonstrates the potential of optional therapist support to meet the needs and preferences of patients and to also reduce therapist costs in routine care.

40,Inverse reasoning processes in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Replication in a clinical sample,"The inference-based approach (IBA) is one cognitive model that aims to explain the aetiology and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). IBA theory suggests that certain reasoning processes lead an individual with OCD to confuse imagined possibilities with actual probabilities, a process termed inferential confusion. One such reasoning process is inverse reasoning, where hypothetical causes form the basis of conclusions about reality. Recently, we developed a task-based measure of inverse reasoning. In an online sample, we reported significant and positive associations between endorsement of inverse reasoning on this task and OCD symptomatology. We concluded that there was some support for the role of inverse reasoning in OCD but these results required extension using a between-groups design in a clinical sample. Therefore, the present study compared endorsement in inverse reasoning on this task between individuals diagnosed with OCD, anxiety and/or mood disorder (clinical controls), and healthy individuals (healthy controls). Relative to both control groups, the OCD group demonstrated significantly greater endorsement in inverse reasoning on scenarios where OCD relevant concerns were prompted. When non-OCD relevant concerns were involved, the OCD group only evidenced greater endorsement in inverse reasoning relative to the healthy control group. Implications for IBA theory are discussed.

41,Mapping the frequency and severity of anxiety behaviors in preschool-aged children,"Although anxiety can be early-emerging, impairing, and persistent, behaviors relevant to anxiety mirror typical development in early childhood. To better understand the spectrum of typical to problematic behavior, this study characterizes the range of frequency and severity of separation and social anxiety behaviors and associated impairment in preschool-aged children using a novel daily diary method. Primary caregivers of 291 3-5-year-old children reported the frequency of children’s daily separation and social anxiety behaviors and related impairment for 14 days. Frequencies of each separation and social anxiety behavior were computed and item response theory analyses revealed the specific frequencies at which the behavior was considered psychometrically severe/rare. Patterns varied across items; for example, worry that caregiver would not return and shyness with familiar adults had to occur at least 3–4 times over 14 days for the behavior to be considered severe/rare, whereas shyness around peers and new people were not severe at any frequency. In addition, behaviors were associated with impairment. To our knowledge, these data are the first to delineate empirical, dimensional information about the frequency and severity of anxiety behaviors and associated impairment in early childhood. Such data could be useful for clinical practice to enhance empirically-driven assessment of anxiety.

42,A systematic review of the role of parents in the development of anxious cognitions in children,"Anxious cognitions and parental behavior are important in the development of child anxiety. The current review aims to appraise the literature on the relationship between parental factors and chid anxious cognitions. Online database searches of PsycInfo, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Web of Science were systematically searched using key terms related to ‘parent’, ‘child’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘cognitions’. Included studies (N = 13) were quality assessed and study findings were appraised in line with cognitive behavioral frameworks of the parental pathways to the development of anxious cognitions in children. Reviewed studies confirmed that parental factors have a role in the development of their children’s anxious cognitions by modelling fearful responses, reducing their child’s autonomy, and indirectly via their own expectations about their child. Limitations of the literature are considered, including issues of measurement. Future research should consider multi-modal assessment of parental factors and examine parental behavior and child anxious cognitions in the context of real-life threatening events.

43,Intolerance of uncertainty and &lt;i&gt;DSM-5&lt;/i&gt; PTSD symptoms: Associations among a treatment seeking veteran sample,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), defined as an inability to tolerate the unpleasant response triggered by the observed absence of information, has received increased empirical attention in recent years. The contribution of this cognitive behavioral construct to the etiology and maintenance of various anxiety disorders has become increasingly recognized. However, the relationship between IU and other affective disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), remains largely unexplored. The current study sought to examine the relationship between IU and overall PTSD symptom and cluster severity using an outpatient sample of veterans ( N = 116) assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition ( DSM-5 ) PTSD symptom structure. Results revealed that IU was significantly associated with overall PTSD symptom severity, above and beyond relevant covariates. Further, IU was significantly associated with the PTSD avoidance and hyperarousal clusters. Prospective IU, rather than inhibitory IU, accounted for these unique associations. These findings add to a growing body of literature establishing IU as a transdiagnostic risk factor and point to the importance of future research on the role of IU in contributing to and/or maintaining PTSD symptoms.

44,Family accommodation mediates nightmares and sleep-related problems in anxious children,"Nightmares are commonly reported in clinically anxious children and are associated with the presence of other sleep-related problems. Family accommodation has been theorized as playing a central role in the sleep-related problems of anxious children, but empirical data is lacking. We examined associations between nightmares, maternal reports of family accommodation, and sleep-related problems in clinically anxious children. We also examined a hypothesized mediational pathway linking nightmares to other sleep-related problems, through increased family accommodation using structural equation modeling. Participants were 277 clinically anxious children (ages 6–17), and their mothers. Nightmares were reported in over three quarters of the children and were linked to higher mother-rated accommodation and to sleep-related problems. Fit indices for the structural equation model were excellent, and data supported the hypothesis that family accommodation mediates the association between nightmares and sleep-related problems in the anxious children. Results provide the first empirical evidence for the role of family accommodation in nightmares and other sleep-related problems in anxious children. Implications for assessment and treatment of childhood anxiety are discussed.

45,Efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for the treatment of dental phobia in adults: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Although Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has proven to be effective in the treatment of various subtypes of specific phobia, there is limited evidence of its role in the treatment of dental phobia. Method: A single-blind RCT was conducted among 30 randomized patients with dental phobia to either VRET or informational pamphlet (IP) condition. Primary outcome anxiety measures (VAS-A, MDAS and DFS) were evaluated at baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 1-week, 3-months and 6-months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures assessed were pre-post behavioral avoidance, temporal variations of heart rate and VR-experience during and post-VRET, and dental treatment acceptance in both conditions at 6-month follow-up. Results: Intention to treat analysis, using a repeated measures MANOVA, revealed a multivariate interaction effect between time and condition (p = 0.015) for all primary outcome measures (all ps &lt; 0.001). Only patients of the VRET condition showed a significant reduction in anxiety scores (mean reduction [s.d.]: VAS-A 44.4 [36.1]; MDAS 7.1 [5.4]; DFS 21.2 [13.1]) whereas the patients in the IP group did not (mean reduction [s.d.]: VAS-A −0.33 [7.7]; MDAS −0.33 [1.3]; DFS −1.9 [3.8]), F (15, 14) = 3.3, p = 0.015. Conclusions: VRET was found to be efficacious in the treatment of dental phobia.

We first present background on the health advantages and disadvantages of using a smartphone. Next, we provide caveats in distinguishing healthy smartphone use from unhealthy PSU, and we discuss how PSU is measured. Additionally, we discuss theoretical frameworks explaining how some people develop PSU, including Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Compensatory Internet Use Theory. We present our own theoretical model of how PSU is specifically related to anxiety. We discuss and review mental health constructs associated with PSU severity, based on prior literature. Next, we systematically review the research on PSU severity in relation to anxiety symptoms, given the recent growth of studies on this research question. Finally, we offer implications and recommendations for future research in this area.

47,Deterioration rates in Virtual Reality Therapy: An individual patient data level meta-analysis,"Ample evidence supports the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, currently there is no evidence about moderators or potential negative effects of VR treatment strategies. An Individual Patient Data (IPD) approach was employed with 15 retrieved datasets. The current study sample was composed of 810 patients. Randomized control trials (RCTs) for each primary outcome measure were performed, in addition to moderator analyses of the socio-demographic variables. Deterioration rates were 14 patients (4.0%) in VR, 8 (2.8%) in active control conditions, and 27 (15%) in the WL condition. With regard to receiving treatment, patients in a waiting list control condition had greater odds of deteriorating than in the two active conditions, odds ratios (ORs) 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.05, 0.67]. In the case of the socio-demographic variables, none of them were associated with higher or lower odds of deterioration, with the exception of marital status in the WL condition; married people presented a significantly lower probability of deterioration, OR 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.67]. Finally, when comparing pooled effects of VR versus all control conditions, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI 0.31–1.23) in favor of VR, although this result was not statistically significant. This study provides evidence about the deterioration rates of a therapeutic VR approach, showing that the number of deteriorated patients coincides with other therapeutic approaches, and that deterioration is less likely to occur, compared to patients in WL control groups.

48,Virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety and related disorders: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Trials of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety-related disorders have proliferated in number and diversity since our previous meta-analysis that examined 13 total trials, most of which were for specific phobias (Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008). Since then, new trials have compared VRET to more diverse anxiety and related disorders including social anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia. With the availability of this data, it is imperative to re-examine the efficacy of VRET for anxiety. A literature search for randomized controlled trials of VRET versus control or in vivo exposure yielded 30 studies with 1057 participants. Fourteen studies tested VRET for specific phobias, 8 for SAD or performance anxiety, 5 for PTSD, and 3 for PD. A random effects analysis estimated a large effect size for VRET versus waitlist ( g = 0.90) and a medium to large effect size for VRET versus psychological placebo conditions ( g = 0.78). A comparison of VRET and in vivo conditions did not show significantly different effect sizes ( g = −0.07). These findings were relatively consistent across disorders. A meta-regression analysis revealed that larger sample sizes were associated with lower effect sizes in VRET versus control comparisons (β = −0.007, p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that VRET is an effective and equal medium for exposure therapy.

50,Therapist-led and self-led one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety with consumer hardware and software: A randomized controlled trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 64 of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2019-27063-012). A phrasing error has been discovered in one of the items of the self-report instrument used as a primary outcome measure in the trial. Consequently, the item is perceived as one that should be reverse-coded (the Swedish equivalent of the word “not” was omitted), yet the total scores used for analyses and reported in the publication were not adjusted for this error. The results of reverse-coding the item and calculating new total scores for each individual and time point are discussed in the erratum.] Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common condition which can be treated effectively with exposure therapy. However, inherent difficulties in stimuli presentation and control limits dissemination and the therapeutic potential. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to resolve these issues and provide a scalable platform for self-help interventions. No previous study has examined whether this can be achieved using the first generation of consumer VR hardware and software. In the current trial, n = 25 + 25 participants were randomized to either one-session therapist-led VR exposure therapy for PSA followed by a four-week internet-administered VR to in-vivo transition program, or a waiting-list. Linear mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (within Cohen’s d = 1.67) decreases in self-reported PSA. The waiting-list was then given access to an internet-administered, self-led version of the same VR exposure therapy to be conducted at home, followed by the same transition program. Dual-slope mixed effects modeling revealed significant, large (d = 1.35) decreases in self-reported PSA. Results were maintained or improved at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. We show for the first time that low-cost, off-the-shelf consumer VR hardware and software can be used to conduct exposure therapy for PSA, both in the traditional, previously impractical one-session format, and in a novel self-led, at-home format.

51,A meta-analytic examination of attrition in virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders,"A proposed advantage of virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is that people will be less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely if the treatment involves facing one’s fear in a virtual world rather than the real world, but this has yet to be empirically tested. The present meta-analyses assess the odds of dropout from virtual reality exposure therapy compared to in vivo exposure therapy, estimate the overall rate of dropout from virtual reality exposure treatment, and test potential moderating variables. The odds ratio meta-analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in the likelihood of attrition from virtual reality exposure therapy relative to in vivo exposure therapy. The overall attrition rate for virtual reality exposure therapy across 46 studies with a combined sample size of 1057 participants was 16%. This rate is slightly lower than other estimates of dropout from in vivo therapy and from cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. Incorporation of between-session intervention (i.e., homework) was identified as a moderator; specifically, inclusion of between-session interventions in the treatment was associated with better retention. Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that virtual reality exposure and in vivo exposure therapy show similar rates of attrition.

23,The working alliance in manualized CBT for generalized anxiety disorder: Does it lead to change and does the effect vary depending on manual implementation flexibility?,"Objective: The investigation of session-to-session effects of working alliance on symptoms and coping experiences in patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, investigating these effects dependent on whether therapists are primed to work with patients strength (resource priming) or to adhere to the treatment manual (adherence priming). Method: Data was drawn from a randomized controlled trial in which 57 patients were randomly assigned to either the resource priming condition or the adherence priming condition. Within- and between patient associations were disentangled using dynamic structural equation modeling. Results: The total score of the working alliance, as well as all its overlapping components (i.e., goal agreement, task consensus, bond) showed significant within-patient effects on next session coping experiences. More specifically, better alliance scores in one session were followed by more coping experiences in the subsequent session. With regard to anxiety symptoms, an association was found only with the working alliance total score as well as for the bonds component, but not for the goals and task components of the working alliance. The priming condition (resource priming vs. adherence priming) had no influence on the within-patient alliance–outcome association. Between-patient alliance associations were only present with coping experiences, but not with anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: The findings provide further empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the working alliance may be a robust facilitative factor for change in CBT treatments for generalized anxiety disorder, which evolves irrespective of the strictness with which therapists adhere to the treatment manual.",2309766152.0, Journal Article,2019
24,Integrating addiction medicine into rural primary care: Strategies and initial outcomes,"Objective: This retrospective study describes the role of behavioral health in an addiction medicine program integrated in a primary care clinic, and evaluates retention, substance use, and mental health symptoms for patients in a rural underserved community. Method: Data were abstracted from records of patients referred for buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (N = 101; 45% female, 23% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Mage = 42.5, SD = 12.75). Among patients prescribed buprenorphine (n = 61), most had comorbid substance-related diagnoses (72% with tobacco use, 75% with at least one other substance use disorder) and non-substance-related mental health diagnoses (77%), most commonly depression and anxiety. Integrated sessions with a behavioral health provider and a buprenorphine-waivered prescriber occurred weekly to monthly. Participants completed depression and anxiety questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) and provided urine samples at each visit. Results: Most patients (72%) were retained for at least 3 months, with early dropout associated with higher initial depression and anxiety scores. Inconsistent urine drug tests (i.e., those positive for illicit/nonprescribed substances) were significantly more common at treatment initiation (74%) than during the most recent visit (43%, p &lt; .001), and were associated with baseline substance and other mental health factors, as well as shorter treatment duration. Generalized estimating equations models suggested time-based improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, especially for patients retained for at least 3 months.

25,Opioid use before and after completion of an online pain management program,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a pain management course that has demonstrated efficacy in pain reduction on the use of opioid medication. Method: Self-reported medication use was recorded at baseline assessment for all patients enrolled in a validated pain management program provided free by a university research clinic (N = 471). Participants were randomized either to receive immediate treatment or to be a wait-list control. Opioid use at baseline assessment, with the daily doses converted to morphine equivalents, was compared with the self-reported opioid medication use at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. The relationship between opioid use and measures of psychological symptoms, pain, and disability was examined. Results: At assessment, 85% (n = 399) reported taking some form of pain modifying or psychotropic medication, 43.1% (n = 203) reported regular opioid use and 22.9% (n = 108) reported taking additional as required (pro re nata, or PRN) opioid-containing medication. On completion, there were significant reductions in the number who reported taking regular opioids and a large reduction in the use of PRN opioids and in the reported doses of opioids. Those reductions were more strongly associated with reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression than in measures of disability and pain. Conclusions: The reduction in the self-reported use of regular and PRN opioid pain-relieving medication following completion of an online pain management program with demonstrated efficacy in pain reduction appeared to be related to effective treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression.",2300160431.0, Journal Article,2019
26,Internet-Delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Significant Others of Treatment-Refusing Problem Gamblers: A Randomized Wait-List Controlled Trial,"Objective: Problem gambling can cause severe harm to concerned significant others (CSOs) in the form of, for example, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and mental and physical illness. CSOs are important for their ability to support problem gamblers and motivate them to change. This study investigated the effect of an Internet-based intervention for CSOs of treatment-refusing problem gamblers on (a) gambling-related harm, (b) the gamblers' treatment-seeking rate, and (c) the relationship satisfaction and mental health of the CSOs. Method: A total of 100 CSOs of problem gamblers were randomized into one of two conditions: Internet-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy for CSOs or a wait-list control group. The intervention group was given Internet-based treatment consisting of nine modules with therapist support available via telephone and e-mail. Outcome measures were collected up 12 months posttreatment. Results: The intervention improved the psychological well-being of the CSOs compared to the wait-list group at the posttest (CSO's emotional consequences: d = −0.90, 95% CI [−1.47, −0.33]; relationship satisfaction: d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.05, 0.76]; anxiety: d = −0.45, 95% CI [−0.81, −0.09]; depression: d = −0.49, 95% CI [−0.82, −0.16]). However, the effects on the gambling outcomes were small and inconclusive (gambling losses: multiplicative effect = 0.73, 95% CI [0.29, 1.85]; treatment-seeking: hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI [0.31, 2.38]). Conclusion: The results confirm earlier studies' findings that affecting the gambler via a CSO is challenging, but it is possible to increase the CSO's coping and well-being.

27,GROUPS 4 HEALTH Reduces Loneliness and Social Anxiety in Adults With Psychological Distress: Findings From a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: Loneliness is a key public health issue for which various interventions have been trialed. However, few directly target the core feature of loneliness-lack of belonging. This is the focus of GROUPS 4 HEALTH (G4H), a recently developed intervention that targets the development and maintenance of social group memberships to support health. Method: To investigate the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants (N = 120) assigned to G4H or treatment-as-usual (TAU) by computer software. Assessment of primary (loneliness) and secondary (depression, social anxiety, general practitioner visits, multiple group membership) outcomes was conducted at baseline and 2-month follow-up using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Results: G4H produced a greater reduction in loneliness (d = −1.04) and social anxiety (d = −0.46) than TAU (d = −0.33 and d = 0.03, respectively). G4H was also associated with fewer general practitioner visits at follow-up (d = −0.33) and a stronger sense of belonging to multiple groups (d = 0.52) relative to TAU (d = 0.30 and d = 0.33, respectively). Depression declined significantly in both G4H (d = −0.63) and TAU (d = −0.34), but follow-up analyses showed this was greater in G4H among those not receiving adjunct psychopharmacological treatment and whose symptoms were milder.

This study is the first controlled trial to evaluate an intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) for children with SM. Method: Twenty-nine children with SM (5–9 years; 76% female; 35% ethnic minority) were randomized to immediate SM 5-day IGBT or to a 4-week waitlist with psychoeducational resources (WLP), and were assessed at Week 4 and again 8 weeks into the following school year. Results: IGBT was associated with high satisfaction and low perceived barriers to treatment participation. At Week 4, 50% of the immediate IGBT condition and 0% of the WLP condition were classified as ""clinical responders."" Further, Time × Condition interactions were significant for social anxiety severity, verbal behavior in social situations, and global functioning (but not for SM severity, verbal behavior in home settings, or overall anxiety). School-year follow-up assessments revealed significant improvements across all outcomes. Eight weeks into the following school year, 46% of IGBT-treated children were free of an SM diagnosis. In addition, teachers in the post-IGBT school year rated less school impairment and more classroom verbal behavior relative to teachers in the pre-IGBT school year. Conclusions: Findings provide the first empirical support for the efficacy and acceptability of IGBT for SM. Further study is needed to examine mechanisms of IGBT response, and other effective SM treatment methods, in order to clarify which treatment formats work best for which affected children.",2271769557.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
29,A randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a brief alcohol intervention supplemented with a substance-free activity session or relaxation training,"Objective: Behavioral economic theory suggests that a reduction in alcohol use is most likely when there is an increase in rewarding substance-free activities. Anxiety has also been linked to heavy drinking, and strategies to reduce anxiety may enhance alcohol interventions. The goal of this 2-site randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a brief alcohol intervention that was supplemented with either a behavioral economic substance-free activity session (SFAS) or a relaxation training (Relaxation training [RT]) session. Method: Participants were 393 college students (61% female, mean age = 18.77 years) who reported 2 or more past-month heavy drinking episodes. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) assessment; (b) alcohol brief motivational intervention (BMI) plus SFAS; or (c) BMI plus RT. Both treatment conditions included 2 in-person sessions plus a phone booster session. Outcomes were evaluated 1-, 6-, 12-, and 16-months postintervention. Results: Generalized linear mixed models indicated that the combination of a BMI plus either the SFAS or RT was associated with significant reductions in alcohol use and problems across the 16-month follow-up compared with assessment only. There were no significant differences between the two active treatment conditions. Changes in proportional reinforcement from substance-related activities, and protective behavioral strategies mediated treatment effects. Conclusion: Two-session (plus booster) interventions that combine BMI and either substance-free activity enhancement or RT can result in enduring reductions in alcohol misuse among college drinkers.",2256516678.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
30,Sexual orientation differences in psychological treatment outcomes for depression and anxiety: National cohort study,"Objective: This study investigates whether sexual minority patients have poorer treatment outcomes than heterosexual patients in England's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. These services provide evidence-based psychological interventions for people with depression or anxiety. Method: National routinely collected data were analyzed for a cohort who had attended at least 2 treatment sessions and were discharged between April 2013–March, 2015. Depression, anxiety and functional impairment were compared for 85,831 women (83,482 [97.2%] heterosexual; 1,285 [1.5%] lesbian; 1,064 [1.2%] bisexual) and 47,092 men (44,969 [95.5%] heterosexual; 1,734 [3.7%] gay; 389 [0.8%] bisexual). Linear and logistic models were fitted adjusting for baseline scores, and sociodemographic and treatment characteristics. Results: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women had higher final-session severity for depression, anxiety, and functional impairment and increased risk of not attaining reliable recovery in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.3–1.4) and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.2–1.3). Compared to heterosexual and gay men, bisexual men had higher final-session severity for depression, anxiety, and functioning and increased risk of not attaining reliable recovery for depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.5–1.7) and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.3–1.4). Gay and heterosexual men did not differ on treatment outcomes. Racial minority lesbian/gay or bisexual patients did not have significantly different outcomes to their White lesbian/gay or bisexual counterparts. Conclusions: The reasons for treatment outcome inequities for bisexual patients and lesbian women (e.g., 30–70% increased risk of not recovering) need investigation. Health services should address these inequalities.",2256514809.0, Journal Article,2019
31,Internalizing symptoms and cannabis and alcohol use: Between- and within-person risk pathways with coping motives,"Objective: To test reciprocal associations among internalizing symptoms (depression and social anxiety), using alcohol and cannabis to cope, and use-related problems. Method: The study utilized a community sample (N = 387, 55% female; majority non-Hispanic Caucasian (83.1%) or African American (9.1%) and a longitudinal design that spanned 17 to 20 years of age, and distinguished within- and between-person associations using latent curve models with structured residuals. Results: Reciprocal prospective within-person associations were supported for alcohol, such that elevated depression symptoms were associated with increased alcohol coping motivates 1 year later, which, in turn, was associated with subsequent increased depression symptoms. Bidirectional associations were not supported for social anxiety, although high levels of social anxiety were associated with elevated levels of coping drinking 1 year later. Cannabis coping motives were associated with exacerbation of depression, but not social anxiety symptoms, 1 year later. Between- and within-person contemporaneous associations suggested that depression and social anxiety were more strongly associated with coping than social/enhancement motives, and that coping motives were associated with use-related problems. Conclusion: Findings suggest that alcohol coping motivates exacerbate rather than ameliorate depression symptoms, which, in turn, leads to greater reliance on alcohol to cope. There was more consistent support for associations with substance use-related problems for depression than for social anxiety. Both between- and within-person associations may be useful for identifying targets and timing of coping-oriented interventions.",2256512419.0, Journal Article,2019
32,Positive affect treatment for depression and anxiety: A randomized clinical trial for a core feature of anhedonia,"Objective: Loss of pleasure or interest in activities (i.e., anhedonia) is a risk factor for suicidality, treatment nonresponse, and relapse. Extant treatments that focus on reducing negative affect have limited effects upon positive affect (a core feature of anhedonia). We investigated whether a novel intervention aimed at increasing reward sensitivity was more efficacious for positive affect than a cognitive–behavior treatment aimed at reducing threat sensitivity, in individuals with clinically severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, and functional impairment. Method: The Treatment for Affective Dimensions trial was offered in a 2-site randomized study at outpatient treatment centers in Los Angeles and Dallas. Ninety-six patients were randomized to 15 weekly, individual sessions of Positive Affect Treatment (PAT) or Negative Affect Treatment (NAT). The primary outcome was improvement in positive affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Positive) from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up (6MFU). Secondary outcomes were improvements in negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Negative), suicidal ideation, and symptoms (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales). Results: PAT resulted in greater improvements in positive affect, p = .009, d = .52, and higher positive affect at 6MFU, p = .002, d = .67, than NAT. Participants in PAT also reported lower negative affect, p = .033, d = .52, and lower symptoms of depression, p = .035, d = .34, anxiety, p &lt; .018, d = .30, and stress, p = .006, d = .43 at 6MFU. Finally, probability of suicidal ideation at 6MFU was lower in PAT than NAT (1.7% vs. 12.0%), p &lt; .001. Conclusions: Compared to NAT, PAT demonstrated better outcomes (at 6MFU) on positive affect, depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal ideation, for patients with symptomatic pretreatment levels of these outcomes.",2240141820.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
33,Interpersonal change as a mediator of the within- and between-patient alliance-outcome association in two treatments for generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: Although a better therapeutic alliance associates with treatment outcome, it may do so in different ways. For example, alliance quality may promote improvement as it shifts over time (within-patient changes); alternatively, alliance quality may also, or instead, influence outcome when generally higher or lower for some patients relative to others (between-patient differences). Although both components have been linked to patient improvement, the distinct mechanisms of these associations have been rarely examined. Conceptually, it follows that within-patient alliance fluctuations (representing the changing nature of a current relationship intended to be ameliorative) may facilitate other interpersonal improvements that could, in turn, translate into symptom reduction. This path squares with the corrective relational experience notion. In contrast, whereas as patients’ average alliances across therapy may generally facilitate or hinder improvement, the mechanism may not be other relationship functioning. This squares with the notion that when people generally experience good alliances with their therapist, it may reflect an existing relational ability that catalyzes the effectiveness of other nonrelational therapeutic means. This study tested these distinct hypotheses. Method: Patients (N = 85) with generalized anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive–behavioral therapy, either alone or integrated with motivational interviewing. They rated alliance quality, interpersonal problems, and outcome repeatedly. Results: Using multilevel structural equation modeling, both within- and between-patient alliances related to subsequent worry reduction. As predicted, change in interpersonal problems mediated the association only at the within-patient level. Conclusions: Results contribute to the literature on mechanisms of the within- and between-person alliance-outcome association.",2240141796.0, Journal Article,2019
34,What’s in a name? Branding of online mental health programming for university students,"Objective: University students experience many help-seeking barriers, and thus not all students who could benefit from mental health services enroll in them. This study aimed to examine student enrollment in response to strategic marketing of an online prevention program for anxiety and depression. Method: Data were collected from students at two universities during recruitment phases for the online program. The program was branded as either “The Happiness Challenge” or “ReBoot Camp” through parallel sets of recruitment materials using language intended to address help-seeking barrier concerns (e.g., stigma, inaccessibility). The yielded samples were examined for unaddressed psychological need rates, demographic composition, and differential enrollment by student subgroups into either program brand. Results: Replicated results between Study 1 (n = 651 students; 71.2% undergraduate, 80.3% female, 27.9% White non-Hispanic) and Study 2 (n = 718 students; 60.6% undergraduate, 73.4% female, 53.2% White non-Hispanic) showed that more than a third of students qualified as having “unmet need” for services, enrollment was disproportionately self-identified as female and Asian students, Asian students were less likely to report prior service use and more likely to be categorized as having “unmet need,” and ReBoot Camp was disproportionately selected by male students. Conclusion: Findings suggest that recruitment effectively reached students with unaddressed mental health need, including high enrollment by Asian students, who historically seek services less often. Additionally, important gender differences emerged in preferences for program name. These findings could inform how to market services in university settings to reach more students, including those from underserved subgroups.",2240140771.0, Journal Article,2019
35,Time-varying moderation of treatment outcomes by illness duration and comorbid depression in generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: To extend the sparse literature on moderators, we used time-varying effect modeling (TVEM; Tan, Shiyko, Li, Li, &amp; Dierker, 2012) to examine how depressive symptoms and duration of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) moderated effects of 3 treatments for GAD (applied relaxation [AR], cognitive–behavioral therapy [CBT], and nondirective therapy [ND]) over time using intensive repeated measures. Method: In a secondary analysis of Borkovec and Costello (1993), 66 GAD clients were randomly assigned to AR (n = 23), CBT (n = 23), or ND (n = 20). Clients received 12 therapy sessions over 6 weeks, and after 2 weeks of posttreatment assessment, had 2 additional weekly fading sessions. They completed thrice daily anxiety ratings during this 10-week period. GAD duration (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised) and depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) were assessed at baseline. Results: Longer GAD duration predicted less anxiety reduction in CBT and ND relative to AR. These effects were pronounced in the later phase of treatment, suggesting benefits of focused relaxation practice for clients with longer duration. Higher depression predicted better response to CBT than AR and ND. The moderation effects were also more noticeable in the later phase. In multilevel analyses, a similar moderation pattern held at 1-year follow-up on clinician-rated measures. Conclusion: GAD clients with long-standing symptoms may benefit more from repeatedly practicing fewer skills than learning multiple skills. On the other hand, clients with comorbid depression may respond better to CBT than AR, perhaps because CBT includes cognitive interventions that can generalize to depression.",2240141762.0, Journal Article,2019
36,An Internet-based controlled trial of interpretation bias modification versus progressive muscle relaxation for body dysmorphic disorder,"Objective: The current study extended upon previous research efforts by evaluating the utility and feasibility of an 8-session Internet-based interpretation bias modification (IBM) training protocol targeting evaluation- and appearance-related threat biases characteristic of the disorder compared to a progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) condition for treatment of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Method: Fifty participants with BDD were recruited from across the United States and randomly assigned to eight sessions of either IBM or PMR. Assessments of interpretation bias, BDD symptoms, depression, and anxiety were administered at pretreatment, 1-week posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Compared to the PMR group, individuals in the IBM condition reported less negative/threat interpretation biases and greater positive/benign interpretation biases at posttreatment and follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to BDD symptoms, depression, or anxiety. Clinically significant improvement was common in both conditions (IBM = 64.0%; PMR = 52.0%), though it did not differ between them. Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, IBM did not outperform PMR with regard to BDD symptom reduction, though both treatments yielded significant improvements on symptom outcomes. Findings suggest that IBM and/or PMR may be promising treatment strategies for BDD, perhaps adjunctively. Overall, these findings provide helpful future directions for IBM research and provide an additional lens through which to examine its potential effectiveness for BDD.",2240138873.0, Journal Article,2019
37,Prevention of anxiety and depression in school children: Effectiveness of the transdiagnostic EMOTION program,"Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic program (EMOTION, Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in schoolchildren by comparing the intervention condition (EC) to a control condition (CC). Method: A clustered randomized design was used with schools as the unit of randomization. Children (N = 1686) aged 8–12 years in 36 schools completed screening using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (MASC-Child) and The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire Short version (SMFQ-Child). Scoring 1 SD above a population-based mean on anxiety and/or depression, 873 children were invited to participate. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed, and mixed-effects models were used. Results: Analyses revealed significant reductions of anxious and depressive symptoms as reported by the children, in which children in the intervention condition EC had almost twice the reduction in symptoms compared with the control condition CC. For parent report of the child’s depressive symptoms, there was a significant decrease of symptoms in the intervention condition EC compared with CC. However, parents did not report a significant decrease in anxious symptoms in the intervention condition EC as compared with CC. Conclusion: A transdiagnostic prevention program, provided in schools, was successful in reducing youth-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression and parent-reported depression. The EMOTION program has the potential to reduce the incidence of anxious and depressive disorders in youth.",2183627508.0, Journal Article,2019
38,Strengthening resilience in military officer cadets: A group-randomized controlled trial of coping and emotion regulatory self-reflection training,"Objective: This group-randomized control trial examined the efficacy of guided coping and emotion regulatory self-reflection as a means to strengthen resilience by testing the effects of the training on anxiety and depression symptoms and perceived stressor frequency after an intensive stressor period. Method: The sample was 226 officer cadets training at the Royal Military College, Australia. Cadets were randomized by platoon to the self-reflection (n = 130) or coping skills training (n = 96). Surveys occurred at 3 time points: baseline, immediately following the final reflective session (4-weeks postbaseline), and longer-term follow-up (3-months postinitial follow-up). Results: There were no significant baseline differences in demographic or outcome variables between the intervention groups. On average, cadets commenced the resilience training with mild depression and anxiety symptoms. Analyses were conducted at the individual-level after exploring group-level effects. No between-groups differences were observed at initial follow-up. At longer-term follow-up, improvements in mental health outcomes were observed for the self-reflection group, compared with the coping skills group, on depression (Cohen’s d = 0.55; 95% CI [0.24, 0.86]), anxiety symptoms (Cohen’s d = 0.69; 95% CI [0.37, 1.00]), and perceived stressor frequency (Cohen’s d = 0.46; 95% CI [0.15, 0.77]). Longitudinal models demonstrated a time by condition interaction for depression and anxiety, but there was only an effect of condition for perceived stressor frequency. Mediation analyses supported an indirect effect of the intervention on both anxiety and depression via perceived stressor frequency. Conclusions: Findings provide initial support for the use of guided self-reflection as an alternative to coping skills approaches to resilience training.",2183619042.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
39,Trajectories and predictors of response in youth anxiety CBT: Integrative data analysis,"Objective: Integrative data analysis was used to combine existing data from nine trials of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxious youth (N = 832) and identify trajectories of symptom change and predictors of trajectories. Method: Youth- and parent-reported anxiety symptoms were combined using item-response theory models. Growth mixture modeling assessed for trajectories of treatment response across pre-, mid-, and posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. Pretreatment client demographic and clinical traits and treatment modality (individual- and family-based CBT) were examined as predictors of trajectory classes. Results: Growth mixture modeling supported three trajectory classes based on parent-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, and delayed improvement. A 4-class model was supported for youth-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, delayed improvement, and low-symptom responders. Delayed improvement classes were predicted by higher number of diagnoses (parent and youth report). Receiving family CBT predicted membership in the delayed improvement class compared to all other classes and membership in the steady responder class compared with rapid responders (youth report). Rapid responders were predicted by older age (parent report) and higher number of diagnoses (parent report). Low-symptom responders were more likely to be male (youth report). Conclusions: Integrative data analysis identified distinct patterns of symptom change. Diagnostic complexity, age, gender, and treatment modality differentiated response classes.",2183618852.0, Journal Article,2019
235,Association of thyroid dysfunction with suicide attempts in first-episode and drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder,"Backgrounds: Thyroid dysfunction was reported to be associated with depression; however, its role in suicide risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare thyroid function between suicide attempters and non-suicide attempters in a large sample of first episode drug naïve (FEDN) MDD patients, which received little systemic investigation. Methods: A total of 1718 outpatients with diagnosis of MDD at their first episode were recruited. Their socio-demographic, clinical data and thyroid function parameters were collected. The positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) were measured for psychotic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results: Our results showed that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters had greater scores on HAMD, HAMA and PANSS psychotic symptoms and higher serum levels in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidases antibody (TPOAb) (all p &lt; 0.001). Further logistic regression analysis indicated that suicide attempts were associated with severe anxiety with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.704 and TPOAb with an adjusted OR of 2.188. Limitations: No causal relationship could be drawn due to the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Our results indicate TSH, TgAb and TPOAb may be promising biomarkers of suicide risk in MDD, suggesting the importance of regular assessment of thyroid function parameters for suicide prevention, and possible treatment for impaired thyroid function for intervention of suicide in MDD patients.

236,"Depression, anxiety, and guilt in mothers with burnout of preschool and school-aged children: Insight from a cluster analysis","Introduction: The primary objective of this study is to identify the typology of exhausted mothers based on, depressive, anxiety, and guilt symptoms. And, secondarily, evaluate whether these profiles differ on parental stress, environmental stress, and parental burnout. Methods: Five hundred and fifty French-speaking mothers suffering from exhaustion completed several questionnaires assessing parental stress, general perceived stress, maternal guilt, and depressive and anxious symptomology. Results from two hundred and ten mothers with burnout symptoms were explored (mean age [SD] = 33.69 [5.1] years). In order to identify possible subgroups, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. Results: Three profiles were highlighted from the sample (Wilks’ λ = 0.156, p &lt; .0001): the first was characterized by high feelings of guilt (29.52%; n = 62), the second showed a dominance of anxiety symptoms and high feelings of guilt (36.19%; n = 76), and the fourth presented low levels of depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt (23.3%, n = 49). Discussion: These findings suggest different profiles of burned out mothers that vary according to severity of anxiety, depression, and guilt. That suggests that parental burnout, depression and anxiety are distinct disorders. This study also makes it possible to show the aggravating effect of guilt in the experience of burnout. Additional research is warranted as it is important to more carefully consider possible appropriate intervention strategies given the differing experiences of burned out mothers.

(see record 2019-20567-037). Author conducted a meta-analysis addressing the prevalence of apathy, depression and anxiety symptoms in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients. They found that prevalences of clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy in DM1 are 19, 17 and 55% and also found that psychosocial symptoms like depression, anxiety have serious effect on this patient. In summary, meta-analysis is an important means of evidence-based medicine. The study was a failure if a lax meta-analysis were used to produce a lax result. So it is important to evaluate and explore heterogeneity and publication bias in meta-analysis.

238,Personality traits and the risk of incident (hypo)mania among subjects initially suffering from depressive and anxiety disorders in a 9-year cohort study,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by the alternating occurrence of (hypo)manic and depressive episodes. The aim of the current study was to determine whether personality traits independently predicted the subsequent development of (hypo)manic episodes within a group of patients who were initially diagnosed with depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods: The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety is a cohort study with measurements taken at baseline and at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 9-year follow-up. Development of a (hypo)manic episode during follow-up was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and (hypo)manic symptoms were evaluated with the Mood Disorder Questionnaire. The Big Five personality traits were the independent variables in multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: There were 31 incident cases of (hypo)manic episodes ( n = 1888, mean age 42.5 years, 68.3% women), and 233 incident cases of (hypo)manic symptoms ( n = 1319, mean age 43.1, 71.9% women). In multivariable analyses, low agreeableness was independently associated with an increased risk of developing a (hypo)manic episode, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 ( p = 0.002, 95% CI [0.37, 0.78]). This finding was consistent with the development of (hypo)manic symptoms (HR 0.77, p = 0.001, 95% CI [0.66, 0.89]). Limitations: The 2-year lag-time analysis reduced the number of participants at risk of a (hypo)manic episode. Conclusions: We conclude that low agreeableness is a personality-related risk factor for incident (hypo)mania among subjects initially suffering from depressive and anxiety disorders. Increased attention to personality deviances could help to recognize BD at an early stage.

239,"The impact of maternal major depression, anxiety disorders and their comorbidities on gestational age, birth weight, preterm birth and low birth weight in newborns","Background: The present study compared the impact of maternal major depression, anxiety disorders and their comorbidities on gestational age and birth weight of infants. Methods: A total of 1119 women consisting of 26 women with only major depression, 125 women with only anxiety disorder, 36 women with major depression plus an anxiety disorder and 932 women without any psychiatric disorders were included in the study. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Results: The comorbid group had the highest proportion of newborns with preterm birth and low birth weight. Moreover, these newborns had the lowest birth weight and gestational age. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design. Conclusions: The study results suggest that comorbidity between major depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy may have noteworthy negative effects on birth weight and gestational age.

240,Updated statistic to the gut–brain paper examining the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety score in young adults: A response,"Reply by the N. Tran to the comments made by Panahi et al. (2019) on the author's original paper (see record 2019-35165-035) on the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety. Probiotics appeared to worsen anxiety score (e.g., panic anxiety) while decreased negative affect and possibly also decreased worry in participants. The finding seems to cast doubt on the potential of probiotics for anxiety treatment. However, while the results of the Wilcoxon's analyses pointed to a possible relationship between probiotics and negative affect (probiotics increase negative affect score), and to some extent panic anxiety, it is difficult to assert high confidence over the finding when the comparison between the ranks had a sample size in the single-digit. It is worth noting that while the result of the study is by no means conclusive due to its limitations and weaknesses, it does provide some preliminary insights into the use of probiotics in mental health, and directions for future investigation.

241,Transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized clinical trial,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common condition with current treatments being only moderately effective. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques might provide a novel approach for treating GAD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promising efficacy and tolerability for major depression but has not been investigated for GAD yet. Thus, we investigated the effects of tDCS on patients with GAD. Methods: We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial on 30 GAD patients. Five sessions of tDCS (2 mA, 20 min, anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode over the right supraorbital cortex) were performed. Anxiety was the primary outcome and it was measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Secondary outcomes were accessed by the Lipp Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data were examined at baseline, after the 5th day of intervention, and at 1-week follow-up. Results: Thirty patients finished the study. There were no significant improvements in anxiety, mood symptoms of stress, affectivity or depression. Anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC showed significant improvements in physical symptoms of stress in GAD patients. Limitations: Additional tDCS sessions could have resulted in larger tDCS effects. Conclusion: Five sessions of anodal tDCS over the DLPFC did not improve the main outcomes for GAD patients, although physical symptoms of stress were improved. The role of tDCS in GAD should be explored in larger patient samples using different parameters.

242,"The relationship of recalled adverse parenting styles with maladaptive schemas, trait anger, and symptoms of depression and anxiety","Background: Young's contention that early maladaptive schemas mediate the relationship between adverse parenting and later emotional difficulties has been lrttle tested. Also, most relevant research focuses only on depression, and on maternal parenting. Methods: One hundred and fifty-five non-clinical adults completed the Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) regarding both their mothers and fathers, Young's Schema Questionnaire (YSQ), the State/Trait Anger Scale (STAS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: Young's suggested 17-factor YPI structure was not supported. Rather, participants differentiated between recalled paternal and maternal parenting, with rejecting and controlling components emerging for each parent. There was an indirect effect of rejecting fathering on symptoms of depression, via the social isolation schema, in support of Young's theory. However, despite some significant relationships between parenting and schemas, and schemas and emotions, most effects of parenting on emotions were direct. Rejecting fathering had a direct positive effect on trait anger, and controlling mothering on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Controlling fathering had a negative effect on anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, limited to participants in a single city, and had a preponderance of female respondents. Conclusions: Most effects of adverse parenting seem to be direct rather than operating through schemas. Prevention through early parenting programs, and adult cognitive therapies that draw on a broad range of schemas, seem to be called for.

In the original article, there is a numerical error in Figure 1 (page 58). The “Finally included (HCs: n=36)” in the lower left corner should be corrected to “Finally included (HCs: n=24)”.] Background: Associations between abnormal gut microbiome compositions and anxiety-like behaviors are well established. However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome composition is associated with the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and relief from clinical symptoms in patients. Methods: Stool samples from 36 patients with active GAD (A-GAD group) and 24 matched healthy control subjects (HC group) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and global assessments of functioning were performed at baseline and 1 month after drug treatment. Results: Gut microbiome compositions were altered in A-GAD patients, with fewer operational taxonomic units and lower fecal bacterial α-diversity. Specifically, Firmicutes and Tenericutes abundances were lower in A-GAD patients, and several genera were differentially represented in the A-GAD and HC groups. The abundances of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes _group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated negatively with the anxiety severity and positively with anxiety reduction, whereas the abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella were positively associated with anxiety severity. Sex, smoking, and alcohol intake influenced the gut microbiome composition. Limitations: The sample sizes were small and the stool samples were collected only at baseline; therefore, a causal association between changes in intestinal flora and disease remission was not established. Moreover, the effects of different drugs on gut microbiome composition were not investigated. Conclusions: Altered gut microbiome composition may contribute to GAD pathogenesis and remission.

244,Bipolar depression and suicidal ideation: Moderators and mediators of a complex relationship,"Introduction: Not all patients with bipolar depression have suicidal ideation (SI). This study examines some factors that link bipolar depression to SI. Methods: 482 individuals with bipolar I or II were randomized to either lithium or quetiapine plus adjunctive personalized therapy in a 24 week comparative effectiveness trial. Severity of depression and SI were assessed with the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). We examined potential moderators (age, gender, age of illness onset, bipolar type, comorbid anxiety, substance use, past suicide attempts, childhood abuse and treatment arm) and mediators (severity of anxiety, mania, irritability, impairment in functioning (LIFE-RIFT) and satisfaction and enjoyment of life (Q-LES-Q)) of the effect of depression on SI. Statistical analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations with repeated measures. Results: Bipolar type and past suicide attempts moderated the effect of depression on SI. Life satisfaction mediated the effect of depression and SI. The relationship between anxiety, depression and SI was complex due to the high level of correlation. Treatment with lithium or quetiapine did not moderate the effect of depression on SI. Limitations: Suicide assessment was only done using an item on BISS. Patient population was not specifically chosen for high suicide risk. Discussion: Individuals with Bipolar II experienced more SI with lower levels of depression severity. A history of suicide predisposed patients to higher levels of SI given the same severity of depression. Reduced life satisfaction mediates the effect of depression on SI and may be a target for therapeutic interventions.

245,"Testing the vulnerability and scar model of the relationship between self-concept, social support and anxiety symptoms among children of HIV-infected parents in China: A 3-year longitudinal study","Background: Mental illness is a great concern among children of HIV-infected parents (COHIP), who are at their crucial stage of psychosocial development. It has been shown that self-concept (SC) and social support (SS) are important correlates of anxiety symptoms (AS), however, nature of the causality remained unclear. Methods: A 3-year longitudinal study was conducted in rural Central China, where many people were infected with HIV through unhygienic blood donation. A total of 195 COHIP (mean age: 12.6 years, 49.2% male) completed the baseline assessment and were followed for three years. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling analyses were used to test competing theoretical models: vulnerability model (low SC/SS contributes to AS), scar model (AS erodes SC/SS) and reciprocity model (low SC/SS and AS predict each other). Results: At each wave, 104 (53.3%) and 67 (41.6%) participants presented with anxiety disorders respectively. Nested-model comparison supported the superiority of scar models wherein AS significantly predicted subsequent low SC (β = -0.24, p = 0.013) and SS (β = -0.31, p = 0.033), controlling for synchronous and autoregressive effects of all measures. The most parsimonious multivariate model that included significant relations was finally identified with a good model fit. Limitations: Findings might be subject to reporting bias; and could not inform the temporal relationship between SC and SS. Conclusion: Prevalence of anxiety was high among Chinese COHIP. The present study provides empirical evidence for scarring effects of AS; thus, highlighted the importance of identifying and treating COHIP's anxiety to mitigate long-term negative impacts on their psychosocial development.

246,The paradox of relaxation training: Relaxation induced anxiety and mediation effects of negative contrast sensitivity in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Background: The Contrast Avoidance Model postulates that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) fear a sharp spike in negative emotion, and thus, prefer to worry to maintain their negative affect rather than being in a more euthymic state, such as relaxation. Relaxation induced anxiety (RIA) is a paradoxical phenomenon wherein people experience a spike in their anxiety during relaxation training. Because these phenomena may be related and may also operate among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we attempted to test whether negative contrast sensitivity was a mediator of GAD or MDD in the prediction of RIA. Methods: Individuals with GAD ( n = 32), MDD ( n = 34), and healthy controls ( n = 30) were exposed to a negative emotional contrast by engaging with relaxation practice and then watching a negative emotional video. This was followed by the assessment of their negative contrast sensitivity. After this, participants engaged again with relaxation and RIA was measured. We examined mediation effects of negative contrast on the relationship between diagnostic status and RIA. Results: Negative contrast sensitivity fully mediated GAD and partially mediated MDD in predicting RIA. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypotheses that negative contrast sensitivity is the mediator of both GAD and MDD in predicting RIA. This may have implications for assessment and treatment of GAD and MDD.

247,"The convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21)","Background: Previous validity studies of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were limited by yielding poor factor loading values and eventually skipping the critical process addressing convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity. Without the crucial process, it was risky that past studies insisted DASS-21 be ready for use. Therefore, the current study examined DASS-21 regarding the three kinds of validity to determine if DASS-21 can be further used in the future. Methods: The current study formulated a CFA model (i.e., modified one-factor model) of DASS-21, which yielded factor loading values over β = 0.70 and estimated a latent variable of Psychological Distress by employing indicators of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. The data collection was conducted at two universities in the U.S. and South Korea in November 2016 ( N = 255). The study participants completed an online survey developed with DASS-21. With the collected data, the present study investigated the convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of the modified one-factor model of DASS-21 through CFA. Results: The model fit of the modified one-factor model was complete as saturated. The convergent validity coefficient of Psychological Distress was 0.87, and average variance extracted of the variable was 0.68. The three correlations among the measured variables (i.e., indicators) were 0.50 &lt; r &lt; 0.75. Limitations: Application of the current study's findings to youth or older adults can be limited as the subjects were young adults. Conclusions: The current study made substantial evidence regarding the convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity of DASS-21 through CFA.

248,Trait anger and anger attacks in relation to depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Patients with various psychiatric disorders may suffer from feelings of anger, sometimes leading to maladaptive (e.g., aggressive) behaviors. We examined to what extent depressive and anxiety disorders, relevant clinical correlates, and sociodemographics determined the level of trait anger and the prevalence of recent anger attacks. Methods: In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), the Spielberger Trait Anger Subscale and the Anger Attacks Questionnaire were analyzed in patients with depressive ( n = 204), anxiety ( n = 288), comorbid ( n = 222), and remitted disorders ( n = 1,107), as well as in healthy controls ( n = 470) based on DSM-IV criteria. Results: On average, participants were 46.2 years old ( SD = 13.1) and 66.3% were female. Trait anger and anger attacks were most prevalent in the comorbid group ( M = 18.5, SD = 5.9, and prevalence 22.1%), followed by anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, remitted disorder, and controls ( M = 12.7; SD = 2.9, and prevalence 1.3%). Major depressive disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder were most strongly associated to trait anger and anger attacks. Limitations: Due to a cross-sectional design, it was not possible to provide evidence for temporal or causal relationships between anger and depressive and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Trait anger and anger attacks are linked to depressive and anxiety disorders, although the strength of the relationship differed among both anger constructs.

249,Antidepressant use and its relationship with current symptoms in a population-based sample of older Australians,"Background: Australia has the second highest per capita users of antidepressants globally, and their use is pronounced in older Australians. A better understanding of antidepressant use in older adults is important because the elderly are often prescribed multiple drugs, without review, for long periods. Methods: This study analysed questionnaire data obtained from the Personality and Total Health through life project. Individual respondent data was linked to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) records. Associations between self-reported medicine use and current symptoms with antidepressant dispensing were examined. Results: 1275 participants aged over 65 were included in the final analysis. One hundred and forty-six (11.5%) participants were dispensed an antidepressant within the specified timeframe. Of those, 38.4% self-reported that they use medicine for depression, 12.3% for anxiety, 17.8% for both depression and anxiety, 6.2% for sleep problems and 3.4% for pain. One fifth of those dispensed an antidepressant did not self-report use of the medicine. Being female or reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety or suicidality were significant predictors of being on an antidepressant. Increasing pain severity was also associated with increased likelihood of being on an antidepressant. Limitations: We have presented a cross-sectional analysis, which can only provide associations between current symptoms and medicine use. We have only assessed respondents who received their scripts with PBS concession, which limits generalizability. Conclusion: Our analysis highlights the high use of antidepressants in the elderly for various reasons. Our findings also uncovered a high amount of under-reporting of antidepressant use by respondents.

250,Classical psychedelics for the treatment of depression and anxiety: A systematic review,"Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent psychiatric disorders that carry significant morbidity. Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are used to manage these conditions, but their efficacy is limited. Recent interest into the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy using ayahuasca, psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may be a promising alternative for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments. This review aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of psychedelics in the management of resistant depression. Methods: Clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with depression and/or anxiety were searched via MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO. Efficacy was assessed by measuring symptom improvement from baseline, and tolerability was evaluated by noting the incidence and type of adverse effects reported. Risk of bias was assessed. Results: Seven studies, with 130 patients, were analysed in this review. Three were conducted in patients with depression, two in patients with anxiety and two in patients with both. In a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced immediate and significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects that were endured for several months. Psychedelics were well-tolerated. The most common adverse effects were transient anxiety, short-lived headaches, nausea and mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Limitations: At present, the number of studies on this subject is very limited; and the number of participating patients within these is also limited as the treatment under investigations is a relatively novel concept. Conclusions: Though further evidence is required, psychedelics appear to be effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and are well-tolerated.

251,Parental divorce is associated with an increased risk to develop mental disorders in women,"Background: Parental divorce has been associated with reduced well-being in young adults. It is, however, unclear whether this finding is clinically relevant as studies using structured clinical interviews are missing. This study, therefore, investigated if young adults with divorced parents are at risk to develop mental disorders. Furthermore, differences in parental care, social connectedness, chronic stress and traumatic experiences between children of divorced and non-divorced parents were investigated. Methods: 121 women (mean age: 23 years) were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (i.e., major mental disorders) and II (i.e., personality disorders) Disorders and asked to complete questionnaires assessing parental care, social connectedness (loneliness, attachment anxiety and avoidance), chronic stress, childhood trauma and depression. Results: Young adults of divorced parents had a higher risk for Axis I but not Axis II disorders as compared to young adults of non-divorced parents. Participants from divorced families as compared to non-divorced families reported more depression, loneliness, childhood trauma, attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, chronic stress and less paterntal care. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, conclusions about causality remain speculative. Conclusion: The increased vulnerability of children of divorced parents to develop mental disorders, and to experience more chronic stress, loneliness, attachment avoidance, attachment anxiety, and traumatic experiences during childhood is alarming and highlights the importance of prevention programs and psycho-education during the process of parental divorce. Parental support with regard to adequate caregiving is needed to help parents to better support their children during and after their divorce.

252,When worry may be good for you: Worry severity and limbic-prefrontal functional connectivity in late-life generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Late-life generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older adults. However, its neural markers have received relatively little attention. In this study, we explored the association between worry severity and limbic-prefrontal connectivity during emotional reactivity in late-life GAD. Methods: We recruited 16 anxious (GAD) and 20 non-anxious (HC) older adults to perform the faces/shapes emotional reactivity task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We investigated the functional connectivity of both the amygdala and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis. We tested for (1) group differences in connectivity, (2) association between worry severity and connectivity, and (3) interaction between group and worry severity and its association with connectivity. Results: Amygdala-PFC and BNST-PFC functional connectivity were associated with worry severity in an inverse U-shape, and was independent of depression severity, global anxiety, neuroticism, and general cognitive function. Limitations: Our limitations include slightly skewed PSWQ distributions, lack of non-anxious individuals with high worry, small sample size, and low depression comorbidity in a sample of late-life GAD that may not generalize to GAD in younger populations. Conclusions: This suggests that moderate worry is associated with maximum engagement of the limbic-PFC connectivity, while severe worry is associated with failure of the limbic-PFC emotional regulation circuit. This may explain the aberrant and exaggerated responses to negative stimuli observed in participants with pathological worry.

253,One-year trajectories of mental health and work outcomes post return to work in patients with common mental disorders,"Background: We investigated one-year trajectories of symptom recovery, work functioning and the return to work percentage (RTW%) among patients with common mental disorders (CMDs). Methods: Data were used from a cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating a problem-solving intervention for CMD patients ( N = 158) who had returned to work. Information on anxiety and depressive symptoms, work functioning and RTW% was collected at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Latent class growth analyses were used to identify trajectories for the four outcomes and investigate how these trajectories clustered in higher order latent classes. Additionally, we investigated the relation between patient characteristics and class membership. Results: We identified four trajectories for all four outcomes and derived three higher order latent classes: slow recovery (42% [66/158]) (high anxiety and depressive symptoms, moderate to low work functioning and fast RTW); fast recovery (25% [40/158]) (low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high work functioning and fast RTW); and gradual recovery (33% [52/158] (decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms, increasing or low work functioning and fast RTW). Participants with a higher work engagement and readiness to stay at work were more likely to belong to the fast recovery class. Limitations: Due to the relatively small sample size, some trajectories consisted of few participants. Symptom severity was self-reported. Conclusions: Many CMD patients experience high levels of mental health symptoms and work functioning problems during the year post RTW. Creating realistic recovery expectations (for both patients and their environments) could be important for successful and sustainable recovery and work participation.

254,The effects of alpha asymmetry and high-beta down-training neurofeedback for patients with the major depressive disorder and anxiety symptoms,"Background: Alpha-asymmetry neurofeedback (ALAY) was applied to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the theory of frontal alpha asymmetry. Neurophysiological studies have found a higher high-beta activity of electroencephalography (EEG) at the posterior cortex among patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms. The present study examined the effects of ALAY and high-beta down-training (Beta) neurofeedback in symptoms of depression and anxiety and EEG parameters. Method: Eighty-seven patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms were allocated to the ALAY, Beta, or control groups. Both neurofeedback groups received ten-session neurofeedback. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and five minutes resting EEG recording at pre-test and post-test. EEG raw signals were transformed into an A1 score [log (F4 alpha) - log (F3 alpha)], P3 and P4 high-beta power. Results: BDI-II and BAI scores decreased at post-test in both ALAY and Beta groups, but no significant difference between the two groups. No significant interaction effect in A1 score at pre-test and post-test between the ALAY, Beta, and control groups. The P3 high-beta was significantly decreased in the Beta group, an increase in the control group, and no change in the ALAY group at post-test compared to the pre-test. Conclusions: Both neurofeedback groups decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety. The Beta group was more effective in decreasing high-beta power at the parietal cortex compared to other groups. This non-invasive psychological intervention can be used in the future for patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms.

255,Trajectories of maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms and infant fear: Moderation by infant sex,"Background: Prior work has examined the links between pre- and postnatal maternal distress and infant negative affectivity; however, there is little understanding about how the continuity of infant exposure to pre- and postnatal maternal distress relates to infant development. This study investigated the continuity of maternal pre- and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and their relations with infant fear among 391 mother-infant dyads. An additional aim was to consider infant sex as a moderating factor. Methods: Maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured during gestational weeks 14, 24 and 34 and 3 and 6 months postpartum. Subsequently, infant fear was measured using mother reports (IBQ-R) at 6 months and in a laboratory setting (Lab-TAB Masks episode) at 8 months. Using growth mixture modeling, a three-class model describing the course of maternal symptoms across pregnancy and the early postnatal period was identified, consisting of mothers with “Consistently Low Distress”, “Prenatal-Only Distress”, and “Consistently High Distress”. Results: Infant girls exposed to prenatal-only maternal distress were higher in observed fear than infant boys exposed to prenatal-only distress. Infant girls exposed to consistently high distress also showed lower observed fear than their counterparts exposed to prenatal-only maternal distress. Limitations: The main limitation of the study is the relatively small group size within the Consistently High subgroup. Conclusions: The findings suggest that girls might be particularly sensitive to maternal distress, and that prenatal-only and continuous distress exposure are differentially related to female infant fear.

256,How maternal pre- and postnatal symptoms of depression and anxiety affect early mother-infant interaction?,"Background: Maternal pre- and postnatal psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, may negatively affect mother-infant interaction quality. However, more information is needed on the role of specific types and timings of pre- and postnatal distress symptoms on mother-infant interaction. Research on the role of maternal anxiety is especially scarce. Methods: We examined whether maternal pregnancy- related anxiety (gestational weeks 24 and 34), general anxiety or depressive symptoms (gw 14, 24 and 34 and at the infant age of 3 and 6 months) associate with the quality of mother-infant interaction when the child is eight months old. Maternal symptoms ( N = 190) were measured with EPDS, SCL-90 anxiety subscale and PRAQ-R2. Mother-infant interaction was measured with the Emotional Availability Scales (EAS). Results: After controlling for background factors, general anxiety at the 3rd pregnancy trimester was associated with higher maternal intrusiveness in EAS. Depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum associated with lower maternal structuring behavior and with the child's lower involvement of the mother. Limitations: A very small number of mothers with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Prenatal anxiety and postnatal depressive symptoms may each have unique effects on the different areas of mother-infant interaction, suggesting the need to develop more targeted interventions for mothers with different symptom profiles and timings. Prenatally anxious mothers could potentially benefit from early interventions decreasing stress and anxiety symptoms and specifically promoting their ability to read infant cues appropriately. Infants of postnatally depressed mothers may need interventions where both members of the dyad receive help.

257,Pre- and post-natal maternal anxiety and early childhood weight gain,"Background: While maternal depression has been linked to impaired child growth, the relationship between anxiety and child weight gain is unknown. The study objective was to investigate maternal pre- and post-natal anxiety in relation to child weight gain. Methods: Data included 1168 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child height and weight were measured at the median ages of 25 and 31 months postnatally and used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Maternal anxiety was measured with the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index at 18 and 32 gestational weeks, and two and 21 months postpartum. Mothers scoring in the top 15% at one or more of the four time points were considered to have anxiety. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-7 (EPDS-7) at these same time points. Maternal depression was defined as EPDS-7 scores of &gt; 10. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to assess whether child BMI trajectories varied by the presence of maternal anxiety. Parallel analyses were conducted for maternal depression. Results: Among children of mothers who had anxiety at least at one timepoint, the BMI changes associated with a three-month increase in child age increased by 0.06 (95% CI:0.004-0.12) compared to BMI changes in children of mothers without anxiety. Maternal depressive symptoms were not associated with child BMI trajectories. Limitations: Maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms were based on maternal self-report. Conclusion: Maternal anxiety around childbirth was associated with modest increases in child BMI gain during the child's second year of life (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2019
258,"Differential associations between chronotype, anxiety, and negative affect: A structural equation modeling approach","Background: Increasing evidence implicates circadian rhythms, including chronotype, in anxiety symptoms and disorders. However, it remains unclear whether this relation is accounted for by sleep disturbance. Likewise, given overlap between anxiety and negative affect, a unique link between chronotype and anxiety remains to be established. The present study addressed these questions using a multimethod approach to determine whether there is a unique relation between chronotype and anxiety symptoms, controlling for sleep disturbance. Methods: Indicators of chronotype, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and negative affect were collected in a sample of adults ( N = 151) using a combination of subjective and behavioral measures both within and outside the laboratory over a 9-day period. Structural equation modeling was used to examine associations between latent constructs. Results: Results revealed significant associations between sleep disturbance and both anxiety and negative affect. A significant association was found between chronotype and anxiety, over and above the effect of sleep disturbance. In contrast, the relation between chronotype and negative affect was nonsignificant after controlling for sleep disturbance. Limitations: Unselected sample, lack of experimental manipulation, cross-sectional design. Conclusions: These findings suggest a unique role of chronotype in anxiety and point to circadian disruption as a potential biological mechanism in anxiety-related disorders.

259,"The validity of daily patient-reported anxiety measured using smartphones and the association with stress, quality of life and functioning in patients with bipolar disorder","Background: More than half of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) experience anxiety, which is associated with impaired functioning. In patients with BD, the present study aimed (1) to validate daily patient-reported symptoms of anxiety measured using smartphones against clinically rated symptoms of anxiety, (2) to estimate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, and (3) to investigate the associations between patient-reported anxiety symptoms and stress, quality of life and functioning. Methods: A total of 84 patients with BD evaluated their anxiety symptoms daily for nine months using a smartphone-based system. Data on clinically evaluated symptoms of anxiety and functioning and patient-reported stress and quality of life were collected from each patient at five fixed time points during follow-up. Results: The patients presented mild affective symptoms only. The reporting of anxiety symptoms was evaluated for validity according to clinically evaluated anxiety scores based on the two anxiety sub-items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The patients experienced symptoms of anxiety 19.3% of the time. There were statistically significant associations between anxiety and stress, quality of life and functioning (all p -values &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: In patients with BD in full or partial remission, the self-reporting of anxiety symptoms using smartphones was validated. Anxiety is associated with increased stress, decreased quality of life and functioning even during full or partial remission. Identifying anxiety symptoms thus has clinical impact, which suggests that smartphones may serve as a valid tool.

260,Relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Limited published research has examined the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms in Chinese school adolescents. We aimed to explore the effect of coping styles and sleep quality on anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms. Methods: The survey was conducted in Jiangxi Province, China. The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Chinese Secondary School Students Anxiety Scale were utilized to assess sleep quality, coping styles and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 3081 students participated in this study, 50.8% of whom were boys; the number of participants in grades 1, 2 and 3 were 979, 1085 and 1017, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 27.3%. Individuals with poor sleep quality were 3.558 (95% CI = 2.716–4.660) times as likely to have anxiety symptoms than those with good sleep quality. Higher negative coping style scores increased the prevalence of anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.101, 95% CI = 1.894–2.332), whereas higher positive coping style scores were related to reduced odds of anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.892, 95% CI = 0.800–0.995). Interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms were not found (all p &gt; 0.05). The association between negative coping style and anxiety symptoms was mediated by sleep quality. Limitations: This study was cross-sectional and limited to Ganzhou City. Conclusions: The results of our study showed a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms compared with the result of a previous study in Chinese school adolescents. Negative coping style and poor sleep quality were associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety symptoms, whereas positive coping style was related to a decreased prevalence of anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality was a mediating factor between negative coping style and anxiety symptoms.

261,A population-based examination of suicidality in comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and chronic pain,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and chronic pain conditions commonly co-occur, and are both independently associated with suicidality; however, little is known about the impact of chronic pain on suicidality among individuals with GAD. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions with suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in a population-based sample. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH; N = 25,113). Multiple logistic regressions examined the associations between comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions (i.e., arthritis, migraine, back pain; reference = GAD alone) with suicidality (i.e., ideation, plans, and attempts). Results: After adjusting for sociodemographics, other psychiatric conditions, and other chronic pain conditions, results indicated that compared to GAD alone, comorbid GAD and migraine was associated with increased odds of suicide ideation and plans (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) range: 2.55–3.00) and comorbid GAD and arthritis was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts (AOR = 4.10, 95% CI [1.05–16.01]). Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the survey design does not permit causal assumptions regarding the emergent associations and the self-report assessment of chronic pain conditions may be associated with response biases. Conclusions: Results highlight the burden of chronic pain on suicidality among individuals with GAD. These results emphasize the importance of assessing risk of suicidality among individuals with comorbid GAD and chronic pain conditions, particularly migraine and arthritis.

262,A longitudinal exploration of the impact of social anxiety and individual attachment on depression severity,"Background: Research suggests that insecure attachment and early onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) create vulnerability for future depression. The current study explores the mediating role of social anxiety symptoms in the relationship between attachment and depression at baseline and one year later. The study also looks at the longitudinal impact of changes in attachment and social anxiety, on depression severity. Methods: Participants ( n = 162) completed structured clinical interviews and measures of depression, social anxiety, and adult attachment. A subsample of the participants ( n = 77) returned for a follow-up one year later and repeated the measures. Mediation analysis and multivariate linear regression were performed to examine the relationships between depression, social anxiety, and attachment. Results: Social anxiety was a full mediator of the relationship between attachment avoidance and depression severity at baseline but only a partial mediator at one-year follow-up. Social anxiety was a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and depression severity at both baseline and follow-up. Lower baseline depression levels, improvement in social anxiety and improvement in attachment avoidance over the next year, predicted lower levels of depression at follow-up. Limitations: The study did not gather information regarding the treatments received between baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Social anxiety plays a significant role in mediating the vulnerability towards severe depression in insecurely attached individuals. Treating social anxiety, particularly in individuals with avoidant attachment, might decrease the severity of future depression. In addition, interventions targeting attachment avoidance in youth might aid primary prevention strategies.

263,Prevalence and clinical profiles of comorbid anxiety in first episode and drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Anxiety is a common comorbidity in major depressive disorder (MDD) that has been studied extensively in the past. However, few studies have explored anxiety in drug naïve (FEDN) patients with MDD and those presenting with a first episode. The objective of this current study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD in order to understand the relationship between MDD and anxiety in the acute early phase and provide important implications for therapeutic interventions. Methods: A total of 1718 FEDN patients with MDD were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Their anthropometric and clinical data, including suicide attempt and psychotic symptom, were collected. The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety for all the patients in this study. Results: Overall, we found that the prevalence of anxiety in FEDN MDD patients was 80.3%. Correlation analysis showed that anxiety was associated with suicide attempt and psychotic symptom in FEDN patients with MDD. The rate of suicide attempt and psychosis in above patients with anxiety was 24.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that suicide attempt and psychotic symptom were significant predictors for anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD is very high. We also found that two clinical variables, suicide attempt and psychosis, are risk factors for comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD.

264,Anxiety disorders anticipate the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in comorbid patients: Findings from an Italian tertiary clinic,"Background: Studies indicate bipolar disorder (BD) syndromal symptoms are commonly preceded by sub-syndromal BD symptoms, dysregulated sleep, irritability, and anxiety. We aimed to evaluate prevalence and clinical correlates of anxiety disorders (ADs) at BD onset in outpatients with versus without at least one AD at BD onset. Methods: 246 bipolar spectrum outpatients, according to the text revision of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- IV-TR), attending Sacco University Hospital in Milan, were recruited and their onset and clinical features assessed retrospectively. Patients were stratified into those with versus without an AD at BD onset (w/A and wo/A), according to a semi-structured clinical interview to provide diagnoses according to (DSM- IV-TR). Results: 29% of patients reported being w/A, among whom Panic Disorder (PD, in 55.6%) was the most frequent AD, and first AD occurred approximately 4 years before BD diagnosis. Patients w/A versus wo/A had higher ( p &lt; 0.05) rates of BDII and first mood episode being depression versus elevation (mania/hypomania), and lifetime rates of separation anxiety disorder, substance poly-abuse and benzodiazepine abuse. In contrast, patients wo/A had higher lifetime rates of alcohol and illicit drug use. Conclusion: In this naturalistic sample, ADs, in particular PD, preceded BD in almost 1/3 of BD outpatients, and had distinctive clinical correlates. Further investigation into relationships between BD and AD at onset may enhance early BD diagnosis and treatment.

265,State anxiety in pregnancies affected by obstetric complications: A systematic review,"Background: Maternal mental health status remains an important area of study due to its influence on maternal health outcomes. Past reviews on anxiety in pregnancy have included multiple mental health diagnoses and pre-existing conditions. A systematic review was performed to understand maternal state anxiety during pregnancies affected by obstetrical complications. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed including quantitative, primary studies in the English language. The population of interest was women whose pregnancies were affected by maternal and/or fetal obstetric (not pre-existing) complications with state anxiety as the outcome. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion and methodological criteria and were included in the review. Results: The review revealed that 20% to 100% of women experiencing pregnancies affected by obstetric complications had high levels of state anxiety, and these rates are negatively influenced by complication type and severity, demographic characteristics, and maternal perceptions and expectations. Overall, antenatal state anxiety was shown to improve over the course of the pregnancy, though levels remained above clinical thresholds. Limitations: This review was based only on English peer-reviewed articles, many of which used convenience sampling with homogenous samples, limiting generalizability. Additional limitations include how anxiety prevalence was aggregated due to differences in measurement across studies. Conclusions: Anxiety is prevalent among women experiencing pregnancies affected by obstetric complications. Based on this review, we recommend that all women treated for obstetric complications are screened for anxiety; facilitating detection, referral, and treatment, ultimately contributing to optimal maternal outcomes.

266,"A systematic review of prevention programs targeting depression, anxiety, and stress in university students","Background: Given the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among university students, it is important to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs for these problems. Beyond examining effect sizes, applying a common elements approach can enhance our understanding of which practice elements are most frequently included in symptom-reducing programs. Method: This review examined effective (i.e., outcome-producing) prevention programs targeting depression, anxiety, and/or stress in university students. Programs could be delivered in a group-based, online/computer-delivered, or self-administered format and at the universal, selective, or indicated prevention level. Results: The resulting sample of 62 articles covered 68 prevention programs for college, graduate, or professional students across 15 countries. Average effect sizes for programs were moderate (overall g = 0.65), regardless of delivery format or prevention level. The most common practice elements (overall and for programs producing large effects) were: psychoeducation (72%), relaxation (69%), and cognitive monitoring/restructuring (47%). Many programs were limited by: (a) symptom target-outcome mismatches, (b) disproportionately female samples, and (c) inconsistently reported adherence data. Limitations: Commonness of practice elements across outcome-producing interventions does not imply their extensiveness nor unique contribution to effectiveness. Coding was based on information in articles rather than manuals, and inter-rater reliability was moderate for some practice elements. Conclusion: The outcome-producing prevention programs in our sample had common practice elements and produced moderate reduction in symptoms overall. Future research of depression, anxiety, and stress prevention programs for university students can investigate practice elements’ unique and combined impact on outcomes, further explore under-tested practice elements, and use findings to inform intervention design.

267,Utility of the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research in assessing psychological disorders in fibromyalgia patients,"Presents a study which aims to investigate the prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in fibromyalgia (FM) patients by comparing them with a group of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, a “non functional” medical condition also characterized by pain and the impact of the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) syndromes on the psychosocial functioning in FM patients. Ninety-eight women with FM and 98 women with RA, balanced for age and years of education were assessed with the DCPR, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for depression (HADSD) and anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) that evaluates both the physical and the mental components of health. All the patients were recruited at the University Hospital of Turin. The results indicated a statistically significantly higher prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in FM patients compared to RA patients; in particular, regarding the somatization, functional somatic symptoms, conversion symptoms, anniversary reaction, the irritability, and the demoralization. Considered together, the data confirmed the clinical utility of the DCPR in detecting psychological disorders in FM patients. The results highlighted a very high prevalence of psychosomatic syndromes in FM patients, who displayed an average of more than 4 psychosomatic syndromes each, with every patient displaying at least one.

268,Adherence to the MIND diet and prevalence of psychological disorders in adults,"Background: There is no study that examined the association of the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders. We investigated the association between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders. Methods: A total of 3176 adults were included in this cross-sectional study. Dietary intakes of study participants were collected using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (DS-FFQ). The MIND diet score was calculated based on participants’ dietary intakes obtained from DS-FFQ. To assess depression and anxiety, the Iranian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used. Psychological distress was examined using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results: After taking potential confounders into account, participants in the highest quartile of the MIND diet score had a lower odds of depression (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53–0.89) and psychological distress (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.89) than those in the lowest quartile. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.51–1.03). When we did gender-stratified analyses, no significant association was seen between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders in men; however, women in the top quartile of the MIND diet score had lower odds of depression (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45–0.81) and psychological distress (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48–0.90) than those in the bottom quartile. Conclusion: We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet was inversely associated with odds of depression and psychological distress. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety.

269,The validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale-5 in home-dwelling old adults in Norway,"Background: Little is known about the validity of the Norwegian versions of the Geriatric Depression Scale-5 (GDS-5) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-D (HADS-D). The aim of this study was therefore to validate the two assessment tools in a population of home-dwelling persons of 60 years of age and above. Methods: A sample of 194 home-dwelling old adults with and without depressive symptoms were recruited. The participants were examined for depressive symptoms (GDS-5, HADS-D) and cognitive impairment. Sociodemographic information was collected. The participants underwent a blinded diagnostic evaluation for a depressive episode according to the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10. Results: In all, 56 (28.9%) participants fulfilled criteria for a depressive episode according to ICD-10. The Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses of HAD-D and GDS-5 using the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 for depression as gold standard was performed. For GDS-5 the Area under the Curve was 0.81 and for HAD-D 0.75. The cut-off points of the measures that produced the highest accuracies were ≥ 2 for GDS-5 with a sensitivity of 73.2% and a specificity of 73.2% and ≥ 4 for HADS-D with a sensitivity of 70.3% and a specificity of 69.6%. Limitations: A larger sample would have given the opportunity for analyzing home dwelling old adults with and without home health care separately. The participants were talked through the self-filling questionnaires. The procedure could have influenced the participants’ answers. Conclusion: GDS-5 and HADS-D are useful screening tools for old adults, but only fairly good to identify depression according to criteria of ICD-10.

270,Internet-delivered treatment for young adults with anxiety and depression: Evaluation in routine clinical care and comparison with research trial outcomes,"Introduction: Mood and anxiety disorders typically emerge in adolescence and early adult life, but young adults are often reluctant to seek treatment. The Mood Mechanic course is a transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety, targeted at people aged 18–24 years. The current study compared the efficacy of the course when delivered under strict research trial conditions (research trial; n = 192) with its effectiveness in a routine health-care setting (routine care; n = 222). Methods: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and general distress at baseline, during, and after treatment were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Kessler 10-Item Scale (K-10), respectively. Results: Both groups showed significant symptom reductions on all measures at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Deterioration rates were low, within-group effect sizes were large (&gt; 1.0) and both groups reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. Patients in routine care were less likely to complete post-treatment or follow-up symptom questionnaires. Limitations: The study is based on self-reported data from treatment-seeking individuals that were motivated enough to start the course, and the absence of a control group and a formal diagnosis in the routine care sample means that some caution is needed in generalising the results. Conclusion: The results show that the Mood Mechanic course is effective and acceptable in routine clinical care, and that online psychological interventions designed for young adults are an effective treatment option for this hard-to-reach group.

271,Psychological distress among the unemployed: Do core self-evaluations and emotional intelligence help to minimize the psychological costs of unemployment?,"Background: Past research has shown that emotional intelligence (EI) and core self-evaluations (CSE) have a unique and independent role in the prediction of psychological maladjustment in the unemployed population. However, no one to date has examined the joint contribution of EI and CSE in predicting well-being and psychological distress among the unemployed. Our objective was to examine the main and interactive role of EI and CSE in the prediction of indicators for happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety beyond socio-demographics variables. Methods: A sample of 1796 unemployed participants completed a battery that included socio-demographic data and questionnaires of EI, CSE, happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety. We processed the data with SPSS and Hayes PROCESS macro. Results: Pearson correlation analyses showed significant associations between EI and CSE with different mental health outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed that, beyond the main effects, the interactive term EI × CSE increased the explained variance of the prediction of happiness, but not of depression, anxiety, or stress. Limitations: The study comprised an incidental non-clinical sample of unemployed adults, so the results might not generalize to a clinical population. Also, the study was cross-sectional, and we relied only on self-report measures, which do not allow for establishing causal links and might include biases, such as social desirability and common method variance. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for developing more comprehensive models including the interaction of EI and dispositional traits as contributing factors in the prediction of positive outcomes among the unemployed. Also, future promotion programs should include dimensions related to EI and CSE for increasing well-being during unemployment.

272,The mediating roles of caregiver social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Most studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have focused on the direct effects of social support and self-efficacy on caregiver burden. This study aimed to test our prediction that caregiver self-efficacy and social support were two chaining mediator variables on the paths for patient factors affecting caregiver burden, caregiver anxiety, and depression. Method: We enrolled patients with PD and their caregivers from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University in China between July and December 2017. Patients completed scales evaluating their cognition, motor function, and depression. Caregivers completed scales evaluating social support, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and caregiver burden. We applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the mediating effects. Results: Caregiver self-efficacy was a partial mediator on the path of patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (Variance Accounted For, VAF = 0.741), caregiver anxiety (VAF = 0.498) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.471). Social support for caregivers was a partial mediator on the path for patient motor function effects on caregiver self-efficacy (VAF = 0.247). Caregiver social support and self-efficacy were two chaining mediator variables on the pathway for patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (VAF = 0.768) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.510). Limitations: Our sample only met the minimum sample size requirement for the PLS-SEM and we only focused on a part of variables we collected. Conclusions: Our prediction has been validated in this study. And this work supports the decision-making of health authorities and policymakers in managing caregiver social support and caregiver self-efficacy with the aim of reducing caregiver burden in PD.

273,Impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Bangladesh: A longitudinal study,"Background: The psychological health of university students is an issue of utmost concern worldwide. Its consequences include multifaceted outcomes from complex interactions of sociocultural, environmental, and individual lifestyle factors. This research explores the impacts of socio-cultural environment and lifestyle factors on the psychological health of university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A 15-month follow-up was carried out among 1140 university students from April 2016 to November 2017. Data were collected by using a pre-developed questionnaire, consisting of socio-demographic information, comprehensive lifestyle information, and psychological health information including a nine-item scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for assessing the level of depression, and a 7-item scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for assessing the level of anxiety. The collected data were analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22. Results: With time, there was a 22.5% increase in the prevalence of provisional depression and a 27.1% increase in the prevalence of anxiety. In terms of demographic factors, findings revealed that students dissatisfied with university culture were significantly more likely to experience depression ( B = 5.13, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.33) and anxiety ( B = 4.69, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.34). ‘Being female’, ‘being students of social sciences faculty’, ‘dissatisfaction with current education, financial condition and future career’ were found to be significant predictors of students’ psychological disorders. In terms of lifestyle factors, participants with high and excessive recreational screen time were significantly more vulnerable to depression ( B = 1.25, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.097 and B = 1.75, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.12) and anxiety ( B = 0.86, p = 0.02, β = 0.08 and B = 1.22, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.096). Additionally, ‘weekly physical inactivity’, ‘dissatisfaction with daily sleep’, ‘short and long sleep duration’, ‘low and high daily meal intake frequency’ and ‘alcohol consumption’ were inextricably linked with students’ depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The prevalence of provisional as well as major depressive and anxiety disorders among university students in Bangladesh is significantly high and augmented in nature. This study provides significant information about the adverse impacts of university socio-cultural environment and students’ lifestyle factors on their psychological health conditions.

274,Relationship between trait neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women in China: Testing a mediation model,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon among postpartum women around the world. However, evidence of the relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation among postpartum women is still lacking. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, a total of 1027 postpartum women (assessed no later than one month post-birth) were recruited to complete questionnaires assessing neuroticism, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Results: Anxiety and depression fully mediated the association between neuroticism and suicidal ideation (Total indirect effects = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.15). The indirect effect of the pathway of EPQ (Neuroticism)-Anxiety-Suicidal ideation was more significant than other pathways (Indirect effects = 0.04, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.07). Conclusion: Interventions for suicidal ideation in postpartum women need to target neuroticism and further research is necessary understand the mechanisms by which neuroticism affects suicidal ideation.

275,Motivational interviewing prior to cognitive behavioural treatment for social anxiety disorder: A randomised controlled trial,"Background: We examined whether providing three sessions of treatment based on motivational interviewing (MI) prior to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) improved outcomes. Methods: Participants diagnosed with SAD ( N = 186) were randomly allocated to receive three sessions of MI (MI + CBT; n = 85) or supportive counselling (SC + CBT; n = 101) prior to a 12-week group CBT program. Assessments occurred at baseline, after preparatory treatment, after CBT, and at 6-months follow-up. Outcomes were expectations for change, number of CBT sessions attended, self- and clinician-rated CBT homework completion, and self- and clinician-rated social anxiety severity. Results: Conditions did not differ significantly on expectations for change, number of CBT sessions attended, or clinician-rated homework completion. Self-rated homework completion was greater in MI + CBT than in SC + CBT. Change over time in social anxiety severity did not differ between conditions overall, however, this outcome was significantly moderated by two variables; those in MI + CBT, as compared to SC + CBT, showed significantly poorer outcomes on self-reported social anxiety severity if they were higher in change readiness and significantly better outcomes on clinician-rated social anxiety severity if they were higher in functional impairment. Limitations: Although therapists in MI sessions were rated as behaving more consistently with MI than therapists in SC sessions, some MI consistent behaviors occurred in the SC sessions. Conclusions: Addition of a MI-based discussion prior to evidence-based CBT appears to benefit people with SAD who have high functional impairment but may interfere with outcomes for those higher in readiness for change.

276,Anxiety symptoms are associated with smaller insular and orbitofrontal cortex volumes in late-life depression,"Background: Increasing understanding of the neural correlates of anxiety symptoms in late-life depression (LLD) could inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments. Methods: Grey matter volume (GMV) was assessed with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 113 adults ≥ 60 years with MDD using the following regions of interest: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and temporal cortex. Results: After controlling for demographic (age, sex, education) and clinical variables (antidepressant use, anxiolytic use, duration of illness, medical comorbidity, cognitive functioning), greater severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with lower GMV bilaterally in the insula, F (1,102) = 6.63, p = 0.01, and OFC, F (1,102) = 8.35, p = 0.005. By contrast, depressive symptom severity was significantly associated with lower bilateral insula volumes, F (1,102) = 6.43, p = 0.01, but not OFC volumes, F (1,102) = 5.37, p = 0.02. Limitations: Limitations include (1) the relatively mild nature of anxiety symptoms in our sample; (2) the cross-sectional research design, which prohibits inferences of directionality; (3) the relatively homogenous demographic of the sample, and (4) the exclusion of participants with significant psychiatric comorbidity, suicidality, or cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Decreased OFC volumes may serve as a unique biomarker of anxiety symptoms in LLD. Future longitudinal and clinical studies with long-term follow up and more diverse samples will help further elucidate the biological, psychological, and social factors affecting associations between anxiety and brain morphology in LLD.

277,Cyberbullying and depression among Chinese college students: A moderated mediation model of social anxiety and neuroticism,"Background: Cyberbullying is a serious social issue that can cause a number of psychological and behavioral problems for perpetrators and victims. Previous studies have shown that adolescent victims of cyberbullying are more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the perpetration of cyberbullying and depression, or the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relationship. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 476 college students to investigate the relationships between cyberbullying perpetration and depression, the mediating role of social anxiety, and the moderating role of neuroticism. Results: The results showed that cyberbullying perpetration had a significant and positive predictive effect on depression. Social anxiety partially mediated this relationship. The direct predictive effect of cyberbullying perpetration on depression, and the relation between social anxiety and depression, were both moderated by neuroticism. Cyberbullying perpetration had a greater impact on depression for college students with lower levels of neuroticism and the predictive function of social anxiety on depression was stronger for individuals with low levels of neuroticism too. But neuroticism did not moderate the association between cyberbullying perpetration and social anxiety. Limitations: This study focused only on the individual variables influencing the relationship between cyberbullying perpetration and depression, and did not examine interpersonal or environmental variables. Also, the cross-sectional research design means that causality cannot be deduced from the results. Conclusions: Cyberbullying perpetration can predict depression directly, and also indirectly via the mediating role of social anxiety. Neuroticism moderates the relation both between cyberbullying and depression, and between social anxiety and depression. These findings provide new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of depression among college students.

278,The effect of short-term use of benzodiazepines on cognitive function of major depressive disorder patients being treated with antidepressants,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) on cognitive function of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients being treated with antidepressants (ADs). Methods: This was a part of a multi-center, multi-stage and prospective study of “Objective Diagnostic Indicators and Individualized Drug Intervention of Major Depressive Disorder (OIMDD)”. Three hundred and fifty-three patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) alone (Group 1) and 49 patients treated with SSRIs combined with short-term use of BZDs (Group 2) during the acute treatment period were included in the analysis. Cognitive function and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, weekend 8 and 48. A cognitive test battery included 5 domains: information processing speed assessed by the Animal Verbal Fluency Scale (AVFS), Digit Symbol Coding Test (DSCT) and Color Trial Test (CTT), verbal learning assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), visual learning assessed by the Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), executive function assessed by the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and attention or vigilance assessed by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Results: Significant differences were found in education level ( χ ² = 5.442, p = 0.020), the severity of depressive ( t = −1.982, p = 0.048) and anxiety symptoms ( t = −2.629, p = 0.009) between Group 1 and 2 at baseline. There were no significant differences between G1 and G2 in cognitive functions at baseline. After Multiple correction, DSCT was better in patients treated with BZDs combined with ADs than in patients with ADs alone at weekend 8 without controlling education level, depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline ( F = −2.747, p = 0.042). After controlling these factors at baseline, the DSCT was still slightly high in patients treated with ADs combined with BZDs than in patients with ADs alone at weekend 8 (OR = 1.052, 95%CI:1.000–1.105). The repeated measurement analysis of variance showed that the DSCT could be improved by the treatment of BZDs combined with ADs at 1-year follow-up compared to baseline ( F = 7.569, p = 0.006). Conclusions: The findings suggest that short-term use of BZDs does not impair cognitive function of MDD patients; conversely, it could improve the information processing speed after acute treatment and at 1 year follow up.

279,Examining an internet-delivered intervention for anxiety and depression when delivered as a part of routine care for university students: A phase IV trial,"Background: There has been growing interest in the potential of emerging internet-delivered psychological treatments for supporting the mental health needs of university students. However, no large-scale prospective effectiveness trials examining their real-world potential have been reported. Objective: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief, 5-week, internet-delivered and therapist-guided intervention for anxiety and depression, when delivered as part of routine care by a university counselling service. Design: A large, prospective, single-group Phase-IV clinical trial. Students ( n = 1326) engaging with the university counselling service were provided the opportunity to receive the intervention based on their preferences and identified needs. Students completed standardised measures of anxiety and depression at pre-treatment, each week of the intervention, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results: Over a 4 year period, 1081 students (10% of those presenting to the counselling service) participated in the intervention. Large clinical reductions in symptoms of both anxiety (% reduction = 41%; Cohen's d = 0.94) and depression (% reduction = 36%; Cohen's d = 0.81) were observed alongside high levels of acceptability. The intervention required relatively little counsellor time ( M = 36.28 mins; SD = 20.56) per student, and symptom deterioration was observed in less than 5% of students. Conclusion: The findings of the current study are supportive of internet-delivered interventions provided as routine care to university students. Further research is needed to carefully explore whether these interventions could be used with a larger proportion of students presenting to counselling services, paying close attention to acceptability, engagement and clinical outcomes.

280,"The role of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and school functioning in the association between peer victimization and internet addiction: A moderated mediation model","Background: Both peer victimization and internet addiction are common public health problems for children and adolescents. Several studies found an association between peer victimization and internet addiction, but the mechanism underlying this association remained unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying this association. Methods: Data was extracted from an epidemiologic study involving middle and high school adolescents, in which 15,415 individuals (14.6 ± 1.7 years) were recruited. The moderated mediation models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro 2.16 software, in which the mediation variables were depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and the moderation variable was school functioning. Results: The total indirect effect of verbal victimization on internet addiction through depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms was found to be 0.4531, which accounted for 63.7% of the total effect of verbal victimization on internet addiction. Depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms totally mediated the association between relational victimization and internet addiction and the association between the physical victimization and internet addiction. There were gender differences in the mediating effects of depressive and anxiety symptoms on the association between peer victimization and internet addiction. The indirect effect of the three different types of peer victimization (physical, verbal, relational) on internet addiction became stronger as school functioning increased. Limitations: We included two mediators in one model, and the data used in this study was self-reported and cross-sectional. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms mediate the association between peer victimization and internet addiction. Students who score higher in school functioning were more likely to develop internet addiction when they encounter peer victimization.

281,"Social anxiety, posterior insula activation, and autonomic response during self-initiated action in a Cyberball game","Background: An earlier study characterized the neural correlates of self-initiated actions in a Cyberball game in healthy individuals. It remains unclear how social anxiety may influence these neural processes. Methods: We examined regional activations to self-initiated actions in 25 adults with low and 25 with high social anxiety (LA and HA, respectively). Skin conductance was recorded concurrently with fMRI. We followed published routines in the analyses of imaging and skin conductance data. Results: We hypothesized that HA as compared to LA individuals would demonstrate increased cortical limbic activations during self-initiated actions (tossing or T &gt; receiving or R trials, to control for motor activities) in social exclusion (EX) vs. fair game (FG) scenario. At a corrected threshold, HA as compared with LA group showed increases in bilateral posterior insula activation during T vs. R trials in EX as compared to FG. Further, HA as compared to LA showed higher skin conductance response to tossing trials during EX as compared to FG. Limitations: With a limited sample size, we did not examine potential sex effects. Further, we cannot rule out the effects of depression on the findings. Conclusions: Together, the results suggest that individuals with more severe social anxiety engaged the somatosensory insula to a greater extent and exhibited higher physiological arousal when initiating ball toss during social exclusion in the Cyberball game. Posterior insula response to self-initiated action may represent a biomarker of social anxiety. It remains to be investigated whether interventions to decrease physiological arousal may alleviate social anxiety.

282,"Prevalence, onset and course of anxiety disorders during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta analysis","Background: Anxiety disorders during pregnancy are associated with various adverse outcomes. Previous reviews of anxiety disorders during pregnancy have methodological limitations and were conducted without a meta-analysis. The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research on the prevalence, onset and course of all anxiety disorders during pregnancy plus obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on a wide range of databases. A random effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-six studies were included. Prevalence rates of anxiety disorders during pregnancy varied considerably. The pooled prevalence rate of each disorder during pregnancy was 3%, except for specific phobia, where it was 6%. Between 13% and 39% of pregnant OCD women had the onset of OCD during pregnancy, and this occurred mainly in the 2nd trimester. The onset of panic disorder (PD) was more common in the 1st and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy. Limitations: Different designs of the included studies, as well as different assessment tools and assessment times during pregnancy and the paucity of studies of the onset and course, preclude definitive conclusions. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy. Unlike prevalence rates of other anxiety disorders during pregnancy, prevalence rates of PD and OCD during pregnancy were higher than their lifetime prevalence rates in women in the general population. The onset of OCD during pregnancy is not rare and the course of PD and OCD during pregnancy is highly variable. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be a specific risk factor for the occurrence and/or exacerbation of PD and OCD and underscore the importance of their early diagnosis and management.

283,"Excessive daytime sleepiness in medical students of Hunan province: Prevalence, correlates, and its relationship with suicidal behaviors","Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common among medical students, but may have some serious consequences. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of EDS among the medical students of Hunan Province, China. The correlation between EDS and suicidal ideation in our participants was also explored. Methods: A cross-sectional study was employed among 4882 students from three medical schools in Hunan Province. Each student completed a survey on demographic variables, daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), and suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risk factors for EDS among all participants and suicidal behaviors among those with EDS. Results: Overall, the prevalence of EDS in this population was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that being female, alcohol consumption, a history of physical disorder, body mass index, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were independent correlates for EDS. Moreover, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among EDS participants was 38.6%, variables such as physical disorder history, age, anxiety, or depression were independently associated with suicidal ideation. Limitations: No causal relationships could be established as this was a cross-sectional study. Recall biases might exist due to the utilization of self-reported measurements. Moreover, participants were primarily female medical students (89%,4345/4882). Conclusion: EDS is very common among medical students. Special attention should be paid to students with EDS, especially when risks for suicidal ideation are particularly high among this population. These data are valuable for healthcare professionals in assessing the risks of suicide among participants with EDS.

284,Associations between grip strength and generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing,"Background: Associations between grip strength and mental health disorders have been established; however, associations between grip strength and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) remain unstudied. Therefore, this study investigates associations between grip strength and prevalent and incident GAD. Methods: A prospective cohort design was utilized. At baseline, participants aged ≥ 50 years ( N = 3,952) completed a hand grip strength assessment and abbreviated Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and were divided into sex-specific tertiles based on strength. A score of ≥ 23 on the PSWQ defined caseness of GAD. At two-year follow-up, GAD was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview—Short Form. Results: Prevalence and incidence of GAD were 18.2% ( N = 718) and 0.9% ( N = 29), respectively. Adjusting for age, sex, waist circumference, social class, smoking status, and physical activity, a one-standard-deviation (1-SD) increase in strength was associated (OR, 95%CI) with 12.1% (OR = 0.88, 0.80–0.96; p &lt; 0.01) lower odds of prevalent GAD, and middle and high strength tertiles were associated with 27.3% (OR = 0.73, 0.59–0.89; p &lt; 0.01) and 23.1% (OR = 0.77, 0.62–0.95; p &lt; 0.05) lower odds, respectively. A 1-SD increase in strength was non-significantly associated with 24.2% (OR = 0.76, 0.50–1.14) lower odds of incident GAD, and middle and high strength tertiles were non-significantly associated with 31.4% (OR = 0.69, 0.30–1.58) and 66.5% (OR = 0.34, 0.11–1.00) lower odds, respectively (all p &gt; 0.05). There was no significant interaction between strength tertiles and sex. Limitations: The observational nature of the study limits inferring causality. Conclusions: Increased hand grip strength may be associated with lower odds of developing GAD in older adults. Larger investigations of prospective associations are needed.

285,Feeling better at work! Mental health self-management strategies for workers with depressive and anxiety symptoms,"Background: The aim of this study was to identify self-management strategies that can be used in a workplace setting by workers living with depression and anxiety. Methods: A two-round Delphi study was conducted among three panels of experts: (1) employees living with anxiety or depression ( n = 31); (2) managers of employees living with anxiety or depression ( n = 12); and (3) researchers with expertise in workplace mental health ( n = 15). Participants had to indicate whether each of 60 self-management strategies was applicable at work, and how useful each was for managing their symptoms while working. They could also reformulate or add strategies that were then evaluated in the second round. Results: A total of 60 existing and new self-management strategies were retained following the two rounds. Most useful strategies refer to the ability to set boundaries, maintain work-life balance, identify sources of stress and create positive relationships with supervisor and colleagues. Panels differed in their assessment of the usefulness of strategies focusing on employees’ empowerment. Limitations: Most participants were from Canada, limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusion: The self-management strategies identified in this study should be included in programs focusing on mental health at work and disseminated to employees living with depression and anxiety. Managers should take employee's perspective into account when searching for solutions to help them. Future research should use an inductive approach to identify strategies that are specifically related to the workplace setting. Quantitative studies are also needed to evaluate the effect of such strategies on work functioning.

286,Effects of statins on anxiety and depression in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome,"Background: The effects of statins on anxiety and depression in patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) have not been reported. This population-based study investigated these effects. Methods: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2010. We enrolled two ACOS cohorts, one of statin users ( n = 1252) and one of nonstatin users matched by age, sex, and index date ( n = 7887). The cumulative incidence of anxiety and depression was analyzed using time-dependent Cox proportional regression analysis. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and medications—statins, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and oral steroids (OSs)—the ACOS cohort with statin use had significantly lower risks of anxiety and depression (anxiety: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.28–0.42; depression: aHR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.25–0.53). The aHRs (95% CIs) for statin use with ICSs or OSs were 0.32 (0.13–0.78) and 0.37 (0.24–0.57), respectively. Conclusion: The ACOS cohort with statin use had lower risks of anxiety and depression, regardless of age, sex, commodities, or ICSs and OSs. The incidences of anxiety and depression were relatively low among users of statins with ICSs or OSs in the ACOS cohort.

287,"Corrigendum to: ""Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies""","Reports an error in ""Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies"" by Brianna Adamson, Nicole Letourneau and Catherine Lebel ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[Dec][1], Vol 241, 117-126). The authors regret not fully describing Mennes et al. (2009)’s use of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory as a key prenatal predictor and how it was employed differently as a potential confounder. This has been corrected in three places, as given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-46262-018). Background: Maternal anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and are associated with increased behaviour problems and risk of mental health difficulties in children. Understanding alterations in brain structure and function associated with maternal anxiety may help elucidate potential mechanisms via which high maternal anxiety could affect children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of extant research studying the associations between prenatal anxiety and children's brain structure and function, as assessed through neuroimaging. Data were gathered in accordance with the PRISMA review guidelines. Results: Ten articles were identified, and all found a significant association between antenatal maternal anxiety and child neurodevelopment. Studies vary considerably in their methods with five studies employing electroencephalography (EEG), one using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the rest employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Limitations: The heterogeneity of neuroimaging techniques undertaken by the reviewed studies precluded a meta-analysis from being performed. The applicability of this systematic review to clinical practice is also limited given that the studies examined children across a wide age range (neonates to 17 years). Conclusions: From early infancy to late adolescence, findings suggest alterations of brain structure and function in frontal, temporal, and limbic areas in children born to mothers who experienced prenatal anxiety. These brain abnormalities may underlie associations between prenatal anxiety and children's behaviour, though more research incorporating neuroimaging and behavioural data is necessary to determine this.

288,Clinical effectiveness and cost minimisation model of Alpha-Stim cranial electrotherapy stimulation in treatment seeking patients with moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder,"Background: Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a well-tolerated neuromodulation treatment with demonstrated trial efficacy in anxiety disorders. The aim of the current study was to demonstrate its clinical and cost effectiveness during and after CES in people with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) who had not responded to low intensity psychological treatment in a routine health service. Methods: Consecutive sample of eligible patients with GAD waiting for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) selected from two publicly funded services in England. They received 60 min per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6–12 weeks. Primary outcome was remission on the GAD-7 scale at 12 and 24 weeks. Cost effectiveness was examined using a cost minimisation model of direct health costs. Results: Of 161 patients recruited, 72 (44.7%) and 77 (47.8%) achieved remission on the GAD-7 at 12 and 24 weeks respectively with 122 (75.8%) receiving at least 6 weeks CES. Mean (sd) GAD-7 score at baseline significantly improved from 15.77 (3.21) to 8.92 (5.42) and 8.99 (6.18) at 12 and 24 weeks respectively ( p &lt; 0.001). 80 (49.7%) participants required further individual CBT. CES provided a saving of £540.88 per patient (95% CI −£327.12, £648.69). Limitations: Participants were not randomised and there was no control group. Only 48 (29.9%) participants completed every assessment. Conclusion: In patients with generalised anxiety disorder not responding to low intensity psychological treatment, 6–12 weeks daily Alpha Stim CES may be effective after treatment and 3 months later, thereby reducing the need for individual CBT and saving health costs.

289,"Body image and its relationships with sexual functioning, anxiety, and depression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with lower levels of satisfaction with body image, which can affect sexuality and social well-being. Thus, we evaluated body image in women with PCOS and its association with body dis(satisfaction), anthropometric indices, sexual function, anxiety, and depression. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 94 women of reproductive age were grouped by body mass index (BMI) and sexual function. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Figure Rating Scale (FRS), hospital anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) measurement scales, and anthropometric indices were used for data collection. Results: Women with PCOS presented with perceptual distortions of self-image independent of sexual function and BMI. There were negative correlations between HADS-A and HADS-D scores and the FSFI total score, and HADS-D scores had positive correlations with weight, anthropometric indices, and BSQ total score. The degree of dis(satisfaction) was a predictor of FSFI total score, depression, and anxiety, and the FSFI total score was predicted by HADS-D. Desired and ideal-gender BMIs were risk factors for sexual dysfunction, and overweight and obesity were risk factors for the degree of dis(satisfaction). Limitations: This study had the limitations of using a cross-sectional design and it investigated a restricted number of clinical/biochemical parameters, as well as lacked objective measures of acne and hirsutism, and a control group. Conclusions: Perception and cognitive-affective dimensions appear to play important roles in body image dysfunction in women with PCOS, and impact sexual dysfunction and depression associated the syndrome. Furthermore, these results provide additional treatment considerations for women with PCOS.

290,"Differential associations of locus of control with anxiety, depression and life-events: A five-wave, nine-year study to test stability and change","Background: The locus of control (LOC) construct has been associated with onset, course, and severity of anxiety and depression. We investigated the stability of LOC, the bidirectional relationships between LOC and symptom severity of anxiety and depression over nine years, and the influence of intermediate positive and negative life-events on these associations. Methods: Data came from five assessment waves over nine years of 2052 subjects with an anxiety or depressive disorder or healthy controls. First, the stability of LOC (assessed with 5-item Mastery Scale) was tested. Next, associations between LOC, anxiety severity (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology), and intermediate positive and negative life-events (20-item List of Threatening Experience Questionnaire) were determined with structural equation modeling. Results: LOC was rather stable over nine years ( r = 0.62), and scores increased slightly with age (i.e. became more internal). LOC yielded equal stability estimates as symptom levels of anxiety and depression did over nine years. A more external LOC predicted higher anxiety and depression severity, but did not influence the incidence of positive and negative life-events. Higher depression severity and more negative life-events predicted the development of a more external LOC, whereas more positive life-events predicted a more internal LOC. Anxiety severity had no effect on LOC. Limitations: Life-events were assessed with self-report measures. Conclusions: The prospective associations between LOC and meaningful changes in anxiety and depressive symptom severity and experienced life-events may yield important new insights for clinical interventions.

291,NEET status among young Greeks: Association with mental health and substance use,"Background: Prior studies have shown that young people “not in education, employment or training” (“NEET”) are at higher risk for psychopathology and substance abuse. Similar studies are lacking in Southern European populations. We aimed to examine the associations of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and substance use with NEET status in a large, randomized population-based sample in Greece. Methods: A telephone structured questionnaire was conducted in a representative sample of 2771 young Greeks aged 15–24 years. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales, respectively. Substances use and several sociodemographic parameters were also examined. Results: In our sample 16.4% were NEETs. In multivariate analyses, NEETs compared to non-NEETs were older, with lower family income, without insurance and more likely to be married and smoke. Furthermore, NEET status was associated with a higher GAD-7 score among older NEETs and long-term NEETs (NEETs unemployed for more than a year). Moreover, being NEET among older participants was associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and moderate/severe symptoms of depression. Limitations: This was a telephone survey and a clinical evaluation of the patients was not performed. Furthermore, the structured interview was not designed to detect the level of substance use or the reasons for being NEET. Conclusions: NEET status is frequent among young Greeks. Older, and long-term NEETs appear to be at higher risk for presenting anxiety/depression symptoms. Whether NEET status is associated with adverse outcomes later in life requires longitudinal studies.

Ng, Gabor S. Ungvari, Gang Wang and Yu-Tao Xiang ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2018[Sep], Vol 237, 37-46). In the original article, there were errors in the affiliation of the seventh author and in the first affiliation. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-27934-007). Background: The prevalence of comorbid depression is high in chronic gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For these two disorders in particular, the findings have not been consistent. This meta-analysis systematically compares the rates and severity of comorbid depression between IBS and IBD patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure from their inception date to September 12, 2017 for comparative studies on IBS and IBD patients. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) of comorbid depression were calculated using random effect models. Data on comorbid anxiety in the included studies were also extracted and analyzed. Results: Altogether, 22 studies with 1,244 IBS and 1,048 IBD patients were included. While there was no significant group difference in the prevalence of depression (10 studies, OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.87–1.60, P = 0.29), the IBS group had more severe depression (pooled SMD = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.04–0.33, P = 0.01) and anxiety than the IBD group (pooled SMD = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.14–0.49, P = 0.0006). Sixteen (72.7%) studies were assessed as ‘high quality’ using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of comorbid depression was similar between groups, IBS patients had more severe comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to IBD patients. Appropriate assessment and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these patient groups should be implemented.

293,"Influencing factors for prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy among women in Chongqing, China","Background: Prenatal mental disorders are associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, while few studies have been performed in mainland China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders. Methods: Data were obtained from 1220 women with &lt; 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively. Results: The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86%, 15.04% and 5.19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression. Limitations: All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section. Conclusion: Early screening and intervention may have great significance for reducing mental disorders of pregnant women, and the family and society support should be brought into the intervention as well.

294,Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of depression with comorbid anxiety disorders,"Background: The presence of comorbid anxiety is generally associated with poorer treatment outcomes in people with depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to be effective for treatment resistant depression, but there has been little research examining rTMS in depressed patients with comorbid anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of rTMS in patients with treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods: This study included 248 patients with treatment resistant MDD who were treated with rTMS. Of these, 172 patients had one or more comorbid anxiety disorders, so their outcomes were compared with patients who did not have comorbid anxiety. Results: Patients both with and without comorbid anxiety disorders showed improvement in depression ratings after rTMS treatment, with no significant difference in remission rates between groups. In those with comorbid anxiety disorders, 23.3% met criteria for remission and 39.5% met response criteria. For each anxiety disorder diagnosis, there was a significant reduction in HAM-A, HAM-D21, MADRS and ZUNG scores ( p = &lt; 0.001 for all). Limitations: This was not a sham-controlled study, so placebo response rates are not known. Patients were referred by private psychiatrists so are not representative of all patients with depression. Conclusion: Our study indicates that rTMS is an effective treatment for Major Depressive Disorder in people who have comorbid anxiety disorders.

295,Factorial invariance of a computerized version of the GAD-7 across various demographic groups and over time in primary care patients,"Background: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) is commonly used by clinicians and researchers to screen for anxiety disorders and to monitor anxiety symptoms in primary care. However, findings regarding its factor structure are mixed, with most studies reporting a best-fitting for a one-factor structure, whereas others indicate a two-factor model. To be valid for comparisons, the GAD-7 should measure the same latent construct with the same structure across groups and over time. We aimed to examine the best-fit factor structure model of the GAD-7 among primary care patients and to evaluate its measurement invariance. Methods: A total of 1255 patients completed the computerized version of GAD-7 and a subsample of 238 cases was assessed at the 3-month follow-up. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed and analyses of multiple-group invariance were also conducted to determine the extent to which the factor structure was comparable across various sociodemographic groups and over time. Results: The results showed that both a one- and two-factor structure (representing somatic and cognitive-affective components) were invariant across sociodemographic groups and over time. The two-factor structure provided the best model fit. Limitations: Results cannot be generalized to all primary care patients, as only patients whose general practitioners consider them to suffer emotional disorders were included. Conclusions: Our study supports the reliability and validity of the one- and two-factor model of the GAD-7, both for screening purposes and for monitoring response to treatment.

296,Psychometric properties and validation of the Spanish versions of the Overall Anxiety and Depression Severity and Impairment scales,"Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most frequent disorders for which patients seek care in public health settings in Spain. This study aimed at validating the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS), which are brief screening scales for anxiety and depression consisting of only five items each. Methods: The study was conducted in a Spanish clinical sample receiving outpatient mental health treatment ( N = 339). A subsample of participants (n = 219) was assessed before and after receiving a course of cognitive-behavioral treatment. Results: The results revealed excellent internal consistency estimates (Cronbach's alpha for the OASIS and the ODSIS was 0.87 and 0.94, respectively), along with promising convergent and discriminant validity and test-criterion relationships (i.e., moderate correlation with other measures of depression and anxiety, as well as with neuroticism, quality of life, adjustment, and negative affect). A one-dimensional structure was obtained for the OASIS and the ODSIS. The ROC analyses indicated an area under the curve of 0.83 for the OASIS and the ODSIS when predicting moderate-to-severe anxiety and depression, respectively. Good sensitivity to therapeutic change was also evidence and the analysis of the sensitivity as a function of 1-specificity area suggested a cutoff value of 10 for both scales. Limitations: Inter-rater reliability of diagnoses with the ADIS-IV interview could not be investigated and the results obtained may not be generalizable to other samples and health settings. Conclusions: The availability of these two short and psychometrically sound measures should make screening of anxiety and depressive symptoms in routine care more feasible.

297,Online help-seeking prior to diagnosis: Can web-based resources reduce the duration of untreated mood disorders in young people?,"Objective: Mood and anxiety disorders typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, but those at the age of highest risk are among those least likely to access mental health services. However, they may be more likely than other demographic groups to seek help online. The goal of the present study was to investigate the online help- and information-seeking activity of young people newly diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders in order to better understand how digital resources might serve this population. Method: Participants, aged 15 to 35, with a diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were eligible if they had received their first mental health diagnosis within 24 months. Participants were interviewed with the Pathways to Care Questionnaire, which inquires about online activity prior to one's first interaction with mental healthcare providers. Results: Forty people participated (depression n = 30, bipolar disorder n = 5, generalized anxiety disorder n = 5); average age 21 years (SD=3.2), 60% female. Eighty-one percent reported seeking help and/or information about their symptoms online. The gap between symptom onset and in-person help seeking was 91.90 weeks (SD=133.7). Most participants (85%) reported they would be open to communicating with a mental health professional online. Conclusion: A majority of young people experiencing clinically-significant symptoms seek help online. However, the gap between symptom onset and treatment initiation remains unacceptably long. Better strategies are needed to translate young people's interest in online resources into meaningful care, whether through web-based services or facilitated pathways to traditional treatment.

The aim was to determine whether positive mental health predict recovery from mental disorders. Methods: The study population consisted of 414 participants with a 12-month disorder from the representative general population Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2. Independent positive mental health indicators were mental well-being, its subscales emotional, social and psychological well-being and the category flourishing mental health. Recovery was defined as no longer fulfilling DSM-IV criteria of the index disorder 3 years later. Results: Despite meeting the criteria of a 12-month mental disorder, 19% with anxiety disorder were flourishing and 14% with mood disorder. Logistic regression analyses controlled for sociodemographics, physical health, life-events, service use, psychotropic medication, comorbidity and clinical severity showed that positive mental health positively influenced recovery from anxiety disorder (mainly by emotional and psychological well-being) and did not influence recovery from mood disorder. Limitations: The results are not generalizable to psychiatric patients in treatment settings and might differ for specific disorders within each DSM-IV category. Conclusions: Clinicians are encouraged to measure positive mental health in their patients and to improve positive mental health particularly in people with an anxiety disorder. The non-significant relation between positive mental health and recovery from mood disorder warrants further research, for example through using more in-depth assessment of positive mental health components and by investigating recovery from less severe mood disorders.

299,Cross-sectional and longitudinal association of non-exercise estimated cardiorespiratory fitness with depression and anxiety in the general population: The HUNT study,"Background: Cardiorespiratory fitness may help to prevent depression and anxiety. A paucity of literature has considered the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and the incidence of depression and anxiety. The objective of this study was to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with depression and anxiety. Methods: This study included middle-aged and older participants from the second (HUNT 2, 1995–1997) and third (HUNT3, 2006–2008) survery of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). Baseline non-exercise estimated CRF (eCRF) was determined using standardized algorithms. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between eCRF and depression and anxiety. Results: In cross-sectional adjusted analysis including those who participated in HUNT2 ( n = 26,615 mean age 55.7 years), those with medium and high level of eCRF had 21% (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.89) and 26% (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.66–0.83) lower odds of depression compared to those with low eCRF level, respectively. Longitudinal analysis including those who participated in both HUNT2 and HUNT3 ( n = 14,020 mean age 52.2 years) found that medium and level of eCRF was associated with 22% (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) and 19% (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66–0.99) lower odds of depression compared to those with low eCRF level, respectively. CRF was not associated with anxiety, either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a medium and high level of eCRF during late middle age is cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with lower odds of depression. However, our data do not support that eCRF is associated with anxiety. Further studies are warranted to conclude a causal relationship between eCRF and depression.

300,The gut-brain relationship: Investigating the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of healthy young adults,"Intro: There has been an increased interest in understanding the therapeutic effect of gut-microbiota on health, particularly in mental health. However, limited research into the connection between gut-microbiota and mental health makes this study an important endeavor in exploring the effect of gut-microbiota, through probiotics intervention, on mental health like anxiety and factors related to anxiety (e.g., anxiety control, affect, negative mood regulation, and worry). Method: Healthy college students ( N = 86; 75.6% female), average age of 20.59, participated in a double-blind, placebo-control, and randomization-control study. Eligible participants completed a baseline survey before being assigned to a condition, which consisted of four probiotics conditions and one placebo condition. After 28 days of daily intake, the participants returned to complete their exit survey. Result: Probiotics were observed to improve panic anxiety, neurophysiological anxiety, negative affect, worry, and increase negative mood regulation. Furthermore, post hoc analyses revealed that the CFU (colony-forming unit) level was more effective than species counts in accounting for the number of significant improvements. A ceiling effect was detected in the study, participants with high distress reported higher number of improvements than those with normative distress. Conclusion: Overall, this study is the first to examine the effect of CFU and species count on probiotics’ efficacy. The study's finding suggested that probiotics may have the therapeutic potential to treat anxiety, however, further research is necessary to make that determination.

301,"Dynamic and bidirectional associations between maternal stress, anxiety, and social support: The critical role of partner and family support","Background: Stress and anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with poor long-term maternal and child health outcomes. Social support has been shown to mitigate the effects of maternal stress and anxiety; however, the directionality and longitudinal associations among these variables are poorly understood. Using a novel multilevel modeling approach called dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM), we examined within-person (state-level) autoregressive and cross-lagged associations among stress, anxiety, and social support in the perinatal period in order to elucidate directional associations over time. Methods: Mothers from a longitudinal pregnancy cohort ( N = 3,388) completed self-report measures of stress, anxiety, and social support across 4 time points from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Results: Higher than average levels of stress and anxiety led to elevations in anxiety and stress and decreases in social support at subsequent time points. Importantly, earlier individual levels of partner and family support predicted subsequent decreases in stress and anxiety. Limitations: Support was measured via maternal self-report thus extrapolations cannot be made to tangible or instrumental supports and lagged relationships represent average lags over time. Conclusions: Using a novel statistical approach, these results suggest that increases in both partner and family support may be powerful protective factors for decreasing mental health difficulties in pregnancy and the postpartum, highlighting the importance of targeting and increasing this type of support from pregnancy to the postpartum period.

302,Comparison and change of defense mechanisms over the course of psychotherapy in patients with depression or anxiety disorder: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Defense mechanisms play an important role in the development and maintenance of both health and psychopathology. Research is still in the early stages of investigating the specific relationships among diagnostic groups and defense mechanisms along with their response to different treatment types. Methods: For the present study a total of 47 outpatients diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders were randomized to receive 25±3 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy with integrated elements of either emotion-focused therapy (CBT + EFT) or treatment components based on self-regulation theory (CBT + SR). An observer-rated method, the Defense Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS) was used to code transcripts of the 1st, 8th, 16th and 24th session to assess change in defensive functioning. Results: Over the course of therapy, overall defensive functioning (ODF) as well as adaptive defenses increased significantly, whereas maladaptive and neurotic defenses did not change. At the beginning of treatment, the proportion of adaptive defenses and ODF was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders than in patients with depressive disorders. However, depressed patients exhibited greater improvement in their defensive functioning over the course of therapy. Conclusions: Results support the view of defense mechanisms as a useful transdiagnostic and transtheoretical concept and supports the notion that change of defense mechanisms may be a relevant mechanism of change in psychotherapy.

303,Trajectories of self-reported sleep disturbance across inpatient psychiatric treatment predict clinical outcome in comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: As there has been a demonstrated link between sleep disturbance and suicide, the present study investigated the relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance during inpatient psychiatric treatment and clinical outcomes at discharge and six months post-discharge. Methods: Participants were 2,970 adults receiving care in a long-term inpatient psychiatric hospital. Greater than 90% of inpatients reported at least mild sleep disturbance throughout treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine patterns of sleep disturbance changes over time. Results: Participants fit into distinct categories based on their trajectories of sleep problems across treatment: No Sleep Problems (10.3% of participants, no sleep problems endorsed over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment), Resolvers (sleep problems completely resolved over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 10.6%), Non-Responders (did not respond to inpatient psychiatric treatment; 35.7%) and Responders (sleep problems decreased but did not fully resolve over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 43.4%). Individuals with comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to demonstrate higher rates of sleep disturbance throughout inpatient psychiatric treatment and their sleep problems did not respond to treatment as usual (Non-Responders). Further, patients in the Non-Responder group had significantly more suicidal ideation and worse clinical outcomes (higher anxiety, more disability, and lower well-being) at discharge and six months post-discharge, as well as were on more medication including hypnotics throughout treatment. Conclusions: Findings indicate the urgent need to design and implement inpatient psychiatry sleep protocols to not only improve sleep and clinical outcomes, but also reduce the risk for suicide post-discharge.

304,Increased risk of depression in Bell's palsy: Two longitudinal follow-up studies using a national sample cohort,"Background: Recently, a bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and anxiety disorders has been reported. Given the common comorbidity between anxiety and depressive conditions and the typical developmental trajectory of anxiety before depression, we hypothesized that the bidirectional association between Bell's palsy and depression is also reproducible. Methods: Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, data were collected from 3,526 Bell's palsy patients who were 1:4 matched by age, sex, income, region of residence, and past medical history with 14,104 controls. Additionally, 61,068 depression patients were matched with 244,272 control participants. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) of Bell's palsy for depression (study I) and depression for Bell's palsy (study II). Results: In study I, the adjusted HR for depression was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–1.66) in the Bell's palsy group ( P &lt; 0.001). In subgroup analyses, an increased risk of depression was more evident, particularly in female participants ≥ 40 years old. This association was evident in follow-up periods 6 months after the index date. In study II, the adjusted HR for Bell's palsy was 1.08 (95% CI = 0.94–1.25) in the depression group ( P = 0.280). Conclusion: A history of Bell's palsy increased the risk of depression. Contrary to our hypotheses, depression did not increase the risk of Bell's palsy.

305,Cognitive behavioral therapy for childhood anxiety disorders: What happens to comorbid mood and behavioral disorders? A systematic review,"Background: High rates of comorbidity among children and adolescents with anxiety disorders are widely documented. To date the question of what happens to comorbid disorders upon treatment of the primary anxiety disorder has received little attention and the optimal treatment strategy for cases with comorbidity remains to be determined. Objectives: This review examines the literature on the impact of disorder-specific CBT on comorbid mood and behavioral disorders in young people with a primary anxiety disorder. Search methods: PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched using predefined selection criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed the relevance of studies, obtained data using a data extraction form and undertook methodological quality analysis. Results: Ten studies (1647 children in total) were included in the review. All studies demonstrated positive outcomes for CBT focused on the primary anxiety disorder on untargeted comorbid mood and/or externalising disorders. Conclusions: Findings suggest CBT focused on the primary anxiety disorder successfully reduces comorbid mood and/or behavioral diagnoses and symptoms of these co-occurring clinical diagnoses. Therefore, the implementation of disorder-specific CBT for the primary disorder is a valid alternative to transdiagnostic interventions and is recommended in cases of comorbidity in children and adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder.

306,"Disrupted interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and structural connectivity in first-episode, treatment-naïve generalized anxiety disorder","Background: Aberrant functional and structural connectivity are considered to be involved in the underlying neural mechanism of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, alterations in functional and structural interactions between the bilateral hemispheres are rarely examined. The current study aimed to characterized interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and white matter microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum in patients with GAD. Methods: Resting-state Blood oxygen level-dependent and diffusion tensor image were acquired for patients with GAD and healthy subjects. The two groups were matched in age, gender, education years. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) of whole brain and white matter integrity of the corpus callosum (CC) were compared between the two groups. Their correlations with clinical measures were further performed. Results: Compare to controls, decreased resting-state VMHC were found in the precentral gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus and insula/putamen in patients with GAD. No regions of increased VMHC were detected in GAD. Compared to controls, GAD patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in CC2. In GAD group, further Pearson's correlation analyses showed that VMHC of the midcingulate gyrus positively correlated with FA of CC2, FA of CC2 negatively correlated with anxiety severity. Further mediation analyses demonstrated that attenuated VMHC in bilateral midcingulate gyrus partly mediated the association between white matter integrity of CC2 sub-region and anxiety severity. Conclusion: Our findings suggested impairment of interhemispheric coordination in GAD. Moreover, disrupted interhemispheric connectivity correlated with anxiety severity in GAD. Our findings provided a novel clue about the neural mechanism of GAD, and may contribute to further deep exploration and treatment of GAD. Limitations: The study was lack of comparison with non-GAD anxiety disorders.

307,"Association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany","Aim: Our goal was to analyze the association between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and the risk of psychiatric disorders in 57,770 women followed in gynecological practices in Germany. Methods: This case-control study was based on data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). Women with a first documentation of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder in one of 281 gynecological practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 were included in this study (index date). Controls without depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, or somatoform disorder were matched (1:1) to cases by age, index year, and physician. A total of 57,770 women were included in the present study. The main outcome of the study was the risk of psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, somatoform disorder) as a function of induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility. Results: The mean age was 29.2 years (SD = 6.4 years) in women with and without psychiatric disorders. Induced abortion (odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 1.75 to 2.01), spontaneous abortion (ORs ranging from 2.16 to 2.60), and infertility (OR = 2.13) were positively associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: A positive relationship between induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, and infertility respectively and psychiatric disorders was observed in gynecological practices in Germany.

308,The impact of resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shanghai,"Background: Prenatal anxiety/depression has been a major public health problem globally with higher prevalence in developing countries, which leads to negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal stress varies over the course of pregnancy and the stress occurring in early pregnancy is the most critical. However, few studies have focused on the impact of resilience to stress on mental health of pregnant women. Aims: To explore the effect of resilience to stress on prenatal anxiety/depression in pregnant women. Methods: 2813 participants were recruited from Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) in this study. The Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) was used to assess stress at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy and at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Resilience was assessed by the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy. The prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed at 32–26 weeks of pregnancy by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the direct effect of stress and resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression. The indirect effects of mediation were analyzed by structural equation models, and the indirect effect of modification was examined by stratification analysis. Results: There were 11.1% and 10.3% of pregnant women in Shanghai MCPC indicating anxiety and depressive mood, respectively. The stress caused by both subjective and objective events at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy is less than that at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy. We found that resilience was a protective factor for maternal mental health and meanwhile it was both an effect modifier and a mediator to the association between stress and prenatal anxiety/depression, with the mediating effect ratio of 15.1% and 23.8%, respectively. Limitations: The existence of recall bias, missing data, and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the generalizability of the study. The measurements of resilience, prenatal anxiety, and depression were not designed specifically for pregnant women, so that they might have missed some important indications of mental issues related to pregnant women only. Conclusions: Resilience could be a direct and indirect protective factor for prenatal anxiety and depression caused by pregnancy stress.

309,Affective symptoms and apathy in myotonic dystrophy type 1 a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: To gain insight into the prevalence of apathy, depression and anxiety symptoms in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients on the basis of a systematic review with a meta-analysis. Methods: One author systematically searched and selected studies from Embase, Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science (index periods up to August 2018). Data extraction and bias assessment were performed independently by two authors. We calculated (1) a weighted pooled prevalence and (2) weighted pooled standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) from studies comparing DM1 patients to healthy and/or neuromuscular disease controls separately for symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy. Results: The pooled prevalences of depression (26 studies, n = 1267 DM1 patients), anxiety (19 studies, n = 896) and apathy (5 studies, n = 428), were 18% (95%CI: 12–25), 16 (95%CI: 13–18) and 55% (95%CI: 50–60), respectively. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) for depression, anxiety and apathy in DM1 patients compared to healthy controls were 1.04 (95%-CI: 0.71 to 1.37), 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.51 to 1.24) and 1.13 (95%-CI:0.54–1.71). Effect sizes for symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy were 0.29 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.70), 0.45 (95%-CI: –0.31 to 1.22) and 1.12 (95%-CI: 0.32–1.93) for DM1 patients versus neuromuscular disease controls. In most analyses, statistical heterogeneity was high. Conclusions: Estimated pooled prevalences of clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy in DM1 are 19, 17 and 55% respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety in DM1 may reflect reactive adjustment to progressive impairment and restricted participation similar to other chronic neuromuscular disease. The literature on the prevalence and severity of apathy, although a clinically relevant and characteristic symptom of DM1, is relatively scarce.

310,"Use of mental health services by community-resident adults with DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders in a violence-prone area: São Paulo, Brazil","Background: While under-use of mental health services by adults with anxiety and/or depression is well established, use in a violence-prone area, and as a function of diagnosis and personality characteristics such resilience, is little known. We examine the sociodemographic and personality characteristics (specifically resilience), associated with use of mental health services in a violence-prone city by those with anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. Methods: The structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify 12-month DSM-IV- and ICD-10-defined anxiety and depression in a cross-sectional, representative, community-resident sample age 15–75y ( N = 2536) in São Paulo, Brazil, and their use of mental health services. Resilience was determined by the Wagnild and Young scale. Analyses, using weighted, design-corrected statistical tests, included frequency measures and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Mental health services were used by 10% with only anxiety, 22% with only depression, and 34% with comorbidity, with odds of use in controlled analyses doubling from anxiety to depression to comorbidity. Use was significantly higher among those who were white, older (age &gt;30 years, with substantial social support, low resilience, living in low homicide rate areas; use was not affected by experience of traumatic events. Psychiatrists, general practitioners, and psychologists were the primary providers. Limitations: Cross-sectional design Conclusions: Contrary to expectation, use was greater among residents of lower homicide areas, and was not associated with personal traumatic experience. This may reflect increased immunity to violence in higher homicidal rate areas, lower resilience, and poorer access to services. Increased access to mental health services is needed.

311,Biological and psychosocial predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum period: A longitudinal study,"Background: As many as 20% of women will experience an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period. Women with pre-existing anxiety disorders are at increased risk of worsening during this time, yet little is known about its predictors. Study Aim: To investigate the psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Methods: Thirty-five ( n = 35) pregnant women with pre-existing DSM-5 anxiety disorders were enrolled in this prospective study investigating the psychosocial (e.g., childhood trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, depression) and biological risk factors (e.g. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) for anxiety worsening in the postpartum period. Anxiety worsening was defined as an increase of ≥50% or greater on Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores from the third trimester of pregnancy (32.94 ± 3.35 weeks) to six weeks postpartum. Results: Intolerance of uncertainty, depressive symptom severity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms present in pregnancy were significant predictors of anxiety worsening in the postpartum. Limitations: Sample heterogeneity and limited sample size may affect study generalizability. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate psychosocial and biological risk factors for anxiety worsening in the postpartum in women with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Continued research investigating these risk factors is needed to elucidate whether they differ from women experiencing new-onset anxiety disorders in the perinatal period, and those in non-puerperal groups. Identifying these risk factors can guide the development of screening measures for early and accurate symptom detection. This can lead to the implementation of appropriate interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of perinatal anxiety worsening.

312,Screening for perinatal anxiety disorders: Room to grow,"Background: The anxiety and their related disorders (AD) are the most prevalent of all mental health conditions, disproportionately affecting women. The value of perinatal AD screening is well established but there is very limited evidence to support the applicability of existing anxiety screening instruments. To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated an AD screening instrument in a perinatal population using full gold standard methodology. Objective: To assess the accuracy of the most commonly used and/or recommended screening tools for perinatal AD (i.e., the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and its anxiety subscale (EPDS-3A), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and 2-item Scales (GAD-7 and GAD-2) alongside a clinically derived alternative; the Anxiety Disorder-13 (AD-13). Methods: 310 Canadian women completed mood and anxiety questionnaires at approximately 3-months postpartum. Those scoring at/above cut-off on one or more questionnaire completed a diagnostic interview for depression and all AD ( n = 115). The accuracy of each scale was assessed via ROC analyses. Results: Only the AD-13 met the standard of a clinically useful screening measure, with an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.8. This was achieved with and without the inclusion of the related disorders. No other measure demonstrated an AUC above 0.8, either including or excluding the related disorders. Conclusions: Neither the EPDS/EPDS 3-A, nor the GAD-7/GAD-2 can be recommended for widespread use as a perinatal AD screening tool. The high performance of the AD-13 is a good indication that an effective alternative is well within reach.

313,Exploring comorbidity between anxiety and depression among migrant Filipino domestic workers: A network approach,"Background: Depression and anxiety are comorbid. From the network model perspective, comorbidity is due to direct interactions between depression and anxiety symptoms. These interacting symptoms are called bridge symptoms, suppression of which is expected to halt other symptoms. This study investigates the network structure of depression, anxiety, and bridge symptoms in a sample of migrant domestic workers, who are among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups of workers. Method: Data were collected from 1375 Filipino domestic workers in Macao Special Administrative Region, China. Data from a subsample of 355 consisting of participants who met criteria for depression and anxiety were used in analysis. R software was used to estimate the network. Results: The eight strongest edges were between items from the same disorder. Six were between depression symptoms, like “concentration difficulties” and “psychomotor agitation/retardation,” and “psychomotor agitation/retardation” and “thoughts of death.” Two were between anxiety symptoms, including “worry too much” and “trouble relaxing.” For centrality indices, “fatigue” had highest strength and closeness, and “restlessness” had highest betweenness. Results revealed three bridge symptoms: “fatigue,” “depressed mood,” and “anhedonia.” Limitations: The results may not generalize to the entire Filipino population. Further, while the centrality index of strength had adequate stability, it was not highly stable. Conclusions: The current study highlighted critical transdiagnostic bridge symptoms as specific candidates for intervention. “Psychomotor agitation/retardation” was identified as key priority due to its association with suicidal ideation. Systemic multilevel interventions at the person-level (e.g., cognitive therapy and behavioral activation), and at the structural and policy-level to alleviate psychosocial stressors, could be applied to address disorder comorbidity in this population.

314,Differentiating acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD) from anxiety and depression symptoms: A network analysis,"Background: A growing body of literature supports the potential existence of a new clinical entity, Acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD), which is characterized by rapid-onset, acute suicidality. This study aimed to evaluate whether current ASAD symptoms (i.e., suicidal intent, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, disgust with others and oneself, agitation, irritability, insomnia, and nightmares) comprise a psychopathological network distinct from anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods: A sample of 167 psychiatric inpatients completed self-report measures of current ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Results: Network analyses revealed three distinct clusters of symptoms corresponding to ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptom self-report measure items. Namely, ASAD symptoms not only demonstrated strong associations with each other, but they also exhibited weak associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and distinct self-report measures to assess all constructs, which may have led to methodological confounds that influenced the observed network structure. Conclusions: Overall, our findings provide further evidence for ASAD as a syndrome with strongly interrelated symptoms. Furthermore, results indicate that ASAD may represent a construct distinct from anxiety and depression, underscoring its potential diagnostic value. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings across other high-risk populations, as well as to examine how ASAD symptoms may relate to other psychiatric symptoms.

315,Clinically relevant anxiety and risk of Alzheimer's disease in an elderly community sample: 4.5 years of follow-up,"Objectives: To investigate whether clinically relevant anxiety increased the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) while controlling for the presence of depression and other confounders; and to report the population attributable fraction (PAF) associated with anxiety disorder. Method: We used data from the longitudinal, community-based Zaragoza Dementia and Depression (ZARADEMP) study. A random sample of 4057 dementia-free community dwellers aged ≥55 years were followed for 4.5 years. The Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy package was used for the diagnosis of clinically significant cases and subcases of anxiety; and AD was diagnosed by a panel of research psychiatrists according to DSM-IV criteria. Multivariate survival analysis with competing risk regression model was performed. Results: We observed a significant association between anxiety cases at baseline and AD risk in the univariate analysis that persisted in the fully adjusted model (SHR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.59–9.60; p = 0.003), with a PAF for AD of 6.11% (95% CI: 1.30%–16.17%). No significant association between ‘subcases’ of anxiety at baseline and AD risk was found. Limitations: Data on apolipoprotein E were not available. The hospital-based diagnosis was not completed in all cases of dementia. Conclusion: Late-life, clinically significant anxiety (but not subclinical anxiety) seems to increase the risk of AD, independently of the effect of several confounders, including depression. Taking into account the high prevalence of anxiety among the elderly, future studies are warranted to determine potential risk reduction of AD.

316,Buffering against maladaptive perfectionism in bipolar disorder: The role of self-compassion,"Background: Maladaptive perfectionism is a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor for a range of mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD). Self-compassion represents a potential protective factor against maladaptive perfectionism, however no studies to date have examined the relationship of these constructs in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion and symptoms among individuals with BD. Methods: Baseline data were collected from 302 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD participating in an international randomised controlled trial. Participants completed measures of maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion, symptom severity and emotion regulation difficulties. Clinician-administered measures of depression and mania severity were additionally collected. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted. Results: Maladaptive perfectionism was positively associated with depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Lower levels of self-compassion correlated with greater self-reported depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Self-compassion partially mediated relationships between maladaptive perfectionism, depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits conclusions about causal relationships between study variables. Results may not be generalizable to other BD populations. The role of maladaptive perfectionism and self-compassion in elevated mood states of BD remains unclear. Conclusion: Self-compassion represents one mechanism through which maladaptive perfectionism influences symptoms of depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties in BD. Self-compassion represents a modifiable treatment target; individuals with BD exhibiting maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies may benefit from interventions fostering self-compassion.

317,Correlates for state and trait anxiety in a multicultural sample of Turkish and Spanish women at first trimester of pregnancy,"Objective: The main objective of this research was to assess the potential influence of cultural factors on the anxiety levels of a multicultural sample of Spanish and Turkish pregnant women at the beginning of the pregnancy. Methods: Between October and December 2017 a total of 250 Turkish and 264 Spanish pregnant women attending their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy in three different cities, Istanbul, Antalya and Malaga, were recruited for study. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated of the state-trait anxiety Inventory, and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables. Results: The mean value for State Anxiety was 47.1 [16–56] (SD 4.2), and mild, moderate and severe State Anxiety was observed in 56.8%, 14.7% and 20.5% of participants, respectively. Mean value for trait anxiety was 46.9 [34–89] (SD 4.6) and 31.4%, 19.7% and 20.2% of participants scored for mild, moderate and severe anxiety respectively. Anxiety scores were significantly higher among Turkish women. In the whole sample, religion, working status, pregnancy planning and perceived partner´s support predicted anxiety at first trimester of pregnancy. Social support and educational level were the most important predictive variables in the Spanish subgroup, while religion, the number of living children and the lack of husband´s support were among Turkish pregnant women. Conclusion: Our results confirm the existence of a high prevalence of women´s anxiety at the beginning of the pregnancy and some differences between Turkish and Spanish pregnant women have been observed. We have confirmed that some cultural features like family structure (having more children and cohabitants), the Islamic religion or the lack of perceived partner´s support became the most important vulnerability elements.

318,Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptom change during psychological therapy,"Background: Forty-percent of the variance in psychological treatment outcomes is estimated to be explained by symptom change by the third treatment session. However, change may not be uniform across patient groups and symptom domains. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients with different trajectories of depression and anxiety symptom change during psychological therapy and identify baseline patient characteristics associated with these trajectories. Methods: 4394 patients attending two psychological treatment services completed sessional, self-report depression and anxiety measures. Trajectories of symptom change were investigated using latent class growth analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore associations between baseline patient characteristics and trajectory classes. Results: A number of distinct trajectories were identified. Anxiety symptom trajectories could be distinguished by the third treatment session, but for depression symptoms there was a class displaying limited change until session six followed by rapid improvement in symptoms thereafter. Compared to the non-responding trajectories, depression and anxiety trajectories indicating treatment response were associated with lower baseline severity, better social functioning and lower incidence of phobic anxiety, but not with medication prescription status. Limitations: Data came from two services, so wider generalisability is unknown. Predictors were limited to data routinely collected in the services; unmeasured factors may have improved the prediction of trajectories. Conclusions: Baseline characteristics and symptom change early in therapy can help identify different trajectories of symptom change. This knowledge could aid clinical decision making and help improve treatment outcomes. By ignoring distinct trajectories, clinicians may incorrectly consider patients as “not-on-track” and unnecessarily change or end therapy that would otherwise benefit patients.

319,Subtypes of treatment-resistant depression determined by a latent class analysis in a Chinese clinical population,"Background: This study aimed to explore subtypes of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on clinical and demographic data collected from 375 patients with TRD. Clinical variables were compared across subtypes. Treatment outcomes across subtypes of TRD were compared separately for those within each subtype with anxiety (those with a HRSD-17 anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7) and those without anxiety. LCA subtypes were compared using Cochran's and Mantel–Haenszel χ2 test, respectively. Unordered multinomial logistic regression was used to assess clinical correlates of TRD subtypes. Results: Three categories were detected: severe depression (66%), moderate depression with anxiety (9%) and mild depression with anxiety/somatization (25%). Gender, age, age at first onset, family monthly income, number of hospitalizations, HRSD-17 and clinical global impression-severity (CGI) scores were significantly different across the three groups. Remission rates were significantly different among anxious cases with severe (43.75%), moderate (22.73%) and mild (26.25%) depression subtypes. Compared to cases in the mild depression group, those in the severe depression group had a greater likelihood of being male, having a later age of first onset, higher numbers of hospitalization, higher HRSD-17 and CGI total scores, and lower family income. Those in the moderate depression group were more likely to be male and have lower family income than those in the mild depression group. Limitations: Representative bias, relatively small sample size, unbalanced group size and incomplete indicator variables might have a negative effect on the validity and generalization of the findings. Conclusions: Depression severity could be a basis for subtype classification of patients with TRD. The classification of latent class of TRD observed in our study was similar to the structure found in MDD. Longitudinal research into the stability of the latent structure of TRD across illness course is merited as is research into treatment outcomes for TRD subtypes.

320,Insomnia late in pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Postpartum anxiety (PPA) affects a substantial number of women. Despite increasing recognition of PPA, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and potential PPA triggers. Here we aimed to estimate the prevalence of perinatal anxiety disorders, and to explore the association between insomnia during late pregnancy and anxiety before and after childbirth. Methods: This study was part of the large population-based Akershus Birth Cohort. We analyzed data from the hospital's birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy weeks 17 and 32 and postpartum week 8 ( n = 1563). Perinatal anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Anxiety disorder measurements were based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Insomnia was measured using the Bergen Insomnia Scale. Results: Among perinatal women, 10% reported symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder. The observed prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was higher after delivery (4.2%) than during pregnancy (2.5%). Multiple regression analysis, with adjustment for several psychosocial and reproductive variables, indicated that insomnia during pregnancy was significantly associated with postpartum anxiety symptoms. However, this association was markedly weakened when depression variables were included in the analysis, indicating that gestational insomnia may also be a marker for a mood disorder. Limitations: Immigrant and single women were underrepresented in our sample. Conclusions: Our results suggest that anxiety disorders are prevalent during the perinatal period. Moreover, insomnia during pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety. Health professionals should be aware that women with gestational insomnia may have an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders.

321,"Feasibility of a group-based laughter yoga intervention as an adjunctive treatment for residual symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress in people with depression","Background: Laughter Yoga (LY) is a group-based intervention involving simulated laughter, gentle stretching, rhythmic breathing and meditation. There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression. Methods: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention ( n = 23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual ( n = 27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2. Results: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification. Limitations: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group. Conclusions: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention.

322,Trajectories of maternal distress and risk of child developmental delays: Findings from the All Our Families (AOF) pregnancy cohort,"Background: Existing literature on the impact of the course of maternal distress symptoms in the perinatal period and beyond has mainly focused on one source of distress (e.g., anxiety or depression) and only selected aspects of child development. This study examined the relative impact of trajectories of maternal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms from mid-pregnancy to early childhood on child communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social development at three years of age. Methods: Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three-year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Maternal distress and child development across five domains were measured using validated tools. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of maternal distress over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the trajectories and child development while adjusting for the covariates. Results: At age three years, 5.2% of children were at risk communication delay; 12.7% for gross motor delay; 15.4% for fine motor delay; 11.2 for problem solving delay; and 5.6% for personal-social delay on ASQ-3 domains. Multivariable analysis showed children born to mothers with persistent high anxiety symptoms from pregnancy to 3-years postpartum had an increased risk of delays in communication and personal-social domains. Limitations: The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and maternal reported child development are the study limitations. Conclusions: The impact of high levels of maternal anxiety symptoms on the increased risk of child developmental delay in communication and personal-social domains highlights the importance of early intervention and addressing maternal anxiety from pregnancy through early childhood.

323,Vegetarian diet and mental health: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in culturally diverse samples,"Background: Vegetarianism is linked with better physical health, but also to increased anxiety and depression. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between vegetarianism and both positive and negative mental health, across cultures and over time. Method: Self-report questionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national cross-sectional sample including 2007 representative adult members of the German population, 3020 representative adults from Russia, and 3038 representative adults from the USA. Participants for the longitudinal analyses include university students from Germany (1608) and China (12,744). Statistical models included multiple linear regression, longitudinal linear models and longitudinal logistic models. Results: Vegetarianism diet is not reliably related to positive or negative mental health in US and Russian representative samples or in German representative or student samples. Vegetarianism is related to slight increases over time in anxiety and depression in Chinese students. Conclusions: Vegetarianism is not associated with mental health in the US, Russia, or Germany, but is associated with anxiety and depression in China in this study. Future studies should examine the nuances of vegetarianism in more detail and their links with mental health, including dietary composition and cultural beliefs and economic circumstances. Future researchers in this area may also want to consider the effects of experimental manipulation of diet on mental health outcomes over time.

324,"Examining differential relationships among self-reported attentional control, depression, and anxiety in a transdiagnostic clinical sample","Background: Poor attentional control, defined as difficulty focusing attention on a task or shifting attention flexibly between tasks, is a transdiagnostic construct theorized to confer risk for, and maintain, depression and anxiety. Research to date in non-clinical samples has suggested a dissociable relationship between the two factors of self-reported attentional control and psychopathology, with depression being associated with difficulties shifting and anxiety being associated with focusing . However, to our knowledge no study has tested this differential set of relationships in a clinical sample. Methods: Adults ( N = 493) presenting for psychiatric treatment completed measures of depressive and anxiety symptom severity and self-reported attentional control. Hierarchical linear regression and Zou's (2007) confidence interval method were used to examine the relationship between clinical symptoms and attentional control. Results: Both shifting and focusing were significantly correlated with anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample. However, focusing was more strongly associated with clinical symptomatology than shifting, which showed a weak correlation. Limitations: All constructs were measured cross-sectionally by self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: In contrast to studies conducted in non-clinical samples, attentional focusing appears to be more relevant than attentional shifting in a clinical sample for both depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings lend support to efforts to develop neurocognitive interventions that improve focusing. Replication of these findings, particularly in longitudinal studies, is warranted.

325,On a continuum to anxiety disorders: Adolescents at parental risk for anxiety show smaller rostral anterior cingulate cortex and insula thickness,"Background: Having a parent with an anxiety disorder increases the risk of anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders during the lifespan. Moreover, childhood and adolescence anxiety disorders and symptoms have been linked to a range of brain structure abnormalities. However, to date, no study has investigated brain anatomy in adolescents at high risk based on parental anxiety disorders and in adolescents with an anxiety disorder but without any treatment or therapy. Methods: Anatomical images from magnetic resonance imaging of 68 adolescents with anxiety disorders without any treatment ( N = 20), at risk for anxiety because of their parents’ anxiety disorders ( N = 21), and comparison youths ( N = 27), were analyzed using Freesurfer. Results: Compared to comparison group, smaller cortical thickness of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and of the insula was observed in anxious and at-risk groups; smaller amygdala volume was observed in the anxious group only. Limitations: The age range studied is large (10 to 17 years old). Moreover, this study is cross-sectional. Since adolescence is one of the biggest periods of cerebral reorganization, longitudinal follow-up of these youths would be necessary. Conclusions: Smaller rostral anterior cingulate cortex and insula cortical thickness appear to be cerebral markers of the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in adolescence. The reduction of the amygdala volume seems to be linked to the onset of the disorder.

326,"A longitudinal analysis of cannabis use and mental health symptoms among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada","Background: Cannabis use, anxiety, and depression are common among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) and some report using cannabis to manage mental health symptoms. Methods: Sexually-active gbMSM aged ≥ 16 years were recruited into a longitudinal cohort through respondent-driven sampling and completed study visits every six months. Data on demographics, drug use, and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected via a self-administered computer-based survey. A study nurse determined previous mental health diagnoses and treatment. Using multivariable generalized linear mixed models, we examined factors associated with regular cannabis use (≥ weekly in the previous 3 months) and, among individuals who reported anxiety or depression/bipolar diagnoses, factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety or depression symptoms. Results: Of 774 participants (551 HIV-negative, 223 HIV-seropositive), 250 (32.3%) reported regular cannabis use, 200 (26.4%) reported ever being diagnosed with anxiety, and 299 (39.3%) reported ever being diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder at baseline. Regular cannabis use was positively associated with HIV-seropositivity (aOR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.40–3.54) and previous mental health diagnosis (aOR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.00–2.31, p = 0.05). Among those previously diagnosed with anxiety or depression/bipolar disorder, regular cannabis use was not associated with moderate/severe anxiety (aOR = 1.16, 95%CI:0.69–1.94) or depression symptoms (aOR = 0.96, 95%CI:0.59–1.58), respectively. Limitations: Because of observational study design, we are unable to determine absolute effect. Conclusions: Regular cannabis use was more likely among HIV-positive gbMSM and those previously diagnosed with a mental health disorder. No association was found between regular cannabis use and severity of anxious or depressive symptoms among those diagnosed with these conditions.

327,Prevalence and course of subthreshold anxiety disorder in the general population: A three-year follow-up study,"Background: This study examined the prevalence, course and risk indicators of subthreshold anxiety disorder to determine the necessity and possible risk indicators for interventions. Methods: Data were derived from the ‘Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2’ (NEMESIS-2), a psychiatric epidemiological cohort study among the general population ( n = 4528). This study assessed prevalence, characteristics, and three-year course of subthreshold anxiety disorder ( n = 521) in adults, and compared them to a no anxiety group ( n = 3832) and an anxiety disorder group ( n = 175). Risk indicators for persistent and progressive subthreshold anxiety disorder were also explored, including socio-demographics, vulnerability factors, psychopathology, physical health and functioning. Results: The three-year prevalence of subthreshold anxiety disorder was 11.4%. At three-year follow-up, 57.3% had improved, 29.0% had persistent subthreshold anxiety disorder and 13.8% had progressed to a full-blown anxiety disorder. Prevalence, characteristics and course of subthreshold anxiety disorder were in between both comparison groups. Risk indicators for persistent course partly overlapped with those for progressive course and included vulnerability and psychopathological factors, and diminished functioning. Limitations: Course analysis were restricted to the development of anxiety disorders, other mental disorders were not assessed. Moreover, due to the naturalistic design of the study the impact of treatment on course cannot be assessed. Conclusions: Subthreshold anxiety disorder is relatively prevalent and at three-year follow-up a substantial part of respondents experienced persistent symptoms or had progressed into an anxiety disorder. Risk indicators like reduced functioning may help to identify these persons for (preventative) treatment and hence reduce functional limitations and disease burden.

328,The relationship between phobic anxiety and 2-year readmission after Acute Coronary Syndrome: What is the role of heart rate variability?,"Objective: Phobic anxiety is a risk factor for poor prognosis following Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). A psychophysiological marker of vagal function, autonomic dysfunction may play a critical role in this relationship. The aim of the study was two-fold: to assess whether phobic anxiety was characterised by autonomic dysfunction (heart rate variability) in the short (1-month) and longer term (12-months) following ACS, and (ii) to quantify the extent to which HRV parameters modified the effect of phobic anxiety on all-cause hospital readmission over 2 years. Methods: The ADVENT study followed 416 ACS patients. At 1-month following discharge (T0), phobic anxiety and autonomic functioning were assessed using the Crown Crisp Index (CCI) and 11 indices of heart rate variability (HRV), respectively. HRV was measured again at 12-months (T1) ( n = 359). Hospital readmission (all cause) was derived from an audit of hospital records by two medically trained research fellows. Generalised linear modelling (GLM) was used to first determine the association between CCI score at T0 and HRV parameters at T0 and T1. Binary logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between CCI scores and readmission (yes/no) and the extent to which HRV parameters modified this effect. Results: CCI scores were associated with 7 of the 11 indices of HRV: Average RR (ms), SDRR (ms), RMSSD (ms), SDSD (ms), pRR50 (%), LF Powers (ms2) and HF Powers (ms2) at T0 but not T1. CCI scores at T0 significantly predicted likelihood of readmission to hospital in the subsequent 2 year period. No parameter of HRV at T0 modified this effect. Limitations: We were unable to provide adjudicated major adverse coronary events outcome data, or account for changes in medication adherence, diet or physical activity. Conclusions: While phobic anxiety is associated with both reduced vagal function in the short term after an ACS event and 2 year all cause readmission, HRV does not appear to be the pathway by which phobic anxiety drives this outcome.

329,Prediction of prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders in an outpatient setting: The Leiden routine outcome monitoring study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to improve clinical identification of patients with a prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders early in treatment. Method: We conducted a cohort study in 1.225 adult patients with a depressive or anxiety disorders in psychiatric specialty care setting between 2007 and 2011, with at least two Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) assessments within 6 months. With logistic regression, we modelled baseline age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, housing situation, employment status, psychiatric comorbidity and both baseline and 1st follow-up BSI scores to predict prolonged treatment course (&gt; 2 years). Based on the regression coefficients, we present an easy to use risk prediction score. Results: BSI at 1st follow-up proved to be a strong predictor for both depressive and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.17 (CI95% 1.73–2.74); OR = 2.52 (CI95% 1.86–3.23)). The final risk prediction score included BSI 1st follow-up and comorbid axis II disorder for depressive disorder, for anxiety disorders BSI 1st follow-up and age were included. For depressive disorders, for 28% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was 60% (sensitivity 0.38, specificity 0.81). For anxiety disorders, for 35% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was 52% (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.75). Conclusions: A high level of symptoms at 2–6 months of follow-up is a strong predictor for prolonged treatment course. This facilitates early identification of patients at risk of a prolonged course of treatment; in a relatively easy way by a self-assessed symptom severity.

330,Examining a training effect on the state anxiety response to an acute bout of exercise in low and high anxious individuals,"Background: An acute bout of exercise temporarily reduces state anxiety. The current study examined whether these benefits are greater for those with higher levels of anxiety, and whether these benefits are augmented with exercise training. Methods: Young adults were randomized to either a nine-week moderate-intensity exercise group or an inactive control group. We assessed changes in state anxiety in response to an acute bout of exercise each week. Results: State anxiety reductions following acute exercise increased in the exercise subgroup with high anxiety at baseline as training progressed ( p = .029). No training effects were observed for the exercise subgroup with low baseline anxiety ( p = .27). Limitations: A predominantly female sample, a single state anxiety measure post exercise and a non-exercise control group should be addressed in future research. Conclusions: The results support the use of regular physical activity as a method for managing state anxiety in young adults. In particular, regular physical activity may be especially beneficial for those experiencing higher levels of anxiety.

331,The long-term effect of bariatric surgery on depression and anxiety,"Background: No previous review has comprehensively assessed long-term changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms in bariatric surgery patients. This systematic review assessed the effects of bariatric surgery on long-term reductions (≥ 24 months) in anxiety and depressive symptom severity in morbidly obese (≥ 35 BMI kg/m²) participants. Short term effects (&lt; 24 months) are briefly reviewed for context. Methods: PsychINFO, Google Scholar and PubMed databases were systematically searched for prospective cohort studies published from inception to 14 June 2018 that evaluated long-term (≥ 24 months) changes in anxiety and depressive symptom severity in bariatric surgery patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² using a combination of the following search terms: bariatric surgery (and surgical approaches included under this term), obesity, depression, depressive disorder, anxiety, anxious, psychiatric disorders, mood disorders. Results: We reviewed 2058 articles for eligibility; 14 prospective studies were included in the systematic review. 13 studies (93%) reported significant reductions in depressive symptom severity 2–3 years after bariatric surgery. However, all studies recorded statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms at the conclusion of the study. Similarly, there were reductions in overall anxiety symptom severity at ≥ 24 months follow-up (k = 8 studies, n = 1590 pooled). Pre-operative anxiety or depression scores did not predict outcomes of postoperative BMI. Similarly, post-surgery weight loss did not predict changes in anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Very few studies assessed anxiety or depression as a primary outcome. Therefore, we cannot suggest bariatric surgery as a stand-alone therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression based on our findings. Conclusion: Currently available evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with long-term reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. This supports existing literature showing that metabolic treatments may be a viable therapeutic intervention for mood disorders.

In the original article, there were some errors in the Abstract section on page 82 and the Results section on page 85. The corrected texts are present in the erratum.] Background: Social network, loneliness, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression disorder (MDD) are interrelated. However, as the directions of these associations are still unclear, we examined them prospectively using community-based data. Methods: Data on 5066 adults aged ≥ 50 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed. Loneliness was assessed through the UCLA loneliness scale. Social integration was measured using the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index. MDD and GAD were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Logistic regression models were conducted. Results: The longitudinal association between experiencing loneliness and higher likelihood of suffering from MDD or GAD two years later is bidirectional but stronger with loneliness as origin, whereas the association between social isolation and higher likelihood of subsequent MDD or GAD as well as those between loneliness and subsequent deterioration of social integration are unidirectional. Conclusion: Objective and perceived social isolation independently affect the probability of suffering from MDD or GAD whereas loneliness is a risk factor for the deterioration of social life, which highlights the need to address the subjective factors (such as loneliness) and objective factors (such as social network size) of social isolation in a complementary way in order to improve the mental health of the older adult population.

333,Does bullying victimization really influence adolescents’ psychosocial problems? A three-wave longitudinal study in China,"Background: Traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization are associated with adolescents’ mental health problems, but the temporal sequence of these relations remains unclear. The present study analyzed the temporal and reciprocal relationships between both types of bullying victimization and six frequent psychosocial problems during adolescence: depression, general anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, social anxiety, and loneliness. Methods: A total of 661 Chinese adolescents in grades 7 and 8 at the initial wave of the study responded to the survey items assessing their bullying victimization experiences and self-reported psychosocial problems. This research was conducted at three separate time points, over a year and a half period. Results: Bullying victimization did not predict adolescents’ psychosocial problems. Instead, adolescents with psychosocial problems were more likely to experience bullying victimization. Depression and general anxiety were two common predictors of traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization. Stress was a specific predictor of traditional bullying victimization, whereas self-esteem, social anxiety, and loneliness were specific predictors of cyberbullying victimization. Psychosocial problems did not differentially predict the two types of bullying victimization. Boys with higher levels of loneliness were more likely than girls to experience cyber-bullying victimization. Limitations: The present study is limited in terms of its sample selection and self-reported instruments. Conclusions: This study emphasizes adolescents’ psychosocial problems as the potential risk factors for their future bullying victimization. Education professionals should pay special attention to adolescents’ mental health problems when formulating bullying interventions and programs.

334,Prevalence of anxiety disorder among older adults in Spain: A meta-analysis,"Background: Anxiety disorders are recognized as one of the most prevalent mental disorders in late-life. However, the prevalence of anxiety disorders in older Spanish people has not yet been determined. The aim was to review epidemiological studies systematically to calculate the overall prevalence of anxiety in Spanish older adults by using meta-analytic techniques. Methods: We searched relevant published studies in electronic databases up to January 2018 providing data on the prevalence of anxiety among people aged 65 + years in Spain. Overall anxiety prevalence estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by means of univariate meta-regressions. Results: A total of 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis ( N = 12,577). Pooled overall prevalence of anxiety was 11% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%–18%) representing 1958,471 people aged 65 + (95%CI: 1068,257–3204,771). Point, 12-month and lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders were 12%, 6% and 19%, respectively. Limitations: We detected a small publication bias effect for life-time prevalence of anxiety. The use of different diagnostic methods across the studies would have required separate analyzes. Conclusion: Some heterogeneity was found across studies, probably due to different methodological issues. Overall, the pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders in Spanish older adults was lower than that observed in other countries. Due to the negative consequences of anxiety disorders in older adults, detection and treatment should be a priority in this population.

335,Comorbid disorders as moderators of response to family interventions among adolescents with bipolar disorder,"Background: While family interventions have shown efficacy in improving mood symptoms and family functioning in pediatric bipolar disorder, few studies have examined the effects of comorbid psychiatric conditions on patients’ symptomatic or functional responses to treatment. Methods: 145 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder were randomly assigned to family-focused therapy (FFT-A) or a brief psychoeducational therapy (enhanced care; EC) and followed over 2 years. Participants received pharmacotherapy for the study's duration. We examined whether comorbid anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs; i.e., oppositional defiant and conduct disorder) predicted the proportion of weeks that participants experienced mood symptoms during follow-up, and whether comorbid disorders moderated the effects of treatment assignment on mood symptoms and family conflict. Results: Comorbid anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with depressive symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms during follow-up, and greater family conflict over the 2-year study. Comorbid ADHD was associated with a greater proportion of weeks with (hypo)manic symptoms, more severe (hypo)manic symptoms, and greater family conflict. Additionally, youth with comorbid ADHD who received FFT-A had more favorable trajectories of (hypo)manic symptoms and family functioning than youth with comorbid ADHD who received EC. Comorbid DBDs were consistently associated with more severe depressive symptoms and greater family conflict throughout the study. Limitations: Randomization to treatments was not stratified on comorbid disorders. The longitudinal trajectories of anxiety, attentional, and disruptive behavior symptoms were not examined. Conclusions: The course of bipolar disorder in adolescents is strongly affected by comorbid disorders. Future research should examine whether adolescents with more complex presentations of bipolar disorder should be treated with different or more intensive psychosocial protocols than adolescents without these presentations.

336,Spatial complexity of brain signal is altered in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Is it healthy to be chaotic? Recent studies have argued that mental disorders are associated with more orderly neural activities, corresponding to a less flexible functional system. These conclusions were derived from altered temporal complexity. However, the relationship between spatial complexity and health is unknown, although spatial configuration is of importance for normal brain function. Methods: Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we used Sample entropy (SampEn) to evaluate the altered spatial complexity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 47) compared to healthy controls (HCs; n = 38) and the relationship between spatial complexity and anxiety level. Results: Converging results showed increased spatial complexity in patients with GAD, indicating more chaotic spatial configuration. Interestingly, inverted-U relationship was revealed between spatial complexity and anxiety level, suggesting complex relationship between health and the chaos of human brain. Limitations: Anxiety-related alteration of spatial complexity should be verified at voxel level in a larger sample and compared with results of other indices to clarify the mechanism of spatial chaotic of anxiety. Conclusions: Altered spatial complexity in the brain of GAD patients mirrors inverted-U relationship between anxiety and behavioral performance, which may reflect an important characteristic of anxiety. These results indicate that SampEn is a good reflection of human health or trait mental characteristic.

337,Association of adult attachment and suicidal ideation in primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a common health concern in primary care. Attachment theory indicates that subjects with higher anxiety and/or avoidance may be more susceptible to suicidal ideation. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the association of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and suicidal ideation in middle-aged to elderly, chronically ill primary care patients. Methods: The APRICARE Study comprised 207 patients aged 50–85 years with a minimum of three chronic diseases. Adult attachment, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were measured via the self-report questionnaires Experiences in Close Relationships–Revised (ECR-RD12) and Patient Health Questionnaire—9 (PHQ-9). Univariable and adjusted associations of suicidal ideation with ECR-RD12-attachment anxiety, ECRRD12- attachment avoidance, and ECR-RD12-insecure adult attachment were examined via logistic regression analyses. Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 13% of all patients. ECR-RD12-anxiety was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.88, CI 1.44–2.44), while ECR-RD12-avoidance was not associated. In patients with suicidal ideation, 85% were insecurely attached compared to 63% in those without suicidal ideation—thus the OR for suicidal ideation in insecurely attached patients was 3.33 (CI = 1.10–10.04) with securely attached patients as reference. Further variables associated with suicidal ideation were depressive symptomatology, living alone (especially in men) and obesity (especially in women). Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and suicidal ideation was assessed using a single item self-report measure. Conclusion: General practitioners should be aware of attachment styles in order to have a better chance to identify patients at risk for suicide.

338,Effects of the neuropeptide S receptor gene on the mediating effect of somatization on the association between life-event scores and psychological distress,"Background: The mechanisms underlying the relationship between life events and psychological distress are unclear. However, evidence of genetic involvement, including the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1), exists. Methods: A total of 600 Chinese adults were enrolled in this cross-sectional study using random cluster sampling. Demographic information, measures of life events and psychiatric symptoms, and fasting blood samples were collected. Results: Significant correlations were observed among life-event scores, somatization, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Regression revealed life-event scores and somatization predicted anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress, while controlling for sex, age, income, education, and marital status. Structural equation modeling indicated that somatization mediated the association between life-event scores and psychological distress. Moreover, the mediating effect was influenced by the NPSR1 gene, suggesting that the NPSR1 polymorphisms rs324981, rs6947841, and rs6972158 influenced the association between life-event scores and somatization ( p s &lt; 0.05). The NPSR1 polymorphisms rs12673132 significantly affected the relationship of somatization with psychological distress ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: In conclusion, somatization mediated the association between life-event scores and psychological distress. The current study is the first to demonstrate this relationship with a Chinese sample, whereby the NPSR1 gene affects the mediating effect of somatization on the association between life-event scores and psychological distress.

339,What protects at-risk postpartum women from developing depressive and anxiety symptoms? The role of acceptance-focused processes and self-compassion,"Background: Not all women presenting risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) develop depressive symptoms. Research has shown that acceptance-focused processes (nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content, psychological flexibility) and self-compassion play an important protective role in the development of psychological symptoms. However, considering the perinatal period, little is known about what variables can modify the negative impact of risk. Methods: The sample consisted of 185 postpartum women at risk of developing PPD (Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised &gt; 5.5). Data were collected regarding depressive (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II), nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content (Postnatal Negative Thoughts Questionnaire) and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form). Results: Women not presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms reported significantly higher levels of psychological flexibility, nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content and self-compassion than women presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical logistic regression showed that women with higher levels of psychological flexibility (OR = 1.06, CI: 1.01–1.12) and nonjudgmental appraisal of thought content (OR = 1.33, CI: 1.15–1.53) had a significantly higher likelihood of not presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The limitations of this study were the cross-sectional design, the use of self-report questionnaires and the self-selected bias in recruitment. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the important role of acceptance-based processes, suggesting that at-risk women who are more accepting of their private events may be more protected from developing psychological symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider the promotion of these processes to improve women's adjustment to this period.

340,Impact of preoperative anxiety and depression on quality of life before and after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Objective: The impact of anxiety and depression symptoms (ADS) is often estimated in terms of clinical endpoints such as the risk of complications and probabilities of readmission and survival. The purpose of this study was to provide a benchmark for capturing the negative effects of ADS on quality of life after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgery and to provide an evidence base for future research and clinical interventions aimed at understanding and remediating these effects. Methods: This prospective study analyzed 410 HCC patients at three tertiary academic hospitals. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-H) were administered before HCC surgery and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after HCC surgery. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate differences-in-differences models for examining the effects of ADS. Results: At baseline, 9.0% of the participants had anxiety symptom (BAI &gt; 10), 17.1% had depression symptom (BDI &gt; 13), and 7.1% had ADS. Throughout the study period, anxiety and depression (differences-in-differences value) had significant ( P &lt; 0.001) negative net effects on mean scores for all FACT-H dimensions, and the differences gradually increased over time. From baseline through all follow-up years, the two groups significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) differed in scores for all FACT-H dimensions, and the differences increased over time. Conclusions: For healthcare providers, this study highlights the need for continued monitoring for ADS in patients who have undergone hepatic resection and the need for timely and appropriate psychological care for these patients.

341,Comparative validity and responsiveness of PHQ-ADS and other composite anxiety-depression measures,"Background: Composite measures that assess the overall burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms have been infrequently evaluated in the same study. The objective of this study was to compare the validity and responsiveness of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) and other composite anxiety-depression measures. Methods: The sample comprised 256 primary care patients enrolled in a telecare trial of chronic musculoskeletal pain and comorbid depression and/or anxiety. Measures included the PHQ-ADS; the 8-item and 4-item depression and anxiety scales from the PROMIS profiles; the PHQ-anxiety-depression scale (PHQ-4); the SF-36 Mental Health scale; and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale. Correlations among these measures and health-related quality of life measures were examined. Responsiveness was evaluated by standardized response means, area under the curve (AUC) analyses, and treatment effect sizes in the trial. Results: Convergent and construct validity was supported by strong correlations of the composite depression-anxiety measures with one another and moderate correlations with health-related quality of life measures, respectively. All composite measures differentiated patients who were better at 3 months, whereas the PHQ-ADS and PHQ-4 also distinguished the subgroup that had worsened. AUCs for composite measures were generally similar, whereas treatment effect sizes were largest for the PHQ-ADS. Limitations: The study sample was predominantly male veterans enrolled from primary care who had chronic musculoskeletal pain and moderate levels of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Composite depression and anxiety scales are valid and responsive measures that may be useful as outcomes in research and clinical practice.

342,The effect of a six-week focused meditation training on depression and anxiety symptoms in Brazilian university students with 6 and 12 months of follow-up,"Background: Evidence shows high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among university students. This study investigated whether a meditation-based program would help reducing these symptoms in this population. Methods: Non-randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a six-week focused meditation training on depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) outcomes among university students. Participants were allocated into a meditation or waiting list control group. Assessment occurred pre and post intervention and only for the meditation group at 6 and 12 months follow-up. General linear model for repeated measures evaluated the intervention effect considering group and time factors, controlling for minor psychiatric disorders, gender and absence at meetings. Results: The meditation group presented a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms after intervention compared to controls. Among the meditation group, depression (at 6 months follow-up) and anxiety (at 6 and 12 months follow-up) scores were lower for those who continued practicing. Limitations: Non-randomization and absence of daily practice record (precluding dose-response gradient evaluation). Conclusion: The meditation training was effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, but the maintenance of these reductions only occurred for those who continued meditating. Permanent meditation programs may be an alternative for promoting mental health for university students.

343,Promoting the well-being of mothers with multidisciplinary psychosocial interventions in the perinatal period,"Background: Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms are common and may persist over time after delivery, with negative consequences on the mothers and their children. Evidence on the efficacy of psychological and pharmacological interventions during pregnancy aimed at preventing post-partum depression is controversial. Methods: A consecutive sample of 318 women presenting for scheduled obstetric visits during pregnancy was screened for risk factors and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Based on the screening results, women were classified into three groups at increasing risk of post-partum depression (PPD) and were offered different interventions. Results: Depressive or anxiety symptoms were found in 91 (28.6%) women, 89 (28.0%) had low risk of PPD and 138 (43.4%) had no risk of PPD. The multidisciplinary psychosocial interventions offered to women with clinical symptoms were well accepted, with an uptake of 76/91 (83.5%). Thirty-three women who did not improve with psychotherapy were offered sertraline or paroxetine as a second-line treatment: 7 accepted and 26 (78.8%) refused. Eleven women already on medication at baseline continued their treatment along with the MPI. The MPI interventions had some positive effects in terms of post-partum recovery, symptom reduction, and in preventing a new onset of depression. Among the 227 non-symptomatic during pregnancy, only 5 (2.2%) developed symptoms in the post-partum period. At 12 months post-partum, 84.6% of women who were symptomatic at 2 months post-partum recovered. Limitations: Our results should be interpreted in light of important limitations, including the lack of a control group that was not offered the MPI, the lack of information on the reasons for refusal and discontinuation and on the number of psychotherapy sessions attended. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the potential usefulness of MPI in recognizing early signs or symptoms during pregnancy and the advantage of building specific interventions for preventing post-natal depression. The MPI has positive effects on women with depressive or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, that however did not exceed significantly those observed in women who refused the intervention. Thus, in the absence of a control group, our results are preliminary and warrant confirmation and testing in future randomized clinical trials.

344,"Time perspective differences between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, and their relationships with depressive and anxiety symptoms","Background: Time perspective (TP) can be described as an individual's attitude towards his personal past, present and future. Literature suggests that it plays a role in several areas of psychological functioning (self-efficacy, coping) and impacts actual thoughts and behaviors. However, TP has seldom been studied in mental health, despite previous studies suggesting that the temporal profile is altered in depressed patients. This study investigates the differences of TP between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, and its relationship with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: 45 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were compared to 43 non-depressed participants recruited in the general population. Participants were asked to answer time perspective (ZTPI), depression (BDI- 13) and anxiety (STAI-Y) self-report inventories. Statistical analysis included comparisons of scores between depressed patients and non-depressed participants, correlation and regression analysis. Results: Results indicate that TP is significantly altered in depressed patients. They display a more negative view of their past, a less hedonistic perspective towards their present, and a more fatalistic perspective when compared to non-depressed participants. Regression analysis shows that depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with negative past and fatalistic present , and similar results are found with correlation analysis. Limitations: The size of the sample was small, and longitudinal studies are needed to understand the dynamics and causal relationship between TP and depression. Conclusions: These results underline the importance of considering TP in depressed patients, and encourage an in depth study of the relationship between TP and mood disorders. Therapeutic perspectives are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2019
345,Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) in outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders and their association with psychiatric and somatic comorbidity and revictimization. Cross-sectional observational study,"Background: This study aims to establish prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) and their association with somatic comorbidity and adult adverse events (AAE) in outpatients with anxiety or depressive disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional observational design. Specialty mental health outpatients classified with DSM-IV-TR anxiety or depressive disorder filled-out the ACE-IQ and the AAE-IQ. T-tests, ANOVA, logistic regressions and Chi-square analyses were performed and stratified for ACE score ≥ 4(high) versus ACE &lt; 4(low). Gender differences were explored. Results: From May 2015 -November 2016, in 298 consecutive patients 77.2% reported at least one ACE, 58.7% reported multiple ACE (mean 2.92). Scores were highest in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and in case of comorbid mental disorders. Somatic comorbidity was not associated with ACE-scores. AAE scores were significantly ( t = −9.33, p &lt; .001) higher in the high ACE-group ( M = 4.09 SD = 2.42) versus the low-ACE group ( M = 1.63 SD = 1.70), indicating general revictimization. An association between sexual ACE and sexual revictimization was found as well ( χ ² = 86.14, p &lt; .001).The effects did not differ for males and females. Conclusions: ACE and AAE are highly prevalent in depressive and anxiety disorders PTSD and psychiatric comorbidity are associated with higher scores, somatic comorbidity is not. Indications for general and sexual revictimization are shown. Further research is needed. Limitations: Selection bias may have influenced results on somatic comorbidity, as patients with obvious somatic comorbidity usually get referred to other health services. The generalisability of the results may be limited as non-Dutch speaking immigrants were excluded.

346,The association between an anxiety disorder and cancer in medical history,"Background: Cancer patients can feel depression and anxiety any time after a cancer diagnosis. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is an instrument for the assessment of anxiety. The main objective of this work was to compare general anxiety levels between cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer in a population-based study (LIFE-ADULT) with 10,000 participants. Methods: All participants (18–80 years) completed the GAD-7 and other psychological and medical questionnaires. A score of 10 or greater for GAD-7 (of total 21) indicates a probable generalized anxiety disorder. Results: 954 participants reported a diagnosis of cancer in their medical history. In the multivariate analysis an anxiety disorder was associated with prior cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.8; 95% CI [1.4–2.4]), age -every additional year- (OR: 0.983; [0.976–0.991]), female gender (OR: 1.8; [1.5–2.2]) and low socioeconomic status (OR: 2.0; [1.7–2.5]) all p &lt; 0.001. There were no significant associations between general anxiety and other comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction (OR: 1.0; p = 0.948), stroke (OR: 1.4; p = 0.237) or diabetes (OR: 1.0; p = 0.326). There was also no significant difference in anxiety disorder among cancer survivors regarding the time passed since the initial cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.1; [0.6–1.9], p = 0.804 comparing 5–10 years after a diagnosis of cancer vs. ≤ 5 years and OR: 0.6; [0.4–1.1], p = 0.107 comparing &gt; 10 vs. ≤ 5 years). Limitations: This study has a cross-sectional character, therefore, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Conclusion: Cancer survivors may require screening for anxiety disorders and long-term professional psychosocial support.

347,An evaluation of the impact of co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorder on bipolar disorder illness outcomes in STEP-BD,"Background: Anxiety disorder (AD) and substance use disorder (SUD) highly co-occur with bipolar disorder (BD). AD and/or SUD co-occurrence is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in BD. However, respective associations between AD and/or SUD diagnoses and BD outcomes require clarification. Baseline data from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) were therefore utilized to investigate independent and simultaneous contributions of ADs and SUDs on clinical variables in BD. Methods: Two latent factors, “pathological anxiety” and “substance use problems,” were derived from presence/absence of lifetime AD and SUD diagnoses. Latent dimensions’ associations with clinical variables, obtained from the Affective Disorders Evaluation, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Range of Impaired Functioning, were estimated via structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: Modeled independently, pathological anxiety and substance use problems were significantly associated with several variables. Yet when modeled simultaneously, pathological anxiety's associations with functional impairment, past-year rapid cycling, and past-year %time spent anxious and depressed remained while most variables’ associations with substance use problems became non-significant. The only significant latent-factor interaction evidenced was for age of BD onset. Limitations: Analyses were limited to lifetime diagnoses and causality may not be inferred given cross-sectional data. Conclusions: ADs and SUDs impact on BD was mostly additive rather than synergistic. Findings highlight the potentially understated importance of treating inter-episodic anxiety in BD as it may exacerbate mood symptoms, increasing functional impairment and risk for subsequent mood episodes.

348,Neonatal isolation modulates glucocorticoid-receptor function and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal and amygdala neurons in a rat model of single prolonged stress,"Background: Early life and stressful experiences affect hippocampal and amygdala structure and function. They also increase the incidence of mental and nervous system disorders in adults. However, prospective studies have yet to show if early-life experiences affect the risk/severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: We applied neonatal isolation (NI) alone, single prolonged stress (SPS) alone and NI + SPS to rats. We evaluated anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory of behavior using open field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests. Then, we measured expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and synaptic-related proteins by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and western blotting in the hippocampus and amygdala. Results: NI + SPS exacerbated the increased anxiety levels and impaired spatial memory induced by NI alone or SPS alone. NI alone or SPS alone induced varying degrees of change in expression of GRs and synaptic proteins (synapsin I and postsynaptic density protein-95) in the hippocampus and amygdala. There were opposite changes in GR expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdala. The degree of such change was exacerbated considerably by NI + SPS. In addition, neuroligin (NLG)-1 and NLG-2 were distributed in postsynaptic sites of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. NI, SPS, and NI + SPS altered the patterns of NLG-1 and NLG-2 colocalization as well as their intensity. NI + SPS strengthened the increased ratio of NLG-1/NLG-2 in the hippocampus, but decreased this ratio in the amygdala. Conclusions: NI and SPS together induced greater degrees of change in anxiety and spatial memory, as well as GR and synaptic protein levels, in the hippocampus and amygdala than the changes induced by NI alone or SPS alone.

349,Response inhibition and anxiety in adolescents: Results from a population-based community sample,"Background: Anxiety disorders are prevalent among adolescents; however, without objective behavioral markers, anxiety disorders in adolescent populations may often go undiagnosed. Response inhibition is considered as a possible behavioral marker, based on the results with two-gate design, which can aid in early detection of anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety using a large-scale population-based adolescent sample with single-gate design. Methods: We used data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study which was a population-based survey in adolescence. Anxiety was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist answered by primary caregivers. Response inhibition was measured using the Go/No-Go task. We estimated Pearson's correlation coefficient to test the relationship between response inhibition and anxiety. Results: A total of 2,434 adolescents aged 11–13 years were included in our analyses. We found a significant but weak correlation between response inhibition and adolescent anxiety ( r = 0.07, confidence interval 0.03–0.11, p &lt; 0.001). Similar results were shown in most of subgroups according to gender, age, and intelligence. Limitations: The primary outcome was assessed only via parent-reported questionnaire, leading to potential informant bias. Conclusions: Response inhibition may not be considered as a suitable behavioral marker of adolescent anxiety.

350,Default mode network alterations in individuals with high-trait-anxiety: An EEG functional connectivity study,"Background: Although several researches investigated Default Mode Network (DMN) alterations in individuals with anxiety disorders, up to now no studies have investigated DMN functional connectivity in non-clinical individuals with high-trait-anxiety using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). Here, the main aim was to extend previous findings investigating the association between trait anxiety and DMN EEG functional connectivity. Methods: Twenty-three individuals with high-trait-anxiety and twenty-four controls were enrolled. EEG was recorded during 5 min of resting state (RS). EEG analyses were conducted by means of the exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software (eLORETA). Results: Compared to controls, individuals with high-trait-anxiety showed a decrease of theta connectivity between right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex. A decrease of beta connectivity was also observed between right mPFC and right anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, DMN functional connectivity strength was negatively related with STAI-T total score (i.e., lower connectivity was associated with higher trait anxiety), even when controlling for potential confounding variables (i.e., sex, age, and general psychopathology). Limitations: Small sample size makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Furthermore, we did not assess state variation of anxiety, which make our interpretation specific to trait anxiety. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that high-trait-anxiety individuals fail to synchronize DMN during RS, reflecting a possible top-down cognitive control deficit. These results may help in the understanding of the individual differences in functional brain networks associated with trait anxiety, a crucial aim in the prevention and in the early etiology understanding of clinical anxiety and related sequelae.

351,"Home-delivered attention bias modification training via smartphone to improve attention control in sub-clinical generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized, controlled multi-session experiment","Background: Mogg and Bradley (2016) proposed that attentional bias (to threat stimuli) among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be associated with the top-down attention control process. Additionally, some scholars (e.g., Enock &amp; McNally, 2013) have designed mobile applications to enable patients to engage in home-delivered attentional bias modification (HD-ABM); however, many problems related to these training systems have not yet been addressed. Method: A total of 82 participants (61 women, mean age = 21.47 y) who received GAD diagnoses were randomly assigned to an HD-ABM ( n = 30), placebo training ( n = 30), or waiting list ( n = 22) group. Both the HDABM and placebo groups were trained with the attention training application (through Android phones three times a day for four weeks). Results: (1) All measures of participants’ self-reported symptoms (except for trait anxiety) were significantly lower in Week 4 and in the follow-up. (2) Attentional network test (ANT) results demonstrated that all participants’ alerting scores significantly increased by Week 4. (3) Participants in the HD-ABM and placebo groups demonstrated significant increases in their self-reported attention control scores, decreases in their attention bias index (ABI) scores, and progress in their executive control abilities. Limitations: Self-report scales may have been insufficient for measuring effectiveness in the present study. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying changes in attention processes after HDABM training implemented through a mobile application in GAD.

352,Screening for depressive and anxiety disorders among adolescents in Indonesia: Formal validation of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale,"Background: This study aimed to culturally verify and examine the empirical psychometric properties of the Indonesian versions of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 items (K10) and a subset of 6 items of the K10, the K6 to detect depressive and anxiety disorders among older adolescents in Indonesia. Methods: The empirical psychometric properties were examined formally among students aged 16–18 years attending high schools in Jakarta. The scales were validated against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-Kid) modules for major depressive episode, dysthymia, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Results: In total, 196 students contributed complete data. All of the scales had Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.8. The areas under the ROC Curve of CESD-R against MINI depressive disorders and K10/K6 against MINI depressive and anxiety disorders were at moderate to high accuracy levels (0.78 to 0.86). The optimal cut-off value of CESD-R (scores ranging: 0–60) to screen for any depressive disorder is ≥ 20 (sensitivity 75.0%; specificity 79.9%). The optimal cut-off value of K10 to detect any depressive/anxiety disorders is ≥ 18 (sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 74.7%); and K6 is ≥ 12 (sensitivity 81.0%; specificity 76.6%); Limitations: The school-based sample limits the generalisability of the findings to this group. Conclusions: This study suggests that the CESD-R I is a useful tool for screening for depressive disorders and both the K10 I and K6 I are useful for screening for any depressive or anxiety disorders among Indonesian adolescents.

353,Comorbid anxiety in bipolar CHOICE: Insights from the bipolar inventory of symptoms scale,"Background: Approximately 86–89% of patients with BD have a comorbid anxiety disorder associated with poor quality of life and reduced likelihood of recovery from an acute mood episode. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and impact of comorbid anxiety using the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) in patients with BD who participated in a 6-month pragmatic trial. Methods: Participants ( N = 482) in the Bipolar Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness (CHOICE) study were adults with BD I or II. Anxiety diagnoses were assessed with the MINI. Global illness severity was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version. Mood symptoms and anxiety severity were assessed using the BISS. Results: 61% of the study sample met criteria for a current anxiety disorder. Patients with a higher BISS anxiety score at baseline had a higher overall BD illness severity, depressive severity, and manic episode severity ( p &lt; 0.001). A single cutoff value of BISS anxiety had great sensitivity, yet poor specificity for determining a comorbid anxiety diagnosis. There were no significant differences in outcomes for individuals treated for anxiety disorders with anxiolytics compared with those who were not treated with anxiolytics. Limitations: Sample size limitations prevented an analysis of whether the BISS cutoff score of 10 performed differently across varied anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Given its ability to identify patients with co-occurring anxiety, the BISS anxiety subscale shows clinical utility as a screening measure though its application as a clinical assessment measure may not be advisable.

354,A randomised placebo controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Caralluma fimbriata&lt;/i&gt; supplement for reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults over eight weeks,"Background: This study investigated the efficacy of a succulent, Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) in reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults. Methods: An 8 week double-blind randomised clinical trial, in which 97 adults self-reporting mild to moderate anxiety were given 500 mg b.d. CFE ( n = 49), or 500 mg b.d. placebo ( n = 48). Anxiety and stress were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8 to investigate the timing of treatment effect using the GAD-7, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and salivary cortisol. Data were analysed using mixed ANOVAs on SPSS v.24. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in anxiety and stress in both groups at week 4 and week 8. The reduction in the CFE group was significantly greater ( p &lt; .05) than in the placebo group on the GAD-7 and PSS at week 4 and week 8, and in Negative affect at week 4. Improvement in Positive affect was greater in the CFE group than in the placebo group at week 8. Cortisol analysis indicated that CFE may act through the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, showing statistically significant changes in males, but not in females. Limitations: Self-reported instruments involve subjective interpretation thus salivary cortisol was employed as a more objective measure. The study would benefit from a larger sample and longer trial, and the inclusion of a wait-list group to allow comparison between treatment and no treatment. Conclusions: The findings indicate that CFE is superior to placebo in reducing subclinical anxiety and stress over 8 weeks.

355,Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) accuracy for anxiety disorders detection in drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients,"Background: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is the most prevalent type of surgically remediable epilepsy and highly associated with psychiatric comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate Hospital anxiety and depression scale-anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—Trait subscale (STAI-T) accuracy for detection of anxiety disorders in patients with drug-resistant MTLE-HS. Methods: One hundred three consecutive patients with drug-resistant MTLE-HS were enrolled. Diagnosis was based on the anamnesis, neurological examination, video-electroencephalogram (VEEG) analyses, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Psychiatric interviews were based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and ILAE Commission of Psychobiology classification as a gold standard; HADS-A and STAI-T were used as psychometric diagnostic tests, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal threshold scores. Results: The areas under the curve (AUCs) were higher than 0.7 (0.6–0.8) for both scales. The STAI-T cutoff point of &gt;53 and the HADS-A cutoff point of &gt;7 showed both around of 80% (44.4–97.7) sensitivity and 80% (66.9–86.9) and 60% (46.5–68.6) of specificity, respectively. In this sample the prevalence of anxiety disorders was 11.7% and both scales showed a high negative predictive value such as 96% (87.1–99.0) but low positive predictive value such as 30% (22.1–45.2) and 20% (15.0–27.2) respectively. Limitations: The small number of cases in the diagnostic population; the results are only applied to drug resistant MTLE-HS; the psychiatric diagnosis were not based on a structured psychiatric interview; possible observer bias in 7 illiterate patients; the antidepressant treatment was not controlled. Conclusions: In MTLE-HS, STAI-T and HADS-A had a similar and low positive predictive value and high negative predictive value. The implications for the HADS-A and STAI-T usefulness for anxiety disorders screening in patients with other epilepsies types deserve further investigations. If replicated in other populations, these findings may have important relevance for the presurgical screening of anxiety disorders in MTLE-HS patients who are candidates to epilepsy surgery.

356,Dynamic functional abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorders and their increased network segregation of a hyperarousal brain state modulated by insomnia,"Background: Insomnia is frequently accompanied by the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) but mostly fMRI studies investigated their aberrant functional connectivity (FC) without this issue. Recently, dynamic FC approach is prevailing to capture the time-varying fluctuations of spontaneous brain activities. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the dynamic FC characteristics are altered by insomnia in GAD. Methods: We acquired resting state fMRI and neuropsychological tests for the 17 comorbid GAD with insomnia (GAD/IS), 15 GAD and 24 healthy controls (HC). Then, based on the sliding window correlations, we estimated distinct brain states and statistically compared their dynamic properties. Further combining with graph theory, their network properties of each state among groups were accessed. Lastly, we examined associations between abnormal parameters and neuropsychological tests. Results: We identified four brain states but did not observe significance on the state transitions. The mean dwell time and fraction of one globally hypoactive state accounted for high proportion of brain activities were significantly different (GAD &gt; HC &gt; GAD/IS). Meanwhile, we found gradual decreases in a brain state representing slight sleep/drowsiness (HC &gt; GAD/IS &gt; GAD). Additionally, we observed the GAD/IS patients had significantly increased network segregation and posterior cingulate cortex in a hyperarousal state, as well as significant associations with anxiety and insomnia severity. Limitations: The influences of depression on dynamic FC properties in GAD are unclear yet and more subjects should be recruited. Conclusions: These results provide new insights about the temporal features in GAD and offer potential biomarkers to evaluate the impacts of insomnia.

357,The effectiveness of four empirically supported psychotherapies for primary care depression and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and detrimental in primary care settings. However, there are gaps in the literature concerning effectiveness and generalizability of empirically supported interventions and treatment of both depression and anxiety in primary care settings. The aim of this review is to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effectiveness of brief empirically-supported psychotherapies for treating depression and/or anxiety in primary care. Methods: Seven electronic databases, five professional websites and manual search of reference lists were searched through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of four psychotherapies treating primary care depression and anxiety: cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), problem-solving therapy (PST), motivational interviewing (MI), and solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT). Results: From an initial pool of 1140 articles, 179 articles were eligible for full-text review and 65 articles were included for final analysis. Sixty-five articles containing 198 effect sizes reported an overall treatment effect size of d = 0.462, p &lt; 0.001. Single-predictor meta-regression indicated that marital status, treatment modality (individual versus group), and treatment composition were significant moderators. Multiple-predictor meta-regression discovered treatment setting (inside versus outside primary care) significantly moderated treatment effect, b = −0.863, p = 0.039 after controlling for other intervention characteristics. Conclusion: Treatment effects were found for CBT and PST, both for depressive and anxiety disorders. Interventions delivered outside primary care settings were more effective than those within, individual treatment had greater treatment effects compared to group treatment, and both technology-assisted and in-person treatments were found to be effective.

358,"Prospective associations of androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin with 12-month, lifetime and incident anxiety and depressive disorders in men and women from the general population","Background: Findings on associations of androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with anxiety and depressive disorders in the general population remain inconclusive. Methods: We used data of n = 993 men and n = 980 women from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP, a prospective-longitudinal general population study from northeastern Germany). Immunoassay-measured serum concentrations of total testosterone, androstenedione and SHBG were assessed when participants were aged 20–80. 12-month, lifetime and incident DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed with the DIA-X/M-CIDI at 10-year follow-up, when participants were aged 29–89. Logistic regressions were adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, waist circumference, hypertension and oral contraceptive use (women only) at baseline and follow-up interval. Results: In men and women, androgens and SHBG were not associated significantly with incident anxiety and depressive disorders. In men, higher total testosterone predicted any 12-month (OR = 1.46) and lifetime (OR = 1.34) anxiety disorder, lifetime social phobia (OR = 2.15), and 12-month (OR = 1.48) and lifetime (OR = 1.39) specific phobia, but neither 12-month nor lifetime depression. Moreover, androstenedione in men interacted with age in predicting lifetime anxiety disorders (OR = 0.98): Higher androstenedione more strongly predicted lifetime anxiety in younger vs. older men. These findings, however, did not survive correction for multiple testing. In women, androgens and SHBG were not associated significantly with 12-month and lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders. Limitations: The follow-up period was relatively long and other factors might have affected the examined associations. Conclusions: Higher serum total testosterone in men and androstenedione in younger men may relate to an increased risk of anxiety disorders.

359,The relationship of anxious and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease with voxel-based neuroanatomical and functional connectivity measures,"Background: Anxiety and depression are two frequent comorbidities of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying neural mechanism is still unclear and the studies on their neural correlates were insufficient. Methods: Using voxel-based neuroanatomical and functional connectivity (FC) measures, i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, and weighted degree centrality (WD), we examined their correlations with the severity levels of anxious and depressive symptoms in 36 PD patients. Results: Positive correlations were shown between anxiety and the WDs in the left amygdala, and between depression and short-ranged WDs in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Using these two regions as the seeds, we found that the severity levels of anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the FCs between the two seeds and the areas in the default mode network (DMN), while negatively correlated with the FCs between the two seeds and the prefrontal and superior temporal cortices. Anxiety was also positively correlated with the FC between the amygdala and the superior parietal lobule. Limitations: The severity levels of anxious and depressive symptoms of our participants is relatively mild than some previous studies. The cross-sectional design of this study cannot clarify the etiological relationship between PD and two comorbidities. Conclusions: Our results were in line with the key roles of the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in anxiety and depression, and reflected the distinct effects of the DMN, prefrontal and superior temporal cortices, and sensory-motor regions on emotional regulation. The identification of these neural substrates might assist clinical monitoring mood disturbances in PD.

360,Association of generalized anxiety symptoms and panic with health care costs in older age—Results from the ESTHER cohort study,"Background: Little is known specifically about the association between generalized anxiety symptoms or panic and health care costs in older age. The aim of this study was to examine the association between generalized anxiety symptoms, panic and health care costs in people aged 65 and over. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 8-year follow-up of a large, prospective cohort study, the ESTHER study, was used. Individuals aged 65 and over, who participated in the study's home assessment, were included in this analysis ( n = 2348). Total and sectoral costs were analyzed as a function of either anxiety symptoms, probable panic disorder, or a panic attack, while controlling for selected covariates, using Two Part and Generalized Linear Models. Covariates were chosen based on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Care Use. Results: There was no significant association between either of the anxiety or panic measures and total health care costs. Stratified by health care sectors, only the occurrence of a panic attack was significantly associated with incurring costs for outpatient non-physician services (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.15–3.45) and inpatient services (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.07–4.28). Other illness-related factors, such as comorbidities and depressive symptoms, were associated with health care costs in several models. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported data. Conclusion: This study points to an association between a panic attack and sector-specific health care costs in people aged 65 and over. Further research, especially using longitudinal data, is needed.

361,The efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy in somatoform disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to update and give an overview of the evidence from published literature that focused on the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in the management of somatoform disorders and medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was carried out through an electronic search of various databases on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Primary outcome was the severity of somatic symptoms. Secondary outcomes were also measured based on severity of anxiety symptoms, severity of depressive symptoms, social functioning, physical functioning, doctor visits and the compliance with CBT, as well as follow-up visits. Effects were summarized by a random effects model using mean differences or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 15 RCTs comprising 1671 patients with somatoform disorders or MUPS were enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT could alleviate somatic symptoms: −1.31 (95% CI: −2.23 to −0.39, p = 0.005); anxiety symptoms: -1.89 (95% CI: −2.91 to −0.86; p &lt; 0.001); depressive symptoms: −1.93 (95% CI: −3.56 to −0.31; p = 0.020); improve physical functioning: 4.19 (95% CI: 1.90 to 6.49; p &lt; 0.001). The efficacy of CBT on alleviating somatic symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms were sustained on follow-up. CBT may not be effective in reducing the number of doctor visits: −1.23 (95% CI: −2.97 to 0.51; p = 0.166); and improving social functioning: 3.27 (95% CI: −0.08 to 6.63; p = 0.056). The results of subgroup analysis indicated that CBT was particularly beneficial when the duration of session was more than 50 min to reduce the severity of somatic symptoms from pre to post treatment time, when it was group based and applied affective and developed good interpersonal strategy during the treatment. Longer duration and frequency such as more than 10 sessions and 12 weeks treatments had significant effect on reduction of the comorbid symptoms including depression and anxiety, but they may underpin low level of compliance of CBT based treatments. Conclusions: CBT is effective for the treatment of somatoform disorders and MUPS by reducing physical symptoms, psychological distress and disability.

362,Effect of &lt;i&gt;bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia: A proof-of-concept study,"Background: Studies of probiotics have suggested they have a positive effect on anxiety and depressive symptoms in humans. This study investigated the effect of consuming the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and explored its effect on immune products such as cytokines and chemokines. Methods: In this open-label single-arm study, all participants received B. breve strain A-1 (10¹¹ cfu/day) for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of observation. The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score. Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), blood test findings, and fecal microbiome composition. Results: Twenty-nine outpatients completed the study. HADS total score and PANSS anxiety/depression score were significantly improved at 4 weeks. Based on the criterion of a greater than 25% reduction in HADS total score at 4 weeks from baseline, there were 12 responders and 17 non-responders. Responders were found to have fewer negative symptoms, reduced intake of dairy products, and higher relative abundance of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome than non-responders. Moreover, IL-22 and TRANCE expression was significantly increased at 4 weeks from baseline in responders but not in non-responders. Limitations: This open-label, single-arm study cannot exclude a placebo effect. Conclusions: The results suggest the potential effect of B. breve A-1 in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Further studies should investigate this effect in patients with other psychiatric conditions and assess dietary habits and the gut microbiome.

363,Are children with social anxiety disorder more likely than children with other anxiety disorders to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on their performance?,"Background: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of studies with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD. Methods: Children (7–12 years) diagnosed with SAD ( n = 40), other anxious children ( n = 40) and non-anxious children ( n = 34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and their pre- and post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account objective performance ratings. Results: Although observers rated some aspects of performance as significantly worse among children with SAD than children with other anxiety disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their anxious or non-anxious peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance appraisals. Furthermore, children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious and non-anxious peers to recognize good performance but were more critical of themselves when their performance was poor. Limitations: The speech task did not involve a same-age peer. Participants were relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. Specificity for SAD in relation to other anxiety disorders remains unclear. Conclusions: Focusing on counteracting pre- and post-event social performance appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for childhood SAD. Children with SAD might benefit from interventions that focus on helping them to become less critical of themselves after social interactions have not gone well.

364,Diagnostic consequences of a new category of anxious depression and a reduced duration requirement for anxiety symptoms in the ICD-11 PHC,"Background: A new diagnosis of anxious depression (AD), characterized by both depressive and anxious symptoms at case level, has been proposed for the classification of mental disorders for primary care for ICD-11 (ICD-11 PHC). The ICD-11 PHC proposes a duration requirement for anxiety symptoms of 2 weeks, in line with the requirement for depressive symptoms. This study examined diagnostic assignment under ICD-11 PHC as compared to the previous classification, the ICD-10 PHC, and the relationship of anxiety duration to disability and suicidal ideation. Methods: Primary care physicians in five countries referred patients based on either perceived psychological distress or distressing somatic symptoms to a research assistant who administered a computer-guided diagnostic interview. Complete data were obtained for 2279 participants. Results: Under ICD-11 PHC 47.7% participants received a diagnosis of AD and had greater disability than other diagnostic groups. Under ICD-10 PHC, in addition to meeting requirements for depressive episode, most of these patients met requirements for either generalized anxiety disorder (41.5%) or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (45.4%). One third of individuals diagnosed with AD had anxiety durations between 2 weeks and 3 months and presented as much disability and suicidal ideation as individuals with longer anxiety durations. Limitations: The study was not designed to establish prevalence of these conditions. Conclusion: The proposed ICD-11 PHC encourages early identification and management of significant anxiety symptoms in primary care, particularly when these co-occur with depression. This study provides support for the clinical relevance of these symptoms and the importance of early identification.

365,"The relationships between health anxiety, online health information seeking, and cyberchondria: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Cyberchondria refers to an abnormal behavioral pattern in which excessive or repeated online searches for health-related information are distressing or anxiety-provoking. Health anxiety has been found to be associated with both online health information seeking and cyberchondria. The aims of the present systematic review and meta-analysis were to examine the magnitude of these associations and identify any moderator variables. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed across several databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase) and reference lists of included studies. Results: Twenty studies were included across two independent meta-analyses, with 7373 participants. Random effects meta-analyses showed that there was a positive correlation between health anxiety and online health information seeking [ r = 0.34, 95% CI (0.20, 0.48), p &lt; .0001], and between health anxiety and cyberchondria [ r = 0.62, 95% CI (0.52, 0.71), p &lt; .0001]. A meta-regression indicated that the age of study participants [ Q (1) = 4.58, p = .03] was partly responsible for the heterogeneity found for the relationship between health anxiety and cyberchondria. Limitations: The generalizability and validity of our findings are restricted by the methodological limitations of the primary studies, namely, an over-reliance on a single measure of cyberchondria, the Cyberchondria Severity Scale. Conclusions: Our review found a positive correlation between health anxiety and online health information seeking, and between health anxiety and cyberchondria. Further research should aim to explore the contexts for these associations as well as address the identified limitations of the extant literature.

366,Concordance of genetic variation that increases risk for anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorders and that influences their underlying neurocircuitry,"Background: There have been considerable recent advances in understanding the genetic architecture of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as the underlying neurocircuitry of these disorders. However, there is little work on the concordance of genetic variations that increase risk for these conditions, and that influence subcortical brain structures. We undertook a genome-wide investigation of the overlap between the genetic influences from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on volumes of subcortical brain structures and genetic risk for anxiety disorders and PTSD. Method: We obtained summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of anxiety disorders (N cases = 7016, N controls = 14,745), PTSD (European sample; N cases = 2424, N controls = 7113) and of subcortical brain structures (N = 13,171). SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Score Regression were used to examine genetic pleiotropy, concordance, and genome-wide correlations respectively. SECAs conditional false discovery was used to identify specific risk variants associated with anxiety disorders or PTSD when conditioning on brain related traits. Results: For anxiety disorders, we found evidence of significant concordance between increased anxiety risk variants and variants associated with smaller amygdala volume. Further, by conditioning on brain volume GWAS, we identified novel variants that associate with smaller brain volumes and increase risk for disorders: rs56242606 was found to increase risk for anxiety disorders, while two variants (rs6470292 and rs683250) increase risk for PTSD, when conditioning on the GWAS of putamen volume. Limitations: Despite using the largest available GWAS summary statistics, the analyses were limited by sample size. Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that there is genome wide concordance between genetic risk factors for anxiety disorders and those for smaller amygdala volume, which is consistent with research that supports the involvement of the amygdala in anxiety disorders. It is notable that a genetic variant that contributes to both reduced putamen volume and PTSD plays a key role in the glutamatergic system. Further work with GWAS summary statistics from larger samples, and a more extensive look at the genetics underlying brain circuits, is needed to fully delineate the genetic architecture of these disorders and their underlying neurocircuitry.

368,Acute effects of aerobic exercise on negative affect and obsessions and compulsions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: The acute effects of aerobic exercise on improved mood and anxiety reduction have been demonstrated across clinical and nonclinical populations. Limited work has evaluated the acute effects of aerobic exercise on negative affect, obsessions, and compulsions in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Method: Fifty-five patients (64% female) with treatment-resistant OCD were randomized to either 12 weeks of aerobic exercise (AE) or health education contact (HEC) control. Participants rated negative affect (i.e., mood and anxiety), obsessions and compulsions before and after each weekly AE or HEC session. Multilevel models were constructed to evaluate the effect of intervention condition, treatment week (time), and their interaction in terms of acute change in affect, obsession, and compulsions. Results: Results reflected a main effect of condition, such that AE resulted in significantly larger increases in positive mood, and reductions in anxiety and compulsions, as compared to HEC. There was also a main effect of time in predicting acute anxiety reduction, such that linear reductions in anxiety over the course of treatment were observed. No significant effects were observed for acute changes in obsessions. Limitations: The sample was small and was limited in demographic heterogeneity. Bouts of aerobic exercise were not standardized in terms of duration and mode, which could impact affective response to exercise, and acute affective OCD effects were exclusively self-reported. Discussion: The current findings may help elucidate potential mechanisms of action of exercise on OCD outcomes. In addition, these results point toward the potential of designing exercise interventions that can teach patients to utilize individual bouts of physical activity, “in-the-moment” to improve mood and reduce anxiety and compulsions.

369,The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health interventions for depression and anxiety in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose: Psychological interventions are labor-intensive and expensive, but e-health interventions may support them in primary care. In this study, we systematically reviewed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in primary care. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane library, Embase, and PsychINFO until January 2018, for randomized controlled trials of e-health interventions for depression or anxiety in primary care. Two reviewers independently screened the identified publications, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Results: Out of 3617 publications, we included 14 that compared 33 treatments in 4183 participants. Overall, the methodological quality was poor to fair. The pooled effect size of e-health interventions was small (standardized mean difference = −0.19, 95%CI −0.31 to −0.06) for depression compared to control groups in the short-term, but this was maintained in the long-term (standardized mean difference = −0.22, 95%CI −0.35 to −0.09). Further analysis showed that e-health for depression had a small effect compared to care as usual and a moderate effect compared to waiting lists. One trial on anxiety showed no significant results. Four trials reported on cost-effectiveness. Limitations: The trials studied different types of e-health interventions and had several risks of bias. Moreover, only one study was included for anxiety. Conclusions: E-health interventions for depression have a small effect in primary care, with a moderate effect compared to waiting lists. The approach also appeared to be cost-effective for depression. However, we found no evidence for its effectiveness for anxiety.

Therefore, depressive episodes with suicidal ideation could be different from depressive episodes without suicidal ideation in terms of latent variable structures. Methods: In this study we compared latent variable structures between suicidal and non-suicidal depressed patients using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), following a measurement invariance test procedure. Patients ( N = 919) suffering from major depressive disorder were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and split into a group that showed no symptoms of suicidal ideation (non-SI; N = 691) and a suicidal ideation (SI) group that had one or more symptoms of suicidal ideation ( N = 228). Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the short form of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ-D30). Results: CFA implied a difference in latent variable structures between the non-SI sample (CFI 0.957; RMSEA 0.041) and the SI sample (CFI 0.900; RMSEA 0.056). Subsequent multiple-group CFA showed violations of measurement invariance. The General distress and Anhedonic depression subscales were best indicated by hopelessness and lack of optimism in the SI sample and by dissatisfaction and not feeling lively in the non-SI sample. Overall, the SI sample had higher scores and lower inter-item correlations on the Anhedonic depression items. Limitations: We have included very mild cases of suicidal ideation in our SI sample. Conclusions: On a latent variable level, depression with suicidal ideation differs from depression without suicidal ideation. Results encourage further research into the symptom structure of depression among suicidal patients.

371,Negative peer social interactions and oxytocin levels linked to suicidal ideation in anxious youth,"Background: Anxious youth are at risk for negative peer interactions including peer victimization, and for suicidal ideation. However, data about the pattern of association between these two factors are scarce. In this study we examined the association between negative peer interactions and suicidal ideation in a sample of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, and whether oxytocin, which has been shown to enhance the impact of social events, moderates the impact of negative peer interactions on suicidal ideation. Method: Participants were 168 youths with primary anxiety disorders. All participants were assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and with self-report measures of suicidal ideation, negative peer interactions, anxiety, and depression. The anxious youths’ salivary oxytocin levels were measured with immunoassay. Results: Thirty percent of the anxious youths reported suicidal ideation, with suicidal ideation severity associated with negative peer social interactions and depressive symptoms. Consistent with past data indicating that oxytocin enhances the impact of social events, the association between peer negative social interactions and suicidal ideation was stronger in youths with high oxytocin levels than in youths with low levels (i.e., moderation). Limitations: Assessment focused on suicidal ideation and data on suicidal behavior were not available. Limitations inherent to immunoassay measurement of peripheral oxytocin levels are noted. Conclusion: Negative peer interactions are associated with suicidal ideation in youth with anxiety disorders, and the association is stronger in youth with high oxytocin levels.

372,The effect of complementary medicines and therapies on maternal anxiety and depression in pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Depression and anxiety are common during the antenatal and postnatal period, and are known to have a significant impact on the woman and her unborn infant. Pregnant women state a preference for non-pharmacological treatment options, and use complementary medicines and therapies to manage these symptoms. We examined the effectiveness and safety of these modalities on depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing complementary therapies and medicines to a control, for pregnant women with depression or anxiety. The primary outcome measure was antenatal depression or anxiety. Results: Twenty randomised controlled trials containing 1092 women were included in the review. We found some evidence of reduced antenatal depression from three modalities. Acupuncture reduced the number of women diagnosed with antenatal depression (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.06–2.66, 1 trial). Massage reduced the severity of antenatal depression in one trial of 149 women (SMD −0.73, 95%CI −1.07–−0.39). One small trial of bright light therapy found reduced antenatal depression (RR 4.80, 95% CI −8.39–−1.21, 27 women). There was no evidence of a reduction in depression and anxiety from relaxation, yoga, mindfulness and fish oils. Overall the risk of bias was high or unclear for the majority of studies. Limitations: There are few high quality randomised controlled trials of complementary medicines and therapies examining the effect on anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Acupuncture, bright light therapy, and massage may reduce antenatal depression. There is a need for high quality and larger studies that include postnatal follow up and maternal and neonatal outcomes.

373,Anxiety and anhedonia in depression: Associations with neuroticism and cognitive control,"Background: Despite the fact that higher levels of anxiety and anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are linked to poorer treatment outcomes, mechanisms contributing to these clinical presentations remain unclear. Neuroticism, impaired cognitive control, and blunted reward learning may be critical processes involved in MDD and may help to explain symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. Methods: Using baseline data from patients with early-onset MDD ( N = 296) in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial, we conducted a path analysis to model relationships between neuroticism, cognitive control, and reward learning to levels of anxiety and anhedonia. Results: Neuroticism was positively associated with both anhedonia (standardized coefficient = 0.26, p &lt; .001) and anxiety (standardized coefficient = 0.40, p &lt; .001). Cognitive control was negatively associated with anxiety (standardized coefficient = -0.18, p &lt; .05). Reward learning was not significantly associated with either anxiety or anhedonia. Limitations: Extraneous variables not included in the model may have even more influence in explaining symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia. Restricted range in these variables may have attenuated some of the hypothesized relationships. Most important, because this was a cross-sectional analysis in a currently depressed sample, we cannot draw any causal conclusions without experimental and longitudinal data. Conclusions: These cross-sectional findings suggest that neuroticism may contribute to anxiety and anhedonia in patients with early onset and either chronic or recurrent MDD, while enhanced cognitive control may protect against anxiety.

374,"The synergic relationship of social anxiety, depressive symptoms and waist circumference in adolescents: Mediation analysis","Background: It is not well established whether depression leads to weight loss or weight gain, or whether a relationship exists among depression, social anxiety, and weight status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the synergic association among social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and waist circumference (WC) during adolescence and examine whether depression mediated the relationship between social anxiety and WC. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with 1296 adolescents from a northeastern district in Brazil. It was used the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) to evaluate symptoms of social anxiety and the Depression Scale of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) for symptoms of depression. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether depression, social anxiety, and WC were synergically associated. Analysis was adjusted for sex, age, height, and mother's educational level. Results: Symptoms of social anxiety were directly associated with symptoms of depression and WC, whereas symptoms of depression were not associated with WC. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study, and so we cannot infer causality in the interpretation of results. Conclusion: Social anxiety was found to be associated with depressive symptoms and WC. General medical doctors and health practitioners who observe overweight adolescents with any symptoms of anxiety might consider a thorough evaluation of the patient's mental health.

375,Validation of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS) and RCADS short forms adapted for adults,"Background: The life span nature of anxiety and depression has led to an interest in whether assessments designed for use with children and young people are also valid for adults. The Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS) is a commonly used measure and we aimed to explore its structural validity in adults. Methods: We examined the factorial validity of the original and two short form versions of the (RCADS) adapted for adults, using confirmatory factor analysis with a convenience sample ( n = 371) aged 18–67. Results: All versions of the RCADS were found to provide reliable measures of general anxiety and depression in adults and of most subdimensions of anxiety corresponding to the original version of the RCADS. However, anxiety subdimension reliability was primarily driven by the strong general anxiety dimension, due to the high comorbidity between anxiety subtypes. Limitations: We did not include data for children as well as adults in our analyses and small changes were made to the wording of five RCADS items to make them appropriate for adults. Conclusions: Results suggest that all versions could be helpful for longitudinal and comparative research and evaluation of clinical outcomes, in situations where the focus is on general anxiety and depression, rather than clinical subtypes.

376,Prevalence of common mental disorders in widowhood: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Widowed people have a high risk of common mental disorders, however no summary estimates of the prevalences exist. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of common mental disorders in widowed people in the community. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched for papers reporting on prevalence of common mental disorders and widowhood. Eligible studies were included in random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. Subgroup analyses were performed on method of assessment of depression and age and sex. Results: The literature search identified 13,781 titles of which 42 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in studies using a screening scale was 40.6% (33.6%–47.6%) ( n = 30). For studies using full diagnostic criteria the pooled prevalence of depression was 19.2% (13.4%–25.0%) ( n = 12). Subgroup analyses of age (≥ or &lt; 65) and sex did not show any differences regarding depression. Five studies reported the prevalence of anxiety disorders. The pooled prevalence estimate was 26.9% (8.1%–45.7%). Limitations: The prevalence estimates in this study are summary estimates of prevalences from existing literature. Although the reporting bias assessment showed no evidence, there could be some reporting bias, as studies might only present results if there is a high prevalence. Conclusions: Widowed people have a high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. The high prevalence of depression was independent of age and sex. The study identifies a population group at high risk needing special attention in clinical practice.

377,Correlation between depression/anxiety symptom severity and quality of life in patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder,"Objective: To study the correlation between depression/anxiety severity and the quality of life (QOL) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: Two hundred forty-three outpatients diagnosed with MDD or BP were used to study the relationship between depression/anxiety severity and QOL. Depression and anxiety symptom-severity were measured with the QIDS-16-SR (the 16 Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology —Self Report), and Zung-SAS (Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale). The QOL was measured with the Q-LES-Q short-form (the Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire). Correlation was assessed with regression analysis. Results: The percentage of maximum possible scores (MPS) of Q-LES-Q was 72.1%, 70.5%, and 67.6% for euthymic MDD, BPI, and BPII, respectively. Increases in QIDS-16-SR total scores significantly correlated to decreases in Q-LES-Q total scores, with an R ² = 0.61, R ² = 0.52, and R ² = 0.45 for MDD, BPI, and BPII, respectively. Increases in Zung-SAS scores also significantly correlated to decreases in Q-LES-Q total scores with an R ² = 0.20, R ² = 0.21, and R ² = 0.12 for MDD, BPI, and BPII. However, after controlling for depression severity, significant differences between Q-LES-Q and Zung-SAS scores disappeared in MDD and BP. After controlling for anxiety and other clinical variables, the negative correlation between QIDS-16-SR and Q-LES-Q scores remained significant in MDD and BP. Conclusions: In this outpatient sample, the MPS of Q-LES-Q in euthymic MDD and BP patients was at the lower end of non-psychiatric or medical community norm spectrum. Depression severity was the only independent variable negatively correlated to the QOL in both disorders.

378,Relations between trait anxiety and depression: A mediated moderation model,"Background: This study proposed a mediated moderation model based on the cognitive theory and susceptibility phenotype theory for depression to explore the moderating role of cognitive flexibility in the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and the mediating role of rumination in this interactive effect. Methods: The subjects were selected via the cluster sampling method. A cross-sectional survey of 1619 Chinese adults of Han nationality was recruited from three cities in central and western China. The trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait scale), Short Ruminative Response Scale (SRRS), Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used for a paper-and-pencil evaluation. The data were statistically processed using correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and a test of mediated moderation. Results: (1) Trait anxiety was significantly positively correlated with rumination and depression. There was a significant negative correlation between cognitive flexibility and trait anxiety, rumination, and depression. (2) The moderating effect of cognition flexibility on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression was mediated by rumination, and the indirect moderating effect accounted for 79.25% of the total variance. Limitations: Cross-sectional studies do not reveal the causal relationships between observed variables well. Self-report questionnaires lack objective indicators. The applicability of the current results in the clinical depression population requires further experimental tests. Conclusions: The results support the important role of trait anxiety in the development of depression. Cognitive flexibility moderates the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and has a risk-buffering effect on this relationship. Rumination plays a mediating role in the moderating effects of cognitive flexibility on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression. The findings enrich the research on the relationship between trait anxiety and depression and have important practical implications for the early prevention and intervention of depression, which can increase individual cognitive flexibility and address rumination to regulate depression.

380,Imagery-based treatment for test anxiety: A multiple-baseline open trial,"Background: Many students are affected by test anxiety (TA), which involves considerable distress and can lead to reduced performance. Despite its prevalence, TA has been under-studied; specifically, few effective and brief interventions have been identified to date. In our work, we explore the adaptation of imagery, an emotion-focused treatment technique used widely in the treatment of other anxiety disorders, for addressing TA. Methods: In a two-site concurrent multiple-baseline pilot study ( n = 31), we examined the effectiveness of a targeted six-session protocol developed for the treatment of TA, which integrates traditional cognitive behavioral techniques with imagery work. Results: The protocol was well-accepted by clients. We found that students’ test anxiety levels did not drop between the recruitment and pre-intervention assessments, but did drop significantly from recruitment or baseline to the delayed follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.75 and 0.84, respectively). We also found evidence for session-level processes tying the quality of the imagery work with session efficacy. Limitations: The study involved a relatively small sample size, leading to weaker power to detect treatment effects. Moreover, some clients did not have any exams scheduled before the delayed follow-up assessment. Due to the scheduling intensity of the sessions, some clients had insufficient time to implement or practice skills and to complete tasks discussed in the sessions. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the utility of integrating imagery work with traditional cognitive-behavioral techniques for treating test anxiety.

381,"The moderating role of social support for marital adjustment, depression, anxiety, and stress: Evidence from Pakistani working and nonworking women","Background: This study examined how social support moderates the prolongation of mental distress related to depression, anxiety, stress, and marital adjustment in working and nonworking women. The study aimed to reveal the relationship between social support and mental health issues associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and marital adjustment among females. Methods: This research study is among the few studies performed in a Pakistani context and was conducted in 2017 to measure affective disorders among nonworking and working married females. Questionnaires were distributed among 500 targeted women, and valid responses were received from married working women in hospitals, banks, and multinational companies, and married nonworking women from residential areas of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A cross-sectional design with purposive sampling was adapted for this research, and three scales were used to measure stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and marital adjustment and its social and cultural implications among the sampled population. Results: Social support was positively and significantly associated with marital adjustment, although it showed a negative association with anxiety, depression, and stress in working and nonworking women; this finding reflects the better mental health of the study population. The findings proved that marital adjustment has a negative relation with depression and anxiety in married working and nonworking females. Social support acts as a moderator for marital cohesion, affection, stress, and depression, and the results reflected that nonworking women with higher marital cohesion and affection showed less stress and depression because of social support. Limitations: The findings of this sample cannot be generalized to the whole population as they are specific to the targeted respondents only. Conclusion: The study revealed that women's mental health is affected by psychological distress caused by depression, anxiety, stress, social and cultural norms, and their implications. Lower stress and depression lead to better mental health as ostensive social support may help to explain the relationship between depression, anxiety, and stress.

382,"Persistent depressive disorder has long-term negative impacts on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms at 10-year follow-up among patients with major depressive disorder","Objective: The study aimed to investigate the impacts of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) and pharmacotherapy on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) over a ten-year period. Methods: 290 outpatients with MDD were enrolled, including 117 with PDD, at baseline. Subjects were followed-up at six-month, two-year, and 10-year points. MDD and dysthymic disorder were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were used. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to investigate the impacts. Results: MDD patients with PDD had greater severities of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms at the three follow-up points as compared with those without; however, these results were of statistical significance only in patients without pharmacotherapy. MDD patients with PDD had a longer duration of pharmacotherapy and a lower remission rate as compared with those without. After controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline, PDD was independently associated with more severe depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Limitation: At the ten-year follow-up, approximately half of the subjects were lost to follow-up; this, in addition to the unequal follow-up intervals, might have caused bias. Conclusions: Among the patients, PDD continued to have negative impacts on depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms over the subsequent ten years. Differences in symptomatology between the patients with and without PDD were statistically insignificant when pharmacotherapy was utilized; however, pharmacotherapy did not fully compensate for the negative impacts of PDD.

383,Insomnia predicts increased perceived burdensomeness and decreased desire for emotional support following an in-laboratory social exclusion paradigm,"Background: Research suggests that insomnia is associated with elevated perceptions of loneliness and social disconnection; however, few quasi-experimental studies have tested the relationship between these constructs. This study examined whether insomnia symptom severity predicts changes in perceptions of interpersonal connectedness and desire for emotional support following in-laboratory participation in a social exclusion paradigm. Methods: Young adults ( N = 70) completed self-report measures assessing constructs of interest before and after engaging in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate whether baseline insomnia symptom severity predicted perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness after playing Cyberball; analyses controlled for baseline perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness, respectively, as well as baseline social anxiety and depression symptoms. Results: Greater insomnia symptom severity significantly predicted greater feelings of perceived burdensomeness following Cyberball participation, beyond baseline perceived burdensomeness, social anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms (β = .24, p = .001). More severe insomnia symptoms also significantly predicted lower desire for emotional support after playing Cyberball, beyond baseline desire for emotional support and social anxiety symptoms (β = -.14, p = .03) but not beyond baseline depression symptoms (β = -.16, p = .07). Insomnia symptoms were not significantly associated with thwarted belongingness after Cyberball (β = -.05–.08, p = .27–.57). Limitations: Replication in larger samples and using other sleep disturbance indices is needed. Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals with more severe insomnia symptoms in the past two weeks experience greater perceptions of being a burden on others and less desire for emotional support in response to social exclusion.

This study aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety comorbid depression based on a population-based sample in Chifeng City Inner Mongolia and explored the gender differences of depressive subtypes in anxiety patients. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 6376 community residents. Logistics analysis and multiple-group latent class analysis was used in exploring the risk factors and subtypes of anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed in this study. The lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety in the total sample was 5.70%. Among residents who had ever had anxiety, most of them reported having depressive symptoms while 15.79% of them met the criteria of MDD. Logistics analysis showed childhood adversities were associated with anxiety comorbid depressive symptoms. The results of multiple-group latent class analysis showed that the latent class probabilities were different between males and females. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of comorbidity were similar to the reports of previous regional surveys in China with statistically significant differences of comorbidity occurring between males and females. Precision prevention should therefore be targeted towards different kinds of populations.

385,Measurement equivalence of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) across individuals with social anxiety disorder from Japanese and Australian sociocultural contexts,"Background: Cultural factors influence both the expression of social anxiety and the interpretation and functioning of social anxiety measures. This study aimed to test the measurement equivalence of two commonly used social anxiety measures across two sociocultural contexts using individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) from Australia and Japan. Methods: Scores on the straightforwardly-worded Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (S-SIAS) and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) from two archival datasets of individual with SAD, one from Australia ( n = 201) and one from Japan ( n = 295), were analysed for measurement equivalence using a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) framework. Results: The best-fitting factor models for the S-SIAS and SPS were not found to be measurement equivalent across the Australian and Japanese samples. Instead, only a subset of items was invariant. When this subset of invariant items was used to compare social anxiety symptoms across the Australian and Japanese samples, Japanese participants reported lower levels of fear of attracting attention, and similar levels of fear of overt evaluation, and social interaction anxiety, relative to Australian participants. Limitations: We only analysed the measurement equivalence of two social anxiety measures using a specific operationalisation of culture. Future studies will need to examine the measurement equivalence of other measures of social anxiety across other operationalisations of culture. Conclusions: When comparing social anxiety symptoms across Australian and Japanese cultures, only scores from measurement equivalent items of social anxiety measures should be used. Our study highlights the importance of culturally-informed assessment in SAD.

386,Maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety symptoms and infant attention disengagement from emotional faces,"Background: Biases in socio-emotional attention may be early markers of risk for self-regulation difficulties and mental illness. We examined the associations between maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety symptoms and infant attention patterns to faces, with particular focus on attentional biases to threat, across male and female infants. Methods: A general population, Caucasian sample of eight-month old infants ( N = 362) were tested using eye-tracking and an attention disengagement (overlap) paradigm, with happy, fearful, neutral, and phase-scrambled faces and distractors. Maternal self-reported anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90/anxiety subscale at five time points between gestational week 14 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Probability of disengagement was lowest for fearful faces in the whole sample. Maternal pre- but not postnatal anxiety symptoms associated with higher threat bias in infants, and the relation between maternal anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy and higher threat bias in infants remained significant after controlling for maternal postnatal symptoms. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associated with higher overall probability of disengagement from faces to distractors, but the effects varied by child sex. Limitations: The small number of mothers suffering from very severe symptoms. No control for the comorbidity of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Maternal prenatal anxiety symptoms associate with infant's heightened attention bias for threat. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associate with infant's overall disengagement probability differently for boys and girls. Boys may show enhanced vigilance for distractors, except when viewing fearful faces, and girls enhanced vigilance for all socio-emotional stimuli. Long-term implications of these findings remain to be explored.

387,Maternal supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid reduce anxiety and lipid peroxidation in the offspring brain,"Background: Maternal consumption of fatty acids can alter neuronal membrane function, synaptic connections, and protect the brain from alterations caused by disturbances such as lipid peroxidation and anxiety in the offspring. We aimed to investigate how the maternal consumption of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) interferes in anxiety behavior of the offspring and cerebral lipid peroxidation. Methods: Three groups were formed: control (CG)—diet without CLA; CLA1—diet containing 1% of CLA; and CLA3—diet containing 3% of CLA. These diets were offered to the mothers from the 7th day of gestation until the end of lactation. The following behavioral tests were used: Elevated plus maze (EPM), Open Field (OF) and Light-dark Box (LDB). Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione were measured in the offspring's brains. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Holm–Sidak post-test or the Kruskal–Wallis test ( p &lt; 0.05). Results: CLA1 and CLA3 showed higher number of entries in the open arms and time spent in the central area in EPM, they translocated and ambulated more in the clear area of the LDB and presented more rearing in the OF compared to CG ( p &lt; 0.05); moreover, they presented higher concentration of glutathione and lower MDA in brain tissue ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: We evaluated the effect of maternal consumption of CLA on anxiety and lipid peroxidation in rats’ offspring, but a similar study should be performed in humans. Conclusions: Maternal intake of CLA induced a decrease in the parameters of anxiety and cerebral lipid peroxidation in the offspring.

388,A randomized controlled trial of ‘MUMentum Pregnancy’: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program for antenatal anxiety and depression,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common during pregnancy and associated with adverse outcomes for the mother and infant if left untreated. Despite the need to improve treatment accessibility and uptake in this population, no studies have investigated internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for antenatal anxiety and depression. In a randomised controlled trial, we examined the efficacy and acceptability of a brief, unguided iCBT intervention—the MUMentum Pregnancy program—in pregnant women with anxiety and/or depression. Methods: Participants meeting clinical threshold on validated self-report measures of generalised anxiety and/or depression were recruited online and randomised to iCBT ( n = 43) or a treatment as usual (TAU) control ( n = 44). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and four-week follow-up; and included anxiety, depression, psychological distress, antenatal bonding, quality of life, and treatment acceptability. Results: Of the 36 women who started iCBT, 26 completed all three lessons of treatment (76% adherence rate). iCBT produced moderate to large effect size reductions for anxiety on the GAD-7 (Hedges’ g = 0.76) and psychological distress on the Kessler-10 ( g = 0.88) that were superior to TAU. Only small nonsignificant differences were found for depression outcomes ( g = &lt; 0.35). Participants reported that iCBT was an acceptable treatment for antenatal anxiety and/or depression. Limitations: Lack of an active control condition and long-term postpartum follow-up. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate brief unguided iCBT for antenatal anxiety and depression. While our findings are promising, particularly for anxiety reduction, additional RCTs are required to establish treatment efficacy.

389,Neuroticism and extraversion mediate the relationship between having a sibling with developmental disabilities and anxiety and depression symptoms,"Background: Children growing up with a sibling with disabilities report higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms as adults. Here, we examined whether personality characteristics also play a part in mediating this relationship. Method: We tested for differences in personality traits between 132 individuals who have a sibling with developmental disabilities and 132 closely matched comparisons. Results: Differences in Big Five factors of personality were demonstrated across the disability groups and between the disability groups and the comparisons, especially in Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness. Individuals growing up alongside a sibling with developmental disabilities have a higher tendency to experience anxiety and depression symptoms, and this research is the first demonstration that personality traits mediate this relationship. Specifically, Neuroticism is a strong mediator of anxiety while both Neuroticism and Extraversion contribute mediating effects toward the development of depression. Limitations: Our study made use of self-report methodology which, although having recognized limitations, is more reliable than parental reports. Given the cross-sectional nature of our design, we were not able to examine pre-existing developmental factors that may have influenced the participant's propensity to particular personality traits and affective disorders. However, we obtained a large sample and closely matched participants to examine differences between those with a sibling with disabilities and those without. Conclusions: As such, differences in personality traits have important implications for the understanding and treatment of siblings presenting with anxiety and depression symptoms. We recommend that intervention should target those high in Neuroticism among individuals who have a sibling with disabilities, and that more social support is put in place for siblings to mitigate their tendency towards introversion and buffer them against psychological maladjustment.

390,Affective models of depression and anxiety: Extension to within-person processes in daily life,"Background: Affective models (e.g., tripartite model) delineate shared and unique components of depression and anxiety. Specifically, negative affect is broadly associated with these symptoms, whereas low positive affect is relatively specific to depression and social anxiety. However, it is unknown how affect relates to symptoms as they occur naturalistically in daily life or as a within-person dynamic process. Method: 135 treatment-seeking adults completed a baseline assessment of trait affect and then rated current affect and symptoms (depression, social anxiety, panic, worry) three times per day for 10 days. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used, and prospective analyses held constant current symptoms. Results: Baseline trait negative affect and individual differences in momentary negative affect predicted all four symptoms in daily life, whereas low positive affect predicted greater depression only. Similar results were found for within-person concurrent analyses. Prospectively, momentary negative affect predicted increased depression up to 24 h later, and increased panic or worry up to 8–16 h later. Low momentary positive affect predicted greater depression only (8 h later). Limitations: All data were self-reported, and some relevant anxiety and mood symptoms were excluded. The timing of reports was random and may have missed notable symptoms. Given the novelty of the study, replication is important. Conclusions: Affective models of depression and anxiety derived from retrospective assessments demonstrated strong ecological validity. With the exception of PA and social anxiety, associations found at the between-person level generally applied to within-person processes, which may be amenable to tracking and targeting in therapy.

391,The effects of childhood maltreatment and anxiety proneness on neuropsychological test performance in non-clinical older adolescents,"Background: The effect of childhood maltreatment (CM) on neuropsychological performance is well established, but the effect of anxiety proneness (AP) on such performance has been underexplored. We assessed the predictive ability of CM and AP, and their interaction, in non-clinical adolescents, for a range of previously documented neuropsychological deficits. Methods: Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the unique and combined influences of CM and AP on neuropsychological performance in 104 non-clinical adolescents, who underwent both neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Results: The interaction of CM and AP was associated with poorer performance in executive functioning skills, processing speed, and estimated IQ. CM and AP were uniquely associated with verbal working memory performance, while verbal and visual memory performance and learning, and visuo-spatial ability, were not associated with either CM, AP or the interaction of CM and AP. Limitations: The use of self-report measures to determine participants’ levels of CM, AP, and depression. The CTQ-SF, a retrospective self-report measure, may have introduced recall bias. The neuropsychological evaluation was not conducted in the Xhosa language, the first language of most African participants. Most instruments utilized have not been validated in a South African adolescent sample. The impact of important moderator variables (e.g., age of onset of maltreatment) was not assessed. Conclusions: Increased levels of CM and AP may be risk markers for poor performance in several key neuropsychological domains. Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the impact of both CM and anxiety-related temperamental traits on neuropsychological performance.

392,Symptoms of social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: A network perspective,"Background: We used network analyses to examine symptoms that may play a role in the co-occurrence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Whereas latent variable models examine relations among latent constructs, network analyses have the advantage of characterizing direct relations among the symptoms themselves. Method: We conducted network modeling on symptoms of social anxiety and depression in a clinical sample of 130 women who met criteria for SAD, MDD, both disorders, or had no lifetime history of mental illness. Results: In the resulting network, the core symptoms of social fear and depressed mood appeared at opposite ends of the network and were weakly related; so-called “bridges” between these symptoms appeared to occur via intervening variables. In particular, the worthless variable appeared to play a central role in the network. Limitations: Because our data were cross-sectional, we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of these effects or whether these variables are related to each other prospectively. Conclusions: Continued testing of these pathways using longitudinal data will help facilitate the development of more effective clinical interventions for these disorders.

393,Testosterone is related to GABA+ levels in the posterior-cingulate in unmedicated depressed women during reproductive life,"Background: The role of testosterone (T) in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and anxiety is broadly supported. Evidence suggests that T has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. One proposed route for the central effects of T is its interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. We explored the relationship between T levels and GABA+ levels in anterior-cingulate (ACC) and the posterior-cingulate (PCC) regions in depressed women, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS). Methods: Twenty-one depressed patients with regularly cycling who were not taking hormonal or psychotropic drugs were recruited. We assessed severity of depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Blood samples were taken for quantification of free (FT) and total testosterone (TT) on the day of the magnetic resonance (MR) scan. We evaluated GABA+ levels in the PCC and ACC, using the Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of MEGA-Edited Spectroscopy (HERMES) sequence. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the association between FT, TT, GABA+ concentrations, and HDRS scores. Results: TT and FT levels were positively correlated with GABA+ levels in the PCC. No correlation was observed between T levels and GABA+ levels in the ACC. The HDRS total scores correlated negatively with FT levels. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional evaluation and the lack of a comparative healthy group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of T are related to increased GABA+ levels in the PCC. This observation may contribute to increased understanding of the role of T in depressive and anxiety symptoms in women.

394,“Taxonicity and network structure of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: An admixture analysis and complex network analysis.”: Corrigendum,"Reports an error in ""Taxonicity and network structure of generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder: An admixture analysis and complex network analysis"" by Joshua Curtiss and David H. Klemanski ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2016[Jul][15], Vol 199, 99-105). In the methods section, the original description of the network estimation procedure should be changed to reflect that the glasso procedure was not used. An updated sentence is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-24408-015). Background: Recent years have witnessed sustained efforts to delineate the nosology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), especially in light of its substantial comorbidity with major depressive disorder (MDD). Traditional diagnostic conceptualizations regard these disorders as categorically distinct; however, extant literature attests to appreciable similarities. The application of admixture analyses and complex network analyses has become more prevalent in recent years to investigate the presence of meaningful subgroups in mental disorders and to address qualitative similarity in network structure across disorders. To date, no studies have extended these analytic techniques to determine whether GAD and MDD constitute independent syndromes. The current study used a clinical sample comprising individuals diagnosed with primary GAD or primary MDD to examine potential subgroups and network structure using symptoms of each disorder as indicators. Methods: The current sample comprised 111 individuals who received primary diagnoses of either GAD or MDD and completed a battery of assessments related to anxiety and depression. Results: Results of the admixture analyses converged on a single class solution, suggesting that individuals with GAD derive from the same population as those with MDD. Furthermore, results of the complex network analyses did not reveal differences in centrality parameters across disorders, suggesting qualitative similarity. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes conclusions about the temporal and causal dynamics of these disorders Conclusion: GAD and MDD exhibit robust similarities, as evidenced by the converging results of the admixture analyses and complex network analyses. This conclusion complements the findings of transdiagnostic research, which has identified common mechanisms underlying multiple emotional disorders.

395,Can chronotype function as predictor of a persistent course of depressive and anxiety disorder?,"Background: The role of chronotype, the individual timing of sleep/activity, has been studied in relation to depressive and anxiety disorders. A cross-sectional association between a depressive episode and evening-type has been identified. However, until now the predicting capacity of chronotype concerning persistence of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Our aim is to examine whether a later chronotype in patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder can serve as a predictor of a persistent course. Methods: A subsample of patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder diagnosis and chronotype data of the longitudinal Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) was used. Diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders (1-month DSM-IV based diagnosis) were determined at baseline ( n = 505). From this group persistence was determined at 2-year (FU2) (persistent course: n = 248, non-persistent course: n = 208) and 4-year follow-up (FU4) (persistent course: n = 151, non-persistent course: n = 264). Chronotype was assessed at baseline with the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Results: A later chronotype did not predict a persistent course of depressive and/or anxiety disorder at FU2 (OR (95% CI) = 0.99 (0.83–1.19), P = 0.92) or at FU4 (OR (95% CI) = 0.94 (0.77–1.15), P = 0.57). Limitations: Persistence was defined as having a diagnosis of depressive and/or anxiety disorder at the two-year and four-year follow-up, patients may have remitted and relapsed between assessments. Conclusion: Chronotype, measured as actual sleep timing, of patients with a depressive or anxiety disorder did not predict a persistent course which suggests it might be unsuitable as predictive tool in clinical settings.

396,Do comorbid social and other anxiety disorders predict outcomes during and after cognitive therapy for depression?,"Background: Cognitive therapy (CT) improves symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) plus comorbid anxiety disorder, but the specific type of anxiety may influence outcomes. This study compared CT outcomes among adults with MDD plus social, other, or no comorbid anxiety disorders. Methods: Outpatients with recurrent MDD ( N = 523, including 87 with social and 110 with other comorbid anxiety disorders) received acute-phase CT. Higher risk responders ( n = 241 with partial or unstable response) were randomized to 8 months of continuation treatment (CT or clinical management plus fluoxetine or pill placebo), followed by 24 months of assessment. Lower risk responders ( n = 49) were assessed for 32 months without additional research treatment. Depression, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance were measured repeatedly. Results: Other (non-social), but not social, anxiety disorders predicted elevated depression and anxiety symptoms throughout and after acute-phase CT. Social, but not other, anxiety disorder predicted greater reduction in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT and elevated social avoidance during and after acute-phase CT. Limitations: Anxiety disorders were assessed only before acute-phase treatment. The anxiety symptom measure was brief. Generalization to other patient populations and treatments is unknown. Conclusions: Non-social comorbid anxiety disorders may reduce the efficacy of acute-phase CT for MDD by diminishing both short- and longer term outcomes relative to depressed patients without comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbid social anxiety disorder may increase relative reductions in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT for MDD, but patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder may require specialized focus on social avoidance during CT.

397,Neural connectivity during affect labeling predicts treatment response to psychological therapies for social anxiety disorder,"Background: Although psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be highly effective, many individuals do not respond to treatment. Identifying factors associated with improved outcomes can facilitate individualized treatment choices. We investigated whether patterns of neural connectivity predicted treatment responses and whether treatment type, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), moderated this effect. Methods: Participants with SAD ( n = 34) underwent fMRI prior to treatment and completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. Neural connectivity measures were estimates of amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. Treatment responder status was defined using the ‘clinically significant change index’ (Loerinc et al., 2015). Results: Right amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity during implicit emotion regulation was a significant predictor of treatment response (OR = 9.01, 95% CI = 1.77, 46.0, p = .008). Stronger inverse connectivity was associated with greater likelihood of treatment response. There were no significant neural moderators of treatment response to CBT versus ACT. Limitations: The primary limitation of this work was the small sample size which restricted the power to detect significant moderation effects, and results should be interpreted as preliminary. Conclusions: Amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during affect labeling predicted treatment responder status following CBT or ACT for social anxiety disorder. This suggests that the functioning of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation capacities may be a ‘gateway’ to receiving benefit from psychological treatments. Future work should aim to replicate this effect in a larger sample and consider methods for enhancing functional connectivity within this circuitry as a potential treatment adjunct.

398,"Psychosocial factors associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress among single mothers with young children: A population-based study","Background: Abundant evidence highlights single parenthood as a common risk factor for depression, anxiety and stress but few studies have comprehensively examined psychosocial factors (adversities), particularly during early parenting. We investigated symptom prevalence and potential risk factors among mothers with very young children. Methods: Data stem from the 2015 National Psychosocial Burdens Prevalence Study (KiD 0–3). Mothers with children up to 3 years of age ( n = 6925) were recruited from random probability-sampled paediatric clinics ( n = 271) across Germany and reported on depression or anxiety, general and parenting stress using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Multivariable logistic regression models determined risk factors and quantified potential mediation of psychosocial factors for all 3 outcomes. Results: Approximately 30% of single mothers ( n = 517) reported depressive or anxiety symptoms and 37% general stress, twice as high compared to partnered mothers ( n = 6408; p &lt; 0.0001). Parenting stress was also elevated ( p &lt; 0.0001). Adjusted regression models confirm that single mothers are twice as likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety (OR 1.9, CI 95% 1.4–2.5). Risk factors for stress correspond to those for depression and anxiety. Inadequate social support and history of partner or childhood maltreatment were also consistent risk factors across all outcomes. Limitations: The study design and self-reported symptoms are limitations to consider. Conclusions: Single mothers with young children are more predisposed to mental health disorders than partnered mothers, especially when facing financial, social or distal adversities. Appropriate social support programs and screening measures are necessary to reduce further disparities.

399,A comparison of the interviewer-administered phone and self-complete online versions of the computerized eMINI 6.0 in a sample of pregnant women,"Background: This study compares the prevalence rates of depressive and anxiety disorders identified during pregnancy using an interviewer-administered phone version and a self-complete online version of the computerized eMINI 6.0. Methods: 888 pregnant women completed the computerized eMINI 6.0 (interviewer-administered phone, n = 253; self-complete online, n = 635). Results: There were no significant differences in the proportions of women meeting eMINI 6.0 criteria for current major depression, any current anxiety disorder, or lifetime panic or depressive disorder, by mode of administration. However, a greater proportion of women in the interviewer-administered phone group than in the self-complete online group met criteria for current minor depression (2.0% vs 0.2%, p = .008). Limitations: Study limitations include its non-randomized design, overall low prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in the sample and inclusion of only a select number of eMINI 6.0 modules. Conclusions: This study demonstrated few differences in the rates of DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorders identified between the interviewer-administered and self-administered versions of the eMINI 6.0. Findings provide preliminary support the practical value of self-completed computerized interviews in large scale studies examining common mental disorders in pregnant women.

400,"High risk of depression, anxiety, and poor quality of life among experienced fathers, but not mothers: A prospective longitudinal study","Background: Mental distress patterns in first-time or experienced mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood have been inadequately studied. This longitudinal study thus investigated changes in depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life in both parents from early pregnancy until 1 year postpartum. Parity effects were specifically examined. Methods: In total, 531 pregnant women and their partners were recruited in Taiwan during early prenatal visits from 2011 to 2015, with five follow-ups from midpregnancy to 1 year postpartum. The participants’ self-reported data were collected and analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Results: Maternal mental distress levels were highest at 1 month postpartum. During postpartum periods, depression scores increased and social relations domain scores decreased in men. Although mental distress levels were higher in mothers than in fathers, parity evidently affected men. Experienced fathers were independently associated with a 70% higher risk of perinatal depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–2.3) and anxiety (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.6). Experienced fathers also exhibited significantly lower perinatal scores than first-time fathers in the physical health and social relations domains. Limitations: Selection of both parents in metropolitan areas with higher socioeconomic status may restrict the generalizability of our findings. Conclusions: In addition to maternal mental distress during the transition to parenthood, we highlighted experienced fathers’ psychological difficulties throughout perinatal periods. Such trends may indicate unsatisfied needs and could guide timely intervention to prevent adverse consequences.

401,"Sense of coherence, burden and mental health in caregiving: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Informal caregiving is associated with a number of negative effects on carers’ physical and psychological well-being. The salutogenic theory argues that sense of coherence (SOC) is an important factor in psychological adjustment to stress. The main aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence on the association between SOC, burden and mental health outcomes in informal carers. Method: A systematic search was carried out up to September 2017 in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychInfo (OVID) and Scopus. Studies were included if they evaluated the relationship between sense of coherence and subjective caregiver burden and/or mental health outcomes, specifically symptoms of depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses were performed and subgroup analyses were carried out to explore if methodological factors influenced findings. Results: Thirty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis, which provided 40 independent samples with 22 independent comparisons for subjective caregiver burden, 26 for symptoms of depression and 7 for symptoms of anxiety. Higher levels of SOC were associated with lower levels of subjective caregiver burden and better mental health outcomes. Publication bias did not change the estimate of the effect. Limitations: Most of the studies included in this review were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Findings suggest that SOC is an important determinant of carer well-being and may protect carers from high levels of psychological distress and caregiver burden.

402,Sedentary behaviour and risk of anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: This research synthesis sought to determine the magnitude of the association between sedentary behaviour (sitting time) and anxiety. Evidence acquisition: A comprehensive literature search of eight electronic databases (and a manual search) identified 13 observational studies that met inclusion criteria (22 effect sizes; total n = 70,425). Pooled mean effects were computed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis and moderation by study and population characteristics were tested using random effects meta-regression. Evidence synthesis: Sedentary behaviour was associated with an increased risk of anxiety for non-adjusted effect sizes ( k = 7, OR = 1.33 [95% CI: 1.14, 1.55]) and effect sizes adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors ( k = 11, OR = 1.48 [95% CI: 1.25, 1.75]). There was no evidence of publication bias in the results. The regression models showed that effect sizes were not moderated by age or gender. However, there was some evidence of moderation by study quality and measurement of sedentary behaviour and anxiety. Measures of sitting time showed larger associations than measures of screen time, and measures of anxiety symptoms showed larger associations than measures of anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The research synthesis provides evidence that sedentary behaviour has a small positive association with anxiety, after controlling for sociodemographic and other health-related factors. Study limitations include low statistical power in meta-regression models and heterogeneity in measures of anxiety and sedentary behaviour. Findings might be of interest to health care professionals developing health care initiatives to reduce risk of anxiety.

168,Ratio of plasma BDNF to leptin levels are associated with treatment response in major depressive disorder but not in panic disorder: A 12-week follow-up study,"Background: A link between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and the mood regulatory effect of leptin has been suggested in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). We investigated treatment response and pre-treatment leptin and BDNF in patients with MDD and with panic disorder (PD). Methods: We recruited 41 patients with MDD, 52 patients with PD, and 59 matched healthy controls. All subjects completed five visits (at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks), and both MDD and PD patients were treated with standard pharmacotherapy for 12 weeks. Plasma BDNF (pBDNF) and blood leptin levels were obtained along with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale rating (HDRS-17) score at every visit. Results: The ratio of pre-treatment pBDNF to leptin was significantly lower in patients with MDD and PD compared to healthy controls ( p = 0.024), but was not associated with severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Pre-treatment pBDNF:leptin ratio was significantly higher in treatment responders than in non-responders ( p = 0.012) in MDD but not in PD. This difference was larger in MDD patients with appetite loss ( p = 0.034). In multivariate analysis, pre-treatment pBDNF:leptin ratio was significantly associated with treatment responsiveness (Adjusted Odds Ration [AOR] = 2.50, 95% CI 1.02–6.14) in MDD. Limitation: small sample size; limited information on detailed pharmacological effects. Conclusions: A relatively higher ratio of pre-treatment pBDNF to leptin was associated with greater treatment response in MDD but not in PD. Further research should focus on exploration of a link between BDNF and leptin underlying neuronal plasticity in depression.

169,Investigating the potential role of BDNF and PRL genotypes on antidepressant response in depression patients: A prospective inception cohort study in treatment-free patients,"Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with response to antidepressant drugs in mood and anxiety disorders. Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone with behavioural effects, acting as a neurotrophic factor within the brain and may be involved in antidepressant response. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between BDNF and PRL genotypes with antidepressant drug response. Methods: Prospective inception cohort of 186 Russian treatment-free participants (28 men and 158 women) between 18 and 70 years clinically diagnosed with depressive disorder who initiated antidepressant medication. DNA polymorphisms were genotyped for PRL rs1341239, BDNF rs6265 and rs7124442. Primary outcome was measured by differences in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (∆HAM-D) scores between baseline/week two, week two/week four, and baseline/week four. Linear regression and independent t -test determined the significance between polymorphisms and ∆HAM-D. Results: Comparisons between genotypes did not reveal any significant differences in scores during the first two weeks of treatment. In the latter two weeks, BDNF rs7124442 homozygous C patients responded significantly worse in comparison to homozygous T patients during this period. Further analysis within women and in post-menopausal women found a similar comparison between alleles. Limitations: Study lasted four weeks, which may be considered short to associate genuine antidepressant effects. Conclusions: Patients taking tricylic antidepressants were noted to have a significant improvement in ∆HAM-D compared to patients taking SSRIs. Homozygous C BDNF rs712442 patients were found to respond significantly worse in the last two weeks of treatment.

170,Body dysmorphic disorder and major depressive episode have comorbidity-independent associations with suicidality in an acute psychiatric setting,"Background: This study sought to examine whether mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders have unique (comorbidity-independent) associations with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in an acute psychiatric population. Methods: Patients ( N = 498) were evaluated during admission to a partial hospital. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess current psychiatric diagnoses and past-month suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors (e.g., suicide attempts). Results: After adjusting for age, gender and other psychiatric disorders, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) had a significant association with suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] = 6.62; 95% CI, 1.92–22.79) and suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.05–5.71). Similarly, major depressive episode was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 3.00; 95% CI, 1.95–4.63) and suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.12–3.98). When unipolar and bipolar depression were analyzed separately, unipolar depression was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.20–2.74), but not suicidal behaviors, whereas, bipolar depression was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 2.71; 95% CI, 1.36–5.40) and marginally with suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.02; 95% CI, 0.99–4.13). Anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder were unrelated to suicidality in this sample after controlling for comorbid disorders. Limitations: Cross-sectional design and a relatively small sample for analyses of low base-rate conditions. Conclusions: Major depressive episode and BDD are unique markers of suicidality in an acute psychiatric setting. BDD is a common but often underdiagnosed condition, and clinicians should be aware of high rates of suicidality among these patients.

171,Adverse childhood experiences and mental health: Comparing the link in rural and urban men who have sex with men,"Background: Research shows individuals experiencing adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as well as identifying as a man who has sex with other men (MSM) are at an increased risk for mental health issues. Less has been studied, however, on ACEs in MSM; with even fewer studies investigating non-urban (e.g., rural/small town/suburban) MSM, as most research features urban samples. This is problematic due to studies showing that rurality can influence the behavior of MSM. The current study comparatively investigates the impact of ACEs on the mental health of rural/small town/suburban and urban MSM. Methods: Participants included 156 MSM residing in Oklahoma. Linear regression was used to test the association between ACEs’ and mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness). Split-sample regressions were conducted on rural/small town/suburban and urban MSM. Results: ACEs were associated with all three mental health outcomes in the full sample. However, ACEs were significantly linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms only in urban MSM. Limitations: Limitations include a smaller sample size with limited racial/ethnic variations. Conclusions: Results suggest that living in an urban environment may amplify the risks of ACEs, rural/small town/suburban MSM may acquire outside, unique support networks which work to limit the effect of ACEs, or that rural/small town/suburban MSM may manifest the effects of ACEs differently (or a combination of the three). Trauma-informed programming has been shown to effectively reduce mental health issues, yet consideration is generally not given with regards to rurality. Future programming and research should consider rurality/urbanity as influential factor.

We aimed to examine the evidence on the contribution of mental disorders to suicide among record linkage studies. Methods: We performed a systematic search using eight major health databases for English-language studies published between 1 January 2000 and 11 June 2018 that linked collected data on mental disorders and suicide. We then conducted a meta-analysis to assess risk of suicide conferred by mental disorders. Results: Our search identified 20 articles representing 13 unique studies. The pooled rate ratio (RR) was 13.2 (95% CI 8.6–20.3) for psychotic disorders, 12.3 (95% CI 8.9–17.1) for mood disorders, 8.1 (95% CI 4.6–14.2) for personality disorders, 4.4 (95% CI 2.9–6.8) for substance use disorders, and 4.1 (95% CI 2.4–6.9) for anxiety disorders in the general population. The overall pooled RR for these mental disorders was 7.5 (95% CI 6.6–8.6). The population attributable risk of mental disorders was up to 21%. Limitations: The overall heterogeneity between studies was very high. Conclusions: Our findings underline the important role of mental disorders in suicide.

173,Prenatal SSRI antidepressant use and maternal internalizing symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum: Exploring effects on infant temperament trajectories for boys and girls,"Background: The severity and treatment of depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum has important implications for maternal and child well-being. Yet, little is known about prenatal SSRI use and early child socioemotional development. This study explores effects of prenatal SSRI exposure, and pre- and postnatal internalizing symptoms on trajectories of infant temperament, identifying potential differences for boys and girls. Methods: Using latent growth models, sex differences in infant temperament trajectories from 3- to 10-months were examined in relation to prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms and prenatal SSRI exposure among 185 mother-infant dyads. Results: For girls, prenatal internalizing symptoms were associated with greater initial distress to limitations, and lower duration of orienting, smiling/laughter, and soothability. Postnatal symptoms predicted slower decreases in girls’ duration of orienting. SSRI exposure predicted decreases in distress to limitations and slower increases in smiling and laughter. For boys, maternal internalizing symptoms did not generally affect temperament profiles. SSRI exposure was associated with higher initial activity level and slower declines in distress to limitations. Limitations: Only parent-report indicators of infant temperament across 10 months of infancy were provided. Maternal internalizing symptoms were measured at discrete times during pregnancy and postpartum, with no analysis of changes in symptoms across time. Conclusions: Prenatal SSRI treatment, and both prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms, exert unique effects on infant temperament. Overall, the present study suggests sex-dependent fetal programming effects that should be further evaluated in future research. Results have implications for perinatal mental health treatment and perceived impacts on child socioemotional development.

174,The association between a history of self-harm and mental disorders in pregnancy,"Background: Self-harm is prevalent, particularly among young women, and is associated with mental disorders. However, little is known about the mental health of pregnant women who have a history of self-harm. This study examined whether lifetime self-harm was associated with increased risk of antenatal mental disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 544 pregnant women recruited after their first antenatal appointment, oversampling those who responded positively to the depression-screening Whooley questions. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR was delivered, including questions about the lifetime occurrence of self-harm. The associations between lifetime self-harm and the presence of mental disorders, and more specifically anxiety and depressive disorders, were examined using survey-weighted logistic regression. The association between lifetime self-harm and symptoms of personality disorder, was investigated using survey-weighted linear regression. Results: After survey weighting, history of self-harm had a prevalence of 7.9% (95%CI 5.5–11.2%) and was associated with increased risk for mental disorders in early pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.03; 95%CI: 2.22–11.37; p &lt; 0.0001; n = 517). Women with a history of self-harm were more likely to experience antenatal anxiety disorders (AOR 4.41; 95%CI: 1.85–10.51; p = 0.001; n = 517) and antenatal depression (AOR 2.71; 95%CI: 1.04–7.05; p = 0.042; n = 517) than women who did not report self-harm. History of self-harm was also associated with higher SAPAS scores (adjusted coefficient 0.69; 95%CI: 0.21–1.17; n = 517). Limitations: Information on the timing and persistence of self-harm was not available. Conclusions: Women with a history of self-harm are more vulnerable to mental disorders in pregnancy. Further research should include more comprehensive assessments of self-harm and the social context of pregnant women.

175,Structural and functional neural correlates of vigilant and avoidant regulation style,"Background: Regulation of emotional arousal is a relevant factor for mental health. The investigation of neural underpinnings of regulation styles in healthy individuals may provide important insights regarding potential risk factors. To fill the gap of structural correlates of regulation styles and to expand previous results, we focused on the association between brain structure, neural responsiveness and vigilant/avoidant regulation style. Methods: In n = 302 healthy individuals regulation style was assessed with the Mainz Coping Inventory (MCI). Participants underwent structural and functional MRI during an emotion-processing paradigm. Structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry) and functional MRI were analysed in two regions of interest (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]). Results: Regulation styles did not show an association with brain structure after correction for gender, age, trait anxiety, depressive symptoms. During emotion processing, a vigilant regulation style was negatively associated with ACC activation. Limitations: The cross-sectional study in a non-pathological sample is not adequate to unveil causalities or draw conclusions regarding prevention interventions. Conclusion: Regulation styles are associated with specific neural activation patterns. The association of a high-vigilant regulation style and low ACC activation during emotion processing in healthy participants might be a potential risk factor.

176,Unstable wakefulness during resting-state fMRI and its associations with network connectivity and affective psychopathology in young adults,"Background: Drifts between wakefulness and sleep are common during resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Among healthy adults, within-scanner sleep can impact functional connectivity of default mode (DMN), task-positive (TPN), and thalamo-cortical networks. Because dysfunctional arousal states (i.e., sleepiness, sleep disturbance) are common in affective disorders, individuals with affective psychopathology may be more prone to unstable wakefulness during rsfMRI, hampering the estimation of clinically meaningful functional connectivity biomarkers. Methods: A transdiagnostic sample of 150 young adults (68 psychologically distressed; 82 psychiatrically healthy) completed rsfMRI and reported whether they experienced within-scanner sleep. Symptom scales were reduced into depression/anxiety and mania proneness dimensions using principal component analysis. We evaluated associations between within-scanner sleep, clinical status, and functional connectivity of the DMN, TPN, and thalamus. Results: Within-scanner sleep during rsfMRI was reported by 44% of participants ( n = 66) but was unrelated to psychiatric diagnoses or mood symptom severity ( p -values &gt; 0.05). Across all participants, self-reported within-scanner sleep was associated with connectivity signatures akin to objectively-assessed sleep, including lower within-DMN connectivity, lower DMN-TPN anti-correlation, and altered thalamo-cortical connectivity ( p &lt; 0.05, corrected). Among participants reporting sustained wakefulness ( n = 84), depression/anxiety severity positively associated with averaged DMN-TPN connectivity and mania proneness negatively associated with averaged thalamus-DMN connectivity ( p -values &lt; 0.05). Both relationships were attenuated and became non-significant when participants reporting within-scanner sleep were included ( p -values &gt; 0.05). Limitations: Subjective report of within-scanner sleep. Conclusions: Findings implicate within-scanner sleep as a source of variance in network connectivity; careful monitoring and correction for within-scanner sleep may enhance our ability to characterize network signatures underlying affective psychopathology.

177,"Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability questionnaire (RIPoSt-40) assessing emotional dysregulation: Development, reliability and validity","Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a heterogenous construct with great relevance in psychiatric research and clinical practice. In the present study, we validated a 40-items version of the Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability questionnaire (RIPoSt-40), a self-report measure of ED. Methods: A non-clinical sample ( N = 396) and two clinical samples of patients with cyclothymia ( N = 120) and ADHD ( N = 54) were recruited. Items were selected and subscales were derived based on inter-item correlations and PCA with promax rotation in the non-clinical sample. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a subsample ( N = 60). Internal consistency and concurrent validity with TEMPS-M factors were evaluated in each sample. The three groups results were compared to ascertain discriminant validity. Results: Four subscales were identified as measures of affective instability, emotional impulsivity, negative and positive emotionality. The first three subscales also sum up to a negative ED score comprising thirty items. Measures of reliability (test-retest r = 0.71–0.84) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.72–0.95) were generally high. Concurrent validity was supported by correlations with TEMPS-M factors. Discriminant validity was significant ( p &lt; 0.001) with cyclothymic and ADHD patients showing higher scores for each subscale, except for positive emotionality. Limitations: The non-clinical sample was recruited through a web-survey and mainly included young and highly educated subjects. Mood and anxiety comorbidity of the clinical samples were not taken into consideration. Conclusion: RIPoSt-40 questionnaire has proved to be a valid, reliable and useful tool to assess ED both in clinical and non-clinical contexts.

Harry and Stephen C. Waring ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2019[Jul][1], Vol 254, 59-68). The authors regret the exclusion of the following cited reference: Smith, S.M., Stinson, F.S., Dawson, D.A., Goldstein, R., Huang, B., Grant, B.F., 2006. Race/ethnic differences in the prevalence and co-occurrence of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Psychol. Med. 36, 987-998. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-36157-008). Background: American Indian people have high suicide rates. However, little epidemiological data is available on depression prevalence, a suicide risk factor, in this population. Some research suggests that depression scales may perform differently for American Indian people. However, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a depression scale widely-used in clinical practice, had not been assessed for cross-cultural measurement invariance with American Indian people. Methods: In this retrospective study of existing electronic health record (EHR) data in an upper Midwestern healthcare system, we assessed the measurement invariance of the standard one-factor PHQ-9 and five previously identified two-factor models for 4443 American Indian and 4443 Caucasian American adults (age &gt; = 18) with a PHQ-9 in the EHR from 12/1/2005 to 12/31/2017. We also conducted subgroup analyses with adults ages &gt; = 65. Results: Models showed good fits (e.g., CFI &gt; 0.99, RMSEA &lt; 0.05) and internal consistency reliability (ordinal alpha &gt; 0.80). All models displayed measurement invariance between racial groups. Factor correlation was high for two-factor models, providing support for the one-factor model. American Indian adults had significantly higher odds of PHQ-9 total scores &gt; = 10 and &gt; = 15 than Caucasian American adults. Limitations: Data came from a single healthcare system. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 exhibited cross-cultural measurement invariance between American Indian and Caucasian American adults, supporting the PHQ-9 as a depression screening tool in this clinical care population. American Indian adults also had higher levels of depression than Caucasian Americans. Future research could confirm the generalizability of our findings to other American Indian populations.

179,"A systematic review of the antidepressant effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) functional agonists: Further link between metabolism and psychopathology: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders”. Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Introduction: An increasing amount of preclinical and clinical evidence links together metabolic regulations and psychopathological mechanisms, in particular linking mood disorders with changes in Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta and 5′Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase expression and activity. New hypoglycemic drugs, including thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) functional agonists, which work by these mechanisms, have also been described as potential antidepressants. The putative role of thiazolidinediones in depression has been already supported, but no clear evidence exists yet for GLP-1 functional agonists. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to describe the effect of GLP-1 functional agonists on depression rating scales and either support or confute a potential antidepressant role. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases for terms related to DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and depression, including symptoms and rating scales with acronyms and full names. We included longitudinal interventional and observational studies on GLP-1 functional agonists used for depression symptoms. We applied a random effects meta-analysis on standardized mean differences before-after treatment, comparing GLP-1 functional agonists versus control treatments. Results: Literature searches found 815 papers, 8 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Both control treatments (-0.67, 95%C.I. -0.99 – -0.36, Z = 4.24, p &lt; 0.0001) and GLP-1 functional agonists (-1.28, 95%C.I. -2.34 – -0.21, Z = 2.35, p = 0.02) resulted in a significant reduction of depression rating scores, although GLP-1 functional agonists tended to be superior. When a selection was made, including only studies conducted on diabetic patients that did not exclude depressed patients, the effect of GLP-1 functional agonists (-2.09, 95%C.I. -2.28 – -1.91, Z = 22.5, p &lt; 0.00001) was significantly superior to that of control treatments (-0.57, 95%C.I. -0.66 – -0.49, Z = 13.6, p &lt; 0.00001). Discussion: Results of this meta-analysis must be carefully considered, since the amount of studies available was low and heterogeneity was high. If further trials will confirm this hypothesis, GLP-1 functional agonists may be considered as antidepressants, either as adjuncts or in mono-therapy, with a peculiar value for preventing the adverse metabolic effects of long-term antipsychotic therapies used in rehabilitation.

180,Sympathetic arousal in children with oppositional defiant disorder and its relation to emotional dysregulation,"Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a trans-nosographical condition characterized by mood instability, severe irritability, aggression, temper outburst, and hyper-arousal. Pathophysiology of emotional dysregulation and its potential biomarkers are an emerging field of interest. A Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) profile, defined as Dysregulation Profile (DP), has been correlated to ED in youth. We examined the association between the CBCL-DP and indices of sympathetic arousal in children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and healthy controls. Method: The current study sought to compare the arousal level measured via electrodermal activity in response to emotional stimuli in three non-overlapping groups of children: (1) ODD + CBCL-DP (n = 28), (2) ODD without CBCL-DP ( n = 35), and (3) typically developing controls ( n = 25). Results: Analyses revealed a distinct electrodermal activity profile in the three groups. Specifically, children with ODD + CBCL-DP presented higher levels of sympathetic arousal for anger and sadness stimuli compared to the other two groups. Limitations: The relatively small sample and the lack of assessing causality limit the generalizability of this study which results need to be replicated in larger, different samples. Conclusion: The CBCL-DP was associated to higher levels of arousal for negative emotions, consistently with previous reports in individuals with depression and anxiety. Further work may identify potential longitudinal relationships between this profile and clinical outcomes.

181,A functional variant of CB2 receptor gene interacts with childhood trauma and FAAH gene on anxious and depressive phenotypes,"Background: Accumulating data suggest that CB2 receptor plays a crucial role in development of anxiety via regulatory function of stress response and neuroimmune crosstalk. Although animal experiments confirm this relationship, relevant human genetic studies on CB2 receptor gene ( CNR2 ) in association with affective phenotype are absent. Methods: CNR2 R63Q and FAAH C385A functional polymorphisms were genotyped of 921 volunteers from the general population. Phenotypic variables were measured by the Zung Self-related Depression Scale (ZSDS), The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Trait subscale, STAI-T) and the depressive and anxious subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-DEP and BSI-ANX). Early life trauma was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CHQ). Using general linear models we tested possible associations between phenotypic variance and genotype distribution. Results: There was a significant main effect of RR genotype of R63Q on ZSDS score ( p = 0.007) and a remarkable interacting effect of CHQ and R63Q on scores of ZSDS, STAI-T and BSI-ANX scales ( p = 0.009; p = 0.003; p = 0.001; respectively). R allele of R63Q and A allele of FAAH C385A were associated with significantly higher ZSDS, STAI-T and BSI-ANX scores compared to non-risk allele carriers ( p = 0.009; p = 0.007; p = 0.007, respectively). The highest phenotypic scores were observed in GxGxE model ( p ZSDS = 0.04; p BSI-DEP = 0.006; p STAI-T = 0.001; p BSI-ANX = 3.8 × 10 −5 ). Conclusions: In this first human genetic study on CNR2 and childhood trauma we revealed that dysfunctional CB2 receptor and FAAH can contribute to greater sensitivity for childhood trauma possibly via weaker inhibition of inflammatory and overactivated HPA axis.

182,Development of a very brief scale for detecting and measuring panic disorder using two items from the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Self Report,"Objective: To minimize the burden in detecting and monitoring Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia by developing a very brief scale with selected items from the Panic Disorder Severity Scale-Self Report (PDSS-SR), and to investigate the proposed scale's psychometric properties in a comorbid sample. Methods: A sample of 5103 patients from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Sweden, diagnosed and treated with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder ( n = 1390), social anxiety disorder ( n = 1313) or depression ( n = 2400), responded to the PDSS-SR. Six criteria related to factor structure, sensitivity to change and clinical representativeness were used to select items. Psychometric analyses for the selected very brief scale were performed. Results: Items 2 (distress during panic attacks) and 4 (agoraphobic avoidance), were selected to create the very brief PDSS-SR version. Correlations with the full scale were high at screening, pre and post, and for change (0.87–0.93). Categorical Omega was ⍵ C = 0.74. With a cut-off of 3 points, the scale could detect panic disorder in a psychiatric sample with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 66%. Limitations: Limitations include lack of healthy controls and lack of blinding on secondary outcome measures. Conclusion: The proposed 2-item PDSS-SR version is a good candidate for a very brief panic disorder questionnaire, both for detecting cases and for measuring change. This is especially useful in clinical settings when measuring more than one condition at a time.

183,What is at the core of OCD? A network analysis of selected obsessive-compulsive symptoms and beliefs,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous condition that consists of distinct subtypes, and identification of its core symptoms may inform how to best conceptualize the heterogeneity. Accordingly, we used network analysis to evaluate which symptoms (and associations between symptoms) are most central to OCD symptoms and beliefs. Methods: Participants consisted of a combined sample of adults with a primary diagnosis of OCD ( N = 150), those with other primary diagnoses ( N = 114), and an unselected nonclinical sample ( N = 310). Network analysis was used to identify the most central symptoms (nodes) and associations between symptoms (edges) assessed by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and the Obsessional Beliefs Questionnaire-44. Results: The most central symptoms in the network were negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts (i.e., Having intrusive thoughts means I'm out of control ). Some of the strongest associations between symptoms were also observed for those pertaining to intrusive thoughts and their negative appraisal. Furthermore, central symptoms in the network predicted depression and anxiety (over and above peripheral symptoms) among those with a primary diagnosis of OCD, but not the severity of OCD symptoms. Limitations: The approach was exploratory rather than experimental and relied solely on self-report measures of OCD symptoms and beliefs. Conclusions: Negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts were the most central symptoms in the OCD network, and they uniquely predict co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and depression, suggesting that these symptoms should be prioritized in theoretical and treatment models of OCD.

184,Sleep duration is associated with depressive symptoms among expatriate nurses,"Background: There is limited data on sleep and its impact on mental health among expatriate nurses in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to assess the association between sleep duration and symptoms of depression among expatriate nurses. Methods: Nurses in government healthcare facilities in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia responded to an electronic survey ( n = 977) on demography, lifestyle, job features, and symptoms of depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21). Binary and multinomial logistic regression, respectively, assessed the adjusted associations of daily sleep hours (≤ 5, 6–7, ≥ 8) with having any (no, yes) or degree of symptoms (no, mild to moderate, and severe to extremely severe). Results: There was a dose–response relationship between sleep hours and depressive symptoms (any as well as degree) ( p -values for trend &lt; 0.05). For nurses who slept 6–7 h, the odds ratio (OR) of having any symptoms of depression was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2 – 2.2), ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1 – 2.2), and ‘severe to extremely severe’ symptoms 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1 – 3.4). For nurses who slept ≤ 5 h, the OR of having any symptoms was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4–3.3), ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms 1.7 (95% CI: 1.0–2.6), and ‘severe to extremely severe’ symptoms 4.2 (95% CI: 2.2–8.1) (reference group ≥ 8 h). Limitations: The sleep data pertained to duration only and not to sleep quality. Conclusion: There was a strong association between sleep duration and symptoms of depression among expatriate nurses.

185,Predictors and outcomes of suicidal ideation during peripartum period,"Introduction: Suicide belongs to the leading causes of maternal perinatal mortality and suicidal ideation is one of the strongest predictors for suicide attempt and completion and thus represents an opportunity for early intervention prior to self and infant harm. This post-hoc analysis aims to investigate predictors of peripartum suicidality (PS) and potential maternal and infant outcomes of PS. Methods: In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) study, n = 306 women were repeatedly examined from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum using interviews (Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women) and questionnaires (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory) to obtain sociodemographic, gynecological and offspring characteristics as well as information about PS (thoughts of death/self-harm, suicide plans, suicide attempt). Results: PS was indicated by n = 15 women. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed a history of suicide attempt (OR = 17.84, 95%CI: 4.61–69.05), living together with the partner (OR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.03–0.63), and social support (OR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13–0.91) as significant predictors for PS (model fit: AUC = 0.7926). As compared to women with no PS, infants of women with PS presented lower scores in neuropsychological development ( p = 0.020). Limitations: This post-hoc analysis was conducted with the aim of generating hypotheses for future research. The small number of women who indicated PS limits the statistical power. Conclusion: PS is an important perinatal complication that requires clinical attention. Larger prospective studies are warranted to verify the findings. This will lead to improved preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the motives behind maternal suicide and infanticide.

186,Is resting state frontal alpha connectivity asymmetry a useful index to assess depressive symptoms? A preliminary investigation in a sample of university students,"Background: Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been widely investigated in depressive disorders (DDs) with contradictory and not conclusive results. The main aim of the current study was to explore the association between a new neurophysiological index, the so-called frontal alpha connectivity asymmetry index (FACA-I), and depressive symptoms. Methods: One hundred and thirteen participants (45 men and 68 women, mean age: 22.83 ± 2.26 years) were enrolled. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were performed during 5 min of resting state (RS). FACA-I was computed by subtracting connectivity at left frontal regions from right frontal regions and dividing by their sum. RS FAA were also computed and compared to the FACA-I in all analyses. Results: After controlling for the presence of potential confounding variables (i.e., sex, age and anxiety symptoms), only FACA-I scores between medial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex were negatively associated with both somatic and cognitive/affective depressive symptoms and were lower in individuals with significant level of depressive symptoms. Limitations: We focused on a sample of university students with no formal diagnosis of depression and we did not assess FAA and FACA-I during cognitive and/or emotional tasks, which make our interpretation specific to the RS condition. Conclusions: Taken together our data suggest that alpha connectivity asymmetry between medial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex may be a useful neurophysiological index in the assessment of depressive symptoms.

187,Longitudinal course of suicidal ideation and predictors of its persistence—A NESDA study,"Background: Prior research indicates that the factors that trigger suicidal ideation may differ from those that maintain it, but studies into the maintenance of suicidal ideation remain scarce. Our aim was to assess the longitudinal course of suicidal ideation, and to identify predictors of persistent suicidal ideation. Methods: We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We performed a linear mixed-effects growth model analysis ( n = 230 with current suicidal ideation at baseline) to assess the course of suicidal ideation over time (baseline through 2-, 4-, 6- and 9-year follow-up). We used logistic regression analysis ( n = 195) to test whether factors previously associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation in the literature (insomnia, hopelessness, loneliness, borderline personality traits, childhood trauma, negative life events) also predict persistence of suicidal ideation (i.e., reporting ideation at two consecutive assessment points, 6- and 9-years). We controlled for socio-demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, medication use, and suicide attempt history. Results: Suicidal ideation decreased over time, and this decrease became slower with increasing time, with the majority of symptom reductions occurring in the first two years of follow-up. More severe insomnia and hopelessness were associated with increased odds of persistent suicidal ideation, and hopelessness was a significant mediator of the relationship between insomnia and persistent suicidal ideation. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to those with more severe suicidal ideation due to dropout of those with the worst clinical profile. Conclusions: Targeting insomnia and hopelessness in treatment may be particularly important to prevent the persistence of suicidal ideation.

188,"Complex polypharmacy in bipolar disorder: Side effect burden, adherence, and response predictors","Background: Complex polypharmacy (CP) is common in bipolar disorder (BD). We assessed the associations between CP, adherence, and side effect burden, and patient traits associated with clinical improvement in relationship to CP. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 482 adult BD participants in the Bipolar CHOICE trial. We examined the associations between CP (use of ≥ 3 BD medications) and non-adherence (missing &gt;30% of BD medication doses in the last 30 days) and side effect burden (Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating scale) using multivariate models with patient random effects. We used logistic regression to assess the patient traits associated with remission among those with majority CP use (Clinical Global Impression-Severity for BD score ≤ 2 for 8 + weeks). Results: 43% of patients had any CP and 25% had CP for the majority of the study. CP was associated with non-adherence (OR = 2.51, 95% CI [1.81, 3.50]), but not worse side effect burden. Among those with CP, 16% achieved remission; those with non-adherence, comorbid social or generalized anxiety disorder, or BD I vs. II were less likely to achieve remission among those with CP. Limitations: There could be unmeasured confounding between use of CP and side effect burden or adherence. Adherence was measured by self-report, which could be subject to reporting error. Conclusions: BD patients with CP were less likely to adhere to therapy, and those with worse adherence to CP were less likely to clinically respond. Clinicians should assess medication adherence prior to adding another agent to medication regimens.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by cognitive impairments that are known to predict psychosocial functioning and quality of life. While cognitive remediation (CR) was originally developed to directly target cognitive symptoms in traumatic brain injury and psychotic illnesses, the efficacy of CR in BD has begun to emerge only in the last decade. Functional Remediation (FR) is an integrated intervention that has been developed to restore psychosocial functioning by means of ecological neurocognitive techniques that involve psychoeducation about cognitive dysfunctions and their impact on the general functioning. Because of the heterogeneity of treatment targets and mechanisms of actions, here we aim to illustrate the effects induced by existing CR/FR approaches in BD. Methods: In this systematic review, we evaluated cognitive and functional outcomes after CR/FR in studies conducted in BD. Results: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria: 3 RCTs that compared CR/FR to one or more control condition ( n = 354), 5 secondary analyses that further examined data from these trials, 2 single-arm studies, and 1 naturalistic study. While features such as the use of computerized training tools and a group-based format recurred across studies, CR/FR paradigms targeting different cognitive and functional domains showed specificity of training focus to outcomes. Effect sizes were in the medium-large range, suggesting that patients with BD respond to treatment at or above the level reported in psychotic patients. Integrated approaches that combined cognitive exercises with group-based experiences were associated with both cognitive and functional improvements. Conclusions: In this review, we found support for the use of CR/FR paradigms in patients with BD with evidence of cognitive and functional improvements. The scarcity of currently published RCTs as well as of data examining mechanisms of action and neural correlates limits the generalizability of our findings.

190,Physical health in individuals with psychiatric disorders in Austria,"Introduction: The association between severe psychiatric disorders and metabolic syndrome is well documented and goes along with a reduced life expectancy. The prevalence of medical comorbidities in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders in Austria has not yet been examined; aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of comorbid somatic disorder in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders in Austria. Methods: Patients ( n = 600) with a life-time diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders undergoing a six-week course of intensive treatment in a psychiatric rehabilitation center were recruited. Prevalent somatic and psychological conditions, anamnestic data, medical history, blood samples, clinical and psychological tests as well as medication were examined to determine somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Metabolic disorders were highly prevalent especially in individuals diagnosed with affective disorders, respectively in bipolar disorder. Furthermore, obesity and thyroid dysfunction were found in about 40% of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the present study. Significant gender differences were found in CVD and hypertension with higher prevalence in men, while thyroid dysfunction occurred more often in women also compared to the general female population. Conclusions: Characterizing somatic comorbidity in individuals with psychiatric disorders can stimulate research to better understand possible shared etiologic factors and has public health implications for improving models of care. This could have a positive effect on the course of mental disorders, and additionally improve social integration and life expectancy. Knowledge about sex differences should be used to further improve individualized treatment of individuals with psychiatric disorders.

191,"Psychological burden of PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity in the U.S. veteran population: Suicidality, functioning, and service utilization","Background: Emerging evidence suggests that comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD) may impose an even greater burden than either disorder alone. However, nearly all previous studies examining these associations have relied on treatment-seeking samples. This study examined the mental health burden associated with co-occurring PTSD/MDD compared to PTSD and MDD alone using a nationally representative sample of U.S. veterans. Methods: Data were analyzed from National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative survey of U.S. veterans (n = 2,732). Analyses (a) estimated the current prevalence of PTSD only, MDD only, and comorbid PTSD/MDD; (b) compared demographic/military variables by PTSD/MDD status; and (c) examined associations between PTSD/MDD status and suicidality, functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, and service utilization. Results: The current prevalences of probable PTSD only, probable MDD only, and probable comorbid PTSD/MDD were 1.7%, 4.8%, and 3.4%. Compared to all other groups, the PTSD/MDD group was more likely to screen positive for current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide attempts, probable generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders, and ever utilize mental health services. They also scored lower on measures of mental health functioning (d = 1.49), cognitive functioning (d = 1.03), and quality of life (d = 0.84). Veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD were more than twice as likely as those with PTSD only to have attempted suicide. Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal inference. Conclusions: Results provide a population-based characterization of the psychological burden of PTSD/MDD comorbidity in U.S. veterans. Findings further underscore the importance of screening, monitoring, and treatment of the comorbid manifestation of these disorders.

192,Depressive symptomatology in adolescents in Ghana: Examination of psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9,"Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) has been used extensively in research and clinical settings. However, there is limited information regarding the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 among adolescents, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Data were collected from 553 adolescents (girls = 322, 58.1%) using a cross-sectional survey design to investigate the factorial validity, construct validity and internal consistency of the PHQ-9 in Ghana. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multi-group CFA support a one-factor structure of the PHQ-9 that was invariant across gender. The PHQ-9 correlates significantly with measures of anxiety, depression, mental wellbeing, and suicidal behavior. The internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was 0.71. Limitation: The study did not include a gold standard measure of depression to assess the diagnostic properties (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of the PHQ-9. Conclusion: The results suggest that major depressive disorder, measured by the PHQ-9, is a homogeneous construct across gender and that the PHQ-9 can be used to screen for depressive symptoms in adolescent boys and girls in Ghana.

193,Potential predictors of depressive relapse following repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A systematic review,"Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is widely approved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, around 50% of individuals who recover from depression following rTMS interventions experience a relapse of depressive symptomatology by 12 months. The short-term durability of the rTMS treatment effect has been systematically investigated. However, variables relating to the long-term durability of the antidepressant effect produced by rTMS are less understood. Therefore, the current review systematically assessed the research on variables relating to relapse following rTMS. Method: This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive electronic literature search for terms related to relapse following rTMS treatment for MDD was performed on studies published before the end of October 2018. Results: A total of 18 studies assessing relapse related variables were identified. While there is some indication that comorbid anxiety, acute response, and residual symptomatology may hold predictive potential for depressive relapse following rTMS treatment, findings were not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. Discussion: Identified studies assessed three main categories of variables including demographic information, clinical characteristics and rating scale scores, and rTMS treatment specific factors. Only a small number of studies were available, and considerable inconsistency exists between studies, only limited conclusions were able to be drawn. Conclusion: More studies assessing a wider range of predictor variables such as cognitive or neuroimaging markers are needed.

194,Relationship between internet addiction and depression among Japanese university students,"Background: Internet addiction (IA) has various adverse effects. We sought to elucidate the relationship between IA and depression among university students and to identify factors associated with IA. Methods: Anonymous, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 5,261 students and comprised basic characteristics, lifestyle habits, anxieties, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Center for Epidemiological Self-Depression Scale. Results: Responses were obtained from 4,490 students (response rate: 85.3%). After excluding those with missing responses, 3,251 participants were analyzed (valid response rate: 61.8%). Logistic regression analysis with severity of IA as the independent variable and depression as the dependent variable revealed that the odds ratio (OR) for depression increased with severity of IA (mild addiction: OR = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.45−3.36; severe addiction: OR = 7.31, 95% CI = 4.61−11.61). In a logistic regression analysis with mobile phone use as the independent variable and IA as the dependent variable, the highest OR was for message board use (OR = 3.74, 95% CI = 2.53−5.53) and the lowest OR was for use of LINE instant messenger (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.49−0.70). Logistic regression analysis with academic department as the independent variable and internet addiction as the dependent variable revealed high ORs for the humanities department (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.18−2.16) and fine arts department (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07−2.23). Limitations: The main limitations were the cross-sectional design, low valid response rate, single-university setting, and possible social desirability bias. Conclusions: Our results suggest a relationship between IA and depression in university students. IA tendency differed according to mobile phone use and academic department, suggesting these factors are associated with IA.

195,Bipolar disorder comorbidity in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: Prevalence and predictors,"Background: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with comorbidities, mainly anxiety and affective disorders, which may influence OCD course, help-seeking and treatment response. Some authors have studied bipolar disorder (BD) comorbidity in patients with OCD, but usually in small samples. The objective was to estimate the lifetime prevalence of BD in a large clinical sample of OCD patients, and to compare demographic and clinical features of patients with and without BD comorbidity. Method: This cross-sectional study with 955 adult OCD patients from the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders (C-TOC) used several assessment instruments, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were followed by logistic regression. Results: The lifetime prevalence of BD was 7.75% ( N = 74). The variables that were independently associated with BD comorbidity were: panic disorder with agoraphobia, impulse control disorders, and suicide attempts. Limitations: The cross-sectional design does not permit causal inferences; the external validity may be limited, as the participants were from tertiary services. Despite the large sample size, some analyses may have been underpowered due to the relatively low prevalence of the outcome and of some explanatory variables. Conclusions: Patients with OCD comorbid with BD have some clinical features indicative of greater severity, including higher suicide risk, and require a careful therapeutic approach for the appropriate treatment of both disorders.

196,Validation of the MGMQ in screening for emotional difficulties in women during pregnancy,"Background: Screening for emotional health difficulties in pregnant or postpartum women is becoming routine practice in health services. This screening is often done using the EPDS, usually using a screen positive score just to identify possible depression. This and other such scales often have a myriad of screen-positive scores, making them impractical within clinical settings. The recent MGMQ screens for a variety of negative moods, is brief, simple, and has just a few screen-positive thresholds. Method: At recruitment 391 women attending routine antenatal clinics completed various mood questionnaires. Several weeks later they were re-contacted by phone, at which time 247–252 of them provided valid data on the MGMQ, EPDS, and a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety disorders (numbers vary depending upon valid combinations). Results: The MGMQ showed good-excellent receiver operating characteristics (sensitivity specificity, positive predictive value) against diagnostic status for depression or anxiety disorders. It also showed good concurrent and concordant validity with the EPDS, and good discriminant validity between women with clinical and subclinical diagnostic caseness. Stability over several weeks was however low, indicating that, as with other measures, women's mood can naturally change during the perinatal period. Limitations: The findings only apply to English-speaking antenatal women from Sydney, Australia. Conclusion: The MGMQ has good psychometric properties when compared to the usual gold-standard applied to emotional health screening measures. Its brevity, simplicity to ‘score’ and interpret, together with its clinically useful questions, suggest it could be a practical alternative to other more complicated mood screening measures for perinatal women.

197,Racing thoughts revisited: A key dimension of activation in bipolar disorder,"Background: Racing and crowded thoughts are frequently reported respectively in manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (BD). However, questionnaires assessing this symptom are lacking. Here we aimed to investigate racing thoughts across different mood episodes of BD through a self-report questionnaire that we developed, the 34-item Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire (RCTQ). In addition to assessing its factor structure and validity, we were interested in the RCTQ's ability to discriminate mixed and non-mixed depression. Methods: 221 BD patients and 120 controls were clinically assessed via the YMRS (mania) and the QIDS-C16 (depression), then fulfilled the RCTQ, rumination, worry, and anxiety measures. Three depression groups were operationalized according to YMRS scores: YMRS scores 2 &gt; 6 and YMRS scores = 1 or 2, for respectively mixed and non-pure depression, and YMRS = 0 for pure-depression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the three-factor model of the RCTQ yielded the best fit indices, which improved after the removal of redundant items, resulting in a 13-item questionnaire. Hypomanic and anxiety symptoms were the main predictors of scores; rumination was not a significant predictor. RCTQ results were similar between mixed groups and non-pure depression, and both were higher than in pure-depression. Limitations: Patients’ pharmacological treatment might have influenced the results. Conclusions: The 13-item RCTQ captures different facets of racing thoughts heightened in hypomanic and mixed states, but also in depression with subclinical hypomanic/activation symptoms (e.g. non-pure depression characterized by enhanced subjective irritability), suggesting that it is particularly sensitive to activation symptoms in BD, and could become a valuable tool in the follow-up of patients.

198,"The effects of cognitive remediation in patients with affective psychosis: A systematic review: Special section on “translational and neuroscience studies in affective disorders”. Section editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and related illnesses are associated with significant impairment in cognitive functioning which is among the strongest predictors of disability and poor quality of life. Cognitive remediation (CR) was developed as a set of behavioral interventions directly targeting cognitive symptoms. Studies have shown that CR produces cognitive improvements in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that may be associated with improvements in functioning. However, the relative efficacy of CR across diagnoses has not been established. Indirect evidence suggests that CR is effective in patients with affective illness as well as patients with schizophrenia (SZ); however, the one study to evaluate the effects of diagnosis on outcomes directly in patients with SZ versus schizoaffective disorder (SZA) found no differences by diagnosis. Methods: In this systematic review, we evaluated cognitive and functional outcomes after CR in studies including patients with SZA, and examined specificity of training content to outcomes. Results: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria: 10 studies that compared CR to a control condition ( n = 779) and 6 comparative effectiveness studies. None of the studies explicitly compared patients by diagnosis. Studies included a mixture of patients with SZA or SZ. Of the CR versus control studies, effect sizes for cognitive outcomes were moderate-large ( d = .36–.94). Studies comparing CR paradigms targeting different cognitive domains showed specificity of training focus to outcomes. Five of studies reported significant functional improvement after CR as secondary outcomes. Conclusions: In this review, we found support for the use of CR paradigms in patients with affective psychosis, with evidence that reported treatment effects in mixed affective and non-affective samples are at or above the levels previously reported in SZ. However, lack of availability of data directly comparing patients by diagnosis or examining moderator or mediator effects of diagnosis or diagnosis-related patient characteristics limits our understanding of the relative efficacy of CR across patient group.

199,"Role of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in depression: Translational evidence: Special section on “translational and neuroscience studies in affective disorders”. Section editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Antidepressants have a low rate of response paired with a delayed onset of action. Translational studies are thus seeking for novel targets for antidepressant drug development. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in mood and stress response, even if drugs targeting this system have not yet become available for clinical use. The dietary supplement N-Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a fatty acid amide belonging to the endocannabinoid system with potential antidepressant properties. Methods: We performed a bibliographic search to review current knowledge on the potential antidepressant effects of PEA and its underlying mechanism of action. Results: PEA targets not only the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), but also the endocannabinoid system, binding the G-protein-coupled receptor 55, a non-CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptor, and also the CB₁/CB₂ receptors, although with a weak affinity. Preclinical studies have shown antidepressant activity of PEA in animal paradigms of depression and of depression associated with neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury. In a translational perspective, PEA is increased in stress conditions, and a randomized, double-blind study in depressed patients indicated a fast-antidepressant action of PEA when associated with citalopram. Limitations: There are still limited preclinical and clinical studies investigating the effect of PEA upon the endocannabinoid system and its potential as antidepressant. Conclusions: PEA has potential antidepressant effects alone or in combinations with other classes of antidepressants. Future studies in depressed patients are needed to confirm the mood-modulating properties of PEA and its role as a biomarker of depression.

Fond et al. published data from a national online survey involving 2165 French interns (residents), 302 in psychiatry and 1863 in other specialties. Interns in psychiatry reported increased substance use behaviors (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis), were more exposed to violence during medical studies, were more frequently treated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist and used more often antidepressants and anxiolytic. Pointing out that medical students experience high rates of depression and suicidal ideation, the authors suggest that, according to their findings, interns in psychiatry are more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders.

201,Applications of the Chinese version of the primary care PTSD screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) for children,"Background: Effective screening is important for public mental health services. Although the primary care PTSD screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) is useful in screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults, its reliability and validity for use in children remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the performance characteristics of the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 for children in children aged 8 to 16 years. Methods: 4,022 rural children from Grades 4 to 9 in China were included in this study. All participants were assessed for PTSD using the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 for children and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and assessed for anxiety using the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C), and for depression using the Children's Depression Inventory - Short Form (CDI-S). The performance characteristics of the PC-PTSD-5 for children were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results: The mean scores on the PCL-5 and the PC-PTSD-5 were 17.45 ( SD = 14.78) and 1.78 ( SD = 1.33), respectively. There was a significant correlation between the PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5 ( r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.001), and small but significant correlations of the PC-PTSD-5 with the CSAS-C ( r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001) and CDI-S ( r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001). In this study, 2 and 3 were both found to be acceptable cutoff values. A cutoff value of 2 yielded a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.52, while a cutoff of 3 had sensitivity = 0.57, and specificity = 0.77. Limitations: A clinical interview was not used to validated diagnostic findings. Conclusions: The reliability and validity of the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 were statistically acceptable for screening for probable PTSD in children. Additionally, the Chinese PC-PTSD-5 had a favorable sensitivity at a cut off 2 and a favorable specificity at a cut off 3, based on PCL-5 results.

The authors regret the exclusion of the following cited reference: Smith, S.M., Stinson, F.S., Dawson, D.A., Goldstein, R., Huang, B., Grant, B.F., 2006. Race/ethnic differences in the prevalence and cooccurrence of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Psychol. Med. 36, 987-998.] Background: American Indian people have high suicide rates. However, little epidemiological data is available on depression prevalence, a suicide risk factor, in this population. Some research suggests that depression scales may perform differently for American Indian people. However, the Patient Health Questionnnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a depression scale widely-used in clinical practice, had not been assessed for cross-cultural measurement invariance with American Indian people. Methods: In this retrospective study of existing electronic health record (EHR) data in an upper Midwestern healthcare system, we assessed the measurement invariance of the standard one-factor PHQ-9 and five previously identified two-factor models for 4443 American Indian and 4443 Caucasian American adults (age &gt; = 18) with a PHQ-9 in the EHR from 12/1/2005 to 12/31/2017. We also conducted subgroup analyses with adults ages &gt; = 65. Results: Models showed good fits (e.g., CFI &gt; 0.99, RMSEA &lt; 0.05) and internal consistency reliability (ordinal alpha &gt; 0.80). All models displayed measurement invariance between racial groups. Factor correlation was high for two-factor models, providing support for the one-factor model. American Indian adults had significantly higher odds of PHQ-9 total scores &gt; = 10 and &gt; = 15 than Caucasian American adults. Limitations: Data came from a single healthcare system. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 exhibited cross-cultural measurement invariance between American Indian and Caucasian American adults, supporting the PHQ-9 as a depression screening tool in this clinical care population. American Indian adults also had higher levels of depression than Caucasian Americans. Future research could confirm the generalizability of our findings to other American Indian populations.

203,The course and clinical correlates of obsessive-compulsive disorder during the postpartum period: A naturalistic observational study,"Background: In this study, we aimed to investigate the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the demographic and clinical correlates associated with significant changes in symptom severity in postpartum women. Methods: Data were collected form 37 consecutive postpartum women who were diagnosed with OCD during psychiatric interviews by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Psychiatric assessments were carried out on the first day after delivery and at 6 to 8 weeks in the postpartum period. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was administered at both assessments while the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Coping orientation to problems Experienced (COPE) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A), were administered to the participants at the first assessment. Results: The mean score of Y-BOCS was significantly reduced from the baseline to the 6–8 week postpartum period. The proportion of patients with a decreaseof at least 35% in the total score of Y-BOCS during the postpartum period was 43.2%. When the patient groups with and without ≥ 35% decrease in the total score of Y-BOCS were compared, the group showing the decrease had a higher score of COPE-supression of competing activities, COPE-humor and TEMPS-A-hyperthymic affective temperament and more frequently reported a decrease in the severity of OCD symptoms after a previous childbirth. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the last two variables could accurately predict a ≥ 35 decrease in the severity of OCD symptoms during the postpartum period. Limitations: The study has relatively small sample size. Conclusions: The current results suggest that patients with OCD who exhibit hyperthymic affective temperament character and a decrease in symptoms following a previous childbirth may experience a significant alleviation in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the postpartum period.

204,Clinical utility of the CBCL Dysregulation Profile in children with disruptive behavior,"Background: Children who are severely dysregulated experience a range of concurrent and long-term impairments and psychopathology and are particularly at-risk for mood and anxiety disorders. The Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) may be useful in identifying children who are highly dysregulated, which could facilitate early intervention. Methods: We examined the prevalence, gender differences, parent-teacher agreement, and concurrent validity of two categorical definitions of the CBCL-DP in 348 children ages 6–12 who were clinic-referred for assessment and treatment because of disruptive behavior. Results: Rates of the CBCL-DP were 3 times higher when a less stringent versus a more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used (46.8% vs. 15.2%). Girls were more likely than boys to meet criteria for the CBCL-DP when the more stringent definition was used. Parent-teacher agreement was low, particularly when the more stringent definition of the CBCL-DP was used. Children with the CBCL-DP were rated by their parents, but not their teachers, as more impaired than other children, regardless of the definition of the CBCL-DP used, and even when compared to children with clinically elevated scores on other CBCL subscales. Limitations: Our cross-sectional data did not allow us to examine the predictive validity of the CBCL-DP, informant effects may have inflated associations between CBCL-DP and parent-rated impairment, and teacher ratings were missing for many children. Conclusions: Our findings support other reports that provide evidence that the CBCL-DP may identify a particularly symptomatic and impaired group of children with disruptive behavior, as rated by their parents.

205,Source activity during emotion processing and its relationship to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Neural mechanisms contributing to an underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. An effective method to probe cognitive processing deficits in PD is the examination of brain activity during emotional processes, particularly in explicit language emotion recognition contexts. Methods: The present study utilised cortical source imaging of event related potentials (ERP) from electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate valence judgements on negative and neutral target words in an automatic affective priming paradigm. Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed affective priming tasks during EEG monitoring. Cognitive impairment was measured using the validated Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS). Results: Results reveal that compared to healthy age-matched controls, PD patients demonstrate a reduced N400 activation during affective priming tasks in bilateral regions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and, notably, have a late wave ERP component (LPP) in left MFG, present between 600 and 800 ms, following family-wise error correction ( p FWE &lt; 0.05). LPP in PD patients were significantly associated with PD-CRS scores. Limitations: Although affective priming paradigms are an effective means for various domains of cognition, it is not a focused cognitive behavioural test for cognitive dysfunction. Our study is thus limited to a surrogate measure of cognitive dysfunction via examination of emotional word processing cues. Conclusions: These findings suggest that source imaging methods with ERP paradigms in PD are effective in identifying delayed cognitive processes in PD.

The purpose of this study was to discover the potential physical symptoms predictors for suicidal ideation in college freshmen. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in a randomly selected freshmen population in Wuhan China ( N = 2449). Questionnaire evaluated suicidal ideation as well as related psychosocial risks and gastrointestinal (GI) physical symptoms. The association between the suicidal ideation and potential predictors was analyzed by Mann–Whitney test and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 2053 (83.8%) completed this survey and 64 (3.1%) was reported to have suicidal ideation. Anxiety (OR 5.44(2.40–12.35)), depression (OR 8.36(3.90–17.94)) and chronic abdominal discomfort (OR 2.06(1.07–3.94)) were independent predictors for suicidal ideation. In freshmen with chronic abdominal discomfort, interestingly, defecation disorder( P = 0.01) and low satisfaction of defecation ( P = 0.04) was associated with high risk for suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Defecation disorders were associated with high risk of suicidal intention in young adult with chronic abdominal discomfort. Our result implied that clinicians should be vigilant for suicidal ideation in chronic abdominal discomfort patients, especially those with defecation disorders.

207,Examining the relationship between negative affect and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among smokers using ecological momentary assessment,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and negative affect (e.g., anger, depression, anxiety), are highly co-occurring. It remains unclear whether changes in PTSD symptoms subsequently impact negative affect, or vice versa. This study assessed associations between moment-to-moment PTSD symptoms and negative affect in a sample of smokers with PTSD to determine directionality of this relationship. Methods: Participants ( N = 125) enrolled in two smoking cessation studies with co-occurring PTSD and cigarette use completed measures of PTSD and negative affect. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology was used to record symptoms during a one-week baseline period, during which participants smoked ad lib . Cross-lagged path analyses assessed PTSD symptoms and negative affect for directionality of their relationship, controlling for whether an EMA reading was smoking or non-smoking. Path analyses examined the lagged associations between PTSD symptoms and negative affect. Results: Results found PTSD symptom severity at T-1 was significantly related to negative affect levels at time T, but negative affect at time T-1 was not associated with PTSD symptom severity at time T. Results indicated the model retaining the cross-lagged effect of PTSD symptom severity on negative affect provided better fit to the data than other models. Limitations: Limitations included use of self-report data, brief measures of symptoms, participants already had PTSD and/or MDD, participants were recruited from a specific clinical population, and use of DSM-IV data. Conclusions: Results suggest PTSD symptoms drive day-to-day fluctuations in negative affect, and highlight the importance of evaluating negative affect in the treatment of PTSD.

208,The relationship of physical activity to mental health: A 2015 behavioral risk factor surveillance system data analysis,"Introduction: Available literature has repeatedly ascertained the inverse relationship of physical activity to mental health. Engaging in regular physical activity decreases symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress in a dose-responsive manner. Methods: Cross-sectional, national data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were analyzed to establish the relationship between physical activity and days of poor mental health. The association between physical activity and days of poor mental health was assessed by multiple linear regression using SAS. Results: Findings support the assumption of an inverse dose-response relationship between physical activity levels and self-reported days of poor mental health. Individuals who engage in higher levels of physical activity reported significantly fewer days of poor mental health when compared to those who reported low or no physical activity (e.g. −2.23, 95%CI (−2.31, −2.15)) for highly active vs. inactive individuals (unadjusted model)). Furthermore, individuals who only met the guidelines for aerobic exercise reported significantly fewer days of poor mental health than those who only met the muscle strengthening guidelines (−0.85 (95% CI: −0.98, −0.73)). Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional study design, the direction of the relationship is unknown and reverse causation is possible. Conclusion: Higher physical activity levels were associated with fewer self-reported days of poor mental health, which reiterates the important association between physical activity and mental health with national data. The findings of this study could prove to be valuable for developing interventions aimed at improving mental health. Nonetheless, several research gaps persist that warrant further empirical inquiry.

209,Evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a cognitive behavior therapy-based transdiagnostic program for emotional problems in children in a regular school setting,"Background: The present study examined the real-world effectiveness of a transdiagnostic prevention program, Super Skills for Life (SSL), among children with emotional problems in regular school settings. SSL is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), behavioral activation, and social skills training. Methods: Participants were 205 children, aged 8–12 years, who were referred by their teachers as having significant emotional problems. All the children completed measures of emotional and behavioral problems and self-esteem, both before and after participating in SSL, and at six months after the intervention. The children's parents and class teachers also completed a questionnaire that measures children's general difficulties and positive attributes. Children also gave a 2-minute speech task in front of the video in sessions 1 and 8. Results: There was agreement among self, parent, and teacher report, showing significant decreases of emotional symptoms from pretest to posttest and pretest to follow-up. Main effect of gender was significant for anxiety symptoms, emotional symptoms peer problems, and prosocial behavior. Video analysis of the 2-minute speech task showed significant improvement in length of eye gaze, vocal quality, length of speech, manifestation of comfort, and conversational flow. However, hypothesized increases in self-esteem did not act as a mediator of change in pre- to post-anxiety symptoms or social phobia subscale scores. Limitations: The present study used an open clinical trial design. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for the effectiveness of the manual-guided CBT for emotional problems in regular school settings when delivered by school services staff.

210,Disagreement and factors between symptom on self-report and clinician rating of major depressive disorder: A report of a national survey in China,"Background: Measurement-based care (MBC) is a popular strategy of clinical management for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The consistency of self-report and clinical measurements is of importance, but whether individual symptom severity is in agreement for both self-report and clinician rating in MDD has not been comprehensively tested. This study aimed to test whether individual symptom severity of MDD was in agreement between self-report and clinician rating, and to explore factors affecting the agreement. Methods: In the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) of China, 3275 patients with a major depressive episode were evaluated by both self-report and a clinician-rated version of 62 questions. Results: On average, 59% of all patients reached absolute agreement with their research clinicians. Among all questions, 73% returned with moderate positive strength of correlation, followed by 27% with low positive correlation. In 77% of the total questions, there was a tendency to rate higher in the self-report version compared with the clinician-rated version. After classifying the symptoms by six major domains, it was found that patients and clinicians showed more consistent answers in history and somatic questions (81% and 65% reached agreement), and that there were more differences in mood, energy, and anxiety questions (up to 56% in full agreement). “Outpatient”, “high financial status”, “poor working condition”, and “high education level” were found to be significant positive predictors for patients rating higher than clinicians or patients and clinicians reaching agreement as opposed to clinicians rating higher than patients. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of our study undermines the interpretation of the results across the MDD treatment course. Conclusions: It is sufficient to use the self-report version of a questionnaire to screen, monitor, and detect remission for MDD symptoms. Complete assessment of depression severity should take both clinician-rated scales and self-reported measures into consideration. Factors other than source of admission, financial status, working condition, and education level should be further investigated for the discrepancy between self-report and clinician rating.

211,Efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy with medication for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: A multicentre randomised controlled trial in China,"Background: Meta-analyses support the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in Western cultures. However, there are no adequately powered multicentre studies in China. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of treatment with CBT combined with medication and medication alone in OCD patients in China. Methods: OCD patients ( N = 167) were recruited from outpatient clinics at three large tertiary psychiatric hospitals and one general hospital in China. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either CBT combined with medication ( n = 92) or medication alone ( n = 75) for a 24-week treatment period. Participants’ symptoms and social functioning were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity (CGI-S) at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks, and the effectiveness of the two treatments compared using linear mixed-effects models. Results: At 24 weeks, both groups showed large within-group effects in all measures. Significantly more patients receiving combined therapy than medication alone had a decrease in symptom severity of at least 35% (based on Y-BOCS total score). The CGI-S and GAF scores decreased in both groups, and significant differences were found between the groups. Limitations: Study limitations included lack of consideration of medication types and dosages, and the absence of a CBT-only arm. Conclusions: CBT combined with medication may be effective in alleviating symptoms and social functioning impairment associated with OCD, and is more effective than medication alone in China, particularly for the treatment of compulsive behaviours.

212,Psychological interventions for young people at risk for bipolar disorder: A systematic review,"Objectives: Several studies have recently been conducted that have explored the benefits of psychological interventions in reducing symptomatology or improving outcomes in young people at-risk of developing bipolar disorder. The aim of this review was to explore if such interventions reduce current psychiatric symptoms and prevent the development of new symptoms. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and SCOPUS from January 1990 until August 2018. The inclusion criteria were young people aged under 30 years with a family history of bipolar disorder and any empirical studies that contained a psychological or psychoeducation intervention. Results: A total of 7 articles ( N = 138, 55 males) were included (mean age ranged from 12 to 15 years). Interventions conducted included Family Focussed Therapy, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy, and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Children. Significant results were found in some studies, depending on the sample's initial symptoms, with reduced time to relapse and reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression and hypo/mania being found. Limitations: No studies have explored if interventions may delay the time to onset of first hypo/manic episodes and only two randomised controlled trials were identified. Conclusions: Some significant results were noted with lower symptoms of anxiety, depression and hypo/mania being found in some studies. It is currently unclear if psychological interventions may prevent the development of bipolar disorder or other psychiatric symptoms over time; further longitudinal studies are required.

213,Temperament and character influence on depression treatment outcome,"Background: Personality features have been repeatedly associated with depression treatment outcome in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), however conclusive results are still lacking. Moreover, as for Bipolar Disorder (BD), results are only few and preliminary. Aim: : the aim of the present study was to perform an exploratory investigation of the influence of personality traits as assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), on principal depression treatment outcomes (non remission, non response and resistance). Methods: : 743 mood disorders patients (455 MDD (61.24%) and 288 BD (38.76%)) were recruited in the context of 6 European studies. Generalized logit models were performed to test the effects of TCI dimensions on treatment outcomes, considering possible confounders such as age, gender and education. Positive results were controlled for comorbidities (anxiety and substance use disorders) as well. Results: : MDD Non-Remitters showed high Harm Avoidance (HA) and Self Transcendence (ST) ( p = 0.0004, d = 0.40; p = 0.007, d = 0.36 respectively) and low Persistence (P) and Self Directedness (SD) ( p = 0.05; d = 0.18; p = 0.002, d = 0.40, respectively); MDD Non-Responders showed a slightly different profile with high HA and low Reward Dependence (RD) and SD; finally, MDD Resistants showed low RD, P and Cooperativeness (C). In BD patients, only higher HA in non response was observed. Limitations: : the retrospective cross-sectional design, the TCI assessment regardless of the mood state and the small number of bipolar patients represent the main limitations. Conclusion: : specific TCI personality traits are associated with depression treatment outcome in MDD patients. The inclusion of such personality traits, together with other socio-demographic and clinical predictors, could ameliorate the accuracy of the prediction models available to date.

214,Neuroticism and chronicity as predictors of 9-year course of individual depressive symptoms,"Background: The large between-person differences in symptomatology suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder. However, symptom-specific prospective studies are scarce. We hypothesized that chronicity (i.e., being depressed for 24 months during a patient's preceding 48 months at baseline) and neuroticism at baseline would predict adverse course trajectories over 9 years of follow up with differential magnitudes for individual depressive symptoms. Methods: In total, 560 patients with a current MDD were included from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA-cohort). We used a multivariate linear mixed model with repeated measures, with a history of chronicity and neuroticism separately as main independent variables and with Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (IDS-SR) item scores as outcome variables. For each individual symptom, the model was adjusted for age, gender, and baseline depression severity. Results: Patients were on average 42.7 ( SD = 12.1) years old and 64.7% were women. Patients with chronic depression or high levels of neuroticism showed similar absolute rates of decline over time compared to their counterparts. However, because symptoms had higher starting points for mood, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms (in that order), symptom severity remained higher over time. Chronicity and neuroticism were especially linked to persistent low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity. Limitations: Neuroticism is partly state dependent and likely affected by depression severity. Conclusions: Chronicity and neuroticism predict long-term persistence of diverse psychiatric symptoms, in particular low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity.

215,Effectiveness and harms of mental health treatments in service members and veterans with deployment-related mild traumatic brain injury,"Background: Co-morbidity of psychiatric conditions with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common among service members and Veterans from recent deployments. Practice guidelines for mild TBI (mTBI) recommend management of co-occurring psychiatric conditions with existing treatments, but it is unclear whether the effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions is impacted by mTBI. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal ideation or attempts, and anxiety disorders in the presence of co-morbid deployment-related mTBI. Methods: We searched bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed, English language studies published from 2000 to October 2017. Two reviewers independently completed abstract triage and full text review. Results: We identified 7 studies (5 pre-post and 2 secondary analysis). Six assessed psychotherapy and one reported on hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO₂). Studies comparing outcomes by TBI history found that a history of TBI does not affect treatment outcomes. Harms were reported only for HBO₂ and were mild. No study examined the effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders or suicidal ideation, or the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for the psychiatric conditions of interest in service members and Veterans with mTBI. Limitations: Studies lacked usual care or wait-list control groups and no randomized trials were found, making the strength of evidence insufficient. Conclusions: Evidence is insufficient to fully assess the impact of TBI on the effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions. Higher quality evidence with definitive guidance for providers treating this population is needed.

216,Assessing interpersonal and mood factors to predict trajectories of suicidal ideation within an inpatient setting,"Background: A limited amount of research has assessed how suicide risk changes over time, and how changes can be predicted. The current study assessed suicidal ideation and risk factors throughout inpatient visits to a psychiatric facility to refine prediction of suicide risk. Method: In total, 491 patients (73% Female; mean age = 39.21) at a psychiatric inpatient facility self-reported the frequency of their suicidal thoughts, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, hopelessness, depression, and anxiety in the prior 24 h on a daily basis. Levels of suicidal ideation and risk factors at each quarter of an inpatient's stay were identified, and latent class growth analysis used to identify common patterns of change over time. Results: Changes in mood and interpersonal factors were associated with changes in suicidal ideation over days and weeks. Further, they contributed to the prediction of future levels of suicidal ideation. Thwarted belongingness at admission predicted whether patients had pervasively high suicidal thoughts over the course of inpatient visits or showed marked improvements, while perceived burdensomeness predicted which patients would develop suicidal thoughts during their visit. Limitations: The use of single item measures may limit specificity of measurement of suicide risk factors. Hourly, rather than daily measurement used in the current study, may more accurately identify suicide risk. Conclusions: Change in suicidal ideation is associated with changes in a number of psychological risk factors. Regular assessment of interpersonal risk factors may identify warning signs and aid clinical interventions in reducing suicidal thoughts and associated self-injurious behaviours.

217,"A panel of miRNAs is involved in the effect of sertraline on panic disorder, as implicated by a microarray-based analysis","Background: MiRNAs are considered to be significant contributors to the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases, but little is known about the potential roles of miRNAs in the treatment effect of panic disorder (PD). Therefore, we aimed to identify the miRNAs association with PD over the course of sertraline treatment. Methods: Sixty-seven patients were collected for a 6-week period of sertraline treatment, and evaluated using HAMD-17, HAMA-14 and PDSS both at the baseline and 6 weeks later. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment, respectively. Ten pairs of samples were analyzed using miRNA array, and the differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated using RT-PCR in the whole sample. Results: miR-451a, miR-144-5p, miR-25-3p and miR-660-5p were found to be significantly up-regulated, while miR-1 and miR-148-5p significantly down-regulated after sertraline treatment. The change of miR-25-3p before and after treatment (△miR-25-3p) was positively related to both the changes of PDSS3 scores (△PDSS3) (p = 0.017, 31.5% contribution) and △ PDSS7 (p = 0.016, 32.3% contribution). The △miR-660-5p was positively related to both the △HAMA5 (p = 0.03, 26% contribution) and △PDSS7 (p = 0.032). The △miR-148-5p was positively related to the △PDSS4 (p = 0.046, 21.5% contribution), but negatively related to the △HAMA13 (p = 0.005, 41.9% contribution). The △miR-144-5p was negatively related to the △HAMA9 (p = 0.032, 25.3% contribution). Conclusions: These findings might provide some evidences to the involvement of miRNA in the effect of anti-anxiety agents, which contributed to the better understanding the disease and developing new therapeutic genetic targets.

218,"Relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms, caregiving response, and parent mental health in youth exposed to single incident trauma","Background: Family factors may alter the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression in young people after a traumatic event, but it is not clear which modifiable family variables can be addressed in psychological therapies. This study examined the relationships between family factors (Expressed Emotion [EE] and family accommodation) and psychopathology (posttraumatic stress symptoms; PTSS) in young people following a single incident trauma. Potential mediators of these relationships were also investigated. Method: Sixty-six parent-child dyads (aged 8–17 years) were assessed within one month of attending an Emergency Department. Self-reported PTSS and perceived EE were assessed in young people. Parents’ own PTSS, mood symptoms, EE, and accommodating behaviours were also assessed. Results: Cross-sectional analyses revealed that young person-perceived EE, parent-reported emotional over involvement (EOI) and accommodation behaviours significantly predicted higher PTSS in young people. The stress experienced as a consequence of EE mediated the relationship between young person-perceived EOI and PTSS in young people. Parental PTSS and anxiety were positively correlated with EOI and accommodation. Parental PTSS was not significantly associated with symptoms in young people. Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that EE and accommodation are positively associated with PTSS in young people in the month following a potentially traumatic event. Understanding the child in the context of their family environment and relationships offers an important framework for making sense of and facilitating adaptive adjustment following a traumatic event.

219,Brief mindfulness-based stress management program for a better mental state in working populations—Happy Nurse Project: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: The efficacy of the mindfulness-based stress management program for maintaining a better mental state has not been examined among working populations. We aimed to explore the effectiveness of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program for hospital nurses. Methods: In a multi-center randomized trial, 80 junior nurses working in hospitals were randomly allocated either to the brief mindfulness-based stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet. The program consisted of four 30 min individual sessions conducted by trained senior nurses using a detailed manual. The primary outcome was the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at week 26. Secondary outcomes included presence of a major depressive episode; severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and presenteeism; utility scores; and adverse events up to 52 weeks. Results: The mean HADS score of all the participants at baseline was 7.2. At 26 weeks, adjusted mean scores on the HADS score were 7.2 (95% confidence intervals: 5.9, 8. 5) in the program group and 6.0 (4.8, 7.2) in the leaflet group, respectively. The coefficient of the group by time interaction was not statistically significant at -1.41 (-3.35, 0.54; P = 0.156). No significant superiority or inferiority was observed on the other outcomes. Limitations: We did not manage to recruit the number of participants we initially set out, although our post-hoc analyses showed that this did not lead to changes in our conclusions. Conclusions: The additive value of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program was not confirmed in mental state and self-evaluated work efficiency.

220,Physical activity as prognostic factor for bipolar disorder: An 18-month prospective study,"Introduction: Exercise is an adjuvant therapy indicated for various psychiatric disorders. However, prospective studies in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are scarce and with uncertain conclusions. This study aims to evaluate physical activity as a prognostic factor for BD, analyzing relationship with levels of anxiety, functionality, sleep, mood episodes and hospitalizations. Methods: Three psychiatrists interviewed 80 BD outpatients in euthymia, referred from four different institutions in Brazil. In this moment, they evaluated the intensity of physical activities using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)—short form. They reevaluated patients and reviewed medical records monthly for 18 months to identify mood episodes and psychiatric hospitalizations. Results: Thirty-eight patients (47.5%) were physically inactive (or sedentary) and 42 (52.5%) active. Physically active patients had lower Body Mass Index ( p = 0.006), waist circumference ( p = 0.002), lower levels of anxiety ( p = 0.032) and less insomnia ( p = 0.001). Sedentary individuals revealed poorer global functioning ( p &lt; 0.001) and in all domains: autonomy ( p &lt; 0.001), occupational functioning ( p = 0.008), cognitive functioning ( p = 0.013), capacity of managing the finances ( p = 0.012), interpersonal relationships ( p = 0.011) and leisure time ( p = 0.001). Less activity was associated with more mood episodes ( p = 0.042) and psychiatric hospitalizations ( p = 0.043) over 18 months. Conclusion: This study suggested physical activity as a good prognostic factor for BD during euthymia. This reinforces the need to encourage this practice in clinical settings. Future prospective surveys with longer duration using objective instruments are proposed.

221,"Allergies, asthma, and psychopathology in a nationally-representative US sample","Background: Symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety have been associated with immune dysregulation and atopic disorders, however it is unclear whether this relationship spans other forms of psychopathology. The objective of this study was to use a large, population-based sample to examine the association between several common psychiatric conditions and two atopic disorders: seasonal allergies and asthma. This study also examined whether comorbidity between psychiatric disorders confounded the relationship between atopy and each psychiatric disorder. Methods: Data come from the Comprehensive Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, a nationally-representative sample of US adults ( N = 10,309). Lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory. History of seasonal allergies and asthma were assessed by self-report. Weighted logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between allergies and asthma and psychopathology. Psychiatric comorbidities were also examined as potential confounders. Results: Approximately 36.6% had a history of allergies and 11.5% a history of asthma. Seasonal allergies were positively associated with odds of MDD (Odds ratio (OR): 1.24, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.06–1.46), GAD (OR: 1.54 (1.28–1.84)), PD (OR: 1.54 (1.24–1.91)), and PTSD (OR: 1.32 (1.09–1.59)). Asthma was not significantly associated with any psychiatric disorder. All significant associations persisted after adjustment for psychiatric comorbidities. Limitations: Limitations include self-reporting of atopic disorder status and of all disorder ages of onset. Conclusions: This study confirms the association between MDD and PD and seasonal allergies, and extends this relationship to GAD and PTSD.

222,"In vivo molecular chronotyping, circadian misalignment, and high rates of depression in young adults","Background: Young adults are disproportionately affected by depression and related mental disorders. Circadian misalignment (a phase advance or delay in the body's internal clock timing) is thought to exert adverse effects on downstream physiological processes regulating mood. Circadian disruption may represent an additional, under-appreciated risk factor affecting young adults. Here, we test the hypothesis that depression in young adults is associated with circadian misalignment—the lack of concordance between an individual's endogenous rhythm and their external social and academic environment. Methods: We screened 528 individuals for morningness-eveningness diurnal preference and sleep-wake chronotype. We selected individuals with extreme scores ( n = 130) for estimation of circadian phase by measuring clock gene mRNA oscillations in hair follicles (a peripheral clock). Using an independent, data-driven cluster analysis, we define the circadian misalignment of both advanced- and delayed-phase individuals from clock gene mRNA expression levels. We compare depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), social jetlag, sleep duration, and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) scores between misaligned individuals and control individuals of intermediate chronotype ( n = 173). Results: We demonstrate that depression scores in young adults are significantly higher in individuals with circadian phase delays and in individuals with a mismatch between circadian behavioral phenotypes and circadian molecular phase. Evening-type individuals with circadian phase delays are 20 times more likely and mismatched individuals are 5–8 times more likely to be depressed than control individuals. Sleep disturbance shows a similar relationship with circadian phenotypes, but the mood effects described in this study are independent of sleep duration, social jetlag and gender. Limitations: Our study examined peripheral clock genes that represents a circadian rhythm potentially influenced by both intrinsic and external, environmental factors. Our study population spanned a limited age-group and our results cannot distinguish between cause and effect of circadian, sleep and mood variables. Conclusions: Our study validates previous theoretical predictions of circadian effects on mood disorders and highlights a critical, hidden risk factor affecting mood in young adults—circadian disruption.

223,Baseline serum C-reactive protein levels may predict antidepressant treatment responses in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Inflammation has been shown previously to predict antidepressant treatment response. This retrospective study was conducted to test if the baseline serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could predict antidepressant treatment responses in a Chinese sample. Methods: 75 adult inpatients (26 male, 49 female) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed according to DSM-5 were included in this study. Sociodemographic and clinical features, baseline CRP levels, 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) scores assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 were then collected. Afterwards patients were divided into two groups: the low CRP group (baseline CRP &lt; 1 mg/L, n = 47) and the high CRP group (baseline CRP ≥ 1 mg/L, n = 28). Depression severity and treatment response were compared between the two groups. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant group * assessments interaction in HDRS-17 scores ( F = 4.754; p = 0.005). Post-hoc test showed that the two groups differed in HDRS-17 scores at week 4 ( F = 6.698; p = 0.012), with the low CRP group having lower HDRS-17 scores than the high CRP group. Moreover, the low CRP group exhibited higher percent reduction in HDRS-17 scores at week 3 ( F = 5.016; p = 0.028) and week 4 ( F = 9.865; p = 0.003) as compared to the high CRP group. Cox proportional hazard model showed that the remission rate was higher in the low CRP group ( p = 0.010). Limitations: Patients received uncontrolled antidepressant therapy and the sample size was limited. Conclusions: Baseline serum CRP levels may predict antidepressant treatment responses in patients with MDD and patients with higher levels of CRP were less likely to get remission.

Results: Melatonin supplementation significantly decreased Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (β −2.15; 95% CI, −3.62, −0.68; P = 0.005), Beck Depression Inventory index (β −3.62; 95% CI, −5.53, −1.78; P &lt; 0.001) and Beck Anxiety Inventory index (β −1.95; 95% CI, −3.41, −0.48; P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. In addition, melatonin administration, compared with the placebo, significantly reduced serum insulin (β −1.20 µIU/mL; 95% CI, −2.14, −0.26; P = 0.01), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (β −0.28; 95% CI, −0.50, −0.05; P = 0.01), serum total- (β −7.96 mg/dL; 95% CI, −13.75, −2.17; P = 0.008) and LDL-cholesterol levels (β −5.88 mg/dL; 95% CI, −11.42, −0.33; P = 0.03), and significantly increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (β 0.008; 95% CI, 0.002, 0.014; P = 0.007). Moreover, melatonin supplementation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) ( P = 0.004) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. Conclusions: Overall, melatonin administration for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, insulin levels, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, and gene expression of PPAR-γ and LDLR among women with PCOS.

225,Depression is associated with diabetes status of family members: NHANES (1999–2016),"Background: The majority of the studies in this area focus on the psychological impact of having diabetic children or adolescents on parents, while a limited number of studies have investigated the effect of diabetes on the mental health status of family members in the general population. Thus, the aim of the current study is to explore the possible association between mental health disorders (depression, anxiety and panic) and diabetes status of family members among a national sample of adults in the United States. Methods: Our analysis included 1,787 and 25,574 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004 and 2005–2016, respectively. Diabetes status of family members was self-reported by the participants, and depression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in NHANES (1999–2004) and NHANES (2005–2016), respectively. Results: With NHANES (1999–2004) participants, logistic regression indicated a marginally significant association between depression and diabetes status of family members after multivariable adjustment ( P = 0.07), and trend analysis suggested that participants who had more diabetic family members were at a higher risk of depression ( P trend &lt; 0.01). We further validated these results using data from NHANES (2005–2016), which indicated diabetes status of family members was associated with both clinically relevant depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) ( P &lt; 0.01). Limitations: The information about the mental health status of family members and the exact role of participants in caring for diabetic patients was inadequate. Conclusions: A positive association between depression and diabetes status of family members was observed in the general population, suggesting that psychological interventions targeting the family members of diabetic patients are worthy of attention.

226,"Stressful life events, insomnia and suicidality in a large sample of Chinese adolescents","Aims: This study aimed to examine the associations between stressful life events, insomnia, and suicidality including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP) and suicide attempt (SA) in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. Methods: A total of 11,831 adolescents who participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort were included for the analysis. Participants were sampled from 8 middle/high schools in 3 counties of Shandong, China. Participants completed a structured behavior and health questionnaire, including suicidality, demographics, depression/anxiety, stressful life events (SLEs), and insomnia in November-December 2015. A series of logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed to examine the associations between SLEs, insomnia and suicidality. Results: The prevalence rates of overall suicidality, SI, SP and SA in the last year were 13.1%, 12.5%, 3.3%, and 1.5%, respectively. SLEs were significantly associated with overall suicidality, SI, and SP. Insomnia was an independent risk factor of suicidality and a mediator of the association between SLEs and suicidality. The total effect of SLEs on overall suicidality was 0.597 (95%CI: 0.534–0.661), including 0.457 (95%CI: 0.391–0.523) for direct effect and 0.158 (95%CI: 0.138–0.178) for indirect effect. Insomnia also mediated the associations of SLEs with SI, SP and SA, respectively. Limitations: Causal relationship could not be concluded because this study is cross-sectional. Conclusions: Stressful life events and insomnia are directly associated with suicidality in adolescents. The association between SLEs and suicidality is partially mediated by insomnia.

227,"Prevalence, clinical correlates and IQ of suicidal ideation in drug naïve Chinese Han patients with major depressive disorder","Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) is a common and serious clinical concern in people with major depressive disorder (MDD). Inconsistent evidence suggests that individuals with SI may have a lower measured intelligence quotient (IQ) than those without SI. The aims of this study were to examine SI prevalence and its associations with demographic, clinical variables and IQ in Chinese drug-naïve MDD patients. Methods: 488 drug-naïve Chinese Han patients (male: 203, 41.6%) meeting a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD were enrolled in a cross-sectional study involving seven hospitals. All participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires, which include information on socio-demographic and clinical variables. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were also administered. Verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full-scale IQ (FIQ) scores were measured using the Chinese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). We categorized patients with SI based on a cut-off score of ≥ 3 on HAMD item 3. Results: An estimated prevalence 32.8% (160/488) of drug-naïve MDD patients experienced SI during the current episode of illness. Patients with SI were more likely to be divorced ( x ² = 6.93, p = 0.031), male ( x ² = 6.04, p = 0.014), had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms ( t = −8.14, p &lt; 0.001, t = −3.28, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), comorbid psychotic features ( t = −5.71, p &lt; 0.001), and lower FIQ levels ( t = −4.21, p &lt; 0.001), when compared to patients without SI. Using logistic regression analysis and adjusting for confounding variables, the following variables were independently associated with SI: divorced marital status compared to married (OR = 4.674, 95% CI: 1.676~13.036), severity of depression symptoms (OR = 1.312, 95% CI: 1.196~1.440), psychotic features (OR = 1.044; 1.012~1.077), and FIQ /PIQ levels which expressed in OR per SD increase in IQ score (OR = 0.740, 95% CI: 0.561~0.977; OR = 0.744, 95% CI: 0.557~0.994, respectively). Limitations: A cross-sectional study which did not assess the influence of severity of SI. Conclusions: The prevalence of SI in drug-naive Chinese patients with MDD is high, and associated with marital status, severity of depression, psychotic features and measured IQ. Further research is needed to further explore these and other potentially relevant risk factors which might affect clinical outcomes.

228,An inflammatory profile linked to increased suicide risk,"Background: Suicide risk assessments are often challenging for clinicians, and therefore, biological markers are warranted as guiding tools in these assessments. Suicidal patients display increased cytokine levels in peripheral blood, although the composite inflammatory profile in the subjects is still unknown. It is also not yet established whether certain inflammatory changes are specific to suicidal subjects. To address this, we measured 45 immunobiological factors in peripheral blood and identified the biological profiles associated with cross-diagnostic suicide risk and depression, respectively. Methods: Sixty-six women with mood and anxiety disorders underwent computerized adaptive testing for mental health, assessing depression and suicide risk. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to uncover system level associations between suicide risk, depression, and the immunobiological factors in plasma. Secondary regression models were used to establish the sensitivity of the results to potential confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI), treatment and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The biological profile of patients assessed to be at increased suicide risk differed from that associated with depression. At the system level, a biological cluster containing increased levels of interleukin-6, lymphocytes, monocytes, white blood cell count and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count significantly impacted suicide risk, with the latter two inferring the strongest influence. The cytokine interleukin-8 was independently and negatively associated with increased suicide risk. The results remained after adjusting for confounders. Limitations: This study is cross-sectional and not designed to prove causality. Discussion: A unique immunobiological profile was linked to increased suicide risk. The profile was different from that observed in patients with depressive symptoms, and indicates that granulocyte mediated biological mechanisms could be activated in patients at risk for suicide.

229,"Symptom manifestation and treatment effectiveness, -obstacles and -facilitators in Turkish and Moroccan groups with depression in European countries: A systematic review","Background: This study examined the state of the art relevant for clinical practice on symptom manifestation of depression or depression-related idioms of distress, the treatment effectiveness and obstacles and facilitators for therapeutic success in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant populations with depression in Europe. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane databases (1970-31 July 2017). Peer-reviewed studies, with adult populations, and an instrument assessing depressive symptoms met inclusion criteria and were evaluated following quality guidelines. Results: We included 13 studies on symptom manifestation, 6 on treatment effectiveness, and 17 on obstacles and facilitators, published between 2000 and 2017, from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden ( n Turkish individuals = 11,533; n Moroccan individuals = 5278; n native individuals = 303,212). Both ethnic groups more often reported combined mood and somatic symptoms (and anxiety in the case of Turkish groups) than natives, and had higher levels of symptoms. There was no report on effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and there was weak evidence of the effectiveness of examined psychological treatments for depression in Turkish groups. No treatment has been examined in Moroccan groups. Salient obstacles to therapeutic success were socioeconomic problems, higher level of psychological symptoms at baseline, and negative attitudes towards psychotherapy. Possible facilitators were interventions attuned to social, cultural and individual needs. Results were most representative of first generation, low SES Turkish immigrant patients, and Moroccan-Dutch members of the general populations. Conclusion: Turkish and Moroccan immigrants with depression presented a comorbid symptom profile with more intertwined depressive and somatic complaints. There were indications that the available therapies are insufficient for Turkish groups, but the current evidence is scarce and heterogeneous, and RCTs suffer from methodological limitations.

230,Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5: Psychometric properties in a Japanese population,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 260 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-64167-097). In the original article, a sentence in the acknowledgement was incorrect. The corrected expression is: “Dr. Yoder, Dr. Weathers, Mr. Bernick, and Ms. Akiyama have no conflicts of interest to declare.”] Background: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) is a widely used self-report measure of PTSD. The reliability/precision and validity of the updated PCL version for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (PCL-5) have only been evaluated in limited populations. This study aimed to examine the factor structure, reliability/precision, and validity of the PCL-5 as assessed by convergent and discriminant relationships with related constructs among Japanese individuals who experienced various traumatic events. Methods: We conducted an online survey of Japanese adults using the PCL-5 and other assessments for PTSD, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric comorbidities, and functionality. A total of 3090 individuals who met a probable diagnosis of PTSD and another 1837 who had experienced traumatic events but did not meet the probable PTSD diagnosis answered the questionnaires. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the best fit with a 7-factor model. This factor structure was temporally stable across 2 time points for 4 months. The total and subscale scores showed good internal consistency and modest test-retest reliability. The convergent and discriminant relationships of the PCL-5 total score with related constructs were demonstrated. Limitations: This study did not use the gold standard interview to assess the diagnostic status of PTSD. Also, the sampled population was younger and had lower incomes in comparison to the census data. Conclusions: Our results support the utility of the PCL-5 for assessing PTSD symptoms in Asian populations.

231,Predominant polarity in bipolar I and II disorders: A five-year follow-up study,"Background: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) differ in their relative predominance of types of episodes, yielding predominant polarity, which has important treatment implications. However, few prospective studies of predominant polarity exist. Methods: In the Jorvi Bipolar Study (JoBS), a regionally representative cohort of 191 BD I and BD II in- and outpatients was followed for five years using life-chart methodology. Differences between depressive (DP), manic (MP), and no predominant polarity (NP) groups were examined regarding time ill, incidence of suicide attempts, and comorbidity. Results: At baseline, 16% of patients had MP, 36% DP, and 48% NP. During the follow-up the MP group spent significantly more time euthymic, less time in major depressive episodes, and more time in manic states than the DP and NP groups. The MP group had significantly lower incidence of suicide attempts than the DP and NP group, lower prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders but more psychotic symptoms lifetime and more often (hypo)manic first phase of the illness than the DP group. Classification of predominant polarity was influenced by the timeframe used. Limitations: The retrospective counting of former phases is vulnerable to recall bias. Assignment of dominant polarity may necessitate a sufficient number of illness phases. Conclusions: Predominant polarity has predictive value in predicting group differences in course of illness, but individual patients’ classification may change over time. Patients with manic polarity may represent a more distinct subgroup than the two others regarding illness course, suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidity.

232,Early cognitive processes in OCD: An ERP study,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, intrusive, and distressing obsessions and/or compulsions and is associated with marked impairments in quality of life. The goal of the present study was to examine initial stages of information processing, specifically, perceptual and attention orientation phases that precede response preparation in OCD. Methods: The P3 event-related potential (ERP) component was used as a measure of early cognitive processes of visual stimulus perception. ERPs were recorded while 38 participants diagnosed with OCD and 38 healthy controls performed a passive visual oddball task with neutral and angry schematic faces. Results: OCD participants demonstrated significantly enhanced P3 amplitude over bilateral parietal areas in response to neutral stimuli that activate basic primary perceptual processes. Emotional valence reduced this effect such that OCD patients did not differ from healthy controls in P3 amplitude under the angry stimuli condition. Limitations: Patients in this study were noncomorbid and unmedicated partially limiting the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Our hypothesis of altered early perceptual processes in OCD was supported. These alterations, specific to OCD and not anxiety and depression symptoms, may represent distracted primary cognitive processes in OCD, possibly serving as a basic source for compulsion initiation.

233,Antidepressants have complex associations with longitudinal depressive burden in bipolar disorder,"Aims: Antidepressants are common in bipolar disorder (BD), but controversial due to questionable efficacy/tolerability. We assessed baseline antidepressant use/depression associations in BD. Methods: Stanford BD Clinic outpatients, enrolled during 2000–2011, assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation, were monitored up to two years with the STEP-BD Clinical Monitoring Form while receiving naturalistic expert treatment. Prevalence/correlates of baseline antidepressant use in recovered (euthymic ≥ 8 weeks)/depressed patients were assessed. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses assessed times to depressive recurrence/recovery in patients with/without baseline antidepressant use, and Cox Proportional Hazard regression analyses assessed covariate effects. Results: Baseline antidepressant use was significantly (albeit without Bonferroni multiple comparison correction) less among 105 recovered (31.4%) versus 153 depressed (44.4%) patients, and among recovered patients (again without Bonferroni correction), associated with Caucasian race, earlier onset, worse Clinical Global Impression scores, and hastened depressive recurrence (only if mood elevation episodes were not censored), driven by lifetime anxiety disorder, and more (even with Bonferroni correction) bipolar II disorder, lifetime anxiety and eating disorders, and core psychotropics. Baseline antidepressant use among depressed patients was associated with significantly (again without Bonferroni correction) older age, female gender, and more (even with Bonferroni correction) anxiolytics/hypnotics, complex pharmacotherapy, and core psychotropics, but no other unfavorable illness characteristic/current mood symptom, and not time to depressive recovery. Limitations: Tertiary BD clinic referral sample receiving open naturalistic expert treatment. Analyses without/with Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: Additional research is required to assess the complex associations between baseline antidepressant use and longitudinal depressive burden in BD.

234,Worry and anger are associated with latent classes of problematic smartphone use severity among college students,"Background: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity throughout the literature. However, many important psychopathology constructs have not been examined for associations with PSU severity. Worry and anger are two psychopathology constructs receiving little empirical scrutiny in relation to PSU, but theoretically should demonstrate significant relationships. Furthermore, few studies have used person-centered analyses, such as mixture modeling, to analyze possible latent subgroups of individuals based on PSU symptom ratings. Method: We conducted a web survey of 300 American college students, using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated Version, and Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 Scale. Results: Conducting mixture modeling using latent profile analysis, we found most support for a three-class model of latent groups of individuals based on their PSU item ratings. Adjusting for age and sex, worry and anger scores were significantly higher in the more severe PSU classes. Discussion: Results are discussed in the context of uses and gratifications theory, as well as compensatory internet use theory, in terms of individual differences explaining excessive technology use. Limitations: Limitations include the non-clinical nature of the sample. Conclusions: Worry and anger may be helpful constructs in understanding the phenomenology of PSU, and psychological interventions for worry and anger may offset PSU.

235,Does social and professional establishment at age 30 mediate the association between school connectedness and family climate at age 16 and mental health symptoms at age 43?,"Background: The aim was to use a theoretical framework developed by Bronfenbrenner in order to investigate if the association between school connectedness and family climate at age 16 and mental health symptoms at age 43 is mediated by social and professional establishment at age 30. Methods: Data were drawn from The Northern Swedish Cohort, a prospective population-based cohort. The present study included 506 women and 577 men who responded to questionnaires at age 16 (in year 1981), age 30 (in 1995) and age 43 (in 2008). Mediation was tested by fitting structural equation models (SEM) and estimating direct effects between proximal processes (school connectedness and family climate) and symptoms of depression and anxiety respectively, and indirect effects via social and professional establishment (professional activity, educational level, and civil status). Results: The standardised estimate for the direct path from school connectedness to depression was -0.147 ( p = .000) and the indirect effect mediated by professional activity −0.017 ( p = .011) and by civil status −0.020 ( p = .002). The standardised direct effect between school connectedness and anxiety was −0.147 ( p = .000) and the indirect effect mediated by civil status −0.018 (p=.005). Family climate was not significantly associated with the outcomes or mediators. Limitations: Self-reported data; mental health measures not diagnostic; closed cohort; intelligence, personality and home situation before age 16 not accounted for. Conclusions: Professional and social establishment in early adulthood appear to partially mediate the association between adolescent school connectedness and mental health symptoms in middle-age.

236,"The relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolarity and mixed features in major depressive patients: Evidence from the BRIDGE-II-Mix Study","Objective: This study primarily focused on the relationship between comorbid attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mixed features and bipolarity in major depressive patients. Methods: The sample comprised 2777 patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) enrolled in a multicentre, multinational study originally designed to assess different definitions of mixed depression. Socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics were compared in patients with (ADHD +) and without (ADHD-) comorbid ADHD. Results: Sixty-one patients (2.2%) met criteria for ADHD. ADHD was associated with a higher number of (hypo) manic symptoms during depression. Mixed depression was more represented in ADHD + patients than in ADHD-using both DSM-5 and experimental criteria. Differences were maintained after removing overlapping symptoms between (hypo)mania and ADHD. ADHD in MDE was also associated with a variety of clinical and course features such as onset before the age of 20, first-degree family history of (hypo)mania, past history of anti-depressant-induced (hypo)manic switches, higher number of depressive and affective episodes, atypical depressive features, higher rates of bipolarity specifier, psychiatric comorbidities with eating, anxiety and borderline personality disorders. Limitations: The study was primarily designed to address mixed features in ADHD, with slightly reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of ADHD. Other possible diagnostic biases due to heterogeneity of participating clinicians. Conclusions: In a sample of major depressive patients, the comorbid diagnosis of current ADHD is associated with bipolar diathesis, mixed features, multiple psychiatric comorbidity and a more unstable course. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the possible mediating role of temperamental mood instability and emotional dysregulation in such a complex clinical presentation.

237,Obsessive compulsive disorder with and without hoarding symptoms: Characterizing differences,"Objective: In recent years there has been some ambiguity about the way hoarding and OCD are related to each other. The present study examines the differences between persons with OCD/hoarding and OCD/non-hoarding and examines which characteristics are associated with the OCD/hoarding group. Information is established about prevalences, socio-demographical characteristics, OCD and related characteristics, OCD subtypes, comorbidity (depression, anxiety disorders and PTSD) and personality traits. Methods: Data from baseline assessment of The Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association (NOCDA) study are used. The NOCDA sample consists of 419 participants between 18 and 79 years of age, including participants with current or remitted full DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD. Results: Results show that 58 persons (14.3%) are classified as persons with OCD/hoarding and 349 persons (85,7%) are classified as persons with OCD/non-hoarding. OCD/hoarding is independently associated with severity of autism symptoms ( p &lt; .001), living without a partner ( p &lt; .05) and being less conscientious ( p &lt; .05). Persons with OCD/hoarding are not associated with childhood trauma (p = .31), PTSD (p = .91) and AD(H)D, inattentive type (p = .22) and hyperactive type (p = .57). Limitations: Causal interferences about associations between the risk indicators and hoarding symptoms were precluded since results were based on cross-sectional data. Conclusion: This study confirmed differences between persons with OCD/hoarding and persons with OCD/non-hoarding. The most relevant outcome of this study was the association between persons with OCD/hoarding and the increased severity of autism symptoms. These results provide a better understanding of persons with OCD/hoarding and have the potential to improve treatment.

238,High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves neurocognitive function in bipolar disorder,"Background: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) present widespread and significant neurocognitive impairments during all stages of the disorder. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to improve clinical outcomes in common psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and BD. Whether rTMS can improve cognitive function in BD patients remains unclear. The present study explored the regulatory effects of rTMS on cognitive function in patients with BD. Methods: Fifty-two eligible subjects with BD were randomly assigned to receive active or sham rTMS via high-speed magnetic stimulator with a figure-of-eight coil for 10 consecutive days. In the active rTMS group, a total of 25,000 stimuli were applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 110% of the motor threshold. The sham group received corresponding sham stimulation. Clinical manifestations and cognitive functions were assessed using a modified 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Results: Ten consecutive days of high-frequency active rTMS improved scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span, and the MCCB Category Fluency subtest, without intolerable adverse effects. No significant differences in HDRS or YMRS scores were found between groups. Limitations: No follow-up after the intervention. The effect of the drug on cognitive function in subjects was not excluded. Conclusions: Short-term rTMS can improve cognitive function in BD patients.

239,The clinical trait self-criticism and its relation to psychopathology: A systematic review—Update,"Background: Self-criticism represents a central phenomenon in a variety of mental disorders. The review looks at the recent body of literature (2012–2018) to summarize the relation of self-criticism and psychopathology beyond depression and aims at detecting how different conceptualizations of self-criticism with psychoanalytical, psychodynamic, or cognitive-evolutionary background are related to psychopathology. Furthermore, latest treatment approaches for dysfunctional forms of self-criticism are reviewed. Methods: The literature research of five databases (PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Library) took place in August 2018. Inclusion criteria for studies to enter the review narrative were an adult sample, non-clinical samples as well as clinical samples, and an empirical approach, which resulted in quantitative data. Results: 48 studies entered the review. Besides depressive symptoms, self-criticism showed positive relations to symptoms of eating disorders, social anxiety disorder, and personality disorders as well as to psychotic symptoms or interpersonal problems through different conceptualizations of self-criticism. Regarding the treatment of self-criticism, compassion- or emotion-focused therapy interventions were investigated in most of the reviewed studies and both reduced self-criticism in clinical and non-clinical samples. However, harsh forms of self-criticism were more persistent and difficult to change. Limitations: The review focused only on the latest empirical findings regarding self-criticism and psychopathology. Conclusion: Potentially functional forms and functions of self-criticism need further consideration, as they represent a possible goal of psychotherapeutic treatment. Future research should address specific questions regarding antecedents and consequences of self-criticism.

Ortiz, K. Bradler, J. Garnham, C. Slaney, S. McLean and M. Alda ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2019[Jan][15], Vol 243, 274-279). The authors’ names were incompletely printed at the time of publication. The names appear correctly in this record, and have been corrected in the original record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-52847-038). Background: Mood regulation is a complex and poorly understood process. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder using time-series analysis. Methods: We recruited 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients. Participants rated their mood, anxiety and energy levels using a paper-based visual analog scale; they recorded their sleep and life events as well. Participants provided information on these variables over a three month period, twice per day. We compared their data using Box-Jenkins time series analysis with data from 30 healthy controls (HC) and 30 euthymic bipolar patients (BD) to obtain information on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the series, and calculated entropy for mood, anxiety and energy series. Results: We analyzed 14,980 data points: 5200 in the healthy control group; 4970 in the bipolar group and 4810 in the unaffected relatives group. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex or education levels. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that individual measures were normally distributed in the whole sample ( D = 0.23, p &gt; 0.1). Autocorrelation functions for mood in all groups are governed by the ARIMA (1,1,0) model, which means that current values in the series are related to one previous point only. In terms of entropy for the mood series, unaffected relatives and bipolar patients showed lower values [mean (SD) : 1.028 ± 0.679; 1.042 ± 0.680], respectively, compared to healthy controls [(1.476 ± 0.33); F (2,74) = 4.39, p &lt; 0.01]. The same case was seen in the energy series, with lower values in the unaffected relatives and bipolar patient groups [mean (SD) : 1.644 ± 0.566; 1.511 ± 0.879], respectively, compared to healthy controls [2.230 ± 0.531; F(2, 75) = 7.89, p &lt; 0.001]. Limitations: Low resolution for the visual analog scale. Conclusions: Using nonlinear analyses, we found that the underlying structure of mood regulation in unaffected relatives is undistinguishable from the one found in bipolar patients. Compared to healthy controls, both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives showed lower entropy levels, which is in keeping with a more rigid system, not as flexible to cope with the demands of a changing environment.

241,A placebo controlled treatment trial of sertraline and interpersonal psychotherapy for postpartum depression,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy of sertraline and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) relative to pill placebo in a two site randomized controlled trial over a period of 12 weeks. It was hypothesized that sertraline and IPT would be more efficacious than pill placebo with respect to depression and social adjustment. Methods: 162 breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women experiencing a major depressive episode in the first year postpartum from two sites in Iowa and Rhode Island were randomly assigned to IPT, sertraline-clinical management (CM), or pill placebo-CM. CM included infant-focused psychoeducation. Interview-based and self-report measures of depression and social adjustment were obtained at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks, and 12-weeks of treatment. Linear mixed effects regression (LMER) was used for the longitudinal data analysis. Results: There was no significant effect for treatment condition associated with the primary outcome measure, the HamD-17, but there was a significant effect for sertraline-CM relative to the IPT and placebo conditions over the duration of the trial based on the General Depression scale of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms. There was a main effect for time in that study subjects across all three conditions showed significant improvement for the duration of the trial. Limitations: Limitations of the present study included significant non-engagement with assigned condition and differential effects of IPT across the two study sites. Conclusions: There was improvement for all postpartum women in all conditions. The results do suggest that active interventions with or without medication delivered over a period of twelve weeks can lead to significant improvement in depression and social adjustment among postpartum women.

242,The impact of depressive comorbidity on neural plasticity following cognitive-behavioral therapy in panic disorder with agoraphobia,"Background: : Depressive disorders are a frequent comorbidity of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PD/AG effectively reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, irrespective of comorbidities. However, as depressive comorbidities can confound fear circuitry activation (i.e. amygdalae, insulae, anterior cingulate cortex) in PD/AG, we investigated whether comorbid depressive disorders alter neural plasticity following CBT. Methods: : Within a randomized, controlled clinical trial on exposure-based CBT, forty-two PD/AG patients including fifteen (35.7%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG + DEP) participated in a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A differential fear conditioning task was used as probe of interest. A generalized psycho-physiological interaction analysis (gPPI) served to study functional connectivity patterns. Results: : After CBT, only PD/AG patients without comorbid depressive disorders (PD/AG-DEP) showed reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) extending to the insula. While PD/AG-DEP patients showed enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between the left IFG and subcortical structures (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and midbrain), PD/AG + DEP patients exhibited increased FC between the left IFG and cortical structures (prefrontal, parietal regions). In both groups, FC decreased following CBT. Limitations: : Primary depressed and medicated patients were excluded. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed. Conclusions: : Reduced activation in the left IFG, as previously shown in PD/AG, appears to be a specific substrate of CBT effects in PD/AG-DEP patients only. Differential patterns of FC pertaining to fear circuitry networks in patients without depression vs. cognitive networks in patients with comorbid depression may point towards different pathways recruited by CBT as a function of comorbidity.

244,"The role of neurotrophic factors in manic-, anxious- and depressive-like behaviors induced by amphetamine sensitization: Implications to the animal model of bipolar disorder","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) and substance use disorders share common symptoms, such as behavioral sensitization. Amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization can serve as an animal model of BD. Neurotrophic factors have an important role in BD pathophysiology. This study evaluated the effects of amphetamine sensitization on behavior and neurotrophic factor levels in the brains of rats. Methods: Wistar rats received daily intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of dextroamphetamine (D-AMPH) 2 mg/kg or saline for 14 days. After seven days of withdrawal, the animals were challenged with D-AMPH (0.5 mg/kg, i.p) and locomotor behavior was assessed. In a second protocol, rats were similarly treated with D-AMPH (2 mg/kg, i.p) for 14 days. After withdrawal, without D-AMPH challenge, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated through forced swimming test and elevated plus maze. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were evaluated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Results: D-AMPH for 14 days augmented locomotor sensitization to a lower dose of D-AMPH (0.5 mg/kg) after the withdrawal. D-AMPH withdrawal induced depressive- and anxious-like behaviors. BDNF, NGF, and GDNF levels were decreased, while NT-3 and NT-4 levels were increased in brains after D-AMPH sensitization. Limitations: Although D-AMPH induces manic-like behavior, the mechanisms underlying these effects can also be related to phenotypes of drug abuse. Conclusions: Together, vulnerability to mania-like behavior following D-AMPH challenge and extensive neurotrophic alterations, suggest amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization is a good model of BD pathophysiology.

245,Memory bias and its association with memory function in women with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: Memory abnormalities are among a central feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is suggested that individuals with PTSD exhibit memory bias; while evidence shows poor memory function in these individuals. We aimed to examine memory bias in PTSD patients relative to controls and to explore an association between memory bias and memory function. Methods: Forty-six women with DSM-IV PTSD, most of whom developed the disorder after interpersonal violence, and 68 non-trauma-exposed healthy control women were studied. Memory bias was assessed by a recognition memory task using negative, neutral, and positive words. Memory function was assessed by a standardized neuropsychological test battery. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed by self-report measures. Results: Compared to controls, patients showed significantly greater negative bias scores (i.e., correctly recognized rates for negative words minus those for neutral words) and poorer memory function. Negative bias scores were significantly correlated with worse memory function in patients. When patients were divided into those with lower vs. normal memory function, the former patients had significantly greater negative bias than the latter patients and controls. Memory bias scores in patients were not significantly correlated with depression or anxiety symptoms, nor were they significantly different between patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and those without. Limitations: The cross-sectional design and absence of the trauma-exposed non-PTSD group limited our findings. Conclusions: PTSD patients have greater negative memory bias, which can be associated with poorer memory function. Our findings may provide an insight into the nature of memory abnormalities in PTSD.

246,Predominant polarity classification and associated clinical variables in bipolar disorder: A machine learning approach,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by periodic episodes of manic and depressive symptomatology. Predominant polarity (PP) appears to be an important specifier of BD. The present study employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately determine a patient´s PP without the inclusion of number and polarity of past episodes, while exploring associations between PP and demographic and clinical variables. Methods: From a cohort of 148 BD patients, demographic and clinical variables were collected using a customized questionnaire and the SCID-CV. The algorithm employed was the Random-Forest method. The algorithm was programed to classify patients into either depressive or manic predominant polarities and to reveal which variables were associated to the specifier. Results: The algorithm attained an AUC ROC of 74.72% (95% CI = 72.29–77.15%) in classifying patients into either manic or depressive PP. The variables selected by the algorithm were: (1) age at first depressive episode; (2) number of hospitalizations; (3) BD Type II; (4) manic onset; (5) delusions; (6) psychotic features at onset; (7) tobacco addiction; (8) family history of BD; (9) hallucinations; and (10) comorbid anxiety disorders, (11) alcohol dependence, (12) eating disorders and (13) substance dependence. Limitations: The study is limited due to the small sample size, the inclusion of only self-reported and clinician-observed clinical variables and its cross-sectional design. Discussion: The results suggest that the ML approach could be effective in determining a patient´s PP. Furthermore, although not previously reported, some variables, such as tobacco use and comorbid eating disorders, appear to be closely associated with PP.

247,Body mass index in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: Psychiatric disorders are associated with overweight/obesity. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be an exception, as anecdotal evidence suggests lower BMI in OCD. Additionally, depression is associated with elevated BMI, but effects of comorbid secondary depression are unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess BMI and risk for overweight/obesity in OCD and to assess the effect of comorbid depression on BMI. Methods: BMI, demographics, and clinical status were assessed in large samples of individuals with OCD, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, comorbid anxiety/depressive disorders, and non-clinical controls (NCC). Results: Although no initial differences were found between the samples on BMI, the non-depressed OCD subsample had significantly lower BMI and risk for overweight/obesity compared to all other clinical samples. NCC were nearly twice as likely to be overweight compared to non-depressed OCD. Limitations: Eating disorders were excluded in the OCD sample, but BMI &lt; 17 was used as an exclusion criterion in the clinical control groups in lieu of screening for Anorexia. Group differences on demographics were controlled for. Recruitment methodology differed between samples. Conclusions: OCD is associated with significantly lower rates of obesity and overweight, but this relationship was not found when comorbid depression was present. This suggests that the purer the phenotype of OCD, the more substantial protective factor against overweight/obesity emerges compared to other clinical samples and NCC. An OCD-specific reward/anhedonia model, previously offered to elucidate lower smoking rates in OCD, may account for lower BMI in OCD. These results warrant careful clinical attention to the negative impact of comorbid depression on OCD that spans from increasing risk for obesity and cigarette smoking, to hindering treatment response.

248,Decreased plasma glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor level in major depressive disorder is associated with age and clinical severity,"Background: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as a neurotrophic factor closely related to depression is able to promote the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of multiple neurons. Clinical features, recurrence rates and suicide rates are significant different in major depressive disorder (MDD) according to age. GDNF level changes in the peripheral blood has been reported in patients with MDD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether GDNF levels differentiated within various age groups and its relationship with age/clinical severity. Method: MDD subjects and healthy controls (HC) are divided into younger (age 13–24 years) group (yMDD n = 35, yHC n = 44) and older (age 25–45 years) group (oMDD n = 30, oHC n = 55) based on the age of brain maturity. Clinical symptom severity was evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-17). The levels of plasma GDNF were compared within subgroups. Results: Plasma GDNF levels in yMDD patients were significantly decreased compared to yHC (yMDD 1.55 ± 0.46pg/ml, yHC 1.77 ± 0.47pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, such difference was not found between oMDD group and oHC group. Our results also showed negative correlations between plasma GDNF levels and HAMD/HAMA scores ( r = −0.33, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.39, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This study was underpowered to observe dynamic changes between age and GDNF in MDD due to the cross-sectional design of present study. We also failed to divided subjects into more age groups because of moderate sample size. Conclusion: The present result showed the level of protective neurotrophic factor GDNF associated with age in MDD, suggesting a relevance between GDNF and MDD subjects abnormal brain development in adolescent and young adult period.

249,Depression symptomatology correlates with event-related potentials in Parkinson's disease: An affective priming study,"Background: Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD. Methods: Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores. Results: Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores. Limitations: Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.

250,"Nutraceuticals for major depressive disorder—More is not merrier: An 8-week double-blind, randomised, controlled trial","Background: One of the most pressing questions in “Nutritional Psychiatry” is whether using combinations of different nutraceuticals with putative antidepressant activity may provide an enhanced synergistic antidepressant effect. Methods: A phase II/III, Australian multi-site, 8-week, double-blind, RCT involving 158 outpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD. The intervention consisted of a nutraceutical combination: S-adenosyl methionine; Folinic acid; Omega-3 fatty acids; 5-HTP, Zinc picolinate, and relevant co-factors versus placebo. The primary outcome was change in MADRS score. Hypothesis-driven analyses of potential moderators of response involving key SNPs, and BDNF were also conducted. Results: Placebo was superior to the nutraceutical combination in reducing MADRS score (differential reduction -1.75 points), however a mixed linear model revealed a non-significant Group X Time interaction ( p = 0.33). Response rates were 40% for the active intervention and 51% for the placebo; remission rates were 34% and 43% for active and placebo groups, respectively. No significant differences were found between groups on any other secondary depression, anxiety, psychosocial, or sleep outcome measures. Key SNPs and BDNF did not significantly moderate response. No significant differences occurred between groups for total adverse effects, aside from more nausea in the active group. Limitations: Very high placebo response rates suggest a placebo run-in design may have been valuable. Interpretation: The adoption of a nutraceutical ‘shotgun’ approach to treating MDD was not supported, and appeared to be less effective than adding placebo to treatment as usual.

251,Fear of cancer recurrence among breast cancer survivors could be controlled by prudent dietary modification with polyunsaturated fatty acids,"Background: The pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), the leading unmet psychological need of cancer survivors, may involve the dysfunctional processing of fear memory. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have beneficial effects on psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, and are involved in fear memory processing. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA composition is associated with FCR in cancer survivors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the relationship between n-3 PUFAs and FCR among breast cancer survivors. Adults who had been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were not undergoing chemotherapy were asked to participate. Blood PUFA composition was evaluated by using capillary blood. We directly administered the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS) to assess the grade of FCR. Results: Among 126 participants used for the analysis, the mean age (SD) was 58 (11) years and 47% had stage I cancer. Multiple regression analysis controlling for possible confounders, depressive symptoms, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms revealed that the alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) level was significantly inversely associated with the average score on the CARS overall fear index ( beta = −0.165, p = 0.04). No significant associations were found for other PUFAs. Limitations: Our findings were obtained from a cross-sectional study in a single institute. Conclusion: These findings provide the first evidence of a beneficial effect of ALA on FCR and indicate the need for prospective study of this association. FCR among breast cancer survivors might be controllable by prudent selection of ALA-containing cooking oil.

252,Application of a transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders to body dysmorphic disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common disorder which is associated with a high rate of comorbidity and functional impairment. Although research shows that cognitive-behavioral therapy can be an efficacious treatment for BDD, there is growing evidence that dysregulated emotion is a core deficit. The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a transdiagnostic, emotion focused cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol that has been developed to target emotion regulation processes that play an important role in the development and maintenance of many emotional disorders Methods: : In the present study, 128 patients meeting criteria for BDD were randomized to either the UP ( n = 64) or waitlist/treatment-as-usual (WL/TAU) condition. Diagnoses were determined using semi-structural interviews and patients also completed the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Results: Repeated measure ANOVA indicated that the UP significantly decreased depression, BDD symptoms and body-related anxiety, as well as significantly improving emotional regulation all with large effect sizes compared to the TAU/WL condition. Treatment gains as well as remission of comorbid conditions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Limitations: : Our study limitations include restricted follow-up periods and excluding participants who were actively suicidal. Conclusions: : To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the UP for BDD, and results suggest that this disorder shares common mechanisms with other disorders of emotion, and that the UP may be an additional efficacious treatment for this condition.

253,Childhood narcissism: A call for interventions,"The past decades have seen a global shift toward greater individualism, with cultures increasingly valuing separateness and uniqueness over connectedness and similarity. Such values may underlie narcissism, an everyday personality trait that exists throughout the population. Narcissistic children feel superior to others, believe they are entitled to privileges, and crave admiration. When they receive the admiration they crave, they feel on top of the world; but when they do not, they feel like sinking into the ground—a feeling that can spiral into anxiety and depression. Narcissistic children often respond to insults by lashing out aggressively against others. Unsurprisingly, then, they have trouble maintaining close relationships with others. Such pernicious consequences of narcissism have been demonstrated around the globe. Thus, narcissism has become a pressing problem, hurting children as well as society at large.

254,"Childhood sexual abuse, poly-victimization and internalizing disorders across adulthood and older age: Findings from a 25-year longitudinal study","Background: We aimed to investigate associations between childhood sexual abuse and maltreatment and internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression, PTSD) across adulthood. Methods: Following a postal survey of 2220 women, a subsample was selected to participate in an interview. The subsample included 276 women reporting childhood sexual abuse and 221 women with no reported history of childhood sexual abuse. Interviews were repeated six and 25 years following the first interview. Internalizing disorders were assessed using ICD-8 and DSM-III criteria. Results: There was a lower probability of having an internalizing disorder at older ages than younger ages for all women, regardless of maltreatment history. Latent class analysis was used to define three classes (no/low maltreatment, sexual abuse, poly-victimisation). Compared with no/low maltreatment, a history of childhood sexual abuse was associated with almost double the risk of an internalizing disorder and a history of poly-victimisation was associated with over four times the risk of an internalizing disorder. Childhood sexual abuse and poly-victimisation remained associated with an elevated risk of a disorder in older age. Limitations: Findings are limited by attrition (39% participated at Time 3), low prevalence of severe physical abuse, and changes in assessment practice of childhood maltreatment and mental disorder in the past 30 years. Conclusions: Screening and treatment for internalizing disorders in women with histories of childhood maltreatment remains important in older aged populations.

255,Treatment effectiveness and tolerability outcomes that are most important to individuals with bipolar and unipolar depression,"Objective: To evaluate patient-reported determinants of treatment effectiveness and tolerability amongst persons with major depressive or bipolar disorders. Methods: The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) conducted an online survey February 2016–April 2016 asking participants about which outcomes are most important in determining subjective treatment effectiveness and tolerability. Results: In total, 896 participants completed the survey [49.9% unipolar depression ( n = 447) and 50.1% bipolar depression ( n = 449)]. Survey respondents reported several previous medication trials with the minority (25% of depression and 29% of bipolar group) of respondents reporting that their current treatment plan was completely effective. When asked how they know that the treatment is working, for both groups, the highest rated response was, “I don't feel overly anxious, agitated or irritable.” Weight gain was the adverse effect that most commonly led respondents to discontinue a medication. Lethargy, emotional blunting, shaking/trembling and anxiety were also identified as common treatment-emergent experiences leading to medication discontinuation in greater than one-third of respondents. The bipolar group more frequently identified several signs that suggested treatment was working (e.g., improved neurocognitive function, improved sleep), as well as more frequently reported several reasons to discontinue medications (e.g., weight gain, trembling). Conclusion: Numerous factors emerged as important to patients when evaluating treatment effectiveness and tolerability. Some of these factors are inadequately assessed by current standard clinical trial outcome measures. Considering these important patient-centred outcomes in future clinical trials, treatment guidelines and direct patient care may serve to improve patient satisfaction, quality of life and the therapeutic alliance.

256,A systematic review and meta-analysis of group treatments for adults with symptoms associated with complex post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: No previous meta-analyses have specifically investigated the effectiveness of psychological group therapy for symptoms associated with complex interpersonal trauma, including whether trauma memory processing (TMP) therapies are superior to psychoeducational approaches alone. Methods: A systematic review identified 36 randomised control trials (RCTs) which were included in the meta-analysis. Results: Large significant effect sizes were evident for TMP interventions when compared to usual care for three outcome domains including: PTSD (k = 6, g = -0.98, 95% CI -1.53, -0.43), Depression (k = 7, g = -1.12, 95% CI -2.01, -0.23) and Psychological Distress (k = 6, g = -0.98, 95% CI 1.66, -0.40). When TMP and psychoeducation interventions were directly compared, results indicated a small non-significant effect in favour of the former for PTSD symptoms, (k = 4, g = -0.34, 95% CI -1.05, 0.36) and small non-significant effect sizes in favour of the latter for Depression (k = 3, g = 0.29, 95% CI -0.83, 1.4) and Psychological Distress (k = 6, g = 0.19, 95% CI -0.34, 0.71). Limitations: Heterogeneity and a limited number of high quality RCTs, particularly in the Substance Misuse and Dissociation domains, resulted in uncertainty regarding meta-analytical estimates and subsequent conclusions. Conclusions: Results suggest that TMP interventions are useful for traumatic stress whereas non-TMP interventions can be useful for symptoms of general distress (e.g. anxiety and depression). Thus, both TMP and psychoeducation can be useful for the treatment of complex interpersonal trauma symptoms and further research should unravel appropriate sequencing and dose of these interventions.

The authors’ names were incompletely printed at the time of publication. The names now appear correctly in this record.] Background: Mood regulation is a complex and poorly understood process. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying dynamics of mood regulation in unaffected first degree relatives of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder using time-series analysis. Methods: We recruited 30 unaffected first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder patients. Participants rated their mood, anxiety and energy levels using a paper-based visual analog scale; they recorded their sleep and life events as well. Participants provided information on these variables over a three month period, twice per day. We compared their data using Box-Jenkins time series analysis with data from 30 healthy controls (HC) and 30 euthymic bipolar patients (BD) to obtain information on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the series, and calculated entropy for mood, anxiety and energy series. Results: We analyzed 14,980 data points: 5200 in the healthy control group; 4970 in the bipolar group and 4810 in the unaffected relatives group. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex or education levels. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that individual measures were normally distributed in the whole sample ( D = 0.23, p &gt; 0.1). Autocorrelation functions for mood in all groups are governed by the ARIMA (1,1,0) model, which means that current values in the series are related to one previous point only. In terms of entropy for the mood series, unaffected relatives and bipolar patients showed lower values [mean (SD) : 1.028 ± 0.679; 1.042 ± 0.680], respectively, compared to healthy controls [(1.476 ± 0.33); F (2,74) = 4.39, p &lt; 0.01]. The same case was seen in the energy series, with lower values in the unaffected relatives and bipolar patient groups [mean (SD) : 1.644 ± 0.566; 1.511 ± 0.879], respectively, compared to healthy controls [2.230 ± 0.531; F(2, 75) = 7.89, p &lt; 0.001]. Limitations: Low resolution for the visual analog scale. Conclusions: Using nonlinear analyses, we found that the underlying structure of mood regulation in unaffected relatives is undistinguishable from the one found in bipolar patients. Compared to healthy controls, both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives showed lower entropy levels, which is in keeping with a more rigid system, not as flexible to cope with the demands of a changing environment.

258,Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder in adult bipolar disorder patients,"Background: It has long been recognized that bipolar disorder (BD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) co-occur in an uncertain proportion of patients, recognized commonly in juvenile years. There is growing suspicion that such co-occurrence is associated with several clinically unfavorable characteristics. Accordingly, we compared 703 type I or II BD subjects with vs. without a lifetime diagnosis of ADHD. Methods: We compared 173 BD patients with vs. 530 without co-occurring ADHD for selected demographic and clinical factors, using standard initial bivariate comparisons followed by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Results: ADHD was found in 25% of BD subjects, more among men and with type I BD. Those with ADHD had higher scores at the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), were more likely to have had less successful school performance, unemployment, lower socioeconomic status, less marriage and more divorce, as well as more substance abuse, suicide attempts, and [hypo]mania, but were less likely to have an anxiety disorder or a family history of mood disorder. Multivariable logistic regression modeling found six factors differing between BD subjects with versus without ADHD: less education after high school, higher ASRS score for inattention, ever separated or divorced, irritable temperament, male sex, and lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at intake. Comments: Co-occurrence of ADHD with BD was identified at a moderate rate, and was associated with several unfavorable outcomes as well as a tendency toward [hypo]mania.

259,"The impact of COMT polymorphisms on cognition in Bipolar Disorder: A review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders” Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Cognitive deficits represent a core feature of Bipolar Disorder. The dopamine system is considered fundamental for cognitive functions relying on prefrontal cortex, such as attention and executive functions. A genetic regulation of prefrontal dopamine has been described and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has been extensively studied in relation to numerous psychiatric phenotypes, especially because of the involvement of its polymorphisms in the regulation of cognitive functions. Specifically, the Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism greatly alters COMT function and cognitive performance in both psychiatric disorders and healthy controls. However, only few studies assessed the association between COMT polymorphisms and cognitive functions in bipolar disorder (BD) subjects and this association might help in the comprehension of cognitive alterations in BD. Methods: In this context, the present review summarizes results from genetic studies that investigated COMT genetic modulation on cognitive performance in patients affected by BD. Results: Overall the results confirmed that (a) COMT Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism is associated with altered cognitive functions in BD patients, especially in the domains of memory, executive functions and emotion detection; and (b) COMT genotype may interact with both mood episodes and pharmacologic treatments in determining the cognitive profile of these subjects. Limitations: Few genetic studies exploring COMT genetic effect on cognition in BD. Conclusions: These findings seem to indicate a role of COMT polymorphisms in regulating cognitive functioning in patients with BD. The genetically determined dopaminergic tone may be further affected by mood episodes and pharmacological treatments.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Converging lines of evidence suggest that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) may play a central role in the pathogenesis of Bipolar Disorder (BD), thus representing a valid biomarker of the disease. A common genetic variation in the BDNF gene, the Val66Met, is associated with reduced maturation and secretion of BDNF and therefore it has been related to specific mood, cognitive and neuroanatomical alterations in BD. However, so far, only a handful of studies have investigated the association between Val66Met polymorphism and cognitive functioning in BD. Methods: We performed a bibliographic search on PUBMED of all genetic studies investigating Val66Met modulation on cognitive performances in BD subjects. The inclusion criteria were met by nine studies, including a total amount of 897 BD subjects and 803 healthy controls. Results: From the analysis of the existing literature emerged that a) Val allele in BD adults, but not in BD adolescents, was associated with better performances in selective cognitive domains including executive functions, verbal learning and memory; b) Met allele may negatively modulate the association between childhood trauma and performances in memory, verbal ability and verbal fluency tasks; c) Met allele may also negatively regulate structural abnormalities in cognitive cerebral structures; d) Val/Met carriers showed greater improvements in cognitive functions compared to Val/Val and Met/Met carriers. Limitations: Few genetic studies exploring the impact of Val66Met on cognition in BD. Conclusions: Val66Met polymorphism likely modulates cognitive functions in BD patients with complex gene-environment interactions and through potential modulations of cerebral structures. Further and larger genetic studies are required in order to detect association between BDNF polymorphism, BDNF levels, brain abnormalities and cognition in BD.

261,"MRI features of clinical outcome in bipolar disorder: A selected review: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders”. Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD. This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and disabling mental illness, which is characterized by selective gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) brain alterations, as observed by several imaging studies. However, the clinical course of the disease is uncertain and can vary across BD patients, with some having a benign course and others a severe disability. In this perspective, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help identifying biological markers of worse prognosis. Methods: The present selected review aimed at summarizing structural MRI (sMRI) studies exploring the correlation between brain morphology and features of clinical outcome, which could include treatment response, cognitive impairment and global functioning. Results: Overall, the results from the reviewed sMRI studies reported that WM hyperintensities and GM volume reductions, mainly in fronto-limbic areas, correlate with worse outcome in BD. However, the selected outcome measures vary across studies, thus these observations cannot be conclusive. Limitations: Heterogeneity across studies and inconsistency on the outcome measures adopted limit the conclusion of the present review. Absence of widely shared definitions of outcome should be object of further research on BD in order to indicate more stable features of illness course. Conclusions: In summary, WM hyperintensities and fronto-temporo-limbic GM alterations may be potential indices of worse outcome in BD patients, particularly in terms of illness severity and progression. The identification of stable markers of prognosis can help the clinicians in selecting subgroups of bipolar patients who need specific treatment to preserve cognitive/psychosocial functioning, in the light of personalized approaches. To further characterize outcome in BD, future sMRI studies should a) longitudinally investigate patients with either poor or good course of the disease, and b) correlate neuroimaging measures with clinical, cognitive and genetic markers.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Non-affective and affective psychoses are very common mental disorders. However, their neurobiological underpinnings are still poorly understood. Therefore, the goal of the present review was to evaluate structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies exploring brain deficits in both non-affective (NA-FEP) and affective first episode psychosis (A-FEP). Methods: A bibliographic search on PUBMED of all MRI studies exploring gray matter (GM) differences between NA-FEP and A-FEP was conducted. Results: Overall, the results from the available evidence showed that the two diagnostic groups share common GM alterations in fronto-temporal regions and anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, unique GM deficits have also been observed, with reductions in amygdala for A-FEP and in hippocampus and insula for NA-FEP. Limitations: Few small MRI studies with heterogeneous methodology. Conclusions: Although the evidences are far to be conclusive, they suggest the presence of common and distinct pattern of GM alterations in NA-FEP and A-FEP. Future larger longitudinal studies are needed to further characterize specific neural biomarkers in homogenous NA-FEP and A-FEP samples.

263,Testosterone is related to GABA+ levels in the posterior-cingulate in unmedicated depressed women during reproductive life,"Background: The role of testosterone (T) in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and anxiety is broadly supported. Evidence suggests that T has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. One proposed route for the central effects of T is its interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. We explored the relationship between T levels and GABA+ levels in anterior-cingulate (ACC) and the posterior-cingulate (PCC) regions in depressed women, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS). Methods: Twenty-one depressed patients with regularly cycling who were not taking hormonal or psychotropic drugs were recruited. We assessed severity of depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Blood samples were taken for quantification of free (FT) and total testosterone (TT) on the day of the magnetic resonance (MR) scan. We evaluated GABA+ levels in the PCC and ACC, using the Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of MEGA-Edited Spectroscopy (HERMES) sequence. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the association between FT, TT, GABA+ concentrations, and HDRS scores. Results: TT and FT levels were positively correlated with GABA+ levels in the PCC. No correlation was observed between T levels and GABA+ levels in the ACC. The HDRS total scores correlated negatively with FT levels. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional evaluation and the lack of a comparative healthy group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of T are related to increased GABA+ levels in the PCC. This observation may contribute to increased understanding of the role of T in depressive and anxiety symptoms in women.

264,Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and suicidality: The mediating effects of psychiatric comorbidities and family function,"Objective: To explore the association between Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and suicidality in children. Mediating effects of family function and psychiatric co-morbidities were also explored. Methods: This is a national representative cross-sectional survey of school-based sample of 4739 children aged 7–15. Logistic regression was used to assess the excess risks of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempts) in 412 children with ADHD. Serial multiple mediator models were conducted to assess the mediating effects of family function and psychiatric comorbidities. Results: The prevalence of suicidality in children with ADHD was approximately 20% in Taiwan. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of suicidality among children with ADHD was approximately four times higher than among non-ADHD children [(adjusted Odds Ratio [“OR”] = 3.82, 95% Confidence Interval (“CI”) (2.73, 5.34)] for suicidal ideation, adjusted OR = 4.18, 95% CI (2.57, 6.80) for suicide plan and adjusted OR = 4.45, 95% CI (1.99, 9.93) for suicide attempts. The mediating effects of anxiety/depression and conduct problems were about 20% and 8%, respectively, across all suicide outcomes. The mediating effects of family function were around 6–7% for suicidal ideation and 16–18% for suicide plan and suicide attempts. The effects of ADHD on suicidality, in general, remained after considering the mediating roles of family function and psychiatric comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Children with ADHD are at a high risk of suicide. Although the family function and psychiatric co-morbidities partially mediate this association, ADHD in itself is a potent suicide risk factor and should be an important target for suicide prevention.

265,The relation between empathy and depressive symptoms in a Dutch population sample,"Background: Impairments in social functioning are common in individuals with (sub)clinical levels of depression. One possible underlying mechanism of this relationship is low empathy. The present study examined linear and non-linear associations between empathy and depressive symptoms, and whether these associations were moderated by gender. Methods: Using the Empathy Quotient scale, cognitive and affective empathy were assessed using a large convenience sample from the general Dutch population (N = 3076). Depressive symptoms were indexed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16). Results: Low cognitive empathy was associated with more depressive symptoms. There was a weak positive relation between affective empathy and depressive symptoms, indexed by the QIDS rather than the DASS. Limitations: Generalizing results to the general population remains difficult with a convenience sample. Self-reported data may be affected by social-desirability or sex-stereotypical reporting biases. Conclusions: Our results support a linear relationship between cognitive empathy and symptoms of depression. There was some evidence for non-linear associations and a moderating role of gender, but these patterns were not observed across all types of analysis.

266,Neurocognitive clusters: A pilot study of young people with affective disorders in an inpatient facility,"Background: There is growing evidence to support the need for personalised intervention in the early stages of a major psychiatric illness, as well as the clear delineation of subgroups in psychiatric disorders based on cognitive impairment. Affective disorders are often accompanied by neurocognitive deficits; however a lack of research among young adult inpatients highlights the need to assess the utility of cognitive testing in this population. Methods: A computerised cognitive battery was administered to 50 current inpatient young adults (16–30 years; 75% female) with an affective disorder. Patients also completed a computerised self-report questionnaire (to measure demographics and clinical features) that included items evaluating subjective impressions of their cognition. Results: Hierarchical cluster analysis determined two neurocognitive subgroups: cluster 1 ( n = 16) showed more severe impairments in sustained attention and memory as well as higher anxiety levels, compared to their peers in cluster 2 ( n = 30) who showed the most impaired attentional switching. Across the sample, poor sustained attention was significantly correlated with higher levels of current anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas poor verbal memory was significantly associated with increased psychological distress. Limitations: This study has a relatively small sample size (due to it being a pilot/feasibility study). Furthermore, future studies should aim to assess inpatient samples compared to community care samples, as well as healthy controls, on a larger scale. Conclusions: The findings suggest neurocognitive profiles are important in understanding phenotypes within young people with severe affective disorders. With clear subgroups based on cognitive impairment being demonstrated, the clinical utility and use of new and emerging technologies is warranted in such inpatients facilities. This pilot/feasibility study has strengthened the utility of cognitive screening as standard clinical care in an inpatient unit.

267,Brain neurokinin-1 receptor availability in never-medicated patients with major depression—A pilot study,"Background: Neurotransmitter substance P (SP) and its preferred neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been implicated in the treatment of affective and addiction disorders. Despite promising preclinical data on antidepressant action, the clinical trials of NK1R antagonists in major depression have been disappointing. There are no direct in vivo imaging studies on NK1R characteristics in patients with a major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, we recruited nine never-medicated patients with moderate to severe MDD and nine matched healthy controls. NK1R availability (NK1R binding potential, BP ND ) was measured with in viv o 3-D positron emission tomography and a specific NK1 receptor tracer [¹⁸F]SPA-RQ. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17). Results: NK1R-BP ND did not differ statistically significantly between patients with MDD and healthy controls. HAM-D17 total scores (range 21–32) correlated positively with NK1R-BP ND in cortical and limbic areas. HAM-D17 subscale score for anxiety symptoms correlated positively with NK1R-BP ND in specific brain areas implicated in fear and anxiety. Limitations: Small sample size. Low variability in the clinical HAM-D subscale ratings may affect the observed correlations. Conclusions: Our preliminary results do not support a different baseline expression of NK1Rs in a representative sample of never-medicated patients with MDD during a current moderate/severe depressive episode. The modulatory effect of NK1Rs on affective symptoms is in line with early positive results on antidepressant action of NK1 antagonists. However, the effect is likely to be too weak for treatment of MDD with NK1R antagonists alone in clinical practice.

41,"The delay of motherhood: Reasons, determinants, time used to achieve pregnancy, and maternal anxiety level","Background: Fertility in recent decades in European countries such as Norway, Spain or United Kingdom has declined, while in others such as Portugal, it has remained relatively constant, and in others such as Germany fertility rates have risen. The determinants of this change in reproductive pattern can be explained by the cultural, social, and economic changes that took place in our society. Objective: to identify the principal reasons and independent determinants associated with the postponement of motherhood and document any association between the time taken to achieve successful pregnancy and maternal age, as well as the level of anxiety of these women. Methods: An observational study, including 326 women, was conducted in Spain with primiparous women, in which data was collected on sociodemographic, health, and pregnancy-related factors. Comparison of means (t-test or analysis of variance) and the analysis of covariance was used to estimate adjusted means for potential confounders. Results: Women in stable relationships became mothers at older ages (31.83 ± 0.29) than those who were not (28.75 ± 0.78) (p &lt; 0.001). Women who delayed motherhood for medical reasons had a mean age of 34.15 ± 0.88 years, compared to a mean of 30.52 ± 0.36 years for personal reasons, and 27.51 ± 1.39 years for other reasons. Mothers with an older age had a higher level of anxiety (p &lt; 0.05). The average time required to achieve pregnancy increased as maternal age increased, with an average time of 24 months for women with a mean age of 35.23±0.71 years compared to &lt; 3 months for women with a mean age of 29.44 ± 0.39 years. Women ≥ 35 years were more likely to need medical assistance to achieve pregnancy (aOR = 12.07, 95% CI: 1.50–97.05; p = 0.019). Conclusions: Medical reasons were among those cited for delaying motherhood. The postponement of motherhood was associated with difficulty to achieve a successful pregnancy and a higher level of anxiety.

42,Improving emotional health and self-esteem of Malaysian adolescents living in orphanages through Life Skills Education program: A multi-centre randomized control trial,"Generally speaking, institutionalised children and adolescents are at greatly increased risk of serious mental and behavioural problems, up to seven times more than their peers. Life skills- based interventions using peer enforcement have been introduced as effective program to improve adolescents’ emotional and behavioral health. Therefore, the current randomized control study aimed to determine, if a life skills-based intervention could improve the emotional health and self-esteem among Malaysian adolescents in orphanages. Overall, 271 male and female adolescents (13–18 years old) from 8 orphanages in Klang valley, Malaysia participated in the study. Comparing the intervention to control group within 3 points of time, the finding of the study showed that immediately after finishing the interventional sessions (post-test), the mean scores of depression (F = 33.80, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.11), anxiety (F = 6.28, P = 0.01, η² = 0.02), stress (F = 32.05, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.11) and self-esteem (F = 54.68, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.17) were significantly decreased compared to the pre-test values. However, there was no significant difference between two groups in the depression mean scores (F = 2.33, P = 0.13). Regarding to the interaction between group and test a significant change was seen in the mean score of all 4 variables including depression (F = 31.04, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.10), anxiety (F = 14.21, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.05), stress (F = 15.67, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.06) and self-esteem (F = 13.29, P &lt; 0.001, η² = 0.05). Furthermore, except depression (Δmean = -1.37, P &lt; 0.001), no significant difference was seen between study variables’ mean scores between post- and follow-up test (p &gt; 0.001). These results provide preliminary approve for LSE to enhance emotional health and self-esteem in orphanages.

43,Cognitive dysfunction in mice lacking proper glucocorticoid receptor dimerization,"Stress is a major risk factor for depression and anxiety. One of the effects of stress is the (over-) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the release of stress hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs). Chronically increased stress hormone levels have been shown to have detrimental effects on neuronal networks by inhibiting neurotrophic processes particularly in the hippocampus proper. Centrally, GCs modulate metabolic as well as behavioural processes by activating two classes of corticoid receptors, high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Upon activation, GR can modulate gene transcription either as a monomeric protein, or as a dimer interacting directly with DNA. GR can also modulate cellular processes via non-genomic mechanisms, for example via a GPCR-protein interaction. We evaluated the behavioral phenotype in mice with a targeted mutation in the GR in a FVB/NJ background. In GR dim/dim mice, GR proteins form poor homodimers, while the GR monomer remains intact. We evaluated the effect of poor GR dimerization on hippocampus-dependent cognition as well as on exploration and emotional behavior under baseline and chronically increased stress hormone levels. We found that GR dim/dim mice did not behave differently from GR wt/wt littermates under baseline conditions. However, after chronic elevation of stress hormone levels, GR dim/dim mice displayed a significant impairment in hippocampus-dependent memory compared to GR wt/wt mice, which correlated with differential expression of hippocampal Bdnf/TrkB and Fkbp5.

Methods: Australian adults (N = 439) completed the PERMA Profiler and measures of physical and mental health (SF-12), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS 21), subjective physical activity (Active Australia Survey), and objective activity and sleep (GENEActiv accelerometer). Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach’s alpha and associations between theoretically related constructs examined using Pearson’s correlation. Model fit in comparison with theorised models was examined via Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results: Results indicated acceptable internal consistency for overall PERMA Profiler scores and all subscales (α range = 0.80–0.93) except Engagement (α = 0.66). Moderate associations were found between PERMA Profiler wellbeing scores with subjective constructs (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress; r = -0.374 - -0.645, p = &lt; 0.001) but not objective physical activity or sleep. Data failed to meet model fit criteria for neither the theorised five-factor nor an alternative single-factor structure. Conclusions: Findings were mixed, providing strong support for the scale’s internal consistency and moderate support for congervent and divergent validity, albeit not in comparison to objectively captured activity outcomes. We could not replicate the theorised data structure nor an alternative, single factor structure. Results indicate insufficient psychometric properties of the PERMA Profiler.

45,Social anxiety changes the way we move—A social approach-avoidance task in a virtual reality CAVE system,"Investigating approach-avoidance behavior regarding affective stimuli is important in broadening the understanding of one of the most common psychiatric disorders, social anxiety disorder. Many studies in this field rely on approach-avoidance tasks, which mainly assess hand movements, or interpersonal distance measures, which return inconsistent results and lack ecological validity. Therefore, the present study introduces a virtual reality task, looking at avoidance parameters (movement time and speed, distance to social stimulus, gaze behavior) during whole-body movements. These complex movements represent the most ecologically valid form of approach and avoidance behavior. These are at the core of complex and natural social behavior. With this newly developed task, the present study examined whether high socially anxious individuals differ in avoidance behavior when bypassing another person, here virtual humans with neutral and angry facial expressions. Results showed that virtual bystanders displaying angry facial expressions were generally avoided by all participants. In addition, high socially anxious participants generally displayed enhanced avoidance behavior towards virtual people, but no specifically exaggerated avoidance behavior towards virtual people with a negative facial expression. The newly developed virtual reality task proved to be an ecological valid tool for research on complex approach-avoidance behavior in social situations. The first results revealed that whole body approach-avoidance behavior relative to passive bystanders is modulated by their emotional facial expressions and that social anxiety generally amplifies such avoidance.

46,Infant rhesus macaque ( &lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) personality and subjective well-being,"Infant temperament is theorized to lay the foundation for adult personality; however, many questions remain regarding personality in infancy, including the number of dimensions, extent to which they are adult-like, and their relation to other outcomes, such as mental and physical health. Here we tested whether adult-like personality dimensions are already present in infancy in a nonhuman primate species. We measured personality and subjective well-being in 7-month-old rhesus macaques ( N = 55) using the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire and Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire, both of which were developed for adult primates based on human measures. Multiple human raters, who provided infants with daily care since birth, independently rated each infant. We found high interrater reliability. Results from a parallel analysis and scree plot indicated a five component structure, which, using principal components analysis, we found to be comprised of dimensions relating to Openness (e.g., curiosity, inquisitive, playfulness), Assertiveness (e.g., dominance, bullying, aggressive), Anxiety (e.g., vigilance, fearful), Friendliness (e.g., sociable, affectionate, sympathetic), and Intellect (e.g., organized, not erratic). These components are largely analogous to those in adult macaques, suggesting remarkably stable structural personality components across the lifespan. Infant macaques’ subjective well-being positively correlates with Openness and Assertiveness and negatively correlated with Anxiety, similar to findings in adult macaques and other primates. Together, these findings suggest that, in macaques, infant personality dimensions may be conceptually related to adult personality and challenge the view that infant temperament may be disorganized and not as meaningful as adult personality. Further research is necessary to explore the antecedents, predictive validity, and stability of these personality components across situations and with development.

47,Central sensitization in knee osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia: Beyond depression and anxiety,"Objectives: To determine the psychopathological profile of patients with central sensitization (CS) in a sample of knee osteoarthritis, with and without CS, and fibromyalgia, and to compare their psychopathological profiles. Methods: The final sample consists of 19 patients with osteoarthritis and CS (mean 66.37 years ± 8.77), 41 osteoarthritis patients without CS (mean 66.8 ± 7.39 years), 47 fibromyalgia patients (mean 46.47 years ± 7.92) and 26 control subjects (mean 51.56 years ± 11.41). The psychopathological profile was evaluated with the Millon Multiaxial Clinical Inventory. Results: The average score of MCMI-III reflect higher scores in the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis-CS groups. Patients with osteoarthritis-CS are more likely to report larger scores in Borderline and Major Depression scales. Fibromyalgia patients are more likely to report more increased scores in Somatoform and Major Depression, versus osteoarthritis-CS group. Fibromyalgia patients versus osteoarthritis without CS are more likely to report higher scores in Schizoid, Depression, Histrionic, Sadistic, Borderline, Somatoform, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depression scales. Discussion: Patients with CS have less differences in their psychopathological profiles as well as in both osteoarthritis groups and greatest differences are obtained between the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis without CS, so perhaps presence of CS is the key to differentiate those groups and not chronic pain. An exhaustive assessment brings more accurate psychopathological profiles, thus better psychological treatment could be applied.

Exploring stress regulation and executive functioning as underlying neurocognitive mechanisms,"Objectives: To explore possible working mechanisms of anxiety reduction in women with anxiety disorders, treated with art therapy (AT). Methods: A RCT comparing AT versus waiting list (WL) condition on aspects of self-regulation. Stress regulation (heart rate and heart rate variability) and executive functioning (daily behavioural and cognitive performance aspects of executive functioning (EF)) were evaluated in a prepost design. Participants were women, aged 18–65 years with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Results: Effectiveness of AT compared to WL was demonstrated in a higher resting HRV post treatment, improvements in aspects of self-reported daily EF (emotion control, working memory, plan/organize and task monitor), but not in cognitive performance of EF, stress responsiveness and down regulation of stress. The decrease in anxiety level was associated with improvements in self-reported daily EF. Conclusions: AT improves resting HRV and aspects of EF, the latter was associated with art therapy-related anxiety reduction.

49,Psychological well-being and distress in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: The roles of positive and negative functioning,"Background: Whether mindfulness and emotional intelligence may counteract psychological symptoms and whether brooding and worry may be linked to decreased psychological well-being (PWB) in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is still an issue. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design on a sample of 66 consecutive individuals with a diagnosis of GAD. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to determine whether PWB and anxiety symptoms were accounted for by mindfulness and emotional intelligence skills, brooding, and worry. Results: Worry was negatively related to PWB and showed a tendency to be positively associated with anxiety symptoms after controlling for the other variables. Brooding was uniquely and positively related to anxiety symptoms. Different mindfulness (i.e., describing and nonjudging) and emotional intelligence (i.e., attention and repair) skills were particularly important for PWB. Repair was also negatively related to anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Repair was the variable that played a key role in the association with both PWB and GAD symptoms. Worry was the second most important variable, although it approached significance in the relationship with anxiety symptoms. Brooding was more strongly positively associated with anxiety than worry. In sum, the results suggest that an integrated and balanced focus on both positive and negative functioning will be useful in future clinical psychology research to predict, understand, and treat anxiety as well as to examine the antecedents and characteristics of positivity in individuals with GAD and promote their PWB.

50,Visual attention to emotional faces in adolescents with social anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric condition that often onsets in childhood. Cognitive models underline the role of attention in the maintenance of SAD, but studies on youth populations are few, particularly those using eye tracking to measure attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD includes interventions targeting attention, like exposure to eye contact, but the link between CBT and attention bias is largely unexplored. This study investigated attention bias in youth with SAD and the association with outcome from CBT. Latency to attend to pictures of faces with different emotions (vigilance) and latency to disengage from social stimuli (avoidance) was examined in N = 25 adolescents (aged 13–17) with SAD in relation to treatment outcome. Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance. Attention characteristics in the SAD group were compared to non-anxious (NA) controls ( N = 22). Visual attention was measured using eye tracking. Participants in both the SAD and NA groups were vigilant towards angry faces, compared to neutral and happy faces. Similarly, both groups disengaged attention faster from angry faces. Adolescents with SAD who disengaged faster from social stimuli had less social anxiety after CBT. The results indicate that anxious youth display a vigilant-avoidant attention pattern to threat. However, partly inconsistent with previous research, the same pattern was observed in the NA group.

51,Why are undergraduate emerging adults anxious and avoidant in their romantic relationships? The role of family relationships,"The exploration of and search for romantic relationships is one of the developmental tasks that characterise emerging adulthood, a new developmental phase halfway between adolescence and full adulthood. This study aims to explore, in a Mediterranean country, the existing relationships between the subjective perception of some parental behaviour and the anxiety and avoidance dimensions of attachment during emerging adulthood. To do so, 1,502 university students (903 women and 599 men) aged between 18 and 29 (M = 20.32 and SD = 2.13) completed a self-report questionnaire. The results revealed that perceived family support and perceived parental warmth were negatively associated with the avoidance and anxiety dimensions. In contrast, perceived parental control (both behavioural and psychological) was found to be positively associated with both attachment dimensions. Perceived behavioural control was also found to play a moderator role between perceived parental warmth and romantic attachment anxiety. Only in cases in which emerging adults of our sample perceived low levels of behavioural control was warmth found to be negatively associated with anxiety. The main conclusion of this work is the negative impact that parental control seems to have on romantic attachment during emerging adulthood. The results are discussed with a focus on the continuing importance of the family context in relation to the completion of developmental tasks, even during emerging adulthood.

52,The association between psychological distress and angina pectoris: A population-based study,"Background: Psychological distress is an undifferentiated combination of symptoms that may be related to the occurrence of angina pectoris (AP). However, few studies have investigated the relationship between psychological distress and AP, particularly in Asian populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between psychological distress and AP in Taiwanese adults. Methods: We adopted a cross-sectional design to explore the data of the 2005–2008 Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan. In total, 2080 subjects (aged ≥ 19 years) responded to questionnaire interviews and underwent physical examinations. Each of the five dimensions of psychological distress (sleep disturbance, anxiety, hostility, depression, and feelings of inferiority) were scored (from 0–20) according to the Five-Item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). A score ≥ 6 points indicated psychological distress. AP was evaluated using a modified Rose questionnaire. Findings: In total, 102 subjects (3.6%) had AP, and 231 subjects (8.8%) had symptoms of psychological distress. After adjusting for the basic data, metabolism, and lifestyle covariates, the BSRS-5 total score was associated with AP (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.26, p &lt; 0.001). Subjects with psychological distress had a higher risk of AP (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.76–4.99, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of AP is associated with psychological distress. Health care providers should therefore be aware of the impact of psychological distress on AP. Our study findings can serve as a reference for AP assessments. Large scale longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship between psychological distress and AP.

53,A study of psychological pain in substance use disorder and its relationship to treatment outcome,"Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a major public health concern affecting an estimated 22.5 million individuals in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to characterize psychological pain in a cohort of patients participating in outpatient treatment for SUD. A secondary aim was to determine the relationships between pre-treatment assessments of psychological pain, depression, anxiety and hopelessness with treatment retention time and completion rates. Data was analyzed from 289 patients enrolled in an outpatient community drug treatment clinic in Southern California, U.S. A previously determined threshold score on the Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (MBP) was utilized to group patients into high and low-moderate scoring subgroups. The higher pain group scored higher on measures of anxiety, hopelessness and depression compared to those in the low-moderate pain group. Additionally, patients scoring in the higher psychological pain group exhibited reduced retention times in treatment and more than two-fold increased odds of dropout relative to patients with lower pre-treatment levels of psychological pain. Among all assessments, the correlation between psychological pain and treatment retention time was strongest. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that psychological pain is an important construct which correlates with relevant clinical outcomes in SUD. Furthermore, pre-treatment screening for psychological pain may help target higher-risk patients for clinical interventions aimed at improving treatment retention and completion rates.

54,Parent psychological wellbeing in a single-family room versus an open bay neonatal intensive care unit,"Background: Studies of parents’ psychological well-being in single-family rooms in neonatal intensive care units have shown conflicting results. Aims: To compare emotional distress in the form of depression, anxiety, stress and attachment scores among parents of very preterm infants cared for in a single-family rooms unit vs an open bay unit. Study design: Prospective survey design. Subject: Parents (132) of 77 infants born at 28 0/7–32 0/7 weeks of gestation in the two units. Outcome measures: Duration of parental presence was recorded. Scores for depression (The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), anxiety (The State–Trait–Anxiety Inventory, Short Form Y), stress (The Parent Stressor Scale: neonatal intensive care unit questionnaire and The Parenting Stress Index—short form) and attachment (Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale) measured 14 days after delivery, at discharge, expected term date and four months post-term. Results: Parents were present 21 hours/day in the single-family room unit vs 7 hours/day in the Open bay unit. Ninety-three percent of the fathers in the single-family rooms unit were present more than 12 hours per day during the first week. Mothers in the single-family rooms had a significantly lower depression score -1.9 (95% CI: -3.6, -0.1) points from birth to four months corrected age compared to mothers in the Open bay unit, and 14% vs 52% scored above a cut-off point considered being at high risk for depression (p &lt; 0.005). Both mothers and fathers in the single-family rooms reported significantly lower stress levels during hospitalization. There were no differences between the groups for anxiety, stress or attachment scores after discharge. Conclusion: The lower depression scores by the mothers and lower parental stress scores during hospitalization for both parents supports that single-family rooms care contribute to parents’ psychological wellbeing.

55,The evolution of mental health outcomes across a combat deployment cycle: A longitudinal study of a Guam-based National Guard unit,"Sustained overseas military operations over the last two decades have resulted in large numbers of United States and Allied service members being faced with multiple unique occupational and environmental stressors, from serving in a combat zone, to having to be away from family and home for long periods of time. These stressors result in numerous negative health (physical and mental) and behavioral outcomes. Whereas there is a substantial amount of research focused on deployment-related health outcomes within active duty military populations, reserve forces are less understood. This study focuses on a United States Army National Guard combat unit before, during and after a deployment to Afghanistan. This prospective longitudinal study, conducted over the course of an operational deployment cycle (i.e., before, during and after), documents the trajectories of salient mental health outcomes (i.e., post-traumatic stress, depression, general anxiety, and aggression). The findings show that both combat (e.g., killing others) and non-combat (e.g., boredom) stressors negatively affect mental health outcomes, and the severity of these outcomes increases over the course of a deployment cycle. Of special note, the study reveals key gender differences in the evolution of PTSD, depression and anxiety across a deployment cycle: females report increased PTSD, depression and anxiety 6 months post-deployment whereas the levels reported by males stabilize at their mid-deployment levels. The findings offer insights for medical providers and policymakers in developing more targeted health promotion campaigns and interventions, especially during the post-deployment phase.

56,Illness beliefs and emotional responses in mildly disabled stroke survivors: A qualitative study,"Background: As acute stroke services improve, more persons experience mild stroke and need to cope daily with hidden disabilities, which may be influenced by how they perceive stroke, cognitively and emotionally. Objective: To investigate cognitive illness beliefs and emotional responses in persons with mild stroke and their possible influences on daily coping. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 persons with mild stroke, on average 7.5 months (± 0.89) after stroke occurrence. A thematic analysis on verbatim transcripts was guided by the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation. Results: All participants experienced difficulties constructing an illness identity at both acute and chronic phase. Behavioral risk factors were less accepted as causes of stroke. Lack (or inappropriate timing) of information from healthcare providers led to limited medication knowledge and low perceived control of stroke recurrence which generated anxiety, fear, and low involvement in coping. Participants who considered stroke a chronic condition experienced more difficulties. Perceived support from relatives and healthcare providers was beneficial for participation in recovery and health behaviour change. Conclusion: Despite having mildly disabilities, participants reported difficulties developing illness beliefs conducive to coping, and dealing with their emotional responses. These elements should be considered in tailored programs to improve coping with hidden disabilities post-stroke.

57,Behavioral predictors of subsequent respiratory illness signs in dogs admitted to an animal shelter,"Individual variability is evident in behavior and physiology of animals. Determining whether behavior at intake may predict subsequent illness in the animal shelter may influence the management of dogs housed at animal shelters and reduce overall disease. While normally associated with mild disease and low mortality rates, respiratory disease nevertheless poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the stressful environment of animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether behavior at intake can predict subsequent occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease in dogs at animal shelters. In a correlational study, 84 dogs were assessed throughout their stay at a city animal shelter. The dogs were subjected to a behavioral assessment, 1 min in-kennel behavioral observations across two observation periods, and the collection of urinary cortisol:creatinine (C:C) ratio. The occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease was monitored through repeated clinical exams (rectal temperature and the occurrence of nasal and ocular discharge, and presence of coughing and sneezing). A basic PLS Path regression model revealed that time in the shelter (estimate = .53, p &lt; .001), and sociability (estimate = .24, p &lt; .001) and curiosity scores (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and anxiety scores, however, were not associated with illness. Urinary C:C, taken on the first full day, did not predict subsequent illness when accounting for time. Limitations included attrition of dogs, a small percentage receiving vaccinations, and continuous and non-systematic rotation of dogs in the kennels. Understanding if behavior can predict subsequent illness may improve shelter management practices, and in turn, result in improved live-release outcomes.

58,"Mindfulness meditation, time judgment and time experience: Importance of the time scale considered (seconds or minutes)","This manuscript presents two studies on the effect of mindfulness meditation on duration judgment and its relationship to the subjective experience of time when the interval durations are on the second or the minute time scale. After the first 15 minutes of a 30-min meditation or control exercise, meditation-trained participants judged interval durations of 15 to 50 s or 2 to 6 min, during which they performed either a mindfulness meditation exercise or a control exercise. The participants’ scores on the self-reported scales indicated the effectiveness of the meditation exercise, as it increased the level of present-moment awareness and happiness and decreased that of anxiety. The results showed an underestimation of time for the short interval durations and an overestimation of time for the long intervals, although the participants always reported that time passed faster with meditation than with the control exercise. Further statistical analyses revealed that the focus on the present-moment significantly mediated the exercise effect on the time estimates for long durations. The inversion in time estimates between the two time scales is explained in terms of the different mechanisms underlying the judgment of short and long durations, i.e., the cognitive mechanisms of attention and memory, respectively.

59,Self-reported and experimentally induced self-disgust is heightened in Parkinson’s disease: Contribution of behavioural symptoms,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with deficits in the recognition and expression of basic emotions, although self-reported levels of the self-conscious emotions shame and embarrassment are higher. However, one self-conscious emotion—self-disgust–which has been shown to have a negative impact on psychological wellbeing, has not been investigated in PD before. Here we employed self-report measures of self-conscious emotions, and an emotion induction paradigm involving images of the self, and narrated personal vignettes of instances when patients with PD (and controls) found themselves disgusting. We found that self-reported and induced levels of self-disgust were higher in PD patients than in matched controls, and that trait self-disgust was specifically related to disorders of impulse control in PD patients. Given the link between self-disgust and impaired psychological wellbeing, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression in PD, self-disgust might make a useful therapeutic target for psychological interventions in the condition.

60,Prevalence and correlates of partner violence among adolescent girls and young women: Evidence from baseline data of a cluster randomised trial in Tanzania,"Background: Little has been documented about partner violence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who are out of school, a factor associated with HIV acquisition. To understand areas for prioritising HIV prevention intervention efforts, we explored the prevalence and correlates of partner violence among out of school AGYW in Shinyanga, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data from AGYW aged 15–23 years recruited in a cluster randomised trial conducted between October and December 2017 was used to examine correlates of partner violence. Data were collected through an Audio Computer-Assisted Self interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association. Results: 2276 (75.5%) AGYW were sexually active. Of these, 816 (35.9%) reported having experienced violence from partners in the last six months. After adjusting for other covariates, being formerly married (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI:1.02, 2.37), having children (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI:1.47, 2.16), anxiety and depression symptoms (AOR = 3.27, 95%CI: 2.15, 4.96), having engaged in sex work in the past six months (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.53) and economic deprivation (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.34,1.92) were significantly associated with partner violence. Conclusions: Almost one in three sexually active AGYW had experienced partner violence in the 6 months preceding the survey. The findings underscore the need for future research to focus on understanding the reasons and dynamics underlying high level of partner violence among AGYW. Furthermore, there is a need for implementing intervention programs that aim to reduce economic deprivation among AGYWs and address social norms and structures perpetuating violence against AGYW.

61,Relatives’ attachment anxiety mediates the association between perceived loss and expressed emotion in early psychosis,"A common reaction experienced by family members of patients with psychosis is grief for the loss of their healthy relative. Importantly, high levels of perceived loss have been related to the manifestation of high expressed emotion (EE), which includes the negative attitudes expressed by relatives toward an ill family member. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between relatives’ perceived loss and EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis are still not fully understood. In this regard, attachment theory has been suggested as a useful framework for understanding this link. The current study aimed to examine: (1) whether relatives’ perceived loss was associated with relatives’ EE dimensions (i.e., criticism and emotional over-involvement (EOI)), and (2) whether such associations were mediated by relatives’ attachment dimensions (i.e., anxiety and avoidance). Seventy-eight relatives of patients with early psychosis completed the Mental Illness Version of the Texas Inventory of Grief for the assessment of loss reactions. Attachment dimensions and EE attitudes were assessed by the Psychosis Attachment Measure and the Family Questionnaire, respectively. Findings indicated that relatives’ perceived loss was associated with EE dimensions. Relatives’ attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, mediated the relationship of perceived loss with both criticism and EOI. Findings highlight the importance of examining the role of relatives’ attachment characteristics for understanding how perceptions of loss might impact the manifestation of EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis. Family interventions aimed at assisting relatives to improve their management of negative emotional reactions to loss are fundamental to prevent impairing loss reactions and the entrenchment of high-EE attitudes.

62,Preference-based serial decisions are counterintuitively influenced by emotion regulation and conscientiousness,"Our decisions have a temporally distributed order, and different choice orders (e.g., choosing preferred items first or last) can lead to vastly different experiences. We previously found two dominant strategies (favorite-first and favorite-last) in a preference-based serial choice setting (the ‘sushi problem’). However, it remains unclear why these two opposite behavioral patterns arise: i.e., the mechanisms underlying them. Here we developed a novel serialchoice task, using pictures based on attractiveness, to test for a possible shared mechanism with delay discounting, the ‘peak-end’ bias (i.e., preference for experienced sequences that end well), or working-memory capacity. We also collected psychological and clinical metric data on personality, depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation. We again found the two dominant selection strategies. However, the results of the delay, peak-end bias, and memory capacity tasks were not related to serial choice, while two key psychological metrics were: emotion regulation and conscientiousness (with agreeableness also marginally related). Favorite-first strategists actually regulated emotions better, suggesting better tolerance of negative outcomes. Whereas participants with more varied strategies across trials were more conscientious (and perhaps agreeable), suggesting that they were less willing to settle for a single, simpler strategy. Our findings clarify mechanisms underlying serial choice and show that it may reflect a unique ability to organize choices into sequences of events.

63,E-MOVIE—Experimental MOVies for Induction of Emotions in neuroscience: An innovative film database with normative data and sex differences,"The need for a validated set of emotional clips to elicit emotions in more ecological experiments is increasing. Here we present the validation of a new database of emotional films, named E-MOVIE, which includes, in this first validation phase, 39 excerpts arranged in six categories, three negative (Fear, Sadness and Compassion), two positive (Erotic and Scenery) and a Neutral category. Notably, Compassion and Scenery are new in the field as they were not included in other databases. The clips in E-MOVIE are characterized by homogenous durations of approximately two minutes, which make them suitable for psychophysiological research. In order to study the affective profile prompted by each category 174 participants (112 women) rated the movies on multiple dimensions, namely valence and arousal, intensity and discreteness of the induction of one of the six basic emotions and, finally, intensity of the experience of the emotional states defined by a series of emotional adjectives. Erotic clips were effective in the elicitation of a positive emotional state, characterized by high levels of arousal and excitement. On the other hand, Fear clips (selected without blood to avoid disgust reaction) prompted an affect characterized by high arousal, low valence and high levels of reported fear and anxiety. Women reported greater unpleasantness, distress, anxiety and jittery than men to the three negative categories. Compassion clips, characterized by the depiction of crying characters, were able to induce an affective state dominated by sadness and feeling touched, consistent with an empathic reaction to emotional sufferance. Sadness clips, instead, elicited an affective state characterized by sadness together with distress and angst. We also demonstrated that clips depicting natural environments (i.e. Scenery) prompted in the viewer a surprised, inspired affective state, characterized by high valence and arousal (especially in males), a result which suggests that their past categorization as neutral stimuli was inaccurate and problematic.

64,Sub-types of safety behaviours and their effects on social anxiety disorder,"Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is maintained through the use of safety behaviours. Previous reports propose that these safety behaviours can be subdivided into two main categories: avoidance and impression management. Study 1 investigates whether certain safety behaviours are specific to SAD. The social behaviour questionnaire was administered to individuals with SAD ( N = 106), post-traumatic stress disorder ( N = 28) and non-patient controls ( N = 59). A factor analysis ( N = 164) replicated the previously reported avoidance and impression management subtypes. Scores for both subtypes were significantly higher in individuals with SAD than in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder or non-patient controls. Study 2 investigated the causal role of such safety behaviours using an experimental design in a non-clinical population ( N = 96). Pairs of participants each engaged in two conversations. In one of the conversations, a randomly selected participant performed either avoidance or impression management safety behaviours. In the other conversation, neither participant was instructed to use safety behaviours. Each participant rated their own anxiety and performance as well as rating the other person. Videos of the conversations were also rated. Both types of safety behaviour increased anxiety in the person performing the safety behaviour. The avoidance subtype also had broader effects on the other person that were largely absent from the impression management subtype. Taken together the studies provide support for the distinction between safety behaviour subtypes and have implications for the treatment of SAD.

65,Reconsidering the associations between self-reported alcohol use disorder and mental health problems in the light of co-occurring addictions in young Swiss men,"Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is known to co-occur with other addictions, as well as with mental health problems. However, the effects of other addictions co-occurring with AUD on mental health problems were rarely studied and not considering them may bias estimates of the association between AUD and mental health problems. This study investigated which role co-occurring addictions play for the cross-sectional associations between self-reported AUD and mental health problems. Method: Participants were 5516 young Swiss men (73.0% of those that gave written informed consent) who completed a self-report questionnaire. Using short screening questionnaires, we assessed three substance use disorders (alcohol, cannabis and tobacco), seven behavioural addictions (internet, gaming, smartphone, internet sex, gambling, work, exercise) and four mental health problems (major depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social anxiety disorder). Differences in the proportions of mental health problems were tested using logistic regressions between (1) participants with no AUD and AUD, (2) participants with no AUD and AUD alone and (3) participants with no AUD and AUD plus at least one co-occurring addiction. Results: Overall, (1) participants with AUD had higher proportions of major depression (Odds ratio (OR [95% confidence interval]) = 3.51 [2.73, 4.52]; ADHD (OR = 3.12 [2.41, 4.03]); bipolar disorder (OR = 4.94 [3.38, 7.21]) and social anxiety (OR = 2.21 [1.79, 2.73])) compared to participants with no AUD. Considering only participants with AUD alone compared to participants with no AUD (2), differences in proportions were no longer significant for major depression (OR = 0.83 [0.42, 1.64]), bipolar disorder (OR = 1.69 [0.67, 4.22]), social anxiety (OR = 1.15 [0.77, 1.73]) and ADHD (OR = 1.65 [1.00, 2.72]) compared to participants with no AUD. In contrast, (3) proportions of mental health problems were considerably higher for participants with AUD plus at least one other addiction when compared to participants with no AUD, with OR’s ranging from 2.90 [2.27, 3.70] for social anxiety, 4.03 [3.02, 5.38] for ADHD, 5.29 [4.02, 6.97] for major depression to 6.64 [4.44, 9.94] for bipolar disorder. Conclusions: AUD was associated with all four measured mental health problems. However, these associations were mainly due to the high proportions of these mental health problems in participants with AUD plus at least one co-occurring addiction and only to a lesser degree due to participants with AUD alone (i.e. without any other co-occurring addictions). Hence, estimates of the association between AUD and mental health problems that do not consider other addictions may be biased (i.e. overestimated). These findings imply that considering addictions co-occurring with AUD, including behavioural addictions, is important when investigating associations between AUD and mental health problems, and for the treatment of AUD and co-morbid disorders.

66,PTSD in prison settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis of comorbid mental disorders and problematic behaviours,"Purpose: Prevalence rates of PTSD are higher in the prison population than in the community. We sought to systematically review the extent to which this disorder is associated with other mental health disorders and problematic suicidal or aggressive behaviours in the prison population. Methods: Studies reporting a relationship between PTSD and comorbid mental disorders and/or problematic behaviours in imprisoned adolescent and adult populations were identified from four bibliographic indexes. Primary studies involving clinical interviews, validated instruments leading to DSM or ICD diagnoses, or validated self-report questionnaires such as the PTSD checklist were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted where possible. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: This review identified 36 studies, with a combined sample of 9594 participants, (6478 male and 2847 female prisoners) from 11 countries. Thirty-four of the identified studies employed a cross-sectional design. We identified significant associations between PTSD and comorbid mental disorders including depression (OR = 3.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3–4.9), anxiety (OR = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8–4.7) and substance use (OR = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5–2.4). We also identified significant associations between PTSD and suicidality (OR = 3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4–3.8) and aggressive behaviours (this latter finding was not subject to meta-analysis). Significant methodological heterogeneity was identified between studies. Conclusions: High rates of psychiatric comorbidity among prisoners with PTSD, and links to suicidal behaviour, self-harm and aggressive behaviour, provide further support for the need for trauma-informed treatment approaches in prisons. However, significant gaps in the current evidence were apparent. In particular, a lack of large, longitudinal studies meant that the temporal relationships between PTSD and relevant outcomes cannot currently be determined.

67,Placebo analgesia induced by verbal suggestion in the context of experimentally induced fear and anxiety,"The role of state anxiety and state fear in placebo effects is still to be determined. We aimed to investigate the effect of fear of movement-related pain (FMRP) and contextual pain related anxiety (CPRA) on the magnitude of placebo analgesia induced by verbal suggestion. Fifty-six female participants completed a modified voluntary joystick movement paradigm (VJMP) where half participated in a predictable pain condition (PC), in which one of the joystick movements is always followed by pain and the other movement is never followed by pain, and half in an unpredictable pain condition (UC), in which pain was delivered unpredictably. By varying the level of pain predictability, FMRP and CPRA were induced in PC and UC respectively. Colour stimuli were presented at the beginning of each trail. Half of the participants were verbally informed that the green or red colour indicated less painful stimuli (experimental groups), the other half did not receive any suggestion (control groups). We measured self-reported pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity (PC only), pain related fear and anxiety (eyeblink startle response and self-ratings) and avoidance behaviour (movement-onset latency and duration). The results indicate that the placebo effect was successfully induced in both experimental conditions. In the PC, the placebo effect was predicted by expectancy. Despite the fact that FMRP and CPRA were successfully induced, no difference was found in the magnitude of the placebo effect between PC and UC. Concluding, we did not find a divergent effect of fear and anxiety on placebo analgesia.

68,"How well do cancer survivor self-classifications of anxiety, depression and stress agree with a standardised tool? Results of a cross-sectional study","Background: There is poor uptake of psychosocial interventions offered to people with cancer who record high scores on distress screening scales. Intervention uptake may be influenced by a mismatch between consumer (bottom-up) and professional (top-down) paradigms of wellbeing. The current research aims to compare cancer survivors’ ‘self-judgements’ about their levels of anxiety, depression and stress, to classifications derived via a professional-driven measure, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken with haematological cancer survivors recruited from three population-based cancer registries in Australia. Consenting participants were mailed a questionnaire package; and non-responders received a second questionnaire package after 3-weeks and a reminder call after 6-weeks. The consumer-driven perspective was assessed via three separate single items asking survivors to self-classify their levels of anxiety, depression and stress over the past week on a scale from ‘normal’ to ‘extremely severe’. The professional-driven classification was assessed via the DASS-21. Kappa statistics were used to assess agreement between consumer- and professional-driven measures. Results: Of 2,971 eligible haematological cancer survivors, 1,239 (42%) provided written consent and were mailed a questionnaire package. Of these, 984 (79%) returned a completed questionnaire. The simple kappa for agreement between the DASS-21 and self-classified measures for anxiety was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001). The weighted kappa for agreement between the DASS-21 and self-classified measures of depression was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001) and for measures of stress was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Moderate agreement between self-classification and professional-driven assessments was found. The value of screening is predicated on the assumption that those with identified needs will be offered and take up services that will benefit them. Our results suggest that to improve the utility of distress screening it may be important to include assessment of survivor views about their symptoms.

69,A randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for adolescents with anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in adolescence, but access to health care services is limited and only few receive professional help. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been proposed to increase accessibility and reduce costs of treatment. Objective The study evaluated the efficacy of a Danish version of the guided ICBT program ChilledOut Online, developed at the Centre for Emotional Health, Macquarie University, Australia. Method: At the Centre for Psychological Treatment of Children and Adolescents, Aarhus University, Denmark, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with 70 adolescents (13–17 years) with anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV. Participants were randomly assigned to a 14-weeks therapist-guided ICBT or to a waitlist condition. Outcomes were evaluated post-treatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Results: At post-treatment, the ICBT group significantly outperformed the waitlist condition with moderate to large between-group effect sizes on diagnostic severity and anxiety symptoms rated by clinicians, and by adolescents and their parents. Forty percent of adolescents in ICBT were free of their primary diagnosis compared to 16% in the waitlist condition. Treatment gains were maintained at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: Results of the study provide support for the efficacy of guided ICBT for adolescents with anxiety disorders.

70,The effect of cathodal tDCS on fear extinction: A cross-measures study,"Background: Extinction-based procedures are often used to inhibit maladaptive fear responses. However, because extinction procedures show efficacy limitations, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a promising add-on enhancer. Objective In this study, we tested how cathodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affects extinction and tried to unveil the processes at play that boost the effectiveness of extinction procedures and its translational potential to the treatment of anxiety disorders. Methods: We implemented a fear conditioning paradigm whereby 41 healthy women (mean age = 20.51 ± 5.0) were assigned to either cathodal tDCS (n = 27) or sham tDCS (n = 16). Fear responses were measured with self-reports, autonomic responses, and implicit avoidance tendencies. Results: Cathodal tDCS shows no statistically significant effect in extinction, according to self-reports, and seems to even negatively affect fear conditioned skin conductance responses. However, one to three months after the tDCS session and extinction, we found a group difference in the action tendencies towards the neutral stimuli (F (1, 41) = 12.04, p = .001, ηp² = .227), with the cathodal tDCS group (as opposed to the sham group) showing a safety learning (a positive bias towards the CS-), with a moderate effect size. This suggests that cathodal tDCS may foster stimuli discrimination, leading to a decreased generalization effect. Discussion: Cathodal tDCS may have enhanced long-term distinctiveness between threatening cues and perceptively similar neutral cues through a disambiguation process of the value of the neutral stimuli—a therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. Future studies should confirm these results and extend the study of cathodal tDCS effect on short term avoidance tendencies.

71,Mental health and quality of life outcomes in family members of patients with chronic critical illness admitted to the intensive care units of two Brazilian hospitals serving the extremes of the socioeconomic spectrum,"Chronic critical illness (CCI) is a relevant clinical, social and financial health issue. The aim of this study was to compare the mental outcomes (symptoms of anxiety and depression) and quality of life outcomes of the family members of patients with CCI from different socioeconomic backgrounds who were admitted to one of the intensive care units (ICUs) in two Brazilian hospitals, one private and one public. It is a prospective study involving a public hospital that serves a low-income population and a tertiary private hospital that serves a high-income population. Family members of patients with CCI answered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The World Health Organization Quality of Life– WHOQOL-bref questionnaires. They responded to the European Quality of life Five Dimension three Level (EuroQol-5D-3L) and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaires on behalf of the patients at three time points: during the ICU stay, 30 and 90 days after the patient was discharged. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the main predictors of a binary outcome regarding symptoms of anxiety and depression. We enrolled 186 patients with CCI. Many patients from public hospitals who were independent became dependent for their ADLs at 90 days (41.7% versus 14.3%, p = 0.03). At 30 days, family members from public hospital had worse impact on all domains of WHOQOL-bref compared with families from private hospital. At 90-days, the difference persists in the physical domain, worse for families from public hospital (p = 0.006). The symptoms of depression at 30-days (p = 0.008) and at 90-days (p = 0.013) were worse in the public hospital. CCIs affected quality of life and the emotional condition of family members, especially in families with fewer resources when the patients became more dependent. Family members with higher education were more likely to experience depression, while depression was associated with cohabiting with the patient in low-income families.

72,Distraction of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit may induce anxiety-like behavior in allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract, which is associated with high incidence of anxiety symptom. There is evidence that medial prefrontal cortex modulates anxiety-related behaviors and receives projections from olfactory bulb. Since olfactory dysfunction has been reported in allergic rhinitis, we aimed to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and oscillations of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit in an animal model of allergic rhinitis. The number of open arm entries in elevated zero maze was significantly reduced in sensitized rats exposed to intranasal ovalbumin compared to the control group, which was indicating the enhancement of anxiety-like behavior in allergic rhinitis animals. Analysis of local field potentials in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex during immobility and exploration state showed that anxiety-like behavior induced by allergic rhinitis was in association with increased activity of medial prefrontal cortex and enhancement of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex coupling in delta and theta bands. Moreover, in allergic rhinitis animals, theta strongly coordinates local gamma activity in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex, which means to have a strong local theta/gamma coupling. We suggested that disruption of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit due to allergic reactions might have a governing role for inducing anxiety-like behavior in the allergic rhinitis experimental model.

73,Distinguishing mild cognitive impairment from healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease: The contribution of the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS),"Executive functions are affected differently in healthy aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and evaluating them is important for differential diagnosis. The INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) is a brief neuropsychological screening tool, developed to assess executive dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Goals: We aimed to examine whether and how MCI patients can be differentiated from cognitively healthy controls (HC) and mild to moderate AD patients based on IFS performance. We also explored how IFS scores are associated with age, years of education, and depressive/anxious symptoms (as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Method: IFS total scores were compared between 26 HC, 32 MCI and 21 mild to moderate AD patients. The three groups were matched for age and education. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was analyzed and optimal cut-offs were determined. Results: Healthy participants had higher IFS scores than both clinical groups, and MCI patients had higher scores than AD patients. IFS showed high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of MCI (AUC = .89, p &lt; .001) and AD (AUC = .99, p &lt; .001), and for the differentiation between the clinical groups (AUC = .76, p &lt; .001). We provide optimal cut-offs for the identification of MCI and AD and for their differentiation. We also found that, in general, higher education predicted higher IFS scores (no associations with age and depressive/anxious symptoms were observed). Altogether, these findings indicate that evaluating executive functions with the IFS can be valuable for the identification of MCI, a high-risk group for dementia, and for differentiating this condition from healthy aging and AD.

74,The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale: Stable structure but subscale of limited value to detect anxiety,"Purpose: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) aims at detecting postpartum depression. It has been hypothesized that a subscale (items 3, 4, 5) may detect anxiety. The aim of this study is to assess whether this EPDS anxiety subscale is present in a community-based dataset, and if so, to assess its validity and stability during the first six months postpartum. Methods: We obtained EPDS data of a community sample of 1612 women at 1 month, with follow-up at 3 and 6 months, postpartum (Post-Up study). We performed an exploratory factor analysis on the EPDS forcing two- and three-factor solutions. We assessed the correlations of the extracted factor subscales and the total EPDS with the short-form of the STAI (STAI-6). We examined the stability of the identified factors by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using the EPDS data collected at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Both the two- and three-factor solutions contained a hypothesized anxiety subscale of items 3,4,5,10, and fitted well with the 3- and 6-months EPDS data, with CFI and TLI values &gt;.99 and RMSEA and SRMR values &lt; .035 and &lt; .45. The subscale’s Pearson correlations with the STAI-6 were moderate: .516, compared to .643 for the total EPDS. Conclusions: The factor structure of the EPDS is stable across the first six months postpartum, and includes the subscale assumed to represent anxiety. However, this subscale as well as the total EPDS correlate only moderately with anxiety criteria. Using the EPDS thus does not imply adequate screening for anxiety.

75,Accuracy of online survey assessment of mental disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in Spanish university students. Results of the WHO World Mental Health- International College Student initiative,"Objective: To assess the accuracy of WMH-ICS online screening scales for evaluating four common mental disorders (Major Depressive Episode[MDE], Mania/Hypomania[M/H], Panic Disorder[ PD], Generalized Anxiety Disorder[GAD]) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors[STB] used in the UNIVERSAL project. Methods: Clinical diagnostic reappraisal was carried out on a subsample of the UNIVERSAL project, a longitudinal online survey of first year Spanish students (18–24 years old), part of the WHO World Mental Health-International College Student (WMH-ICS) initiative. Lifetime and 12- month prevalence of MDE, M/H, PD, GAD and STB were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Screening Scales [CIDI-SC], the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview [SITBI] and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]. Trained clinical psychologists, blinded to responses in the initial survey, administered via telephone the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]. Measures of diagnostic accuracy and McNemar χ² test were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to maximize diagnostic capacity. Results: A total of 287 students were included in the clinical reappraisal study. For 12-month and lifetime mood disorders, sensitivity/specificity were 67%/88.6% and 65%/73.3%, respectively. For 12-month and lifetime anxiety disorders, these were 76.8%/86.5% and 59.6%/71.1%, and for 12-month and lifetime STB, 75.9%/94.8% and 87.2%/86.3%. For 12-month and lifetime mood disorders, anxiety disorders and STB, positive predictive values were in the range of 18.1–55.1% and negative predictive values 90.2–99.0%; likelihood ratios positive were in the range of 2.1–14.6 and likelihood ratios negative 0.1–0.6. All outcomes showed adequate areas under the curve [AUCs] (AUC &gt; 0.7), except M/H and PD (AUC = 0.6). Post hoc analyses to select optimal diagnostic thresholds led to improved concordance for all diagnoses (AUCs &gt; 0.8). Conclusion: The WMS-ICS survey showed reasonable concordance with the MINI telephone interviews performed by mental health professionals, when utilizing optimized cut-off scores. The current study provides initial evidence that the WMS-ICS survey might be useful for screening purposes.

76,Sex differences in cued fear responses and parvalbumin cell density in the hippocampus following repetitive concussive brain injuries in C57BL/6J mice,"There is strong evidence to suggest a link between repeated head trauma and cognitive and emotional disorders, and Repetitive concussive brain injuries (rCBI) may also be a risk factor for depression and anxiety disorders. Animal models of brain injury afford the opportunity for controlled study of the effects of injury on functional outcomes. In this study, male and cycling female C57BL/6J mice sustained rCBI (3x) at 24-hr intervals and were tested in a context and cued fear conditioning paradigm, open field (OF), elevated zero maze and tail suspension test. All mice with rCBI showed less freezing behavior than sham control mice during the fear conditioning context test. Injured male, but not female mice also froze less in response to the auditory cue (tone). Injured mice were hyperactive in an OF environment and spent more time in the open quadrants of the elevated zero maze, suggesting decreased anxiety, but there were no differences between injured mice and sham-controls in depressive-like activity on the tail suspension test. Pathologically, injured mice showed increased astrogliosis in the injured cortex and white matter tracts (optic tracts and corpus callosum). There were no changes in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cortex or amygdala, but injured male mice had fewer parvalbumin-positive neurons in the hippocampus. Parvalbumin-reactive interneurons of the hippocampus have been previously demonstrated to be involved in hippocampal-cortical interactions required for memory consolidation, and it is possible memory changes in the fear-conditioning paradigm following rCBI are the result of more subtle imbalances in excitation and inhibition both within the amygdala and hippocampus, and between more widespread brain regions that are injured following a diffuse brain injury.

77,Anxiety and depression relationship with coronary slow flow,"Background: Psychiatric disorders (depression / anxiety) are linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary slow flow (CSF) is a relatively common form of CAD with the same underlying mechanisms that are attributed to many anatomic and pathophysiologic factors. However, the relationship between psychiatric disorders and CSF is less well-established; and this is the aim of this study. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted on the first 50 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSF by elective coronary angiography (CAG). They were compared with another 50 consecutive patients showing normal coronaries by CAG. Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory were used for assessment. CSF was diagnosed by coronary angiography “Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction” frame count. Lipid profile was obtained for all patients. Results: Traditional risk factors (male gender, smoking, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides) were higher in the CSF group. Depression and anxiety scores were also higher in the CSF group. On multivariate analysis, male gender, depression and high triglycerides were the only significant independent predictors of CSF. A significant correlation existed between CSF and both anxiety and depression scores. Both scores were also significantly higher in multivessel vs single vessel affection. Conclusion: Psychiatric depression, male gender and high triglycerides are highly associated with CSF in patients undergoing elective CAG. There is a significant correlation between CSF severity and the severity of both anxiety and depression. Further studies are warranted to explore the impact of psychological intervention on CSF and its long-term outcome.

78,Influence of aging on the behavioral phenotypes of C57BL/6J mice after social defeat,"Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric disorders that can occur throughout an individual’s lifetime. Numerous pathways underlying the onset of these diseases have been identified in rodents using a social defeat stress protocol, whereby socially defeated individuals exhibit depression- and/or anxiety-like phenotypes that typically manifest as social avoidance behavior. However, most studies in this field have been conducted using young adult mice; therefore, information about social defeat stress-related behavioral phenotypes in older mice is limited. In this study, we exposed groups of young adult (8–16 weeks old) and aged (24 months old) C57BL/6J mice to mild social defeat stress by challenging them with aggressive CD1 mice while restricting the intensity of aggression to protect the animals from severe injuries. We then identified stress-induced behavioral changes and compared their expression between the age groups and with a non-defeated (non-stressed) control group. We found that the stressed mice in both age groups exhibited similar reduced social interactions that were indicative of increased social avoidance behavior. Moreover, unlike the young stressed and control groups, only the aged stressed group showed a reduced preference for sucrose, which was correlated with social avoidance behavior. Also, the aged stressed mice exhibited an attenuated defeat-induced increase in water intake. These findings reveal that aging alters behavioral phenotypes after social defeat and that the hedonic behavior of aged mice is more vulnerable to social defeat compared with younger mice.

It also appears that oceanic blue spaces may be salutogenic, benefitting mental health through their expansive viewscapes, and possibly auditory and olfactory stimuli. Yet, it is unknown whether the same is true for freshwater bodies. In this ecological study, we explored associations between hospitalizations for anxiety/mood disorder in Michigan (&gt; 30,000) and proximity to the North American Great Lakes. As a sensitivity analysis, we examined associations for 15 different inland lake sizes. Results showed small, protective effects for distance to Great Lake (β = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001) and percentage of inland lakes (β = -0.04, p = 0.004). Unexpectedly, shorter distance to nearest inland lake was associated with higher anxiety/mood disorder hospitalizations. The protective effects of percentage area covered by inland lakes was observed for all lake sizes. These initial findings provide a foundation for future individual-level research with finer measurement of health outcomes and blue space exposure.

80,Measurement equivalence of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) in adolescents and emerging adults,"The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) is a self-report instrument measuring distress, depression, anxiety and somatization. The questionnaire has been developed and validated in adult samples. It is unknown whether adolescents and emerging adults respond to the 4DSQ items in the same way as adults do. The objective of the study was to examine measurement equivalence of the 4DSQ across adolescents, emerging adults and adults. 4DSQ data were collected in a primary care psychotherapy practice (N = 1349). Measurement equivalence was assessed using differential item and test functioning (DIF and DTF) analysis in an item response theory framework. DIF was compared across the following groups: adolescents (age 10–17), emerging adults (age 18–25), and adults (age 26– 40). DIF was found in 9 items (out of 50) across adolescents and adults, and in 4 items across emerging adults and adults. The item with the largest DIF was ‘difficulty getting to sleep’, which was less severe for adolescents compared to adults. A likely explanation is that adolescents have a high base rate for problems with sleep initiation. The effect of DIF on the scale scores (DTF) was negligible. Adolescents and emerging adults score some 4DSQ items differently compared to adults but this had practically no effect on 4DSQ scale scores. 4DSQ scale scores from adolescents and emerging adults can be interpreted in the same way as 4DSQ scores from adults.

81,The development and psychometric evaluation of the Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory-15,"The Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory (CBF-PI), a 134-item self-report scale, and its 40-item brief version (CBF-PI-B) are sound psychometric instruments used to measure the Big Five personality domains in the Chinese population. However, their applicability is limited by their length, as well as restricted by assessment conditions. In this study, we developed and validated a new shortened version with 15 items (CBF-PI-15) through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis in a large sample (Sample 1) of 10,738 Chinese adults (mean = 33.90 years, SD = 9.39 years, range 17–57 years). Measurement invariance results suggested the CBF-PI-15 were invariant across gender and age groups. Convergent, discriminant and criterion validities were tested in Sample 2 ( N = 256, mean = 21.62 years, SD = 3.06 years, range 18–35 years) and findings showed an expected correlational pattern with external variables. Results revealed positive correlations of Neuroticism with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Brief Version (BIS-Brief), the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener, as well as a strongly negative correlation between Conscientiousness and BIS-Brief. Additionally, Conscientiousness positively correlated with academic performance as expected. In conclusion, the CBF-PI-15 holds promise as an informative alternative for the original CBF-PI-B when administration time or conditions are limited, and our findings provide preliminary support for the utility of the CBF-PI-15.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-04798-001). Objective: This study examined associations between the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and measures of depression, anxiety, eating disorder psychopathology, stress, and personality in a group of healthy adult females. Methods: Female participants (n = 91) ages 19 ± 50 years with BMI 18.5 ± 25 kg/m² were recruited from central North Carolina between July 2014 and March 2015. Participants provided a single fecal sample and completed an online psychiatric questionnaire that included five measures: (i) Beck Anxiety Inventory; (ii) Beck Depression Inventory-II; (iii) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; (iv) Perceived Stress Scale; and (v) Mini International Personality Item Pool. Bacterial composition and diversity were characterized by Illumine sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and associations were examined using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient, in conjunction with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate procedure. Results: We found no significant associations between microbial markers of gut composition and diversity and scores on psychiatric measures of anxiety, depression, eating-related thoughts and behaviors, stress, or personality in a large cohort of healthy adult females. Discussion: This study was the first specifically to examine associations between the intestinal microbiota and psychiatric measures in healthy females, and based on 16S rRNA taxonomic abundances and diversity measures, our results do not suggest a strong role for the enteric microbe-gut-brain axis in normal variation on responses to psychiatric measures in this population. However, the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathophysiology of psychiatric illness may be limited to more severe psychopathology.

83,Pain interference type and level guide the assessment process in chronic pain: Categorizing pain patients entering tertiary pain treatment with the Brief Pain Inventory,"Chronic pain patients enter treatment with different problem profiles making careful assessment a necessity for more individualized treatment plans. In this cross-sectional study we assigned 320 patients entering tertiary multidisciplinary pain treatment into four categories based on whether they scored low or high on the activity and the affective pain interference dimensions of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). To determine whether this categorization system delineates issues that should be assessed further, the categories were compared with ANOVA and MANOVA analyses on three domains: variables affecting physical well-being (body mass index, exercise, substance use), psychological resources (mood), and pain-specific psychological factors (pain anxiety, pain acceptance). The results indicated that subjects who scored low on both interference dimensions compared similarly in weight: mean Body Mass Index (BMI) 27.0 (SD 6.0) kg/m², and exercise: mean of 2.4 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions over 20 minutes per week, to the general population, had no depressive symptoms on average: mean Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II) score 11.7 (SD 7.5), and had the most favorable psychological reactions to pain relative to the other categories: mean total Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale-20 (PASS-20) score 36.4 (SD 17.9). In contrast, when interference was high on activity, more physical well-being problems were evident e.g. weight: mean BMI 31.0 (SD 7.3) kg/m², diminished exercise: mean of 1.5 (SD 1.6) exercising sessions per week, and avoidance behavior: mean PASS-20 Escape/Avoidance subscale 3.7 (95% CI: 1.7 to 5.8) scores higher in comparison to activity interference remaining low. With high affective interference, more depressive symptoms: mean BDI-II score 17.7 (SD 7.3), and more cognitive pain anxiety: mean PASS-20 Cognitive Anxiety subscale 2.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.8) scores higher in comparison to affective interference remaining low, emerged. Having high interference on both dimensions indicated accumulated risks for reduced physical well-being: mean BMI 29.9 (SD 6.1) kg/m², mean of 1.2 (SD 1.7) exercising sessions per week, mood problems: mean BDI-II 20.3 (SD 10.6), and negative psychological reactions to pain: mean total PASS-20 score 53.2 (18.4). The results suggest that low interference on both dimensions may allow assessment with only physician consultations, while high interference on either dimension may call attention to distinct issues to be addressed with the help of a physiotherapist or a psychologist, whereas high interference on both dimensions highlights the need for a full multidisciplinary assessment.

84,Prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety symptoms among out-of-school adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania: A cross-sectional study,"Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who are out of school are at higher risk of depressive and anxiety disorders compared to their school attending peers. However, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for these conditions among out-of-school AGYW. This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated factors in a community sample of out-of-school AGYW in Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an on-going cluster randomized controlled trial in North-West Tanzania was conducted. A total of 3013 out-of-school AGYW aged 15 to 23 years from 30 clusters were included. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a tool comprising of PHQ-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-2) screeners. Data were collected using Audio Computer-Assisted Self- Interview (ACASI). A random-effects logistic regression was fitted for binary outcomes and an ordinal logistic regression model with robust variance was used to adjust for clustering at the village level. Logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression were used to explore the associations between mental disorders symptoms and other factors. Results: The prevalence of depressive (PHQ-2 ≥ 3) and anxiety (GAD-2 ≥ 3) symptoms among outof- school AGYW were 36% (95% CI 33.8%-37.3%) and 31% (95% CI 29.0%-32.3%) respectively. Further, using the PHQ-4 tool, 33% (95% CI 30.8%-34.2%) had mild, 20% (95% CI 18.3%-21.1%) moderate and 6% (95% CI 5.5%-7.2%) had severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. After adjusting for other covariates, two factors most strongly associated with having anxiety symptoms were violence experience from sexual partners (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.36–1.96) and HIV positive status (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.03–2.31). Likewise, living alone, with younger siblings or others (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.47–4.29) and violence experience from sexual partners (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.59–2.27) were strongly associated with depression symptoms. Having savings (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.95) and emotional support (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.67–0.99) were protective against depression and anxiety, respectively. Conclusion: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent among out-of-school AGYW in Tanzania. The findings emphasize the need to strengthen preventive interventions and scale-up mental health disorder screening, referral for diagnosis and management.

The current study examines patterns of service reception and costs among Medicaid-covered youth newly diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or behavioral disturbance in a large data set of provider billing claims submitted between 2015–2016. Eligibility criteria included: 1) identification of an initial diagnosis of a single anxiety, unipolar mood, or specific behavioral disorder; 2) continuous Medicaid eligibility over the duration of the time period studied; and 3) under 18 years of age on the date of initial psychiatric diagnosis. The final cohort included 7,627 cases with a mean age of 10.65 (± 4.36), of which 58.04% were male, 57.09% were Black, 38.97% were White, and 3.95% were of other ethnicities. Data indicated that 65.94% of the cohort received at least some follow-up services within a median 18 days of diagnosis. Of those, 54.27% received a combination of medical and psychosocial services, 32.01% received medical services only, and 13.72% received psychosocial services only. Overall median costs for direct treatment were $576.69, with wide discrepancies between the lowest (anxiety = $308.41) and highest (behavioral disturbance = $653.59) diagnostic categories. Across all categories the frequency and duration of psychosocial services were much lower than would be expected in comparison to data from a well-known effectiveness trial. Overall, follow-up to psychiatric diagnosis could be characterized as highly variable, underutilized, and emphasizing biomedical treatment. Understanding more about these patterns may facilitate systematic improvements and greater cost efficiency in the future.

86,Involvement of Toll-like receptor 2 in the cerebral immune response and behavioral changes caused by latent &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; infection in mice,"Subacute and chronic infections with the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are associated with an increased risk of psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in T. gondii -induced neuronal disorders. Recently, we reported that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was required to initiate the innate immune response in cultured mouse brain cells. However, how TLR2 contributes to latent infection with T. gondii remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the role of TLR2 in brain pathology and behavior using wild-type (TLR2 +/+ ) and TLR2-deficient (TLR2 -/- ) mice. The behavioral analyses showed that TLR2 deficiency increased the anxiety state of the uninfected and infected animals alike, and TLR2 deficiency showed no relationship with the infection. In the contextual and cued fear-conditioning tests, T. gondii infection decreased the mouse freezing reaction while TLR2 deficiency increased it, but there was no interaction between the two factors. Our histopathological analysis showed that the TLR2 +/+ and TLR2 -/- mice had similar brain lesions at 30 days post infection (dpi) with T. gondii . Higher numbers of parasites were detected in the brains of the TLR2 -/- mice than in those from the TLR2 +/+ mice at 30 dpi, but not at 7 and 14 dpi. No significant differences were observed in the proinflammatory gene expression levels in the TLR2 +/+ and TLR2-/- mice. Therefore, it appears that TLR2 signaling in the brain might contribute to the control of parasite growth, but not to brain pathology or the impaired fear memory response induced by infection with T. gondii .

87,Can verbal suggestions strengthen the effects of a relaxation intervention?,"Short stress management interventions such as relaxation therapy have demonstrated preliminary effectiveness in reducing stress-related problems. A promising tool to strengthen the effectiveness of relaxation-based interventions is the use of verbal suggestions, as previous research provided evidence that verbal suggestions can induce positive outcome expectancies, facilitate adaptive responses to stress and improve health outcomes. The present experimental proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the effects of a brief relaxation intervention and specifically the role of verbal suggestions on stress-related outcomes assessed by self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological data. 120 participants ( mean age = 22.1 years) were randomized to one of four intervention conditions: a brief relaxation intervention plus verbal suggestions condition, a brief relaxation intervention only condition, a verbal suggestions only condition, and a control condition. Afterwards, participants were subjected to a psychosocial stress challenge to assess reactivity to a stressful event. Immediately after both relaxation interventions (with and without verbal suggestions), lower self-reported state anxiety was found compared to the control condition, but no differences were observed in response to the stressor. The verbal suggestions only condition did not impact state anxiety. No significant effects were found for verbal suggestion interventions on cortisol, alpha amylase, heart rate and skin conductance. This is the first study investigating the role of verbal suggestions in the effectiveness of a brief relaxation intervention. Although this experimental proof-of-concept study provides support for the effectiveness of a brief relaxation intervention in lowering state anxiety directly after the intervention, the effects did not impact the response to a subsequent stressor and we did not observe any evidence for the add-on effectiveness of verbal suggestions. The effectiveness of brief relaxation interventions on stress responses should be investigated further in future research by incorporating interventions that are tailored to the specific stress challenge and various types of verbal suggestions.

88,The influence of personality traits and facets on visuo-spatial task performance and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations in young and older adults,"Aims: Personality traits are suggested to influence adults’ cognitive performance, but little is known about their association with visuo-spatial competence, in terms of those visuo-spatial abilities and inclinations crucial to remaining autonomous, especially with aging. This study newly investigated whether, and to what extent, major traits and narrower facets of personality influence young and older adults’ performance in the so-called objective visuo-spatial abilities (mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory [VSWM]), and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations (pleasure and anxiety in exploring places). Method: Seventy young adults (18–35 years old) and 70 older adults (65–75 years old) completed the Big-Five questionnaire, objective rotation and VSWM tasks, and spatial self-assessments on pleasure and anxiety in exploring places. Results: Hierarchical regression models confirmed that age negatively predicted the variance in objective visuo-spatial tasks, but not in self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations, while only the latter were slightly influenced by gender (in favor of men). Further, both objective visuo-spatial abilities (albeit modestly) and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations were predicted by higher Conscientiousness. The latter were also predicted by higher Emotional Stability. Finally, a better objective visuo-spatial performance was explained (again modestly) by lower Dynamism and Politeness, and higher Emotion Control, while higher Perseverance, Emotion Control and Cooperativeness explained a moderate part of the variance in the positive self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, beyond age and gender, some personality traits and facets predict self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations to a larger extent than objective visuo-spatial performance. These results are discussed within the spatial cognition and aging framework.

89,Depression and anxiety in parents of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities: A systematic review and metaanalysis,"Introduction: Although caring for a child with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) can have positive outcomes, parents may be at a greater risk of depression and anxiety, due to a number of associated stressors, such as increased caregiver demands and financial strain. This systematic review updates previous data, exploring the relationship between parenting a child with IDD and parental depression and anxiety. Methods: Five electronic databases were searched for eligible English-language articles, published between January 2004 and July 2018. All epidemiological study designs were eligible, provided the level of depression and/or anxiety was compared between parents of children (aged &lt; 18) with and without IDD. No limit was placed on geographic location. The proportion of positive associations between parenting a child with IDD and depression/anxiety were disaggregated by disability type, geographic region, and sample size. The percentage of parents at risk of moderate depression or anxiety were calculated using recognised clinical cut-off scores for each screening tool. Meta-analyses, in which pooled effect sizes of elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were calculated, were conducted across two IDD conditions, autism and cerebral palsy. Results: Of the 5,839 unique records screened, 19 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in high-income (n = 8, 42%) or upper-middle income countries (n = 10, 53%). Of the 19 studies, 69% focused on parents of children with cerebral palsy (n = 7, 37%) or autism (n = 6, 32%). Nearly all studies found a positive association between parenting a child with IDD and depression (n = 18, 95%) and anxiety (n = 9, 90%) symptoms. Factors associated with higher levels of depression symptoms amongst parents of children with IDD included disability severity (n = 8, 78%) and lower household income (n = 4, 80%). Approximately one third (31%) of parents of children with IDD reach the clinical cut-off score for moderate depression, compared with 7% of parents of children without IDD. 31% of parents of children with IDD reach the cut-off score for moderate anxiety, compared with 14% of parents of children without IDD. The meta-analyses demonstrated moderate effect sizes for elevated depression amongst parents of children with autism and cerebral palsy. Conclusions: Results indicate elevated levels of depressive symptoms amongst parents of children with IDD. Quality concerns amongst the existing literature support the need for further research, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

90,Patient preferences for a guided self-help programme to prevent relapse in anxiety or depression: A discrete choice experiment,"Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are increasingly being viewed as chronic conditions with fluctuating symptom levels. Relapse prevention programmes are needed to increase self-management and prevent relapse. Fine-tuning relapse prevention programmes to the needs of patients may increase uptake and effectiveness. Materials and methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted amongst patients with a partially or fully remitted anxiety or depressive disorder. Patients were presented 20 choice tasks with two hypothetical treatment scenarios for relapse prevention, plus a “no treatment” option. Each treatment scenario was based on seven attributes of a hypothetical but realistic relapse prevention programme. Attributes considered professional contact frequency, treatment type, delivery mode, programme flexibility, a personal relapse prevention plan, time investment and effectiveness. Choice models were estimated to analyse the data. Results: A total of 109 patients with a partially or fully remitted anxiety or depressive disorder completed the DCE. Attributes with the strongest impact on choice were high effectiveness, regular contact with a professional, low time investment and the inclusion of a personal prevention plan. A high heterogeneity in preferences was observed, related to both clinical and demographic characteristics: for example, a higher number of previous treatment episodes was related to a preference for a higher frequency of contact with a professional, while younger age was related to a stronger preference for high effectiveness. Conclusions: This study using a DCE provides insights into preferences for a relapse prevention programme for anxiety and depressive disorders that can be used to guide the development of such a programme.

91,Did you really need to ask? Cultural variation in emotional responses to providing solicited social support,"Most prior research on culture and the dynamics of social support has focused on the emotional outcomes for social support recipients. Though an existing body of research has identified cross-cultural differences in the emotional correlates of receiving different types of social support, researchers have seldom examined possible cultural differences in the experience of social support providers. This study used the Day Reconstruction Method to examine cultural differences in the emotional correlates of the provision of solicited and unsolicited and emotional and informational social support in the daily lives of Singaporean (n = 79) and American (n = 88) participants. Singaporean participants reported providing more social support overall. Regardless of culture, participants reported more positive emotion (affection, happiness) and less negative emotion (anger, anxiety) when they provided emotional social support. Also, multilevel modeling analyses revealed a 3-way interaction between culture, social support provision, and social support solicitation, indicating cultural differences in negative emotional responses to providing solicited social support. Specifically, results suggest that attempts to provide more solicited social support were associated with more negative emotions in the U.S. In contrast, provider negative emotions were highest in Singapore when the provider did not meet the recipient's request for support. Patterns of cultural differences in social support provision are dissimilar to-rather than simply mirroring-those found in published research on social support receipt, highlighting the importance of studying social support provision as a distinct phenomenon.

92,Psychometric properties and factor structure of an Ecuadorian version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in college students,"Background: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the gold standard in assessing harmful alcohol intake, which is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of an Ecuadorian adaptation of a Spanish translation of the AUDIT in a large sample of college students in Ecuador. Methods: A total of 7905 students, including 46.26% males, and 53.75% females, from 11 universities in Ecuador, were surveyed. The questionnaire was tested for two- and three-factor structures, reliability, and correlations with other health related measures. Results: The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test for sampling adequacy was satisfactory (.0885), and Bartlett's test for sphericity was significant (p &lt; .001). Although both models showed a good fit to the data, the two-factor model was preferred based on the high correlations between the factors 2 and 3 within the three-factor model (.86 for the total sample, .77 for females, and .91 for males). The reliability for the two-factor model was good, as indicated by Cronbach's α = .806 (factor I) and .716 (factor II) for the total sample, .808 (factor I) and .667 (factor II) for females, and .787 (factor I) and .728 (factor II) for males. Additionally, the AUDIT scores positively correlated with several health-related measures: stress, psychological inflexibility, loneliness and depression/anxiety symptomatology. Conclusion: The Ecuadorian adaptation of the Spanish version of the AUDIT has good reliability, and internal consistency and correlates with other health related measures, proving to be a reliable tool that can be used by researchers and clinicians to screen hazardous alcohol intake in college students.

93,Short-term sleep fragmentation enhances anxiety-related behavior: The role of hormonal alterations,"Introduction: The neuroendocrine background of acute sleep fragmentation in obstructive sleep apnea and sleep fragmentation involvement in psychiatric comorbidities, common in these patients, are still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of short-term experimental sleep fragmentation on anxiety -like behavior and hormonal status in rats. Methods: Male rats were adapted to treadmill (ON and OFF mode with belt speed set on 0.02m/s and 0.00m/s) and randomized to: 1) treadmill control (TC, only OFF mode); 2) motion, activity control (AC, 10min ON and 30min OFF mode) and 3) sleep fragmentation (SF, 30s ON and 90s OFF mode) group. Six hours later, the animals were tested in the open field, elevated plus maze and light/dark test (n = 8/group). Testosterone, estradiol, progesterone and corticosterone were determined in separate animal cohort immediately upon sleep fragmentation (n = 6/group). Results: SF rats showed decreased rearings number, decreased time spent in the central area and increased thigmotaxic index compared to TC and AC rats in the open field test. Similarly, increased anxiety upon sleep fragmentation was observed in the elevated plus maze and the light/dark test. Significantly lower testosterone, estradiol and progesterone levels were determined in SF in comparison to AC and TC groups, while there was no significant difference in the levels of corticosterone. Conclusion: Short term sleep fragmentation enhances anxiety-related behavior in rats, which could be partly mediated by the observed hormonal changes presented in the current study in form of testosterone, estradiol and progesterone depletion.

94,"Associations between depression, anxiety, stress, hopelessness, subjective well-being, coping styles and suicide in Chinese university students","Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide. This study aimed to predict the suicidal behavior of Chinese university students by studying psychological measures such as hopelessness, orientation to happiness, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, stress, and coping styles. In November 2016, a stratified-clustered-random sampling approach was utilized to select subjects from two large public medical-related universities in Shandong province, China. This sample consisted of 2,074 undergraduate students (706 males, 1,368 females; mean age = 19.79 ± 1.39 years). The students' major risk factors for suicide were depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness, and the students' minor risk factors included orientation to happiness and coping styles (including self-distraction, self-blame and substance use). Notably, the presence of meaning in life had a positive effect on preventing suicide and acted as a protective factor, which suggests that it is important to identify risk factors as well as protective factors relevant to the target population group in order to increase the effectiveness of counseling and suicide prevention programs.

95,"Working memory, negative affect and personal assets: How do they relate to mathematics and reading literacy?","Introduction: Research has recently focused on the relationships between working memory, negative affect (e.g., general anxiety, depressive symptoms) and personal assets (e.g., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency), and their influence on mathematics and reading literacy. Although these variables have been amply explored, previous research has usually considered each of these aspects in isolation. Method: In the present study, 143 schoolchildren in sixth to eighth grade were tested on general anxiety, depressive symptoms, working memory, self-concept (academic and competence scales), ego-resiliency, and mathematics and reading literacy. Results: Variance partitioning showed that all predictors, i.e., working memory, negative affect (i.e., general anxiety and depressive symptoms), and personal assets (i.e., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency) explained a unique and shared portion of the variance in mathematics and reading literacy. Conclusions: Our findings point to the importance of investigating the relationship between these factors. Underlying implications and directions for future research are discussed.

96,Evaluating the predictability of medical conditions from social media posts,"We studied whether medical conditions across 21 broad categories were predictable from social media content across approximately 20 million words written by 999 consenting patients. Facebook language significantly improved upon the prediction accuracy of demographic variables for 18 of the 21 disease categories; it was particularly effective at predicting diabetes and mental health conditions including anxiety, depression and psychoses. Social media data are a quantifiable link into the otherwise elusive daily lives of patients, providing an avenue for study and assessment of behavioral and environmental disease risk factors. Analogous to the genome, social media data linked to medical diagnoses can be banked with patients’ consent, and an encoding of social media language can be used as markers of disease risk, serve as a screening tool, and elucidate disease epidemiology. In what we believe to be the first report linking electronic medical record data with social media data from consenting patients, we identified that patients’ Facebook status updates can predict many health conditions, suggesting opportunities to use social media data to determine disease onset or exacerbation and to conduct social media-based health interventions.

97,Scalp hair cortisol and testosterone levels in patients with sarcoidosis,"Background: Patients with sarcoidosis often experience fatigue and psychological distress, but little is known about the etiology of these conditions. While serum and saliva steroid hormones are used to monitor acute steroid levels, scalp hair analysis is a relatively new method enabling measurement of long-term steroid levels, including hair cortisol reflecting chronic stress. We investigated whether scalp hair cortisol and testosterone levels differ between sarcoidosis patients both with and without fatigue and general population controls. Additionally, we studied if these hormones could serve as objective biomarkers for psychological distress in patients with sarcoidosis. Methods: We measured hair steroid levels using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry in glucocorticoid naïve sarcoidosis patients. Patients completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Fatigue Assessment Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Short Form 36 (SF- 36). Hair steroid levels from 293 participants of the population-based Lifelines cohort study served as controls. Results: Thirty-two patients (14 males) were included. Hair cortisol, but not testosterone, concentrations were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in general population controls (mean 6.6 versus 2.7 pg/mg, p &lt; 0.001). No differences were found in hair cortisol and testosterone levels between fatigued and non-fatigued patients with sarcoidosis. Hair cortisol of sarcoidosis patients correlated significantly with anxiety (r = 0.47, p = 0.01), depression (r = 0.46, p = 0.01), and SF-36 mental domain (r = -0.38, p = 0.03), but not with fatigue. Conclusions: Patients with sarcoidosis have chronically higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than the normal population, while testosterone levels in hair did not differ. Hair cortisol levels were positively related to subjective measures of psychological distress, but not to fatigue. Our study shows that hair cortisol is a promising non-invasive biomarker for psychological distress in patients with sarcoidosis.

98,Examining the relation of personality factors to substance use disorder by explanatory item response modeling of DSM-5 symptoms,"This paper explores how personality factors affect substance use disorders (SUDs) using explanatory item response modeling (EIRM). A total of 606 Chinese illicit drug users participated in our study. After removing the cases with missing values on the covariate measures, a final sample of 573 participants was used for data analysis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was used to measure the illicit drug users’ SUD level. Four personality factors–anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, sensation seeking and hopelessness–along with gender and alcohol use were included in EIRM as person covariates. The results indicated that gender, alcohol use, and their interaction significantly predicted the SUD level. The only personality factor that strongly predicted the SUD level was sensation seeking. In addition, the interaction between gender and hopelessness was also found to be a significant predictor of the SUD level, indicating that the negative effect of hopelessness on SUD is stronger for women than for men. The findings suggest that sensation seeking plays an important role in influencing SUDs, and thus, it should be considered when designing intervention or screening procedures for potential illicit drug users. In addition, several DSM-5 SUD symptoms were found to exhibit differential effects by gender, alcohol use, and personality factors. The possible explanations were discussed.

99,"Influence of genetic factors on long-term treatment related neurocognitive complications, and on anxiety and depression in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: The Petale study","Background: A substantial number of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia suffer from treatment-related late adverse effects including neurocognitive impairment. While multiple studies have described neurocognitive outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors, relatively few have investigated their association with individual genetic constitution. Methods: To further address this issue, genetic variants located in 99 genes relevant to the effects of anticancer drugs and in 360 genes implicated in nervous system function and predicted to affect protein function, were pooled from whole exome sequencing data of childhood ALL survivors (PETALE cohort) and analyzed for an association with neurocognitive complications, as well as with anxiety and depression. Variants that sustained correction for multiple testing were genotyped in entire cohort (n = 236) and analyzed with same outcomes. Results: Common variants in MTR, PPARA, ABCC3, CALML5, CACNB2 and PCDHB10 genes were associated with deficits in neurocognitive tests performance, whereas a variant in SLCO1B1 and EPHA5 genes was associated with anxiety and depression. Majority of associations were modulated by intensity of treatment. Associated variants were further analyzed in an independent SJLIFE cohort of 545 ALL survivors. Two variants, rs1805087 in methionine synthase, MTR and rs58225473 in voltage-dependent calcium channel protein encoding gene, CACNB2 are of particular interest, since associations of borderline significance were found in replication cohort and remain significant in combined discovery and replication groups (OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1–2.3; p = 0.04 and; OR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.25–11; p = 0.01, respectively). Variant rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 gene also deserves further attention since previously shown to affect methotrexate clearance and short-term toxicity in ALL patients. Conclusions: Current findings can help understanding of the influence of genetic component on long-term neurocognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm whether identified variants may be useful in identifying survivors at increased risk of these complications.

100,Association of health literacy and sleep problems with mental health of Chinese students in combined junior and senior high school,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the association between health literacy (HL) and sleep problems with mental health of Chinese students in combined junior and senior high school. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among seven hundred and seventy-five students from a combined junior and senior high school in Shenyang on December 16, 2016. HL, sleep problems, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were measured by self-reported validated instruments. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of HL and sleep problems with mental health problems. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 24.6% and 45.2%, respectively. Low HL was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms ( OR = 2.457, 95%CI: 1.493–4.045) and depressive symptoms ( OR = 5.164, 95%CI: 3.233–8.250). Sleep problems were significantly positively correlated with anxiety symptoms ( OR = 4.237, 95%CI: 2.831–6.341) and depressive symptoms ( OR = 3.170, 95%CI: 2.084–4.823). The students who had sleep problems with low HL had the highest risks of anxiety symptoms ( OR = 11.440, 95%CI: 5.564–23.520) and depressive symptoms ( OR = 19.470, 95%CI: 8.143–46.558). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Chinese students in combined junior and senior high school who had sleep problems with low HL are at risk of exhibiting anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Intervention programs of mental health problems should enhance HL level and improve sleep quality.

101,Anxiety-like features and spatial memory problems as a consequence of hippocampal SV2A expression,"The Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2A (SV2A) is a transmembrane protein whose presence is reduced both in animal models and in patients with chronic epilepsy. Besides its implication in the epileptic process, the behavioural consequences of the changes in its expression remain unclear. The purpose of our research is to better understand the possible role(s) of this protein through the phenotype of cKO ( Grik4 Cre +/-, SV2A lox/lox ) mice, male and female, which present a specific decrease of SV2A expression levels in the hippocampal glutamatergic neurons but without any epileptic seizures. In this study, we compare the cKO mice with cHZ ( Grik4 Cre +/-, SV2A lox/ + ) and WT ( Grik4 Cre +/+, SV2A lox/lox ) mice through a battery of tests, used to evaluate different features: the anxiety-related features (Elevated Plus Maze), the locomotor activity (Activity Chambers), the contextual fear-related memory (Contextual Fear Conditioning), and the spatial memory (Barnes Maze). Our results showed statistically significant differences in the habituation to a new environment, an increase in the anxiety levels and spatial memory deficit in the cHZ and cKO groups, compared to the WT group. No statistically significant differences due to the genotype appeared in the spontaneous locomotor activity or the fear-linked memory. However, sexual differences were observed in this last feature. These results highlight not only an important role of the SV2A protein in the cognitive and anxiety problems typically encountered in epileptic patients, but also a possible role in the symptomatology of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as the Alzheimer’s disease.

102,Lingering health-related anxiety about radiation among Fukushima residents as correlated with media information following the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant,"Following the March 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, many residents of Fukushima have faced anxieties about the health impacts of radiation exposure. Considering that source of information may influence resident anxiety, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between the two. In addition, a health literacy query was included to examine a possible relationship between anxiety and health literacy skills. A mail survey was conducted in August 2016 among 2000 residents of Fukushima Prefecture aged 20 to 79 years. Survey items included questions about current health anxieties caused by radiation, trusted sources of information about radiation, and media used to obtain information on radiation. The survey valid response rate was 43.4%. Results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that anxiety was significantly higher for the groups indicating “trust in citizen groups” and “use of internet sites.” Anxiety was significantly lower for the groups indicating “trust in government ministries,” “trust in local government,” and “use of local broadcast television.” Also anxiety was significantly lower for groups with higher health literacy. It was found that the significant relationship to anxiety varies depending on the sources of trust and media used. There is a possibility that this was caused by the difference between the contents of each information and media reports. In preparation for any future nuclear accident, government may consider action to improve the media literacy of residents. In addition, improving health literacy of both the recipient and the sender of information can improve access to information and thereby safeguard the health and well-being of the public.

103,Public speaking anxiety decreases within repeated virtual reality training sessions,"Therapy for public speaking phobia using virtual reality exposure (VRE) has focused on distress arousal rather than distress habituation. Understanding habituation will help optimize session duration, making treatment more affordable and accessible. This pilot study utilized within-speech repeated measures to examine distress habituation during three brief public speaking scenarios in a non-clinical sample ( n = 19; 18–76 years). VRE elicited significant distress in all three scenarios. Although within-scenario distress habituation was not observed, between-scenario habituation was partially supported. An increase in distress during the second scenario indicated that three consecutive speech performances were critical in achieving habituation. Brief repeated VRE scenarios using an agent audience were effective in eliciting public speaking distress, as well as habituation.

104,Interoceptive deficits in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy,"Interoception is impaired in different psychiatric disorders and is also associated with emotions. Only one study could show a higher interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Based on the predictive coding system we assume contrary results, indicating a decreased IAcc in patients with OCD. So far, there is no study investigating the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on IAcc in patients with OCD. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with OCD improve their IAcc during the time course of therapy compared to healthy controls. Twenty-six patients with OCD from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were examined in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 26 matched healthy controls. IAcc via the heartbeat perception task as well as questionnaire data (OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms) were assessed. Results showed that IAcc, OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms were attenuated in patients with OCD. Patients recovered in the time course of therapy regarding OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms. Interoceptive deficits did not change in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. We demonstrated that IAcc is affected in patients with OCD and this deficit does not change during the time course of a standardized therapy. Future studies should investigate, whether an inaccuracy in perceiving one’s bodily signals constitutes a risk factor for relapse. Further, it could be examined if IAcc can be increased via self- and body focus interventions in patients with OCD.

105,Chronotype mediates gender differences in risk propensity and risk-taking,"Risk-taking is a complex form of decision-making that involves calculated assessments of potential costs and rewards that may be immediate or delayed. Thus, making predictions about inter-individual variation in risk-taking due to personality traits, decision styles or other attributes can be difficult. The association of risk-taking with gender is well-supported; males report higher propensity for risk-taking and show higher risk-taking on tasks measuring actual risk-taking behavior. Risk-taking also appears to be associated with circadian phenotypes (chronotypes), with evening-types reporting higher levels of risk-taking—but this association may be confounded by the fact that, in certain age groups, males are more likely to be evening-types. Here, we test for gender by chronotype effects on risk-taking in young adults (n = 610) using a self-reported risk propensity questionnaire, the health domain of the DOSPERT, and a behavioral task measuring risk-taking, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART). Our results show that males report and take significantly more risks than females in this population. In addition, evening-type individuals have significantly higher self-reported risk propensity and tend to take more risks on the BART. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in risk propensity or risk-taking behavior across male circadian phenotypes, but evening-type females significantly report and take more risk than female intermediate and morning types. In regression analyses, we found both gender and chronotype predict risk propensity and risk-taking. Path analysis confirms that chronotype has an indirect effect on gender differences in both risk propensity and risk-taking. Furthermore, we found that trait anxiety (STAI) and sleep disturbance (PROMIS), significantly correlate with chronotype and gender in the complete dataset, but do not independently predict differences in female risk-taking. These results suggest that chronotype mediates gender effects on risk-taking and that these effects are driven primarily by morning-type females, but are not related to gender-specific differences in trait anxiety or sleep quality.

106,See your mental state from your walk: Recognizing anxiety and depression through Kinect-recorded gait data,"As the challenge of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression increasing today, more convenient, objective, real-time assessing techniques of mental state are in need. The Microsoft Kinect camera is a possible option for contact lessly capturing human gait, which could reflect the walkers' mental state. So we tried to propose a novel method for monitoring individual's anxiety and depression based on the Kinect-recorded gait pattern. In this study, after finishing the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 179 participants were required to walked on the footpath naturally while shot by the Kinect cameras. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) were conducted to extract features from the Kinect-captured gait data after preprocessing, and different machine learning algorithms were used to train the regression models recognizing anxiety and depression levels, and the classification models detecting the cases with specific depressive symptoms. The predictive accuracies of the regression models achieved medium to large level: The correlation coefficient between predicted and questionnaire scores reached 0.51 on anxiety (by epsilon-Support Vector Regression, e-SVR) and 0.51 on depression (by Gaussian Processes, GP). The predictive accuracies could be even higher, 0.74 on anxiety (by GP) and 0.64 on depression (by GP), while training and testing the models on the female sample. The classification models also showed effectiveness on detecting the cases with some symptoms. These results demonstrate the possibility to recognize individual's questionnaire measured anxiety/depression levels and some depressive symptoms based on Kinect-recorded gait data through machine learning method. This approach shows the potential to develop non-intrusive, low-cost methods for monitoring individuals' mental health in real time.

107,What can we learn from the hair of the dog? Complex effects of endogenous and exogenous stressors on canine hair cortisol,"Hair is an emerging biological matrix in which to measure chronic HPA axis activity, offering a longer term view into an animal's life. We explored effects of exogenous (e.g. lifestyle, medications, social environment) and endogenous (e.g. disease, behaviour) stressors on haircortisol concentration (HCC) in a population of Border Collies (BCs). Owners of BCs were recruited and reported their dog's lifestyle, clinical history, anxiety-related behaviour, and collected a white hair sample from their dog's dorsal neck region. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit. Samples from 135 BCs were analysed, with 91 healthy controls and 44 diagnosed with epilepsy as a model disease. Factors associated with higher HCC included psychosocial stressors (living with three or more other dogs) and lifestyle (engaging in competitive flyball); while factors associated with lower HCC included anxiety (stranger-directed and non-social), health (epilepsy diagnosis, with number of seizures to date negatively correlated with HCC) and medication (certain anti-epileptic drugs were associated with elevated or reduced HCC). These novel results highlight the potential of chronic stress with frequent or persisting HPA-axis hyperactivity leading to a state of hypocortisolism, and the need to consider stressor recency and recurrence when interpreting HCC data.

108,Pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section in primiparas: A cohort study in China,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section, and identify the critical period in which pregnancy-specific anxiety will affect the elective cesarean section. Primiparous women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate in the cohort. General information on maternal socio-demographic characteristics and environmental exposure were collected using questionnaires. Pregnancy-specific anxiety was assessed by using pregnancy-specific anxiety questionnaire in the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd trimester, respectively. Delivery modes and pregnancy complications were abstracted from medical notes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to examine the relationship between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section. Results indicated the overall elective cesarean section rate in this study was 45%. Among 1 874 pregnant women, 30.9% women experienced anxiety at least once during pregnancy, and 6.9% women suffered from anxiety in all three trimesters. Anxiety in the 2 nd trimester was a significant predictor for elective cesarean section. Young maternal age and low educational level had indirect effects on women’s choice of elective caesarean section through affecting pregnancy-specific anxiety. More attention should be paid to maternal psychological problems, and professional counseling needs to be strengthened to protect women from pregnancy-specific anxiety.

109,The Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adults (Adult STRAIN) in German: An overview and initial validation,"Life stress is a key determinant of poor mental and physical health, but until recently no instrument existed for efficiently assessing cumulative stress exposure and severity across the entire lifespan. The Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) is an online, interview-based stress assessment system that was developed to address this need. We examined the concurrent, predictive, and discriminant validity of a German translation of the STRAIN by administering the instrument, along with several other measures of stress and health, to 298 adults (81 men, 217 women, M age = 30.3 years). The German STRAIN demonstrated excellent concurrent validity, as evidenced by associations with other instruments assessing early adversity (| r s| ≥ .62, p s ≤ .001). It also correlated with instruments assessing recent life event exposure in adulthood (| r s| ≥ .48, p s ≤ .001), as well as recent perceived stress (| r s| ≥ .25, p s ≤ .001) and recent chronic stress levels (| r s| ≥ .19, p s ≤ .001). Additionally, the German STRAIN showed strong predictive validity in relation to anxiety symptoms (| r s| ≥ .22, p s ≤ .001) and depressive symptoms (| r s| ≥ .33, p s ≤ .001). Finally, the German STRAIN showed good discriminant validity, with lifetime stressor count being unrelated to personality features like neuroticism. These results demonstrate that the German version of the STRAIN is a valid tool for assessing lifetime stress exposure and severity. Additional research is needed to examine how the German STRAIN predicts psychological and biological stress reactivity and physical health outcomes.

110,Differentiating weight-restored anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder using neuroimaging and psychometric markers,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are potentially life-threatening conditions whose partially overlapping phenomenology-distorted perception of appearance, obsessions/compulsions, and limited insight-can make diagnostic distinction difficult in some cases. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as the effective treatments for AN and BDD differ. To improve diagnostic accuracy and clarify the contributions of each of the multiple underlying factors, we developed a two-stage machine learning model that uses multimodal, neurobiology-based, and symptom-based quantitative data as features: task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data using body visual stimuli, graph theory metrics of white matter connectivity from diffus or tensor imaging, and anxiety, depression, and insight psychometric scores. In a sample of unmedicated adults with BDD (n = 29), unmedicated adults with weight-restored AN (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 31), the resulting model labeled individuals with an accuracy of 76%, significantly better than the chance accuracy of 35% ( p = 10 −4 ). In the multivariate model, reduced white matter global efficiency and better insight were associated more with AN than with BDD. These results improve our understanding of the relative contributions of the neurobiological characteristics and symptoms of these disorders. Moreover, this approach has the potential to aid clinicians in diagnosis, thereby leading to more tailored therapy.

Vollbehr, Agna A. Bartels-Velthuis, Maaike H. Nauta, Stynke Castelein, Laura A. Steenhuis, H. J. Rogier Hoenders and Brian D. Ostafin ( PLoS ONE , 2018[Oct][1], Vol 13[10][e0204925]). In the original article, Fig 5 was incorrectly printed as a duplicate of Fig 4. A link to the corrected Fig 5 is presented in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-49530-001). Background: The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effectiveness of hatha yoga in treating acute, chronic and/or treatment-resistant mood and anxiety disorders. Methods: Medline, Cochrane Library, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.gov, NHR Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched through June 2018. Randomized controlled trials with patients with mood and anxiety disorders were included. Main outcomes were continuous measures of severity of mood and anxiety symptoms. Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of effect size. Meta-analyses using a random effects model was applied to estimate direct comparisons between yoga and control conditions for depression and anxiety outcomes. Publication bias was visually inspected using funnel plots. Results: Eighteen studies were found, fourteen in acute patients and four in chronic patients. Most studies were of low quality. For depression outcomes, hatha yoga did not show a significant effect when compared to treatment as usual, an overall effect size of Cohen's d -0.64 (95% CI = -1.41, 0.13) or to all active control groups, Cohen's d -0.13 (95% CI = -0.49, 0.22). A sub-analysis showed that yoga had a significant effect on the reduction of depression compared to psychoeducation control groups, Cohen's d -0.52 (95% CI = -0.96, -0.08) but not to other active control groups, Cohen's d 0.28 (95% CI = -0.07, 0.63) For studies using a follow- up of six months or more, hatha yoga had no effect on the reduction of depression compared to active control groups, Cohen's d -0.14 (95% CI = -0.60, 0.33). Regarding anxiety, hatha yoga had no significant effect when compared to active control groups, Cohen's d -0.09 (95% CI = -0.47, 0.30). The I² and Q-statistic revealed heterogeneity amongst comparisons. Qualitative analyses suggest some promise of hatha yoga for chronic populations. Conclusions: The ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by the notable heterogeneity and low quality of most of the included studies. With this caveat in mind, the results of the current meta-analysis suggest that hatha yoga does not have effects on acute, chronic and/or treatment-resistant mood and anxiety disorders compared to treatment as usual or active control groups. However, when compared to psychoeducation, hatha yoga showed more reductions in depression. It is clear that more high-quality studies are needed to advance the field.

112,Women’s experiences of monitoring the small-for-gestational age fetus by ultrasound: A qualitative study,"Objective: To explore experiences among pregnant women diagnosed with a small-for-gestational age (SGA) fetus, and monitored by frequent ultrasounds. Methods: We performed a qualitative study at the outpatient clinic of the Gynecology and Obstetrics department of a large academic hospital in Amsterdam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen women, diagnosed with an SGA fetus during their pregnancy and having had at least two monitoring ultrasounds since. Themes were identified following analysis of the interview transcripts. Results: Most women experienced the frequent ultrasounds as a source of support providing comfort and a feeling of safety. It was considered necessary, in the best interest of the baby, which outweighed the discomfort caused by having to come to the hospital frequently. Women described anxiety building up prior to each ultrasound, but feeling reassured and relieved afterwards. During the ultrasound a continuous explanation was preferred, which provided confirmation and a feeling of security. Women identified the uncertainty of SGA’s cause and prognosis as one of the biggest challenges to cope with, for which they used different strategies. Many women expressed a need for more detailed information and counselling, including non-medical aspects of pregnancy and delivery as well. Lastly, many women reported that seeing different doctors negatively influenced the perceived quality of care. Conclusions: In general, women in this study were satisfied with the ultrasounds for their small-for-gestational age pregnancies. However, women expressed a need for additional information to help cope with a feeling of uncertainty regarding cause and prognosis. Their medical team should preferably provide this in a consistent and continuous manner.

113,The complexity of the interaction between binge-eating and attention,"Objective: To investigate whether binge-eating in patients with eating disorders (EDs) is associated with attentional deficits. Methods: We studied ED patients with binge-eating (n = 51), no binge-eating (n = 59) and controls (n = 58). ED patients were assessed following the stabilization of weight and ED pathology. Attention assessment included evaluation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, the Adult ADHD Self-Report (ASRS) and ADHD Rating Scale-IV-Home Version (ADHD-RS) questionnaires, and attention functioning assessed with neuropsychological tools. The severity of eating-related pathology, depression, anxiety and obsessionality was also monitored. Results: Patients with binge-eating showed more ADHD symptomatology on the ADHD-RS compared with non-binge-eating patients. No differences were found between binge-eating and non-binge-eating patients in ADHD diagnosis and neuropsychological functioning. Among the specific ED subtypes, patients with anorexia nervosa binge/purge type (AN-B/P) showed the highest rates of ADHD symptomatology on the ADHD-RS, and were characterized with sustained attention deficits. Conclusion: Binge-eating is not associated with attention deficits as measured by objective neuropsychological tools. Nonetheless, it is associated with attentional difficulties as measured with the self-reported ADHD-RS. AN-B/P patients are the only ED category showing objective sustained attention deficits.

114,Do alcohol control policies work? An umbrella review and quality assessment of systematic reviews of alcohol control interventions (2006 – 2017),"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of intrusive re-experiencing of trauma, avoidance and hyper-arousal. Diagnosis and treatment of PTSD is further complicated by concurrently occurring disorders, the most frequent being major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Previous research highlights that attentional processing in posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with substantial interference by emotional stimuli, a phenomenon also observed in these concurrently occurring psychiatric disorders. However, the diagnosis-relevance of this interference remains elusive. Here, we investigated the emotional Stroop interference for diagnosis-related stimuli, generally negative stimuli, and generally positive stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Methods: We performed a systematic database search in PubMed (Medline), Cochrane Library and PsycINFO on emotional Stroop performance in individuals with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders separately. Mean effect sizes, standard errors and confidence intervals were estimated for each clinical group and healthy control group comparison using random effect models. Results: As compared to healthy control group, the posttraumatic stress disorder group displayed greater interference by diagnosis-related stimuli and positive stimuli but not for generally negative stimuli. The major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders groups showed greater interference by diagnosis-related and negative stimuli, but not by positive stimuli. The age and sex had no significant impact on interference. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of diagnosis-relevant information on attentional processing in all three clinical populations, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Further, the impact of generally negative stimuli but not generally positive stimuli in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders indicate impaired attentional bias for mood-congruent stimuli but not for general stimuli. Finally, it remains to be studied whether the influence of generally positive stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder indicate that positive stimuli are perceived as PTSD related.

116,Long-term Chinese calligraphic handwriting reshapes the posterior cingulate cortex: A VBM study,"As a special kind of handwriting with a brush, Chinese calligraphic handwriting (CCH) requires a large amount of practice with high levels of concentration and emotion regulation. Previous studies have showed that long-term CCH training has positive effects physically (induced by handwriting activities) and psychologically (induced by the state of relaxation and concentration), the latter of which is similar to the effects of meditation. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term CCH training effect on anxiety and attention, as well as brain structure. Participants were 32 individuals who had at least five years of CCH experience and 44 controls. Results showed that CCH training benefited individuals’ selective and divided attention but did not decrease their anxiety level. Moreover, the VBM analysis showed that long-term CCH training was mainly associated with smaller grey matter volumes (GMV) in the right precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). No brain areas showed larger GMV in the CCH group than the control group. Using two sets of regions of interest (ROIs), one related to meditation and the other to handwriting, ROI analysis showed significant differences between the CCH and the control group only at the meditation-related ROIs, not at the handwriting-related ROIs. Finally, for the whole sample, the GMV of both the whole brain and the PCC were negatively correlated with selective attention and divided attention. The present study was cross-sectional and had a relatively small sample size, but its results suggested that CCH training might benefit attention and influence particular brain structure through mental processes such as meditation.

117,"The emergence of Exercise Addiction, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and other image-related psychopathological correlates in fitness settings: A cross sectional study","Introduction: In a society that perpetuates the strive for a perfect appearance, a fit body has become synonymous with success, but simultaneously hard to achieve. This represents a fertile ground for the development of Exercise Addiction (EA) alongside other disorders, such as Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). This study aims to explore the diffusion of EA in fitness settings in the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Hungary and the previously unexplored association with appearance anxiety, BDD, self-esteem and the use of fitness supplements. Methods: A large cross-sectional sample (N = 1711) was surveyed in fitness settings using the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI) and Rosenberg’s Self Esteem Scale (RSE) in addition to questions surrounding the use of fitness supplements. Results: Compulsive exercise, appearance anxiety and low self-esteem were present in this sample according to the psychometric measures used (EAI, AAI, RSE). 11.7% scored over the cut off for EA, with alarming peaks in the Netherlands (20.9%) and the United Kingdom (16.1%). 38.5% were found at risk of BDD, mainly female (47.2%). 39.8% used fitness enhancing supplements without medical consultation (95.5%). This cohort of supplement users scored higher in both EAI and AAI. The logistic regression model revealed a strong association between the consumption of sport products and the level of EA across the sample with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.03. Other co-variable factors among female were appearance anxiety (AAI; OR 1.59) and to a lesser extent self-esteem (RSE) (OR 1.08). Conclusions: This study identified a high risk of EA, appearance anxiety and BDD amongst a cohort of gym users internationally. The previously-unexplored association between these disorders and the unsupervised use of a variety of fitness products, including illicit drugs, highlights the need for informed and integrated responses targeting such vulnerable individuals.

118,"Predicting the consequences of physical activity: An investigation into the relationship between anxiety sensitivity, interoceptive accuracy and action","The ability to predict the consequences of our actions is imperative for the everyday success of our interactions. From negotiating an uneven surface, to mounting an immune response, we continually infer the limits of our body. The current investigation considered the impact that the inferred consequences of action has on the placement of limits. We hypothesised that the performance of individuals in a novel, sprint task would reflect both their ability to accurately detect changes in bodily arousal (Interoceptive Accuracy) and the inferred consequences associated with heightened arousal signals (Anxiety Sensitivity). We found that individuals who demonstrated accuracy associated with physiological arousal changes, and who showed a heightened fear of the consequences of arousal symptoms, modified their actions by decreasing their power output (mean Watts•kg -1 ) in a sprint task (Δ R² = 0.19; F (1,34) = 19.87); p &lt; 0.001). These findings provide a basis for understanding the varying actions taken as we encounter bodily perturbation.

119,The three-spined stickleback as a model for behavioural neuroscience,"The three-spined stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) is a small teleost fish that is ubiquitous across the Northern Hemisphere. Among the behaviours that have been characterised in this species is ritualized courtship, aggressiveness and parental behaviour. Whereas three-spined sticklebacks have been used for ecological, evolutionary, parasitological and toxicological research, its complex behavioural repertoire and experimental advantages have not been exploited for basic neuroscience research. The aim of the present study is to describe some innate behaviours of laboratory bred three-spined sticklebacks by using a battery of tests that have been developed and validated to model some aspects of human psychiatric disorders in zebrafish. We recorded mirror induced aggression, novel object boldness, shoaling, and anxiety-like behaviour using both the novel tank diving and the black-white preference tests. We show that behaviour of three-spined sticklebacks in these standard tests is remarkably similar to that of zebrafish and other species and can be altered by fluoxetine and buspirone. These findings highlight the potential of using three-spined sticklebacks for cross-species and translational studies.

120,Use of time in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Longitudinal associations with symptoms and quality of life using a compositional analysis approach,"Background and objectives: This study explored whether, for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), changes to the 24-hour composition of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB) and sleep were associated with changes in symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and how time re-allocations between these behaviours were associated with changes in outcomes. Methods: This study pools data on people with COPD drawn from two previous studies: a randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation and a usual care cohort. Participants recalled behaviours and completed symptom and HRQoL assessments at baseline (T0) and four months (T1). Linear mixed-effects models (pooled control/ intervention samples) predicted changes in outcomes from T0 to T1 with a change to the 24-hour behaviour composition; compositional isotemporal substitution predicted change in outcomes when re-allocating time between behaviours. Results: Valid data were obtained for 95 participants (forced expiratory volume in one second %predicted = 49.6 ± 15.3) at T0 and T1. A change in the 24-hour behaviour composition was associated with a change in anxiety ( p &lt; 0.01) and mastery ( p &lt; 0.01), but not breathlessness, depression or fatigue. When modelling time re-allocation with compositional isotemporal substitution, more time re-allocated to higher intensity PA or sleep was associated with favourable changes in outcomes; re-allocating time to SB or light PA was associated with unfavourable changes in outcomes. The direction of association, however, could not be determined.

121,Rumination in bereaved parents: Psychometric evaluation of the Swedish version of the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS),"Background: Bereaved parents may be at higher risk to develop persistent, severe and disabling grief, termed prolonged grief. Grief rumination, repetitive thinking about the causes and consequences of the loss, is a malleable cognitive process that maintains prolonged grief. Grief rumination can be measured with the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS). The present study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the new Swedish version of the UGRS in a sample of bereaved parents. Methods: A Swedish nationwide postal survey including measures of demographic and loss-related variables, grief rumination (UGRS), and symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, was completed by 226 parents (133 mothers and 93 fathers) who lost a child to cancer in the past five years. Psychometric properties of the UGRS were examined through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), reliability analyses, and assessment of UGRS score associations with symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Results: The internal consistency of the Swedish UGRS was good. The CFA yielded an acceptable fit for a two-factor hierarchical model with five sub-factors. Grief rumination was positively associated with all psychopathology symptom measures. Higher scores on UGRS were found in parents with possible prolonged grief disorder compared to those without ( d = 1.47). Moreover, the Swedish UGRS was associated with prolonged grief symptoms over and above loss-related and demographic variables and other psychopathology symptoms. Conclusions: The Swedish UGRS demonstrated good psychometric properties, which supports its use as a measure to assess grief rumination in Swedish bereaved parents in research and practice.

122,Testing anxiety in undergraduate medical students and its correlation with different learning approaches,"Objectives: Undergraduate medical students experience a considerable amount of stress and anxiety due to frequent exams. The goal of the present study was to examine the development of exam related anxiety and to test for a correlation between anxiety and learning approaches. Methods: A whole class of 212 medical students was invited to participate in the study. During their first term, trait anxiety and learning approaches were assessed by use of the state-trait-anxiety inventory (STAI-T) and the approaches-and-study-skills-inventory-for-students (ASSIST), respectively. Acute state anxiety was assessed twice in the course of the second term. To that extent, the STAI-S in combination with measuring salivary cortisol were employed immediately before two oral anatomy exams. Results: Our most important results were that a surface learning approach correlated significantly with anxiety as a trait and that students with a predominantly strategic approach to learning were the least anxious yet academically most successful. Conclusion: As surface learners are at risk of being academically less successful and because anxiety is a prerequisite for burn-out, we suggest that medical faculties place particular emphasis on conveying strategies for both, coping with stress and successful learning.

Quality of life (Short Form-12), depressive symptoms (Beck-Depression Inventory II) and anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) were assessed at enrollment and 6-weeks, and associations with WCD prescription were analyzed. Results: 123 patients (mean [SD] age 59 [± 14] years, 75% male) were included, 85 (69%) of whom received a WCD. At enrollment 21% showed clinically significant depressive symptoms and 52% anxiety symptoms, respectively. At 6 weeks, depressive and anxious symptoms significantly decreased to 7% and 25%, respectively. Depressive symptoms at enrollment and changes at 6 weeks showed significant associations with health-related quality of life, whereas anxious symptoms did not. There was a trend for better improvement of depression scores in patients with WCD (mean [SD] change in score points: -4.1 [6.1] vs -1.8 [3.9]; p = 0.09), whereas change of the anxiousness score was not different (-4.6 [9.5]) vs -3.7 [9.1], p = 0.68). Conclusion: In patients eligible for a WCD, depressive and anxiety symptoms were initially common and depressive symptoms showed a strong association with reduced health-related quality of life contributing to their clinical relevance. WCD recipients showed at least similar improvement of depression and anxiety at 6 weeks when compared to non recipients.

124,"Functional criticality in the human brain: Physiological, behavioral and neurodevelopmental correlates","Understanding the critical features of the human brain at multiple time scales is vital for both normal development and disease research. A recently proposed method, the vertex-wise Index of Functional Criticality (vIFC) based on fMRI, has been testified as a sensitive neuroimaging marker to characterize critical transitions of human brain dynamics during Alzheimer’s disease progression. However, it remains unclear whether vIFC in healthy brains is associated with neuropsychological and neurophysiological measurements. Using the Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland lifespan cross-sectional datasets and openfMRI single participant longitudinal datasets, we found consistent spatial patterns of vIFC across the entire cortical mantle: the inferior parietal and the precuneus exhibited high vIFC. On a time scale of years, we observed that vIFC increased with age in the left ventral posterior cingulate gyrus. On a time scale of days and weeks, vIFC demonstrated the capacity to identify a link between anxiety and pulse. These results showed that vIFC can serve as a useful neuroimaging marker for detecting physiological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental transitions. Based on the criticality theory in nonlinear dynamics, the current vIFC study sheds new light on human brain studies from a nonlinear perspective and opens potential new avenues for normal and abnormal human brain studies.

125,Multi-state models of transitions in depression and anxiety symptom severity and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease,"Objective: Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) commonly suffer from depression and anxiety, yet transitions of symptom severity and cardiovascular events (CVE) over time are not well characterized. Methods: We included 997 patients with stable CHD from a prospective cohort study. We estimated 5- and 10-year transition probabilities of depression and anxiety symptom severity levels and fatal- and non-fatal adverse CVE. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 5 times over 13 years and categorized as no, mild, or moderate/severe symptoms. Using multi-state modeling, we calculated 5- and 10- year transition probabilities for depression and anxiety symptom severity and CVE and calculated transition intensity ratios for factors associated with symptom severity progression and regression. Results: At 5 years, only approximately half of participants with moderate or severe symptom severity at baseline transitioned to no symptom severity. Patients with low physical activity (&lt;1x/week or never) had a higher probability of worse symptom severity after 5 and 10 years and a higher probability of a CVE after 5 and 10 years regardless of their depression status at baseline compared to higher physical activity groups. Higher body mass index, &lt; 10 years of education, and lower physical activity were associated with depression symptom progression; female and lower physical activity were associated with anxiety symptom progression. Conclusions: Patients with CHD had a consistent burden of depression and anxiety symptoms. Secondary prevention strategies should target depression and anxiety and include a physical activity component.

126,A comparison study of anxiety in children undergoing brain MRI vs adults undergoing brain MRI vs children undergoing an electroencephalogram,"Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in children and adolescents is a well-established method in both clinical practice and in neuroscientific research. This practice is sometimes viewed critically, as MRI scans might expose minors (e.g. through scan-associated fears) to more than the legally permissible “minimal burden”. While there is evidence that a significant portion of adults undergoing brain MRI scans experience anxiety, data on anxiety in children and adolescents undergoing brain MRI scans is rare. This study therefore aimed to examine the prevalence and level of anxiety in children and adolescents who had MRI scans of the brain, and to compare the results to adults undergoing brain MRI scans, and to children and adolescents undergoing electroencephalography (EEG; which is usually regarded a “minimal burden”). Method: Participants were 57 children and adolescents who had a brain MRI scan (MRI-C; mean age 12.9 years), 28 adults who had a brain MRI scan (MRI-A; mean age 43.7 years), and 66 children and adolescents undergoing EEG (EEG-C; mean age 12.9 years). Anxiety was assessed on the subjective (situational anxiety) and on the physiological level (arousal), before and after the respective examination. Results: More than 98% of children and adolescents reported no or only minimal fear during the MRI scan. Both pre- and post-examination, the MRI-C and the MRI-A groups did not differ significantly with respect to situational anxiety ( p = 0.262 and p = 0.374, respectively), and to physiological arousal ( p = 0.050, p = 0.472). Between the MRI-C and the EEG-C group, there were also no significant differences in terms of situational anxiety ( p = 0.525, p = 0.875), or physiological arousal ( p = 0.535, p = 0.189). Prior MRI experience did not significantly influence subjective or physiological anxiety parameters. Conclusions: In this study, children and adolescents undergoing a brain MRI scan did not experience significantly more anxiety than those undergoing an EEG, or adults undergoing MRI scanning. Therefore, a general exclusion of minors from MRI research studies does not appear reasonable.

127,An experimental examination of cognitive processes and response inhibition in patients seeking treatment for buying-shopping disorder,"There is an ongoing debate about whether buying-shopping disorder (BSD) should be acknowledged as a behavioral addiction. The current study investigated if mechanisms that play a prominent role in disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviors are relevant in BSD, particularly cue reactivity, craving, cognitive bias and reduced inhibitory control regarding addiction-relevant cues. The study included 39 treatment-seeking patients with BSD and 39 healthy control (HC) participants (29 women and 10 men in each group). Subjective responses toward buying/shopping-relevant visual cues were compared in patients vs. control participants. Experimental paradigms with neutral and semi-individualized buying/ shopping-related pictures were administered to assess attentional bias, implicit associations and response inhibition with respect to different visual cues: Dot-probe paradigm (DPP), Implicit Association Task (IAT), Go/nogo-task (GNG). The severity of BSD, craving for buying/shopping, and symptoms of comorbid mental disorders (anxiety, depressive and hoarding disorders) were measured using standardized questionnaires. The BSD-group showed more general craving for buying/shopping, stronger subjective craving reactions towards buying/shopping-related visual cues, and more symptoms of anxiety, depression and hoarding disorder than control participants. Task performance in the DPP, IAT and GNG paradigm did not differ between the two groups. The present findings confirm previous research concerning the crucial role of craving in BSD. The assumption that attentional bias, implicit associations and deficient inhibitory control with respect to buying/shopping-related cues are relevant in BSD could not be proven. Future research should address methodological shortcomings and investigate the impact of acute psychosocial stress and present mood on craving responses, cognitive processing, and response inhibition in patients with BSD.

128,Transgenerational improvements following child anxiety treatment: An exploratory examination,"Background: The present study conducted secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial to examine the transgenerational relationship between cognitive-behavioral therapy for child Separation Anxiety Disorder (SepAD) and the mental health of parents. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were compared before and after child treatment between parents of children treated for SepAD and parents of healthy children, who did not receive any treatment. Methods: One hundred and seven children aged 4–14 years with SepAD received one of two cognitive behavioral treatment programs for SepAD (TAFF; TrennungsAngstprogramm Für Familien; English: Separation Anxiety Family Therapy or CC; Coping Cat). Their parents (N = 189; 101 mothers and 88 fathers) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment for symptoms of separation anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. A comparison group of parents (N = 74; 42 mothers and 32 fathers) of 45 children without SepAD, who did not receive any treatment, were also assessed. Results: Results indicated a significant interaction effect between group and time on mothers’ depression and separation anxiety, indicating that maternal symptoms of depression and separation anxiety improved in the child treatment condition in comparison to mothers of healthy children. There was no significant improvement in parental pathology levels among fathers of children treated for SepAD. Conclusions: Treatment for child SepAD may have subsequent positive effects on mothers’ own levels of separation anxiety and depression, though the mechanisms are yet unknown. Future studies are needed that test the transgenerational effect of child SepAD treatment on parental mental health as the primary research question.

129,Behavioral health conditions and potentially preventable diabetes-related hospitalizations in the United States: Findings from a national sample of commercial claims data,"Objective: To characterize the relationship between potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPHs) for diabetes and behavioral health conditions in commercially insured working-age persons with diabetes in the United States. Research design and methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical and pharmacy claims from services rendered between 2011 and 2013 for 229,039 adults with diabetes. Diabetes PPHs were identified using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Prevention Quality Indicators v6.0 logic. We used negative binomial-logit hurdle regression models to explore the adjusted relationships between diabetes PPHs and schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. Results: A total of 4,521 diabetes PPHs were experienced by 3,246 of the persons in the sample. The 20.83% of persons with one or more behavioral health conditions experienced 43.62% (1,972/4,521; 95% CI 42.18%-45.07%) of all diabetes PPHs, and the 7.14% of persons with more than one diagnosed behavioral health condition experienced 24.77% (1,120/4,521; 95% CI 23.54%-26.05%) of all diabetes PPHs. After adjusting for sociodemographic and physical health covariates, patients with depression, schizophrenia, drug or alcohol use disorders, or multiple behavioral health conditions were at significantly increased risk of experiencing at least one diabetes PPH, while patients with depression, drug use disorder, or multiple behavioral health conditions were at significantly increased risk of experiencing recurring diabetes PPHs over time. Conclusions: A number of behavioral health conditions are associated with diabetes PPHs, which are often preventable with timely, high-quality outpatient care. The results of this study will enable clinicians, payers, and policy-makers to better focus outpatient care interventions and resources within the population of persons with diabetes.

130,The effect of a non-talking rule on the sound level and perception of patients in an outpatient infusion center,"Noise is a common problem in hospitals, and it is known that social behavior can influence sound levels. The aim of this naturally-occurring field experiment was to assess the influence of a non-talking rule on the actual sound level and perception of patients in an outpatient infusion center. In a quasi-randomized trial two conditions were compared in real life. In the control condition, patients (n = 137) were allowed to talk to fellow patients and visitors during the treatment. In the intervention condition patients (n = 126) were requested not to talk to fellow patients and visitors during their treatment. This study measured the actual sound levels in dB(A) as well as patients’ preferences regarding sound and their perceptions of the physical environment, anxiety, and quality of health care. A linear-mixed-model showed a statistically significant, but rather small reduction of the non-talking rule on the actual sound level with an average of 1.1 dB(A). Half of the patients preferred a talking condition (57%), around one-third of the patients had no preference (36%), and 7% of the patients preferred a non-talking condition. Our results suggest that patients who preferred non-talking, perceived the environment more negatively compared to the majority of patients and perceived higher levels of anxiety. Results showed no significant effect of the experimental conditions on patient perceptions. In conclusion, a non-talking rule of conduct only minimally reduced the actual sound level and did not influence the perception of patients.

131,Childhood theory of mind does not predict psychotic experiences and social functioning in a general population sample of adolescents,"Aims: Theory of Mind (ToM) is often impaired in early and chronic phases of psychosis and it is often suggested that poor ToM is a trait vulnerability for psychosis. The aim of this study was to examine in an adolescent sample whether childhood ToM abilities can predict psychotic experiences over a period of six years and whether this is mediated by social functioning. To examine whether ToM is a specific predictor for psychosis, symptoms of depression and anxiety were also examined. Materials and methods: A baseline case-control sample (T0: age 7–8 years) with and without auditory vocal hallucinations (AVH) in the general population was assessed after five years (T1: age 12–13 years) on ToM ability (ToM Storybook Frank), and after eleven years (T2: age 18–19 years) on psychotic experiences (Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences; CAPE), depressive and anxiety symptoms (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; DASS-21), and social functioning (Groningen Questionnaire on Social Behaviour; GSVG-45). Analyses were conducted on a subsample of 157 adolescents aged 18–19 years (T2) who had data available on ToM ability at T1. Results: ToM at T1 was not predictive of psychotic experiences after six years (from age 12–13 to age 18–19) and social functioning was also not a mediator. ToM was not associated with psychopathology in general (depressive and anxiety symptoms) over six years (from age 12–13 to age 18–19). Conclusions: The current study found no evidence for a longitudinal association between ToM ability and psychotic experiences, social functioning, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, in adolescence.

132,Psychometric evaluation of the Korean version of the Hepatitis B Quality of Life Questionnaire,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to conduct a psychometric evaluation of the Korean version of the Hepatitis B Quality of Life Questionnaire (K-HBQOL), which is designed to assess the quality of life of patients with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: The K-HBQOL was developed by converting the original English version to Korean using a back-and-forth translation method. The translated questionnaire was distributed to 168 adults with HBV. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic characteristics of these participants. Confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory principal components analysis (CFA and PCA) were performed, applying varimax rotation and using Kaiser’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule to examine the factor structure. The minimum average partial rule was also used to identify the number of components. Results: The original factor model was not confirmed by CFA in this sample. Six components (Psychological Well-being, Stigmatization, Anticipation Anxiety, Weakness, Vitality, and Vulnerability) were extracted by PCA, with 69.11% of the total variance explained. In this process, one component present in the original factor model (Transmission) was not found, while another component (Weakness) was extracted. Conclusions: This study revealed the psychometric characteristics of the Korean version of the HBQOL for patients with hepatitis B. We suggest a study with a larger sample is needed to evaluate validity and reliability of the K-HBQOL for other Korean populations.

133,Depression and anxiety in patients with different rare chronic diseases: A cross-sectional study,"Objective: Empirical evidence on depression and anxiety in patients with rare diseases is scarce but can help improve comprehensive treatment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of depression and anxiety in this heterogeneous population and to examine aspects associated with increased psychopathology. Methods: N = 300 patients with 79 different rare diseases (female:80%, age: M = 44.3(12.8), range:16–74 years) participated in a cross-sectional online study. We determined the percentages of patients reporting elevated depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores. We calculated two linear regressions with depression and anxiety as outcomes. Predictor variables were diagnosis-related aspects (diagnosis assigned to ICD-10 chapter, visibility of symptoms, time since diagnosis, comorbid diseases), perceived somatic-symptom-severity (PHQ-15), illness-perceptions (consequences, control, identity, concern, understanding and treatment control; B-IPQ-R), coping mechanisms (constructive attitudes, active engagement in life) and social support (heiQ). We controlled for gender, age and depression or anxiety depending on the outcome. Results: 42% of the patients (95%CI [36.41%,47.59%]) reported depression scores indicating moderately or severely elevated symptom levels. Regarding anxiety, this applies to 23% (95%CI [18.54%,28.06%]). Variables significantly associated with depression were higher perceived somatic-symptom-severity ( B = 0.41, p &lt; .001), less control ( B = .17, p &lt; .05), lower levels of concern ( B = -0.32, p &lt; .01) and less constructive attitudes ( B = -1.40, p &lt; .001). No diagnosis-related variables were associated with depression. Variables significantly associated with anxiety were diseases of the circulatory system compared to congenital malformations ( B = 1.88, p &lt; .05), less consequences ( B = -0.32,p &lt; .05) and more concern ( B = -0.32, p &lt; .01). Conclusion: The data reveal first insights into depression and anxiety in patients with different rare diseases. High percentages of patients showed clinically relevant symptom burden. No diagnosis- related differences were found in depression while anxiety seems to be particularly frequent in patients with rare diseases of the circulatory system. Besides perceived somatic symptom severity, cognitive appraisal seems to be linked to depression. Supporting patients in coping with their disease may help reduce psychopathology and therefore improve overall health.

134,The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT2) for evaluating civilian mild traumatic brain injury. A pilot normative study,"Self-report measures, particularly symptom inventories, are critical tools for identifying patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms and their follow-up. Unlike in military or sports-related assessment, in general civilian settings pre-injury levels of concussion-like symptoms are lacking. Normative data are available in adolescent and college populations, but no reference data exist to guide clinical adult explorations. The purpose of this study was to use the second edition of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT2) to profile a cohort of 60 healthy community volunteers who had not sustained a head injury. Participating volunteers underwent MRI scanning and were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants reported a median of 3 concussion-like symptoms and the 97.5 percentile score was found at 10.5 symptoms, out of a total of 22. The median severity score was 4.9 points, and 28.9 was the upper limit of the reference interval. Only 10 participants (16.7%) did not endorse any symptom. The most frequently endorsed symptom was feeling difficulty in concentrating, with 41.7% of the sample reporting it. Age, sex and general distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were not associated with concussion- like symptoms. Our data yielded elevated cut-offs scores for both the number of symptoms and the symptom severity. In conclusion, postconcussive-like symptoms are frequent in the general non-concussed adult population and it should be taken into account in any future models developed for screening patients at risk of developing physical, cognitive, and psychological complaints following mild traumatic injury.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-65475-001). It is well established that repeated social defeat stress can induce negative long-term consequences such as increased anxiety-like behavior and enhances the reinforcing effect of psychostimulants in rodents. In the current study, we evaluated how the immune system may play a role in these long-term effects of stress. A total of 148 OF1 mice were divided into different experimental groups according to stress condition (exploration or social defeat) and pre-treatment (saline, 5 or 10 mg/kg of the anti-inflammatory indomethacin) before each social defeat or exploration episode. Three weeks after the last social defeat, anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus maze paradigm. After this test, conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced by a subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg). Biological samples were taken four hours after the first and the fourth social defeat, 3 weeks after the last defeat episode, and after the CPP procedure. Plasma and brain tissue (prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus) were used to determine the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Results showed an increase of peripheral and brain IL-6 levels after the first and fourth social defeat that was reverted three weeks later. Intraperitoneal administration of the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin before each episode of stress prevented this enhancement of IL-6 levels and also reversed the increase in the rewarding effects of cocaine in defeated mice. Conversely, this protective effect was not observed with respect to the anxiogenic consequences of social stress. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a modulatory proinflammatory contribution to stress-induced vulnerability to drug abuse disorders and highlight anti-inflammatory interventions as a potential therapeutic tool to treat stress-related addiction disorders.

136,I’m going to fail! Acute cognitive performance anxiety increases threat-interference and impairs WM performance,"Stress can impair cognitive performance, as commonly observed in cognitive performance anxiety (CPA; e.g., test anxiety). Cognitive theories indicate that stress impairs performance by increasing attention to negative thoughts, a phenomenon also known as threat-interference. These theories are mainly supported by findings related to self-report measures of threat-interference or trait anxiety. Our main aim was to test, for the first time in a single study, the hypotheses that acute CPA-related stress negatively affects both working memory (WM) performance and objectively assessed threat-interference during performance. In addition, we aimed to assess the validity of a new stress-induction procedure that was developed to induce acute CPA. Eighty-six females were randomly assigned to a CPA-related stress group ( n = 45) or a control group. WM performance and threat-interference were assessed with an n-back task (2-back and 3-back memory loads), using CPA-related words as distracters. The stress group showed higher state anxiety and slower WM performance. Both effects were moderated by trait CPA: the effects were stronger for individuals with higher trait CPA. Finally, trait CPA moderated the effect of stress on threat-interference during higher cognitive load: individuals with higher trait CPA in the stress group showed higher threat interference. We conclude that acute CPA increases threat-interference and impairs WM performance, especially in vulnerable individuals. The role of threat-interference, cognitive load, and trait anxiety should be taken into account in future research. Finally, our method (combining our stressor and modified n-back task) is effective for studying stress-cognition interactions in CPA.

We assessed 121 drug-naïve adults with ADHD, 93 treated adults with ADHD, and 145 healthy controls (age 18–36 years) using semi-structured psychiatric interviews, intelligence tests, and medical records. Drug-naïve adults with ADHD had more comorbidities than treated adults with ADHD and controls. Childhood ADHD-combined subtype, relative to ADHD-inattentive subtype, was associated with higher risks of comorbidities. Current medication treatment was associate with a higher risk for anxiety disorders, and longer treatment duration was associated with lower risks of mood disorders and sleep disorders. Our results indicate that no medication treatment, short treatment duration, and childhood ADHD-combined subtype are associated with increased risks for psychiatric comorbidities among adults with ADHD.

Resilience is a psychological characteristic which enhances personal assets and protects individuals from potential negative effects of various stressors. While this topic has been considered in the separate context of sports injuries and anxiety states, these issues have rarely been considered together. The objective of this study is to analyse the association between motivation to overcome injuries in football and the state of anxiety caused by those injuries. One hundred and eighty-five footballers from Spain were analysed by way of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, and an injury self-registration sheet. Statistical analyses were performed using structural equations. Results showed a direct and positive relationship between the capacity to face up to injuries or potential injuries and to adapt successfully to them for injured footballers, especially when anxiety was considered as a transitory emotional state. In addition, this relationship was stronger in non-injured sportspersons because their resilience capacity was not being impaired by the experience of an injury.

139,Perceived microaggressions in health care: A measurement study,"The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Microaggressions in Health Care Scale (MHCS), including factor structure, measurement invariance, and internal consistency reliability. We used a cross-sectional research design to study perceived racial microaggressions, discrimination, and mental health in 296 African American and Latino respondents. Participants completed measures that assess healthcare microaggressions and daily discrimination as well as the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results revealed that the MHCS has promising psychometric properties. The confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) revealed that the MHCS is a unidimensional scale. Multi-group CFAs provided evidence of measurement invariance across racial/ethnic groups and gender. The internal consistency reliability of the scale was .88 for the overall sample. Microaggressions correlated with daily discrimination scores ( r = .67), as well as mental health symptoms ( r ’s = .40 –.52). The MHCS is a brief, valid, and reliable measure that can be used to assess and monitor racial and cultural forces that shape patient-provider interactions. This study concludes with a discussion of the ongoing need for research on microaggressions in healthcare as well as implications for future research.

140,Cannabinoid and nicotine exposure during adolescence induces sex-specific effects on anxiety- and reward-related behaviors during adulthood,"Nicotine and cannabis use during adolescence has the potential to induce long lasting changes on affective and cognitive function. Here, we examined whether adolescent exposure to nicotine, the cannabinoid agonist WIN55-212,2 (WIN), or co-exposure to both would alter operant learning, locomotion, and anxiety- and reward-related behaviors in male and female mice during adulthood. Males exposed to a moderate dose of WIN (2 mg/kg) or coexposed to nicotine and the moderate dose of WIN exhibited decreased anxiety-associated behaviors and increased cognitive flexibility, but did not differ in operant learning or generalized locomotion. In contrast, differences were not found among the females in these measures at the moderate WIN dose or in both sexes with exposure to a low WIN dose (0.2 mg/kg). Furthermore, a sex-dependent dissociative effect was found in natural reward consumption. Males exposed to the moderate dose of WIN or co-exposed to nicotine and the moderate dose of WIN demonstrated increased sucrose consumption. In contrast, females exposed to the moderate dose of WIN exhibited a decrease in sucrose consumption, which was ameliorated with co-administration of nicotine. Together, these novel findings demonstrate that adolescent exposure to cannabinoids in the presence or absence of nicotine results in altered affective and reward-related behaviors during adulthood.

142,"How does mathematics anxiety impair mathematical abilities? Investigating the link between math anxiety, working memory, and number processing","In contemporary society, it is essential to have adequate mathematical skills. Being numerate has been linked to positive life outcomes and well-being in adults. It is also acknowledged that math anxiety (MA) hampers mathematical skills increasingly with age. Still, the mechanisms by which MA affect performance remain debated. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we contrast the different ways in which MA has been suggested to interfere with math abilities. Our models indicate that MA may affect math performance through three pathways: (1) indirectly through working memory ability, giving support for the ‘affective drop’ hypothesis of MA’s role in mathematical performance, (2) indirectly through symbolic number processing, corroborating the notion of domain-specific mechanisms pertaining to number, and (3) a direct effect of MA on math performance. Importantly, the pathways vary in terms of their relative strength depending on what type of mathematical problems are being solved. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which MA may interfere with mathematical performance.

143,Thinking about negative life events as a mediator between depression and fading affect bias,"The current research examined the links between depressive symptomology and anxiety on the fading of affect associated with positive and negative autobiographical memories. Participants (N = 296) recalled and rated positive and negative events in terms of how pleasant or unpleasant they were at the time they occurred and at the time of event recollection. Multilevel mediation analyses identified evidence that higher levels of depressive symptoms were directly associated with lower affect fade for both negative and positive memories. Tests of indirect effects indicated that depressive symptoms were indirectly related to lower affect fade for negative (but not positive) autobiographical memories via the heightened tendency to think about negative (but not positive) memories. Anxiety was unrelated to affect fade both directly and indirectly. These results suggest that people higher in depressive symptoms retain more negative affect due to an increased likelihood of thinking about negative autobiographical events.

144,Habituation of the electrodermal response—A biological correlate of resilience?,"Current approaches to quantifying resilience make extensive use of self-reported data. Problematically, this type of scales is plagued by response distortions–both deliberate and unintentional, particularly in occupational populations. The aim of the current study was to develop an objective index of resilience. The study was conducted in 30 young healthy adults. Following completion of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Depression/Anxiety/Stress Scale (DASS), they were subjected to a series of 15 acoustic startle stimuli (95 dB, 50 ms) presented at random intervals, with respiration, skin conductance and ECG recorded. As expected, resilience (CD-RISC) significantly and negatively correlated with all three DASS subscales–Depression (r = -0.66, p &lt; 0.0001), Anxiety (r = -0.50, p &lt; 0.005) and Stress (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.005). Acoustic stimuli consistently provoked transient skin conductance (SC) responses, with SC slopes indexing response habituation. This slope significantly and positively correlated with DASS-Depression (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.005), DASS-Anxiety (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05) and DASS-Total (r = 0.50, p &lt; 0.005) scores, and negatively with resilience score (r = -0.47; p = 0.006), indicating that high-resilience individuals are characterized by steeper habituation slopes compared to low-resilience individuals. Our key finding of the connection between habituation of the skin conductance responses to repeated acoustic startle stimulus and resilience-related psychometric constructs suggests that response habituation paradigm has the potential to characterize important attributes of cognitive fitness and well-being–such as depression, anxiety and resilience. With steep negative slopes reflecting faster habituation, lower depression/anxiety and higher resilience, and slower or no habituation characterizing less resilient individuals, this protocol may offer a distortion-free method for objective assessment and monitoring of psychological resilience.

145,"The Fear of Pain Questionnaire: Factor structure, validity and reliability of the Italian translation","Background: The Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III (FPQ-III) is a self-report instrument developed to assess fear of different stimuli usually causing pain. The present study aimed to construct an Italian version of the FPQ-III and examine its psychometric properties in a heterogeneous sample of Italian healthy individuals. Methods: The questionnaire was translated following the forward-backward method and completed by 511 Italian adults who met the inclusion criteria. Within 2 months of the first assessment, a subgroup of participants ( n = 164) was re-tested. The factorial structure of the FPQ-III was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To better comprehend the FPQ-III’s factorial structure, a CFA was also performed for each of the two reduced versions of the FPQ-III, namely the FPQ-Short Form and the FPQ-9. Divergent validity, test-retest reliability, and gender/age measurement invariance were also evaluated. Results: The results of the CFA revealed that the original three-factor model poorly fitted the data, but it became satisfactory after allowing correlated error terms. Concerning divergent validity, correlations between FPQ-III scores and pain intensity, depression, and anxiety were found to be positive but weak in magnitude (&lt; .20). FPQ-III subscales and total scores showed good internal consistency and time reliability. Finally, scalar invariance was only partially obtained, whereas all the other types of invariance were fully respected both for gender and age. Conclusions: The current findings indicate that the Italian version of the FPQ-III provides valid and reliable scores for the assessment of fear of pain in the Italian population.

146,Anxiety symptoms and felt stigma among young people living with perinatally or behaviourally-acquired HIV in Ukraine: A cross-sectional survey,"Background: Ukraine has the second largest European HIV epidemic. This study aimed to describe stigma, demographic and social factors and their association with anxiety among perinatally and behaviourally-HIV-infected (PHIV; BHIV) young people in Kiev and Odessa. Methods: 104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13–25 years completed a confidential tabletbased survey. Survey tools included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8–10 indicating mild and ≥ 11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted to explore factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Results: PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 [IQR 13.9–17.1] and 23.0 [21.0–24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3 [10.3–14.4] and 0.9 [0.2–2.4] years previously; 97% (97/100) and 66% (65/99) respectively were on ART. Overall 43% (95%CI 36–50%) reported any and 13% (95%CI 9–19%) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms, with no difference by HIV acquisition mode ( p = 0.405) or gender ( p = 0.700). 42% (75/180) reported history of an emotional health problem for which they had not been referred/attended for care. Moderate/severe anxiety symptoms were associated with HIV-related stigma (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.24 95%CI 1.14–1.34 per HSS unit increase), lower self-esteem (PR 0.83 95%CI 0.78–0.90 per RSES point increase), CD4 ≥ 350 cells/mm³ (PR 2.29 95%CI 1.06–4.97), having no-one at home who knew the respondent’s HIV status (PR 9.15 95%CI 3.40–24.66 vs all know) and, among BHIV, less stable living situation (PR 6.83 95%CI 1.99–23.48 for ≥ 2 vs no home moves in last 3 years) and history of drug use (PR 4.65 95%CI 1.83–11.85). Conclusions: Results indicated unmet need for psychosocial support. Further work is needed to explore strategies for mental health support, particularly around disclosure, self-esteem and stigma.

147,Enhanced activity of pyramidal neurons in the infralimbic cortex drives anxiety behavior,"We show that in an animal model of anxiety the overall excitation, particularly in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL), is increased and that the activity ratio between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (AR PN/IN) is shifted towards excitation. The same change in AR PN/IN is evident for wildtype mice, which have been exposed to an anxiety stimulus. We hypothesize, that an elevated activity and the imbalance of excitation (PN) and inhibition (IN) within the neuronal microcircuitry of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for anxiety behaviour and employed optogenetic methods in freely moving mice to verify our findings. Consistent with our hypothesis elevation of pyramidal neuron activity in the infralimbic region of the prefrontal cortex significantly enhanced anxiety levels in several behavioural tasks by shifting the AR PN/IN to excitation, without affecting motor behaviour, thus revealing a novel mechanism by which anxiety is facilitated.

The purpose of this study was to determine psychological features of patients with pSS. We analyzed personality, depression and anxiety of patients with primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (pSS) in comparison with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls (HC) and assessed their association with sociodemographic factors and comorbidity. Methods: In 105 pSS patients (mean age 51.34 years, mean disease duration 5.98 years), 52 RA patients (mean age 51.37 years, mean disease duration 8.10 years) and 54 HC (mean age 51.35 years) clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were determined and results analyzed. At enrollment patients and controls completed the Revisited NEO Personality Inventory Five-Factor model (NEO-PI-R), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS [Version 16.0]. The relative size of the effect was assessed based on standardized estimates of effect size (d). Results: Patients with pSS, similarly to RA patients had higher scores of Neuroticism (d = 0.46, p = 0.007) and lower scores of Extraversion (d = 0.51, p = 0.001) and Openness for experience (d = 0.65, p = 0.013) compared to HC. There was no significant differences between pSS group and HC in the depression (d = 0.171, p &gt; 0.05). However, patients with pSS had higher anxiety in comparison to HC (p &lt; 0.0001). In multivariate models, education and satisfaction with family relationships were significant predictors for psychological characteristics of patients, independently of clinical diagnosis. Conclusions: Our study is the first to show that patients with pSS scored high on neuroticism and anxiety and low on sociability. Education and satisfaction with family relationships predisposed to their psychological profile. Psychological assessment of patients with pSS may improve understanding and treatment of this clinical condition.

149,Interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training: A systematic review,"Background: Resilience is a contextual phenomenon where a complex and dynamic interplay exists between individual, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. With growing interest in enhancing resilience in physicians, given their high risk for experiencing prolonged or intense stress, effective strategies are necessary to improve resilience and reduce negative outcomes including burnout. The objective of this review was to identify effective interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training, working in any setting. Methods and findings: We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), and observational studies (including pilot studies) published in English, French, and Spanish that included an intervention to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. We included studies that implemented interventions to reduce burnout, anxiety, and depression or to improve empathy to ultimately enhance resilience, rather than studies designed solely to reduce stress or trauma-induced stress. We performed a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane Library with no publication year limit. The last search was conducted on March 29, 2017. We used random effect models to calculate pooled standardized mean differences. Resilience was the primary outcome measure using validated resilience scores. Secondary outcome measures included proxy measures of resilience such as burnout, empathy, anxiety and depression. Our search strategy identified 7,579 records;74 met the criteria for full-text review. Seventeen studies were included in the final review published between 1998 and 2016 of which 9 (4 RCT, 5 observational) had physician data extractable. Interventions varied greatly regarding their approach, duration, and follow-up. Two RCTs measured resilience using validated scales; both found a significant improvement. No meta-analysis for resilience was conducted due to the presence of high clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Conclusions: Our systematic review demonstrates that there is weak evidence to support one intervention over another to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from very low to low. There is a need for a consensus on the definition of resilience and how it is measured. Longer follow-up is required to ensure any intervention effects are sustained over time.

150,Rapid detection of internalizing diagnosis in young children enabled by wearable sensors and machine learning,"There is a critical need for fast, inexpensive, objective, and accurate screening tools for childhood psychopathology. Perhaps most compelling is in the case of internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, where unobservable symptoms cause children to go unassessed–suffering in silence because they never exhibiting the disruptive behaviors that would lead to a referral for diagnostic assessment. If left untreated these disorders are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new approach for identifying children with internalizing disorders using an instrumented 90-second mood induction task. Participant motion during the task is monitored using a commercially available wearable sensor. We show that machine learning can be used to differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with 81% accuracy (67% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We provide a detailed description of the modeling methodology used to arrive at these results and explore further the predictive ability of each temporal phase of the mood induction task. Kinematical measures most discriminative of internalizing diagnosis are analyzed in detail, showing affected children exhibit significantly more avoidance of ambiguous threat. Performance of the proposed approach is compared to clinical thresholds on parent-reported child symptoms which differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with slightly lower accuracy (.68-.75 vs. .81), slightly higher specificity (.88–1.00 vs. .88), and lower sensitivity (.00-.42 vs. .67) than the proposed, instrumented method. These results point toward the future use of this approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success.

151,Alexithymic traits can explain the association between puberty and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescent females,"Symptoms of internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety increase in adolescence, especially in females. However, gender differences in depression and anxiety symptoms emerge only after puberty onset. Levels of alexithymia, characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one’s emotions, are elevated in depression and anxiety, and fluctuate across adolescence in a gender-specific manner. This study investigated changes in alexithymia across adolescence, and explored the potential role of alexithymia in the development of depression and anxiety, separately for females and males. Accordingly, 140 adolescents aged 11 to 21 years (77 female) completed self-report measures of alexithymia, depression and anxiety, and pubertal development. For females alone, pubertal maturation was associated with alexithymic traits (specifically difficulties identifying and describing feelings), as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. After accounting for alexithymia, the relationship between puberty and depression and anxiety was absent or reduced in females. Thus, alexithymic traits may have differential consequences for males and females, and possibly contribute towards increased depression and anxiety symptoms in females during adolescence. We propose that developmental changes in alexithymia should be considered when studying the onset and development of internalizing psychological disorders during adolescence.

152,Melanotan-II reverses autistic features in a maternal immune activation mouse model of autism,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions, difficulty with communication, and repetitive behavior patterns. In humans affected by ASD, there is a male pre-disposition towards the condition with a male to female ratio of 4:1. In part due to the complex etiology of ASD including genetic and environmental interplay, there are currently no available medical therapies to improve the social deficits of ASD. Studies in rodent models and humans have shown promising therapeutic effects of oxytocin in modulating social adaptation. One pharmacological approach to stimulating oxytocinergic activity is the melanocortin receptor 4 agonist Melanotan-II (MT-II). Notably the effects of oxytocin on environmental rodent autism models has not been investigated to date. We used a maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model of autism to assess the therapeutic potential of MT-II on autism-like features in adult male mice. The male MIA mice exhibited autism-like features including impaired social behavioral metrics, diminished vocal communication, and increased repetitive behaviors. Continuous administration of MT-II to male MIA mice over a seven-day course resulted in rescue of social behavioral metrics. Normal background C57 male mice treated with MT-II showed no significant alteration in social behavioral metrics. Additionally, there was no change in anxiety-like or repetitive behaviors following MT-II treatment of normal C57 mice, though there was significant weight loss following subacute treatment. These data demonstrate MT-II as an effective agent for improving autism-like behavioral deficits in the adult male MIA mouse model of autism.

Methods: In this controlled clinical trial (NCT03471429), medically stable, adult patients were approached if the physician believed that the patient had “moderate or greater anxiety.” Patients were allocated on a 1:1 ratio to either 15 min exposure to a certified therapy dog and handler (dog), or usual care (control). Patient reported anxiety, pain and depression were assessed using a 0–10 scale (10 = worst). Primary outcome was change in anxiety from baseline (T0) to 30 min and 90 min after exposure to dog or control (T1 and T2 respectively); secondary outcomes were pain, depression and frequency of pain medication. Results: Among 93 patients willing to participate in research, 7 had aversions to dogs, leaving 86 (92%) were willing to see a dog six others met exclusion criteria, leaving 40 patients allocated to each group (dog or control). Median and mean baseline anxiety, pain and depression scores were similar between groups. With dog exposure, median anxiety decreased significantly from T0 to T1: 6 (IQR 4–9.75) to T1: 2 (0–6) compared with 6 (4–8) to 6 (2.5–8) in controls ( P &lt; 0.001, for T1, Mann-Whitney U and unpaired t-test). Dog exposure was associated with significantly lower anxiety at T2 and a significant overall treatment effect on two-way repeated measures ANOVA for anxiety, pain and depression. After exposure, 1/40 in the dog group needed pain medication, versus 7/40 in controls ( P = 0.056, Fisher’s exact test). Conclusions: Exposure to therapy dogs plus handlers significantly reduced anxiety in ED patients.

154,Sensory sensitivity and its relationship with adult attachment and parenting styles,"Parenting styles vary in levels of both warmth and control, with evidence that type of parenting behavior is linked with social-emotional and other developmental outcomes for children. There are well-established associations between adult attachment and parenting styles. Given emerging evidence that people with different attachment patterns vary in how they receive and modulate sensory information, there are potential implications for parenting which have rarely received research attention. This cross-sectional study investigates the links between parenting style and parental sensory sensitivity, and the possible mediating role of parental sensory sensitivity in the relationship between adult attachment and parenting styles. A convenience sample of 155 parents of children aged 4–12 years old completed an online survey measuring: adult attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships-Modified 16-item Scale), sensory sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Persons Scale-Shortened Version), and parenting styles (Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire). Correlation, regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Analyses revealed that parents who reported more attachment insecurity also reported higher levels of parental sensory sensitivity, and more authoritarian and/or permissive (non-optimal) parenting styles. Parental sensory sensitivity was found to fully mediate the relationship between attachment avoidance and permissive parenting, and to partially mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and both authoritarian and permissive parenting. This study represents the first quantitative evidence for associations between parental sensory sensitivity and parenting styles, and the mediating effect of parental sensory sensitivity on the known relationship between attachment insecurity and parenting. Awareness of a parent’s level of sensory sensitivity, in addition to his/her attachment style, may assist in developing effective strategies to meet both the parent’s and child’s needs and support the parent-child relationship.

155,Agreement between a single-item measure of anxiety and depression and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: A cross-sectional study,"Anxiety and depression can be heightened among individuals living with chronic diseases. Identifying these individuals is necessary for ensuring they are provided with adequate support. Traditional tools such as clinical interviews or symptom checklists are not always feasible to implement in practice. Robust single-item questions may be a useful alternative. This study aimed to measure agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of a single-item question about anxiety and depression compared to the widely used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A cross-sectional survey of 2,811 people with cancer attending 19 treatment centres in Australia. Patients were approached in the waiting room prior to an outpatient clinic appointment and invited to complete a pen and paper survey. Participants completed the HADS as well as 2 single-items asking if they have felt anxious or depressed in the last week. The single-items for anxiety and depression each demonstrated moderate levels of sensitivity (0.78 for anxiety; 0.63 for depression) and specificity (0.75 for anxiety; 0.84 for depression) against the relevant HADS subscale. Positive predictive values were moderate (0.53 for anxiety and 0.52 for depression) while negative predictive values were high for both single-item questions (0.90 for anxiety and 0.89 for depression). The single-item measures of anxiety and depression may be useful to rule out individuals who do not require further psychological assessment or intervention for anxiety and depression. Further research is needed to explore whether these findings generalise to other chronic diseases.

8,Measuring within-day cognitive performance using the experience sampling method: A pilot study in a healthy population,"Introduction: People with depression, anxiety, or psychosis often complain of confusion, problems concentrating or difficulties cognitively appraising contextual cues. The same applies to people with neurodegenerative diseases or brain damage such as dementia or stroke. Assessments of those cognitive difficulties often occurs in cross-sectional and controlled clinical settings. Information on daily moment-to-moment cognitive fluctuations and its relation to affect and context is lacking. The development and evaluation of a digital cognition task is presented. It enables the fine-grained mapping of cognition and its relation to mood, intra-personal factors and context. Methods: The momentary Digit Symbol Substitution Task is a modified digital version of the original paper-and-pencil task, with a duration of 30 seconds and implemented in an experience sampling protocol (8 semi-random assessments a day on 6 consecutive days). It was tested in the healthy population ( N = 40). Descriptive statistics and multilevel regression analyses were used to determine initial feasibility and assess cognitive patterns in everyday life. Cognition outcome measures were the number of trials within the 30-second sessions and the percentage of correct trials. Results: Subjects reported the task to be easy, pleasant and do-able. On average, participants completed 11 trials with 97% accuracy per 30-second session. Cognitive variation was related to mood, with an interaction between positive and negative affect for accuracy (% correct) ( p = .001) and an association between positive affect and speed (number of trials) ( p = .01). Specifically, cheerful, irritated and anxious seem to covary with cognition. Distraction and location are relevant contextual factors. The number of trials showed a learning effect ( p &lt; .001) and was sensitive to age ( p &lt; .001). Conclusion: Implementing a digital cognition task within an experience-sampling paradigm shows promise. Fine-tuning in further research and in clinical samples is needed. Gaining insight into cognitive functioning could help patients navigate and adjust the demands of daily life.

9,Pragmatic language dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: Results from a single center Italian study,"Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a frequent neuropsychiatric manifestation affecting several domains, even in apparently asymptomatic patients. Current research revealed that the typical CI pattern affects frontal-subcortical circuit and thus executive functions. The impairment of non-literal language or pragmatic language (PL), including metaphors, idioms, inferences or irony has been well described in several conditions such as autism disorders, Parkinson’s disease, brain injury and even in earlier phases of neurodegenerative processes. Even if PL neuro-anatomy remains controversial, correlation between executive dysfunctions and non-literal language involvement has been reported both in traumatic injury and mild cognitive impairment patients. Nonetheless, no specific study has been performed to evaluate PL impairment in SLE patients so far. Objectives: We aimed at assessing the PL domain in a Italian monocentric SLE cohort in comparison to healthy controls, matched to age and education, through a specific battery, the batteria sul linguaggio dell'emisfero destro (BLED). Secondly, we focused attention on possible correlations between CI and clinical and laboratory SLE-related features. Methods: Forty adult patients affected by SLE, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and thirty healthy subjects were enrolled consecutively in this cross-sectional study. The protocol included complete physical examination, extensive clinical and laboratory data collection (comprehensive of demographics, past medical history, co-morbidities, disease activity, chronic damage evaluation, previous and concomitant treatments) and cognitive assessment for five different domains: memory, attention, pragmatic language, executive and visuospatial functions. Self-reported scale for anxiety and depression were performed to exclude the influence of mood disorders on cognitive dysfunction. Results: We studied 40 Caucasian SLE patients [male (M)/ female (F) 3/37; mean±standard deviation (SD) age 45.9±10.1 years, mean±SD disease duration 120.8±81.2 months] and 30 healthy subjects (M/F 9/21; mean±SD age 41.3±13 years). According to the low level of disease activity and damage (mean±SD Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) of 1.3±2.3, mean±SD Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) Damage Index (SDI) of 0.2±0.5), only 30% of patients was on glucocorticoid treatment at the study entry. PL was the most compromised domain in terms of Mean Domain Z scores. As for the Domain Cognitive Dysfunction score, a deficit of PL was observed in 45% of patients and was significantly more prevalent than memory, executive and visuospatial functions impairment (P = 0.0002, P = 0.0002 and P &lt; 0.000001, respectively). According to Global Cognitive Dysfunction score, 25% of patients experienced a mild impairment and 7.5% a moderate one. Anti-phospholipid antibodies positivity was significantly associated with memory impairment (P &lt; 0.0005), whereas the presence of other neuropsychiatric events was associated with executive dysfunctions (P &lt; 0.05); no further significant association nor correlation were identified. Conclusion: In this study we evaluated for the first time PL in SLE patients finding a dysfunction in almost half of patients. The dysfunction of PL was significantly more frequent than the other domains assessed.

This in turn will aid the development of healthcare policies and planning for prevention, early diagnosis and management of health conditions. Objective: To evaluate patients’ perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour towards both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns by sex, age and type of primary care setting (as a proxy for affordability of healthcare). Methods: A total of 3979 patients from 221 public and 239 private clinics in Malaysia were interviewed between June 2015 and February 2016 using a patient experience survey questionnaire from the Quality and Cost of Primary Care cross-sectional study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the complex survey design was used. Results: After adjusting for covariates, more women than men perceived that most people would see their general practitioners for commonly consulted acute and preventive physical and some psychosocial health concerns such as stomach pain (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22–2.21), sprained ankle (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.56), anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12–1.55), domestic violence (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13–1.62) and relationship problems (AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.51). There were no significant differences in perceived healthcare seeking behaviour by age groups except for the removal of a wart (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12–1.76). Patients who visited the public clinics had generally higher perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour for both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns compared to those who went to private clinics. Conclusions: Our findings showed that sex and healthcare affordability differences were present in perceived community healthcare seeking behaviour towards primary care services. Also perceived healthcare seeking behaviour were consistently lower for psychosocial health concerns compared to physical health concerns.

The reverse has also been shown, namely that eating a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish and lean meat, is associated with reduced risk of depression. To date, only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted with elevated depression symptoms being an inclusion criterion, with results showing that a diet intervention can reduce clinical levels of depression. No such RCTs have been performed in young adults. Young adults with elevated levels of depression symptoms and who habitually consume a poor diet were randomly allocated to a brief 3-week diet intervention (Diet Group) or a habitual diet control group (Control Group). The primary and secondary outcome measures assessed at baseline and after the intervention included symptoms of depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; CESD-R; and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale– 21 depression subscale; DASS-21-D), current mood (Profile of Mood States), self-efficacy (New General Self-Efficacy Scale) and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test). Diet compliance was measured via self-report questionnaires and spectrophotometry. One-hundred-and-one individuals were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the Diet Group or the Control Group. Upon completion of the study, there was complete data for 38 individuals in each group. There was good compliance with the diet intervention recommendations assessed using self-report and spectrophotometry. The Diet group had significantly lower selfreported depression symptoms than the Control Group on the CESD-R ( p = 0.007, Cohen’s d = 0.65) and DASS-21 depression subscale ( p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.75) controlling for baseline scores on these scales. Reduced DASS-21 depression subscale scores were maintained on follow up phone call 3 months later ( p = .009). These results are the first to show that young adults with elevated depression symptoms can engage in and adhere to a diet intervention, and that this can reduce symptoms of depression. The findings provide justification for future research into the duration of these benefits, the impacts of varying diet composition, and their biological basis.

12,The effects of interacting with fish in aquariums on human health and well-being: A systematic review,"Background: Most research into the health benefits of human-animal interaction has focused on species that interact physically with humans, such as dogs. This may be unsuitable for certain populations for reasons including accessibility and the risk of negative consequences to both the person and the animal. However, some research has associated viewing fish in aquariums with positive well-being outcomes; as there is no physical contact with the animal, this form of interaction carries less risk. At present, little is known about the specific benefits of human-fish interaction. Objectives: To explore current evidence relating to the psychological and physiological benefits of interacting with fish in aquariums. METHODS:Systematic searches were conducted to identify relevant primary research of any design. All forms of interaction were considered, including keeping fish as companion animals and fish aquarium-based interventions. ""Non-live"" alternatives, such as videos, were also considered. This review was conducted according to a registered protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018090466). Results: Nineteen studies were included. Two provided tentative evidence that keeping home aquaria is associated with relaxation. The remaining studies involved novel interactions with fish in home or public aquariums. Outcomes relating to anxiety, relaxation and/or physiological stress were commonly assessed; evidence was mixed with both positive and null findings. Preliminary support was found for effects on mood, pain, nutritional intake and body weight, but not loneliness. All studies had methodological issues and risk of bias was either high or unclear. Conclusions: Review findings suggest that interacting with fish in aquariums has the potential to benefit human well-being, although research on this topic is currently limited. Future research should aim to address gaps in the evidence, such as whether and how the type of human-fish interaction can influence well-being outcomes. Researchers should also aim to address the methodological concerns highlighted in this review.

13,Is higher resilience predictive of lower stress and better mental health among corporate executives?,"Objective: To assess the impact of resilience, the ability to withstand and bounce back from adversity, on measures of well-being, self-reported stress, and mental health diagnoses. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey of participants seen at an executive health practice at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 2012 through September 2016. Participants completed an anonymous survey that included demographic information and 3 validated survey instruments-the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the 12-item Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale (LASA), and the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Self-reported history of mental health diagnoses was also collected. CD-RISC scores were used to stratify participants into lower (&lt; 30), medium (30-34), or higher (≥ 35) resilience categories. Participants' LASA scores, PSS scores, and self-reported mental health diagnoses were compared among resilience categories. Results: Of the 2,027 eligible participants, 1,954 met the study inclusion criteria as currently employed corporate-sponsored executive or business professionals (self-designated) who completed the CD-RISC survey. Most participants (62.5%) were aged 40 to 59 years. The majority were male (78.3%), white (95.3%), educated (86.2%), and in a committed relationship (89.7%). Among participants, 41.7% reported higher resilience, 34.3% had medium resilience, and 24.0% had lower resilience. The quality of life and overall LASA scores were positively associated with higher resilience ( P &lt; .001). PSS scores and self-reported mental health diagnoses were negatively associated with higher resilience ( P &lt; .001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for patient characteristics. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional survey of a large cohort of corporative executives, the lower-resilience cohort had a 4-fold higher prevalence of depression and an almost 3-fold higher prevalence of anxiety compared with the higher-resilience cohort. High resilience was positively associated with well-being and negatively associated with perceived stress. Our findings suggest that higher resilience in the executive workplace environment is associated with better mental health, reduced stress, and greater well-being.

14,Impact of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics on behavioral problems at 5 years of age: A study from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study,"Many women experience anxiety or sleep disorders during pregnancy and require pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines (BZDs) or z-hypnotics. Limited information is currently available on how prenatal exposure to these medications affects behavioral problems in children over the long term. Therefore, from a public health perspective, this issue is highly important. The present study aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to BZDs and z-hypnotics affected externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children at age 5 years. This study was based on The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The final study population included data for 36 401 children, from questionnaires completed by the mothers throughout the 5-year follow up. Children’s behaviors were measured at age 5, based on parental responses to The Child Behavior Checklist. Children T-scores of 63 or above were considered to indicate clinically relevant behavior problems. We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with censoring weights to account for loss during follow-up. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main results. The final sample included 273 (0.75%) children that were exposed to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics during pregnancy. The main, IPTW and censoring weighted analyses showed that prenatal exposure to BZD and/or z-hypnotics increased the risks of internalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.73–2.49) and externalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.86–2.64). However, based on sensitivity analyses, we concluded that the risks of displaying externalizing and internalizing problems at 5 years of age did not significantly increase after prenatal exposure to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics. Instead, the sensitivity analyses suggested that residual confounding and selection bias might explain the increased risks observed in the main analyses.

15,Italian validation of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire: Exploring associations between shyness and psychosocial functioning,"Background: In recent years, researchers have begun to explore the implications of shyness for the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents, exploring its association with internalizing problems. Research in an Italian context is hindered by the lack of a validated self-report measure of shyness. We report two studies aimed to assess the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire (CSQ-it) and investigate its correlations with convergent and divergent constructs. The first study aimed to examine associations between CSQ-it and self-report measures of anxiety and somatic symptoms and attachment with parents and peers. The second study aimed to investigate its relations to internet addiction. Methods The self-report measures were completed by 550 participants in the first study and 131 participants in the second study. Parents provided information on their child’s problems. Psychometric properties were assessed by Cronbach’s alpha in both studies and by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1. The relations between shyness and measures of internalizing problems and attachments were analyzed by correlational methods. In Study 2 a moderated mediation model tested the hypothesis that the relationship between shyness and internet addiction is mediated by somatic symptoms and that shyness moderates the relationship between somatic symptoms and internet addiction. Results: The reliability and validity of the Italian Version of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire were satisfactory. Results from confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the single-factor model of the questionnaire previously identified in North American and Chinese studies. There were significant correlations between shyness, anxious and somatic symptomatology, impaired psychosocial functioning and specific components of attachment relationships. In Study 2 the indirect effect of shyness on internet addiction through somatic symptoms was significant as well as significantly moderated for high shyness scores but not for low levels of shyness. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study that explored the psychometric proprieties of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire in the Italian context. Findings demonstrated that this self-reported measure of shyness has sound psychometric properties and can be used as a sensitive and appropriate instrument for the assessment of shyness in children and adolescents.

16,Systematic review on the prevalence of illness and stress and their associated risk factors among educators in Malaysia,"Background: Despite evidence of physical (illness) and mental (stress) health problems, there appears to be a lack of studies or concern regarding occupational safety and health among educators in Malaysia. Objective: To review the prevalence of illness, stress, and corresponding risk factors among educators in Malaysia. Method: Scopus, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, CAB, and other computerized databases were searched according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify studies published between January 2013 and April 2019 on the prevalence and associated risk factors of illness and stress among educators (S1 Checklist). The keywords used included educator, teacher, lecturer, academic staff, teaching profession, university staff, academician, faculty, illness, injury, disease, pain, WMSD, dysphonia, hoarseness, stress, mental health, strain, health problem, disorder, and/or Malaysia. Selected studies were evaluated by quality assessment. Results: Twenty-two articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The prevalence of illness and stress was determined for low back pain (33.3–72.9%); upper back pain (33.33–56.4%); neck/shoulder pain (40.4–80.1%); upper arm discomfort (91.3%); forearm pain (89.6%); wrist pain (16.7–93.2%); hip pain (13.2–40.9%); thigh discomfort (91.8%); lower leg discomfort (90.5%); knee pain (23.7–88.0%); ankle/feet pain (19.3–87.7%); elbow pain (3.5–13.0%); voice disorder (10.4–13.0%) and stress (5.5–25.9%). Sex, education level, teaching experience, quality of life, anxiety, depression, coping styles, and others were reported as associated risk factors across the studies. Conclusions: There appears to be a cause for concern regarding musculoskeletal disorders, voice disorder, and stress reported among educators in Malaysia. While most risk factors matched those reported in studies elsewhere, others such as school characteristics (school level, government or private school, and location [rural/urban]) have not been investigated.

17,Effect of information about the benefits and harms of mammography on women’s decision making: The InforMa randomised controlled trial,"Background: In Spain, women invited to breast screening are not usually informed about potential harms of screening. The objective of the InforMa study is to assess the effect of receiving information about the benefits and harms of breast screening on informed choice and other decision- making outcomes, in women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening. Methods: Two-stage randomised controlled trial. In the first stage, 40 elementary territorial units of the public healthcare system were selected and randomised to intervention or control. In the second stage, women aged 49-50 years were randomly selected. The target sample size was 400 women. Women in the intervention arm received a decision aid (DA) with detailed information on the benefits and harms of screening. Women in the control arm received a standard leaflet that did not mention harms and recommended accepting the invitation to participate in the Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP). The primary outcome was informed choice, defined as adequate knowledge and intentions consistent with attitudes. Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict, worry about breast cancer, time perspective, opinions about the DA or the leaflet, and participation in the BCSP. Results: In the intervention group, 23.2% of 203 women made an informed choice compared to only 0.5% of 197 women in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Attitudes and intentions were similar in both study groups with a high frequency of women intending to be screened, 82.8% vs 82.2% (p = 0.893). Decisional conflict was significantly lower in the intervention group. No differences were observed in confidence in the decision, anxiety, and participation in BCSP. Conclusions: Women in Spain lack knowledge on the benefits and harms of breast screening. Providing quantitative information on benefits and harms has produced a considerable increase in knowledge and informed choice, with a high acceptance of the informative materials.

18,Risk and protective factors for the development of ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents: Results of the longitudinal BELLA study,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood worldwide, and causes significant impairments in overall functioning. In order to develop effective prevention and intervention programs, knowledge of the determinants that have an impact on the onset and development of ADHD symptoms is essential. So far, little is known about factors affecting ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents over time. Therefore, this study investigates potential psychosocial risk and protective factors for ADHD symptoms based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data of a German population-based study. Methods: Data on children and adolescents ( n = 1,384 aged 11 to 17 years) were collected at three measurement points (baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-ups) covering a period of two years. We used latent growth modelling to investigate effects of parental mental health problems (risk factor) and self-efficacy, family climate and social support (protective factors) on symptoms of ADHD based on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data. Sociodemographic factors, pre- and postnatal factors, and comorbid symptoms of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems were considered as covariates. Results: At baseline, male gender, younger age, stronger aggressive behavior, and stronger parental mental health problems were related to more ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal analyses showed that female gender, migration status, increasing symptoms of generalized anxiety, increasing aggressive behavior and increasing parental mental health problems were associated with stronger increase of ADHD symptoms over time. However, improving family climate was related to decreasing ADHD symptoms over time. We further found moderator effects for social support. Conclusion: The findings of the study provide important information concerning risk and protective factors in the context of ADHD. Hence, the results may be integrated into the planning and implementation of future prevention and early intervention strategies that target affected children and adolescents.

19,Psychological distress and its association with socio-demographic factors in a rural district in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Psychological distress including depression and anxiety are among the most serious causes of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. There has been no study in the rural area to report the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress in a rural district in Bangladesh. Methods: A total of 2425 adults (1249 women) aged 18–90 years were selected from the Narail upazilla using multi-level cluster random sampling for a cross-sectional study. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10 items questionnaire. Participants’ socio-demographic status, life style factors and health conditions were also collected. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for binary outcomes and mean changes for continuous outcomes of psychological distress score were computed. Logistic regression and generalized linear model techniques were used for analytical purpose. Results: The overall prevalence of psychological distress was 52.5%. This proportion included 22.7% people rated as having mild psychological distress, 20.8% moderate and 9.0% severe. The prevalence of moderate (24.7% vs. 17.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and severe (16.2% vs. 2.5%, p &lt; 0.001) psychological distress was significantly higher in older adults of age 60–90 years than that in younger adults of age 18–59 years. The prevalence of severe psychological distress was higher in females than males and the difference increased with age (vs. (females vs males: 1.9% vs. 1.1% at age of &lt; 30 years, 12.2% vs. 10.1% at age between 60–69 years, and 45.5% vs. 25.4% at age of 80 years or older). After multivariate adjustment, compared to degree or equivalent level of education, no education (odds ratio (OR), 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–2.82) was associated with higher prevalence of any psychological distress in the total sample. Compared to married, psychological distress among widowed older adults was almost five times higher prevalence (OR, 4.89, 95% CI, 2.51–9.55). Socio-economic status showed a U-shaped relationship with the prevalence of psychological distress; being very poor or wealthy was associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to those of moderate socio-economic status. People living in pourashava (semi-urban areas) reported significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to people living in typical rural unions. Conclusions: In this rural Bangladeshi community, the prevalence of psychological distress was high, especially among older women. Factors including lower level of education, inability to work, and living in semi-urban areas were associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress. Public health programmes should target people in high risk groups to reduce their psychological distress in Bangladesh.

20,Mental health in individuals with spinal cord injury: The role of socioeconomic conditions and social relationships,"Objectives: To evaluate socioeconomic inequalities in social relationships, and to assess whether socioeconomic conditions and social relationships are independently related to mental health problems in individuals with a physical disability due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 511 individuals with SCI aged over 16 years who participated in the community survey of the Swiss SCI Cohort Study (SwiSCI). Indicators for socioeconomic conditions included years of formal education, household income, and financial strain. Social relationships were operationalized by three structural (partner status; social contact frequency; number of supportive relationships) and four functional aspects (satisfaction with: overall social support; family relationships; contacts to friends; partner relationship). General mental health was assessed by the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) of SF-36 and depressive symptoms were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression subscale, HADS-D). Established cut-offs for general mental health problems (MHI-5 ≤56) and depressive symptomatology (HADS-D ≥8) were used to dichotomize outcomes. Associations were assessed using logistic regressions. Results: Lower household income was predominantly associated with poor structural social relationships, whereas financial strain was robustly linked to poor functional social relationships. Financial strain was associated with general mental health problems and depressive symptomatology, even after controlling for social relationships. Education and household income were not linked to mental health. Poor structural and functional social relationships were related to general mental health problems and depressive symptomatology. Notably, trends remained stable after accounting for socioeconomic conditions. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for socioeconomic inequalities in social relationships as well as for independent associations of financial strain and poor social relationships with mental health problems in individuals with SCI. Further research may develop strategies to improve mental health in SCI by strengthening social relationships. Such interventions may be especially beneficial for individuals with low income and financial strain.

21,Incorporating animal-assisted therapy in mental health treatments for adolescents: A systematic review of canine assisted psychotherapy,"Introduction: As interest in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) grows, there is increasing need to differentiate informal activities from formal and professionally directed therapies, including mental health focussed Canine-Assisted Psychotherapy (CAP). There have been no reviews focusing exclusively on CAP and the distinct developmental period of adolescence. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of CAP interventions, their impacts and their acceptability, tolerability and feasibility for adolescents with mental health disorders. Method: A systematic review identified studies incorporating canines into mental health treatments for adolescents aged 10–19 years. Studies reporting qualitative or quantitative psychological or psychosocial outcomes were included. Results: Seven studies were scrutinised. Intervention characteristics varied, including a range of formats, settings, locations, doses, and facilitators. Information on the role of the canines in sessions was sparse. CAP had a positive impact on primary diagnoses and symptomatology, conferring additional benefits to standard treatments for internalising disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and equivalent effects for anxiety, anger and externalising disorders. CAP was associated with positive impacts on secondary factors including increased engagement and socialisation behaviours, and reductions in disruptive behaviours within treatment sessions. Global functioning also improved. There was insufficient evidence that CAP improved factors associated with self-esteem, subjective wellbeing, or coping. Good attendance and retention rates indicated high levels of acceptability. Moderate to high tolerability was also indicated. Feasibility may be limited by additional training and logistical requirements. Recommendations: We recommend the development of theoretically informed, standardised (manualised) intervention protocols that may subsequently form the basis of efficacy and effectiveness testing. Such protocols should clearly describe canine-participant-facilitator interactions via a formalised nomenclature; spontaneous (animal-led), adjunctive (facilitator-led), and experiential (participant-led). Conclusions: There is emerging evidence to suggest that CAP improves the efficacy of mental health treatments in self-selected adolescent populations via reductions in primary symptomatology, and via secondary factors that improve therapeutic processes and quality, such as engagement and retention.

62,Social problem solving in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience interpersonal difficulties potentially linked to impaired social cognition. We aimed to investigate social problem solving strategies in adults with ADHD. Nineteen patients with ADHD and 20 healthy controls were assessed with a scenario-based battery gauging the ability to understand other people's mental states, to recognize interpersonal conflicts and to generate and identify optimal (i.e. both socially sensitive and practically effective) solutions to these conflicts. Furthermore, measures of socioemotional and executive functioning were administered. Patients and controls performed on a similar level with respect to theory of mind, the generation of the “best” solution to problematic social situations and the selection of the optimal solution out of alternatives. However, in a fluency task, patients generated fewer optimal solutions, while the number of only socially sensitive, only practically effective or irrelevant solutions was comparable in both groups. The overall ability to freely generate problem solutions was not linked to executive functioning or trait empathy, but better generation abilities were related to lower social interaction anxiety in the patients only. This suggests impaired generation fluency of optimal interpersonal conflict solutions in patients with ADHD which might contribute to higher levels of anxiety in social interactions.

63,Modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults: A systematic review,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and associated with high rates of impairment and disability. This burden highlights the need to identify risk factors that individuals can modify without professional intervention. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that examined modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults in the general population. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE using medical subject headings and text words related to risk factors, protective factors, and each anxiety disorder. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by three study authors. Modifiable risk and protective factors from 19 studies across seven countries were identified. Risk factors identified included cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, negative appraisals of life events, avoidance, and occupational factors. Protective factors included social support, coping, and physical activity. Cigarette smoking was the most studied risk factor. Support was found for cigarette smoking as a risk factor for agoraphobia and panic disorder. Mixed results were found for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Across disorders, smoking frequency was associated with greater risk. Results indicate an important gap in the literature in that few studies have examined modifiable risk factors for anxiety disorders.

64,Associations between neighborhood-level violence and individual mental disorders: Results from the world mental health surveys in Five Latin American cities,"Rapidly urbanizing areas of Latin America experience elevated but unevenly distributed levels of violence. Extensive research suggests that individual exposure to violence is associated with higher odds of both internalizing (anxiety and mood) and externalizing (substance and intermittent explosive) mental disorders. Less research, however, has focused on how neighborhood-level violence, as an indicator of broader neighborhood contexts, might relate to the mental health of residents, independently of an individual's personal exposure. We used multilevel analyses to examine associations of neighborhood-level violence with individual-level past-year mental disorders, controlling for individual-level violence exposure. We used data from 7,251 adults nested in 83 neighborhoods within five large Latin American cities as part of the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Accounting for individual-level violence exposure, living in neighborhoods with more violence was associated with significantly elevated odds of individual-level internalizing disorders, but not externalizing disorders. Caution should be exercised when making causal inferences regarding the effects of neighborhood-level violence in the absence of experimental interventions. Nevertheless, neighborhood context, including violence, should be considered in the study of mental disorders. These findings are particularly relevant for rapidly urbanizing areas with high levels of violence, such as Latin America.

65,The prediction of alexithymia as a state or trait characteristic in patients with substance use disorders and PTSD,"Alexithymia is common in patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) and is possibly a negative prognostic factor in their treatment. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we explored whether SUD patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more alexithymic than SUD patients without PTSD. Next, we explored whether trait and state-related parts of alexithymia could be differentiated in these patients. This phenomenon was studied in 197 SUD patients with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20); Clinician Administered PTSD Scale; Self-Report Inventory for PTSD; Traumatic Experiences Checklist; European Addiction Severity Index; and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale in a cross-sectional design. SUD patients with current PTSD showed more alexithymic characteristics than patients without PTSD or with previous lifetime/not current PTSD. The severity of PTSD complaints; alcohol addiction; and the combination of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, all of which are more related to alexithymia as a state, explained 38.1% of the TAS-20. In conclusion, we advise that SUD patients be assessed for alexithymia and that its degree is taken into account. We also tentatively assume that a considerable part of alexithymia is more state- than trait-related in these patients.

66,"Modification of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms after Lorca's earthquakes (Murcia, Spain)","Information of the modulation effect of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after earthquakes is scarce and contradictory. A cross-sectional face-to-face interview survey of a representative sample of the adults was carried out after the Lorca (Spain) earthquakes (May 11, 2011). Socio-demographic variables, DSM-IV diagnostic assessment and earthquake-related stressors were obtained from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The triallelic and biallelic classification of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were genotyped from buccal swabs. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict PTSD, including interaction terms to explore gene-environment (G x E) interactions. The vast majority (83%, n = 341) of the Lorca survey respondents ( n = 412, 71% response rate) were genotyped. Both classifications of the 5-HTTLPR genotype were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Prior lifetime PTSD was the only variable that remained a significant predictor after adjustments. There were no significant main effects of earthquake related stressors or 5-HTTLPR. However, G x E interactions of 5-HTTLPR with high emotional impact and prior lifetime anxiety disorders were statistically significant. These results provide new evidence of the modulation effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on PTSD risk. This information might characterize people at higher risk of developing PTSD after an earthquake exposure.

67,Screening for postpartum hypomania among Chinese women after childbirth,"This study examines the prevalence and risk factors for postpartum hypomania in women after childbirth as well as examining the potential influence of personality traits in relation to experiencing symptoms of postpartum hypomania. A total of 1022 women no later than 1 month post-birth were recruited in Suzhou, China, between March 2017 and December 2018. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed with the Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32), and a total score of 14 or higher was defined as having hypomanic symptoms. We found 43.6% of the women in our sample had hypomanic symptoms. The results of multiple logistic regression showed that rural residence [ p = 0.01, odds ratio (OR) = 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5–0.9], education background ( p = 0.005, OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.5–0.9), marriage satisfaction ( p = 0.048, OR = 0.9, 95% CI =0.8–1.0), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ( p = 0.001, OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.9–1.0), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Extraversion ( p &lt; 0.001, OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1–1.2), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Lie ( p = 0.01, OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.9–1.0), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 ( p = 0.02, OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0–1.1) were independently associated with exhibiting hypomanic symptoms. The current study provided insights into hypomanic symptoms in Chinese postpartum women. We also found that extraversion and lie personality were significantly associated with an increased risk of hypomanic symptoms in postpartum women. It is urgent to arrange screening for women at risk of developing postpartum hypomania as soon as possible after giving birth and at regular intervals in the first 6 months to prevent the women developing psychological disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder later on.

68,Comparing primary insomnia to the insomnia occurring in major depression and general anxiety disorder,"Apart from possibly distinguishing the different clinical causes of insomnia, this article explores the subjective and objective sleep differences amongst primary insomnia, major depression with insomnia and general anxiety disorder with insomnia. Subjective sleep and objective sleep of the participants were evaluated by using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index and polysomnography, respectively. We found that major depression with insomnia exhibited higher daytime dysfunction than primary insomnia; showed significantly higher values of rapid eye movement (REM) periods, time of REM sleep and percentage of REM stage; and presented lower percentage of non-rapid eye movement stage compared with primary insomnia and general anxiety disorder with insomnia ( p &lt; 0.05). General anxiety disorder with insomnia showed lower awakening number (AN) than primary insomnia, and other objective and subjective sleep values of general anxiety disorder with insomnia and primary insomnia showed no significant difference ( p &gt; 0.05). Our findings showed that major depression with insomnia increased active REM sleep and severe daytime function, which could alert clinicians to the risk of depression. Major depression with insomnia and primary insomnia may be categorically different. However, general anxiety disorder with insomnia and primary insomnia might be a continuum of a disease rather than be categorically distinct.

69,"An examination of the Entrapment Scale: Factor structure, correlates, and implications for suicide prevention","Entrapment is an emerging theoretical and empirical factor associated with suicide. The current study expanded our understanding of entrapment by examining the Entrapment Scale factor structure, demographic correlates, and association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Data from an online cross-national study of suicide were analyzed from two samples of young adults aged 18–34 (United Kingdom [U.K.] sample N = 418; United States [U.S.] N = 414). Primary findings included: (1) factor-analytic support for a two factor (i.e., internal and external) Entrapment Scale structure; (2) variation in external entrapment subscale factor loadings by sample; (3) significant demographic correlates of elevated entrapment of younger age, female gender, and U.S. sample; (4) significant convergent positive associations for both entrapment types with cognitive (e.g., perceived burdensomeness), mental health (e.g., anxiety), and STB correlates; and (5) significant, robust associations of internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness with STBs in the U.K. sample. Implications are reviewed for suicide prevention theory, research and practice.

70,"Self-reported empathy in adults with autism, early psychosis, and social anxiety disorder","The Empathy Quotient (EQ) self-report questionnaire is used to measure empathy in individuals with clinical conditions that have been associated with social impairments. In this study, older teens and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N = 60), early psychosis (EP; N = 51) and social anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 71) and neurotypical controls (NT; N = 26) were compared on the cognitive empathy, emotional reactivity and social skills sub-scales of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) measure. All three clinical groups reported lower cognitive empathy than NT controls, and the ASD group reported lower cognitive empathy than EP and SAD groups. The ASD group reported lower emotional reactivity than the SAD group. All three clinical groups reported lower social skills that NT controls. The poor self-rated empathy for the ASD and EP groups generally reflects previous research that found individuals with these conditions perform relatively poorly on certain objective measures of empathy. However, the poor self-rated cognitive empathy and social skills for the SAD group conflicts with previous research that has found that SAD groups perform well on objective measures of empathy. This suggests that both EQ and objective measures should be used to fully assess empathy in clinical groups.

71,Subthreshold autism spectrum in bipolar disorder: Prevalence and clinical correlates,"Background: While few previous studies highlighted a higher prevalence of autistic traits among adults with Bipolar Disorder (BD), little is known about their clinical significance in this population. Method: 143 subjects with BD were enrolled at the adult psychiatric inpatient clinic of the University of Pisa. Assessments included the SCID-5, the MOODS-SR, the AQ and the AdAS Spectrum. Results: 42.7% of the sample scored positively for significant levels of autistic traits. Subjects with high autistic traits showed a greater likelihood of a very early onset of BD, greater length of current in-hospital stay, significantly higher rates of anxiety disorders and lower rates of substance use disorders compared to patients with low autistic traits. They also show significantly greater depressive symptoms and suicidality across the lifetime. Suicidality was associated with the altered responsiveness to sensory input and inversely related to adherence to routine and inflexibility. Conclusion: The study is a first exploration of the clinical significance of autistic traits among BD patients. Our results highlight the clinical significance of autistic traits in patients with BD, supporting the usefulness of a dimensional approach to the autism spectrum.

72,Clinical insight in anorexia nervosa: Associated and predictive factors,"Clinical and cognitive factors associated with clinical insight regarding both baseline level and its time-related changes, in outpatients treated for anorexia nervosa. The 193 participants were recruited at 13 French centers specializing in eating disorders (FFAB network) and assessed for insight (SAI-ED), body mass index (BMI), eating disorder severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, emotional state, silhouette, and functionality; two cognitive tests were also administered. The 137 patients were then re-assessed 18 weeks later. Minimum and ideal subjective BMI and premorbid intelligence were associated with poor baseline insight. Contrary to nearly all other clinical factors, the level of insight revealed no improvement after four months of care. Only the higher value of the minimum lifetime BMI was significantly predictive of increased insight. More positive emotions (PANAS), less symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS scores), and fewer syndromes (HADS above threshold) were the only factors that covaried with the changes in the level of insight. In conclusion, poor insight has little time variability, contrary to nearly all clinical and cognitive factors. As increased insight is mainly accompanied by improvements in the emotional domain, the latter could represent potential targets for patients with lack of awareness about their eating disorder.

73,A randomized controlled trial comparing Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) and behavioral activation in veterans with affective disorders,"This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the efficacy of Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) to Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) in veterans diagnosed with affective disorders. TBT is a transdiagnostic psychotherapy designed to address depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Preliminary findings have been promising; however, no RCT has been completed to date. 105 treatment-seeking veterans were recruited and completed diagnostic and self-report measures, and then randomized into TBT or BATD treatment conditions for 12 weekly psychotherapy sessions. Assessment measures were re-administered at immediate post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Of the 93 participants initiating treatment, 50 participants completed the full treatment protocol (TBT n = 29; BATD n = 21). No differences were observed in treatment completion across groups. Participants demonstrated significant treatment improvements across all assessments, including measures of depression, anxiety (general, cognitive, and somatic), stress, PTSD symptoms, and transdiagnostic impairment. Group differences with small effect sizes were observed in most of the studied measures, favoring TBT compared to BATD. Together, the findings support the growing literature on the efficacy of transdiagnostic psychotherapies, compared to disorder-specific treatments (DSTs). Related to the outcome findings, the benefits for transdiagnostic protocols in terms of symptom coverage, dissemination, and access were discussed.

74,Bipolar subtypes and their clinical correlates in a sample of 391 bipolar individuals,"Differences between BD-I and BD-II patients with regard to specific illness characteristics are poorly understood. This study is mainly aimed to compare socio-demographic and clinical characteristics between BD-I and BD-II patients with the goal of clarifying possible predictors of clinical course. The sample of this cohort study is composed of 391 currently euthymic bipolar patients. Participants were all receiving only maintenance treatment; their psychopharmacological regimens and psychopathological conditions were stable at assessment. After univariate analyses, BD-II patients were more likely to be female, had more frequently a recent depressive episode and substance abuse/dependence relative to BD-I subjects. BD-II patients were also less likely to have a positive history of psychiatric conditions in family, psychotic symptoms at first episode, and first depressive illness episode. Moreover, BD-II were older at their illness onset and first treatment than BD-I patients. Furthermore, BD-I were more likely to have higher depressive, manic, anxiety, and symptoms severity than BD-II patients. After logistic regression analyses, being female (OR = 0.289), having psychiatric conditions in family (OR = 0.273), and higher severity of illness at CGI (OR = 0.604) were all significantly associated with BD-II. Additional studies are required to replicate these results, and facilitate the prediction of BD outcomes according to the specified profile.

75,Social anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning for girls but not boys with ADHD,"There is mixed evidence for whether or not co-occurring anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which may be partly due to studies typically using a global measure of anxiety and failing to consider possible sex differences. The present study examined child-reported social anxiety in relation to peer functioning and whether this association differs by sex in 93 children (66% male; ages 8–12) with ADHD. Children, parents, and teachers completed a measure of social acceptance, and teachers also completed measures of asociality, peer exclusion, peer dislike, and peer ignoring. Regression analyses examined the interaction between social anxiety and sex in relation to the peer functioning variables, with age, race, ADHD subtype, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms included as covariates. Social anxiety was associated with lower parent-reported social acceptance, with no sex differences in the association. However, significant interaction effects were found for child- and teacher-rated social acceptance, as well as peer exclusion and peer ignoring such that social anxiety was associated with less competence, more exclusion, and greater ignoring for girls but not boys. Findings indicate that social anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning for girls more so than boys with ADHD.

76,"Psychometric assessment of mental health in tinnitus patients, depressive and healthy controls","Tinnitus describes the perception of a sound without external source and is characterized by high comorbidity, e.g. depression. In many studies, tinnitus patients were compared to healthy controls while a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis was an exclusion criterion. Consequently, patients with severe tinnitus and psychiatric comorbidity were often neglected. In the current study, we tried to fill this gap and compared four groups including two control groups: (1) chronic tinnitus patients with mild tinnitus distress ( N = 37), (2) chronic tinnitus patients with severe tinnitus distress ( N = 24), (3) patients suffering from depression, but no tinnitus (major depressive disorder, MDD; N = 23) and (4) healthy controls ( N = 42). We assessed their clinical profile with clinical questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression and somatoform symptoms. Data were analyzed with a canonical discriminant analysis resulting in two factors. Factor 1 was called general psychopathology, because most questionnaires loaded highly on it. Regarding this factor, patients with severe tinnitus distress and MDD controls were impaired equally strong. Patients with mild tinnitus distress were more strongly affected than healthy controls. Both tinnitus groups reached higher values than the two control groups with regard to factor 2, called somatization. These results stress the presence of significant general psychopathology even in mild tinnitus.

77,Evidence for enhanced androgen action in the prefrontal cortex of people with bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia or major depressive disorder,"Anxiety and depressive disorders are more prevalent in hypogonadal men. Low testosterone levels are associated with greater negative symptoms and impaired cognition in men with schizophrenia. Thus, androgens may contribute to brain pathophysiology in psychiatric disorders. We investigated androgen-related mRNAs in post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of psychiatric disorders. We also assessed androgen receptor (AR) CAG trinucleotide repeat length, a functional AR gene variant associated with AR gene expression, receptor activity, and circulating testosterone. AR CAG repeat length was determined from genomic DNA and AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs measured using quantitative PCR in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control cases [ n = 35/group; Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) Array collection]. Layer-specific AR gene expression was determined using in situ hybridisation in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and control cases ( n = 15/group; SMRI Neuropathology Consortium). AR mRNA was increased in bipolar disorder, but was unchanged in schizophrenia, relative to controls. AR and 5α-reductase mRNAs were significantly positively correlated in bipolar disorder. AR CAG repeat length was significantly shorter in bipolar disorder relative to schizophrenia. AR mRNA expression was highest in cortical layers IV and V, but no layer-specific diagnostic differences were detected. Together, our results suggest enhanced cortical androgen action in people with bipolar disorder.

78,"The relationship between risk of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep problems, depression, and anxiety in adolescents from a community sample","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly related to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. However, previous studies on OSA and depression and anxiety have mostly been conducted in the adult population. We aimed to (1) screen for risk of OSA in a sample of adolescents from the general population using self-report questionnaires and (2) examine whether there are differences between the high- and low-risk groups for OSA in depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, and sleep-related variables. The data of 793 students (age range: 12–17 years old) were analyzed. The participants were assigned to the high-risk ( n = 202, 25.5%) or the low-risk group ( n = 591, 74.5%) of OSA. The participants in the high-risk group had more severe anxiety symptoms, lower self-esteem, insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and higher BMI compared those in the low-risk group. This study shows that it is possible to efficiently screen for risks of various problems associated with OSA in adolescents using an easy and simple screening tool.

79,Associations of childhood trauma and childhood mental disorder with past-year mental disorder in military and civilian employed men,"Childhood factors are pivotal to understanding mental health over the lifespan. However, there is a dearth of research exploring childhood trauma and childhood disorder simultaneously in determining adult mental disorder. We aimed to analyze childhood trauma and childhood disorder in determining past-year disorder in military and civilian employed men aged 18–60 years. Data derived from the 2010 Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study, and the 2007 Australian Bureau of Statistics National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were analysed using logistic regression and Generalised Structural Equation Modelling (GSEM). All major findings were consistent across both populations. The association between childhood disorder and past-year disorder remained after controlling for demographics, childhood and adult trauma (and service factors in the ADF). Childhood non-interpersonal trauma was not associated with past-year disorder in either population. The pathway between childhood trauma and past-year disorder was fully mediated by the spectrum of common childhood disorders, but not by childhood anxiety, depression or alcohol use disorders alone. Identification, intervention and prevention of childhood disorders is imperative. Investment in interventions targeting the influence of childhood traumatic events on the whole spectrum of childhood disorder, not only PTSD or anxiety, is a priority.

80,Effects of brief daily mindfulness practice on affective outcomes and correlates in a high BPD trait sample,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological disorder characterized by dysregulation across multiple domains. While selected mindfulness-based interventions are effective in addressing symptoms of BPD, less is known regarding the effects of engaging in brief mindfulness practices on affective correlates of BPD. The present study investigated the effects of engaging in brief, daily mindfulness practice in a sample of young adults with elevated BPD symptoms. Ninety-two participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 weeks of daily mindfulness meditation or relaxation practice (active control), or to a no-practice control condition. Participants completed measures assessing depression, anxiety, stress, shame, difficulties with emotion regulation, trait mindfulness, and self-compassion before and after the practice period. Compared to the no-practice control condition, mindfulness practice resulted in significant improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas relaxation practice led to reductions in emotion regulation difficulties. No significant differences were found on any of the other outcomes between the mindfulness and relaxation conditions. The findings suggest that while both mindfulness and relaxation-based practices are effective in targeting selected transdiagnostic processes associated with BPD, more intensive interventions may be required for the practices to induce changes at the level of psychological symptoms.

82,History of parenting instability and lifetime suicidal behavior in people who inject drugs,"Despite high rates of suicide in people who inject drugs, little is known about the risk factors for suicide related to childhood and family history in this population. We aimed to explore the relationship between the history of out-of-home care (OHC) and lifetime suicide attempts among people who inject opioids. Participants ( N = 202) were current injection opioid users with at least one previous episode of opioid maintenance treatment. They were recruited into a double-blind randomized controlled trial for opioid substitution treatment. Secondary analysis of baseline data was conducted from the European Addiction Severity Index and basic demographics questionnaires. A total of 81 (40%) participants reported a history of living in OHC and 27% reported attempting suicide. Participants who reported living in OHC were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts compared to those who did not live in OHC. History of OHC and suicidal ideation were significant risk factors for suicide attempts adjusting for depression and anxiety. Highest rates of lifetime attempts were among participants who lived in a group home, foster care, and/or psychiatric facility. Living in OHC during childhood was significantly associated with higher rates of suicide attempts in our sample. Greater efforts should be made to provide children from vulnerable families with environments where stable one-to-one relationships can be cultivated.

83,Characterization of the mental health of immigrant children separated from their mothers at the u.S.–mexico border,"Immigrant children who faced forced separation from their parents may be at heightened risk of developing mental health disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed the mental health of children being held in U.S. immigration detention who had been previously separated from their mothers. We interviewed 73 mothers about their eldest child age 5–17 using the Parent-Report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Among these children, many had elevated scores for emotional problems (49%), peer problems (21%), and total difficulties (15%). Male children demonstrated significantly higher rates of abnormal peer problems compared to females. Younger children (age 5–11 years) also demonstrated significantly higher rates of abnormal conduct problems, hyperactivity, and total difficulties. Scores did not differ significantly based on length of separation. Results reveal that children who had been separated from their parents experience high levels of mental health distress, which are especially high in younger children. Regardless of length of separation, these children would benefit from comprehensive mental health treatment with a culturally-responsive and trauma-informed lens.

A logistic regression analysis was conducted. Over half of the individuals with deliberate self-harm (DSH) presented significant suicide risk. There was a direct association between DSH and suicide attempts, with almost the totality of the adolescents with suicide attempts also reporting DSH. According to the prediction model, suicidal ideation and diversity of DSH behaviors are significant predictors of suicide attempts, with an augmentation in the diversity of DSH behaviors and suicidal ideation predicting suicide attempts. Depression and anxiety appeared also as significant predictors of suicide attempts in adolescent self-harmers. Considering that the majority of the sample was not from a clinical setting, an alarming finding was that one third of the total sample was at suicide risk. These results place DSH as a key variable for early intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal",2019
85,Intolerance of uncertainty and decision making in generalized anxiety disorder patients,"Presents a study which aims to examine intolerance of uncertainty and decision making in generalized anxiety disorder patients. Patients were recruited at a community mental health center at which they sought assessment and treatment. An adapted version of the decision making task was used to assess participants’ decisions involving simple choices between two small monetary rewards, varying both in probability of receiving the first reward, magnitude of the reward and time to wait before learning the consequences of the choice. This study yielded two main results. One primary finding was that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients, but not control participants, tended to avoid uncertainty when risks were low. However, there was less of a difference in probability of waiting per trial type in the trials where the patients knew the time they had to wait than in the trials where they did not know how long they had to wait. This suggests that when uncertainty is lower, GAD patients are inclined to react more like healthy controls. Furthermore, results showed that both patients with GAD and healthy controls were sensitive to loss, although results suggested that this finding was mainly driven by patients.

The first consultation was mandatory to be in the office. Patients were non-randomly divided in two groups: office consultation (n=95) and Skype consultation (n=103). All patients were followed for 12 months and evaluated in 3–5 regular consultations. Participants included in the Skype group differed significantly from participants in the office consultation group regarding three psychiatric comorbidities: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder (PD) with or without agoraphobia. The number of patients with GAD was significantly higher in the office consultation group, and on the other hand, the percentage of patients with agoraphobia was significantly higher in the Skype consultation group. For patients with GAD the change in the format of the consultations could be sufficient to provoke an anxiety crisis with the worry of getting worse from the depression. This may have been the reason why patients with GAD did not choose the Skype consultation. After 12 months of follow-up the two groups were similar in terms of depression symptoms, disease severity and function, suggesting that the consultations by Skype are as efficient as the office ones.

87,Heterogeneity in psychiatric diagnostic classification,"The theory and practice of psychiatric diagnosis are central yet contentious. This paper examines the heterogeneous nature of categories within the DSM-5, how this heterogeneity is expressed across diagnostic criteria, and its consequences for clinicians, clients, and the diagnostic model. Selected chapters of the DSM-5 were thematically analysed: schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Themes identified heterogeneity in specific diagnostic criteria, including symptom comparators, duration of difficulties, indicators of severity, and perspective used to assess difficulties. Wider variations across diagnostic categories examined symptom overlap across categories, and the role of trauma. Pragmatic criteria and difficulties that recur across multiple diagnostic categories offer flexibility for the clinician, but undermine the model of discrete categories of disorder. This nevertheless has implications for the way cause is conceptualised, such as implying that trauma affects only a limited number of diagnoses despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Individual experiences and specific causal pathways within diagnostic categories may also be obscured. A pragmatic approach to psychiatric assessment, allowing for recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more effective way of understanding distress than maintaining commitment to a disingenuous categorical system.

This systematic review examines published studies that used qEEG in youth with psychiatric illness between 1996 and 2017. We conducted a comprehensive database search of CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane using the following keywords: “quantitative EEG” and depression (MDD), anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), eating disorder, conduct, substance use, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder. Our search yielded 516 titles; 33 met final inclusion criteria, producing a total of 2268 youth aged 4–18. qEEG was most frequently studied as a potential diagnostic tool in pediatric mental illness; few studies assessed treatment response. Studies show higher theta/beta ratio in ADHD vs healthy controls (HC). The most consistent finding in ASD was decreased coherence in ASD vs HC. Studies show MDD has lower temporal coherence and interhemispheric coherence in sleep EEGs than HC. Further research is needed in the areas of mood, anxiety, ASD, and relationship to treatment. It remains unknown if abnormalities in qEEG are nonspecific markers of pediatric psychiatric illness or if they have the potential to differentiate types of psychopathology.

The current study examined three transdiagnostic constructs—anxiety sensitivity (AS), intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and worry—as predictors of depressive symptom severity in a sample of treatment-seeking adults with a primary diagnosis of OCD ( N = 93). Strong, positive associations between depressive symptoms and measures of AS, IU, and worry were detected, and AS and worry (but not IU) remained significant unique predictors of depression after controlling for the severity of OCD symptoms.

90,Prevalence and correlates of sleep disorder symptoms in psychiatric disorders,"Difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, nightmares, and excessive daytime sleepiness are some of the key clinical symptoms of sleep disturbances observed among individuals with psychiatric illnesses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders including parasomnia, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, circadian rhythm disorder and restless leg syndrome/periodic limb movement (RLS/PLMS) and its correlates in patients with psychiatric diagnoses. Patients aged 21–65 years (n = 400) attending the outpatient clinics with a primary diagnosis of either schizophrenia, mood or anxiety disorder based on ICD-9 criteria were included in this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic information was collected and screening questions pertaining to specific symptoms of sleep disorders were administered by a study team member. The overall prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders in the psychiatric outpatient sample was 40.75% (163/400). The prevalence for symptoms of narcolepsy, sleep breathing disorder, PLMS/RLS, circadian rhythm disorder and parasomnia were 12.5%, 14.5%, 14.8%, 4.5%, and 13.8% respectively. These symptoms were associated with age, low physical activity, and anxiety disorder. Results highlight the high prevalence of symptoms of sleep disorders in psychiatric patients.

Sociodemographic factors associated with the comorbidity profiles were also examined. Latent class analysis was conducted using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a representative sample of adolescents ( N = 10,123) in the United States. Latent classes were derived from 26 lifetime mental disorders which were assessed using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI). A three-class solution provided the best fit for the data, with classes labelled as comorbid emotional disorders (Class I), comorbid behavioural disorders (Class II), and normative (Class III). Class I (15.62% of the participants) included adolescents with a high probability of having anxiety, depressive, and intermittent explosive disorder. Class II (6.97%) was characterised by adolescents with a high probability of having substance use, behavioural disorders, and major depression. Class III (77.41%) was characterised by adolescents with a low probability of having any mental disorders. Characterising comorbid profile of mental disorders using person-based approach yields a higher-order classification that could have important clinical implications.

In the present study, we investigated the psychometric properties of such a measure—a self-report version of the Parental Thoughts and Behaviors Checklist (PTBC). Via an online survey platform, 488 women who had given birth during the last year completed the PTBC along with measures of general obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, parental stress and quality of life. Scores on the PTBC and its subscales showed good to excellent internal consistency, correlated in the expected direction with the other measures in the study, and discriminated between women with and without a history of OCD. Finally, exploratory factor analyses yielded nine thematic factors of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors which largely corresponded to the themes identified by the developers of the interview-based version of the PTBC. This self-report version of the PTBC was found to possess good psychometric properties and to have a factor structure that largely overlapped with the structure of the interview-based version. Further evaluation of this version is needed, but the measure holds promise as a tool that may aid in the assessment of postpartum OCD in primary care and in psychiatric settings.

The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the reliability and validity of the internalizing subscale on the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) in assessing broadband internalizing mental health symptoms. Data were collected from clinically-referred children/youths 4 to 18 years of age between 2015 and 2016 ( N = 2536). After initial items relevant to internalizing disturbances underwent expert content validation, exploratory first-order and bifactor factor analyses and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) parameterizations were conducted to test the validity of the measurement model. The internalizing subscale demonstrated strong measurement properties for a three-factor structure (i.e., depression, anxiety, anhedonia) and MIRT analyses showed individual items had acceptable discrimination parameters across the latent continuum. A series of four competing models using confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in a separate sample of 1397 children/youth assessed in 2017 and the bifactor model showed superior fit compared to other models. Finally, concurrent validity of this measure was confirmed based on relationships with other established subscales from criterion measures. The interRAI ChYMH internalizing subscale could be used to provide useful information for triaging and prioritizing referrals for children/youths.

94,Lifetime trauma exposure among those with combat-related PTSD: Psychiatric risk among U.S. Military personnel,"Research has described the association between lifetime trauma exposure and psychiatric symptoms among various cohorts, but little is known about the effect of lifetime trauma histories on the symptom expression of active-duty military personnel diagnosed with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Active-duty soldiers ( N = 162) were diagnosed with PTSD from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Soldiers then completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Lifetime exposure to categories of trauma types and the intensity of exposure was reported on the Life Events Checklist. The number of categories of trauma that happened to them significantly predicted the severity of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, as well as a positive screen for likely depression diagnosis based on self-reported symptoms. Direct exposure to trauma explained most of the association, as witnessing trauma and hearing about trauma did not explain symptoms beyond events that happened to participants. Interpersonal traumatic events were not associated with psychiatric functioning after controlling for non-interpersonal traumatic events. Assessment of trauma history among post-9/11 service members and veterans should include the frequency and variety of lifetime trauma exposure, given the association with psychiatric functioning.

95,Risk classification for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in primary care,"There is a pressing need to identify individuals at high risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on available repeated cognitive measures in primary care. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we applied a joint latent class mixed model (JLCM) to derive a 3-class solution: low risk (72.65%), medium risk (20.41%) and high risk (6.94%). In the low-risk group, individuals with lower daily activity and ApoEε4 carriers were at greater risk of conversion from MCI to AD. In the medium-risk group, being female, single, and an ApoEε4 carrier increased risk of conversion to AD. In the high-risk group, individuals with lower education level and single individuals were at greater risk of conversion to AD. Individual dynamic prediction for conversion from MCI to AD after 10 years was derived. Accurate identification of conversion from MCI to AD contributes to earlier close monitoring, appropriate management, and targeted interventions. Thereby, it can reduce avoidable hospitalizations for the high-risk MCI population. Moreover, it can avoid expensive follow-up tests that may provoke unnecessary anxiety for low-risk individuals and their families.

96,Suicide attempts in chronically depressed individuals: What are the risk factors?,"Chronically depressed individuals have a high suicide risk. However, it is an open question whether previously observed risk factors for suicide attempts also apply to chronic depression or whether there are specific risk factors related to chronic-recurrent illness. We drew from a large group of chronically depressed individuals seeking psychotherapy to investigate demographic and psychological factors related to previous suicide attempts. Participants took part in the SCID and filled out established questionnaires. Among 368 chronically depressed individuals (68.7% women; Mage = 40.95 years), 75 participants (19.4%) reported previous suicide attempts. Men were more likely to have used violent methods. We tested the links of having attempted suicide with different variables using logistic regression analyses. Our findings corroborate previously observed risk factors (e.g. sexual abuse, personality disorders) and suggest other risk factors which could be especially relevant in chronic depression (e.g. depression severity, interpersonal problems, self-injurious behavior, and overall years of depression). Other risk factors from previous studies were not related to suicidal behavior within our sample (e.g. anxiety disorders, PTSD). Thus, mental health professionals should be aware that risk factors for suicidal behavior might vary between diagnosis groups and that chronic illness might be a risk factor in itself.

97,Can the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) differentiate treatment-resistant from non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia? A factor analytic investigation based on data from the Pattern cohort study,"Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS) and Non-Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (NTRS) may represent different subtypes of schizophrenia. However, few studies have investigated their PANSS symptom dimensions by Exploratory (EFA) or Confirmatory (CFA). Data from the present study are derived from 1429 patients of the Pattern study. TRS was defined by the use of clozapine in the previous year whereas NTRS by the use of non-clozapine antipsychotics (""by proxy""). Factors were chosen based on the Kaiser criterion and considered valid when loadings were greater than or equal to 0.5. The fit to the data was evaluated by CFA in comparison with well-established PANSS models, using fit indexes. The EFA yielded similar five-factor model in both groups: Negative, Positive, Anxiety/Depression, Cognitive and Excited. CFA showed a satisfactory, but not perfect, fit to the data, as compared with the previous PANSS factor analytic models. Despite the limitations regarding the ‘by proxy’ definition of TRS, the results of the present study show that there are no differences in the factorial structure of PANSS in patients with TRS and NTRS.

98,A systematic review of studies probing longitudinal associations between anxiety and anorexia nervosa,"The current study aimed to establish whether anxiety predicts subsequent anorexia nervosa onset and maintenance. A systematic review of longitudinal studies assessing the association between stable anxiety exposures (e.g. trait anxiety/anxiety disorder pathology) and anorexia nervosa development or maintenance was undertaken. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Seven probed the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa onset, and one assessed the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa maintenance. Individuals with anorexia nervosa were more likely to report childhood anxiety compared to healthy individuals, but whether childhood anxiety explains unique variance in anorexia nervosa development is unclear. Current evidence does not support longitudinal associations between specific anxiety disorders (independently of other anxiety disorders) and subsequent anorexia nervosa onset, however anxiety disorder diagnosis in general may predict increased anorexia nervosa risk. The single study probing the association between anxiety and anorexia nervosa maintenance did not find evidence supporting a relationship. The quality of individual studies was fair to high, however the body of evidence was of low quality. Further research that minimises bias, allowing for strong conclusions concerning longitudinal associations between anxiety and subsequent anorexia nervosa outcomes, is required to inform anorexia nervosa aetiology. This in turn may promote improved prevention and treatment.

99,Cardiopulmonary coupling analysis predicts early treatment response in depressed patients: A pilot study,"This pilot study evaluated the effect of anti-depression treatment on sleep quality and symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder, and identified cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) indices for predicting early response. Forty-one Han Chinese patients with major depressive disorder were assessed for objective sleep quality before treatment (baseline) and at 2 weeks using CPC. Subjective sleep quality and depression levels were measured at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment, using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective and subjective sleep quality, and depression symptoms, improved after treatment. Significant correlations were found between CPC variables at baseline and depression symptom improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Total sleep time at baseline significantly correlated with somnipathy score reduction at week 2. Total in-bed time at week 2 significantly correlated with reductions in anxiety/somatic symptoms and retardation score, and total HAMD-24 score at week 4. In binary logistic regression, the total in-bed time at baseline was significantly associated with treatment response. Our findings suggest that objective sleep quality measured by CPC analysis is useful for predicting treatment response to antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder.

100,Improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms following cognitive behavior therapy for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder,"Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) co-occurs frequently with other mental health conditions, adding to the burden of disease and complexity of treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for both OCD and two of its most common comorbid conditions, anxiety and depression. Therefore, treating OCD may yield secondary benefits for anxiety and depressive symptomatology. This study examined whether anxiety and/or depression symptoms declined over the course of OCD treatment and, if so, whether improvements were secondary to reductions in OCD severity, impairment, and/or global treatment response. The sample consisted of 137 youths who received 12 sessions of manualized CBT and were assessed by independent evaluators. Mixed models analysis indicated that youth-reported anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in a linear fashion over the course of CBT, however these changes were not linked to specific improvements in OCD severity or impairment but to global ratings of treatment response. Results indicate that for youth with OCD, CBT may offer benefit for secondary anxiety and depression symptoms distinct from changes in primary symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms underlying carryover in CBT techniques is important for furthering transdiagnostic and/or treatment-sequencing strategies to address co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms in pediatric OCD.

101,Psychiatric factors affecting recovery after a long term treatment program for substance use disorder,"Psychiatric comorbidity can negatively impact the course of addictions. Psychiatric features of patients who continued treatment after the first stage of an addiction program have not been sufficiently analysed. Therefore, only these patients were included in order to compare psychiatric comorbidity and clinical factors between patients who were able or not to complete a long term substance-free program. Treatment-completion status of 245 patients was systematically recorded. Addiction severity, psychiatry comorbidity, and psychological symptoms were evaluated. No significant differences were found regarding comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and the completion of the treatment. Longer treatment duration (OR: 1.22; p &lt; 0.01), higher educational level (OR: 2.37; p = 0.02), and cocaine dependence as main substance (OR: 3.68; p &lt; 0.01) were found to be related to increased likelihood in completing the treatment. Patients with higher severity of alcohol consumption (OR: 0.06; p = 0.02) and more depressive symptoms (OR: 0.95; p = 0.01) completed the treatment less frequently. Moreover, differences regarding employment problems, treatment facilities, anxiety symptoms, dysfunctional impulsivity, and mental HRQoL were found. It is concluded that comorbid psychiatric diagnoses do not determine treatment outcomes. However, therapeutic and psychological factors have a major influence on the likelihood to complete a long-term treatment program.

102,"Validation of the Social Functioning Scale: Comparison and evaluation in early psychosis, autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder","Social functioning is an important component of mental disorders for assessment and treatment. There is no recognised self-report instrument to measure social functioning across disorders where social impairment is significant. The Social Functioning Scale (SFS) has, however, been used to assess social functioning in psychotic disorders, including Schizophrenia and Early Psychosis. The current study investigated the reliability, validity and sensitivity of the SFS in Early Psychosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and neurotypical control populations. As expected, all clinical groups showed significant impairment on the total and sub-scale scores of the SFS. The SFS showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity for people diagnosed with SAD and Early Psychosis and a similar factors structure was found for these groups. Participants with ASD reported a relatively low internal consistency and poor concurrent validity, as well as a three-component solution. The SFS has also showed a good sensitivity to separate clinical populations and neurotypical controls. This study supports the use of the SFS for those with SAD and Early Psychosis. Lower internal consistency in ASD populations suggests further research in larger samples is required and that the relationship between its scales are likely different to other populations. Alternative scales or significant other reports may be required for adults with ASD.

103,The role of attachment anxiety in the relationship between childhood trauma and schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis,"Childhood trauma (CT) is a comprehensive concept encompassing experiences of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, and neglect during childhood and adolescence. Patients with schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis (SSP) display higher rates of CT than healthy controls. Among the potential mediators of this association, insecure attachment has gained attention and empirical validation. The present study aimed to extend existing knowledge on this field by exploring the role of the two attachment dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, in the CT-SSP association. A clinical sample of 63 SSP inpatients was compared to a healthy control group on CT and attachment style measures. Correlations between CT, attachment dimensions and psychopathology were sought. Mediation analyses were also performed to examine whether attachment anxiety and/or attachment avoidance mediated the CT-SSP association. Patients displayed higher rates of CT and insecure attachment than controls. Attachment anxiety and severity of Mother Antipathy were linked to severity of hallucinations. Attachment anxiety was recognized as the sole mediator of the CT-SSP association. Our findings suggest that individuals with severe CT and increased attachment anxiety represent a risk population warranting early clinical attention, regular monitoring and tailored therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the psychological impact of trauma.

104,Fear reactivity to head-mounted display perceptual illusion challenges is associated with suicidality,"Suicide remains a public health concern with suicide rates showing a consistent increase over the last 20 years. Recent studies have found a relationship between anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the fear of anxiety related symptoms) and suicidality. Specifically, a relationship has been found between anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC) and suicidality. The knowledge around this relationship, however, has relied mostly on self-report measures. This study seeks to expand on the current literature by exploring the association between ASCC and suicidality, through the use of head-mounted display perceptual illusion challenges (e.g., using tactile sensations and mannequins to create illusions that the participant has switched bodies). A head-mounted display was used to elicit symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization) related to ASCC in a sample of undergraduate students ( N = 54). Suicidality and depression were measured by the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms-2 (IDAS-II), anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), and distress by the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Findings indicated that suicidality was associated with self-reported ASCC as well as the fear generated from the challenges. Furthermore, our results found that challenge-induced fear predicted suicidality scores above and beyond the traditional self-report measures of ASCC. The small sample size and low suicide risk of the current sample limits generalizations to more severe populations.

105,Social anxiety as a precursor for depression: Influence of interpersonal rejection and attention to emotional stimuli,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are comorbid conditions, and SAD confers risk for MDD. Biased attention and interpersonal rejection are important for the development of SAD and MDD, but little research has examined how these processes may lead to MDD. We hypothesized that interpersonal rejection would result in SAD symptoms being associated with more “depression-like” attention biases. Participants ( n = 164) completed a measure of SAD symptoms and an eye tracking task before and after a task in which they were randomized to be socially included or rejected. SAD symptoms, inclusion or rejection condition, and the interaction term were entered into separate hierarchical linear regressions predicting change in attention for five emotional faces. Rejection condition significantly moderated the effects of SAD on change in attention to sad, happy, and neutral faces. SAD predicted increased attention to sad faces and decreased attention to happy faces in the rejection condition, but not in the inclusion condition. SAD predicted increased attention to neutral faces in the inclusion condition, but not in the rejection condition. There were no significant effects for angry or disgust. Results suggest that SAD symptoms are associated with more depression-like attention biases in the context of interpersonal rejection.

106,"Childhood temperament is associated with distress, anxiety and reduced quality of life in schizophrenia spectrum disorders","Schizophrenia is conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder and pre-morbid differences in social function and cognition have been well-established. Less is known about pre-morbid temperament and personality. Inhibited temperament—the predisposition to respond to novelty with wariness, fear, or caution—is a premorbid risk factor for anxiety, depression, and substance use but is understudied in schizophrenia. Participants were patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders ( n = 166) and healthy controls ( n = 180). Patients completed measures of childhood inhibited temperament, clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, PANSS factors), and quality of life. Patients had significantly higher levels of inhibited temperament relative to healthy controls. In patients with schizophrenia, higher inhibited temperament was significantly associated with co-morbid anxiety disorders, greater anxiety and depression symptoms, higher PANSS Distress scores, lower PANSS Excitement scores, and lower quality of life. The current findings replicate and extend previous research with a larger sample and are consistent with vulnerability in an affective path to psychosis. In schizophrenia, higher inhibited temperament was associated with a cluster of mood and anxiety symptoms. Inhibited temperament was not associated with psychosis symptoms. Patients with high inhibited temperament may especially benefit from treatments that specifically target anxiety and depression.

107,Types of problematic smartphone use based on psychiatric symptoms,"To provide appropriate solutions for problematic smartphone use, we need to first understand its types. This study aimed to identify types of problematic smartphone use based on psychiatric symptoms, using the decision tree method. We recruited 5,372 smartphone users from online surveys conducted between February 3 and February 22, 2016. Based on scores on the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale for Adults (S-Scale), 974 smartphone users were assigned to the smartphone-dependent group and 4398 users were assigned to the normal group. The data-mining technique of C5.0 decision tree was applied. We used 15 input variables, including demographic and psychological factors. Four psychiatric variables emerged as the most important predictors: self-control (Sc; 66%), anxiety (Anx; 25%), depression (Dep; 7%), and dysfunctional impulsivities (Imp; 3%). We identified the following five types of problematic smartphone use: (1) non-comorbid, (2) self-control, (3) Sc + Anx, (4) Sc + Anx + Dep, and (5) Sc + Anx + Dep + Imp. We found that 74% of smartphone-dependent users had psychiatric symptoms. The ratio of participants belonging to the non-comorbid and self-control types was 64%. We proposed that these types of problematic smartphone use may be used for the development of an appropriate service for controlling and preventing such behaviors in adults.

108,"Anxiety symptoms across twenty-years in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder","Anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are common in both mood and psychotic disorders. However, limited comparative information exists regarding the long-term course of anxiety in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Prospective evaluation of the 20-year trajectory of self-reported anxiety and somatic-related anxiety in three major diagnostic groups, 43 schizoaffective patients, 47 bipolar patients, and 109 major depression patients was conducted. The patients were recruited at an index phase of hospitalization, and then reassessed longitudinally at six subsequent follow-ups over 20-years. The sample was well characterized with symptom, recovery and functioning data being available. This study found that in the earlier years of illness, self-reported anxiety was greater in schizoaffective and major depression patients than bipolar patients. The three groups were similar for anxiety symptoms during the 20-year course of their illness. Last, we found in all patients, self-reported anxiety in the early years predicted having a period of recovery and lower global functioning in the future. Our data provides unique information regarding the comparative course of anxiety in related mood and psychotic disorders. Both clinicians and researchers should focus on assessing, diagnosing, and treating anxiety in mood and psychotic disorders, as a means to improve outcomes and quality of life in these individuals.

109,Childhood sexual abuse as a potential predictor of psychotic like experiences in Tunisian college students,"Background: Current research has shown that experiencing childhood trauma may predispose individuals for psychosis and expression of Psychotic like experiences (PLEs). We aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of PLEs and depressive and negative experiences in a sample of Tunisian college students, and to evaluate the impact of childhood traumas in the occurrence and severity of these experiences at the time of the survey. Method: A total of 482 college students (63.7% female; aged 18–32) participated in a cross-sectional survey. The Positive Subscale of Community Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (CAPE) was used to measure PLEs. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess childhood trauma and neglect. Results: 53.5% ( n = 258) of the students reported at least one positive PLE ‘nearly always’, and 40.9% ( n = 197) reported at least one negative PLE with this frequency. After controlling for demographic variables (gender, age) and psychosocial factors (drug use, depression, anxiety and stress), sexual abuse significantly contributed to PLEs. Conclusion: There is a need for further cross-cultural research regarding the phenotypal expression of PLEs and its associated variables. Child sexual abuse victims should receive systematic and complete psychological screening during their adolescence/ early adulthood including, among others, PLEs and psychotic symptoms.

110,A pilot randomized trial of a dual n-back emotional working memory training program for veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms,"Anxiety is characterized by excessive attention to threatening information, leading to impaired working memory (WM) performance and elevated anxious thoughts. Preliminary research indicates that individuals with PTSD show particular difficulty with WM in emotional contexts (Schweizer et al., 2011). Although several studies show that computerized training can improve WM capacity for anxious individuals (Owens et al., 2013; Schweizer et al., 2011; 2013), there has been very little research on WM training for PTSD or with Veterans (Saunders et al., 2015). In a pilot randomized trial, we assigned Veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms to an online emotional WM training, either adaptive ( n -back; n = 11) or a less potent training (1-back; n = 10). Overall, both groups showed significant decreases in PTSD symptoms. The n-back group showed a trend of outperforming the 1-back group in improving reexperiencing symptoms (which are likely to be associated with impaired WM functioning). This population anecdotally found the intervention quite challenging, which may be why even the less potent 1-back was still helpful. These preliminary findings justify the effort for developing new WM-focused PTSD intervention for complex, vulnerable populations, particularly as online training can improve accessibility.

111,Mental health in spouses of U.S. Gulf War veterans,"Veterans’ spouses are at risk for mental distress and substance use. We examined long term psychological functioning in spouses from a national cohort of 1991 Gulf War era veterans. From clinical interviews, spouses of deployed veterans ( n = 488) did not have a greater prevalence of post-war mental disorders compared to spouses of non-deployed veterans ( n = 536); however, in couples that were living together since the war, there was an increased risk of anxiety disorders or any one disorder. On questionnaires, the impact varied but was most consistently observed in more severe depression and greater functional impairment in spouses of deployed compared to non-deployed veterans. If a veteran developed post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, the matched spouse was more likely to develop post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, respectively. Veteran combat exposure did not similarly increase the risk of spouse post-war mental disorders. Greater spouse self-reported symptomatology was observed in spouses of veterans with anxious/depressive disorders even when controlling for deployment. In summary, the war conferred greater risk for spouse mental disorders and distress for spouses of veterans with mental health disorders, with some increased risk for spouses of deployed veterans, especially in couples together since the war.

112,Impairment in planning tasks of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders,"Anxiety disorders are associated with poor neuropsychological performance in attention and memory. However, little is known about the impact of these difficulties on other cognitive functions, such as planning. The ability to plan, including attention, working memory and set-shifting components, can be assessed by the Tower of Hanoi task (ToH). This study evaluated seventy-one participants, aged from 7–17 years. Thirty-seven subjects met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety disorder and 34 individuals comprised the controls. The neuropsychological tests used were: the ToH, a problem-solving task, involves planning ability and other executive functions (working memory, attentional control and cognitive flexibility); for the assessment of processing speed and problem-solving, the Vocabulary/Matrix Reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence was used to measure for estimated-IQ in both groups. The groups were compared with a generalized linear model controlling for age, IQ and ADHD comorbidity. Compared with controls, anxiety disorders subjects made more errors and required more time to complete the ToH. Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders have poorer planning ability compared to subjects without anxiety disorders, and the difficulty in planning is affected by interference from other cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility and problems-solutions.

113,The role of excessive reassurance seeking: An eye tracking study of the indirect effect of social anxiety symptoms on attention bias,"High social anxiety is associated with increased attentional bias, and difficulties disengaging from relevant threat information, though social anxiety may also be associated with avoidance of threat. Few mechanisms of this relationship have been empirically evaluated, whereas theories and treatment manuals implicate avoidance and/or safety behaviors as significant agents of negative reinforcement for anxiety symptoms and search for threat. The current study sought to investigate one safety behavior, excessive reassurance seeking, as a mediator of the relationship between social anxiety and attention bias to disgust facial stimuli. Support was found for our hypotheses, such that social anxiety symptoms had an indirect effect on attention bias to disgust faces through increased reassurance seeking. These results suggest that reassurance seeking may result in disengagement of attention to threat stimuli. Specifically, social anxiety may result in a decreased threshold for negative social cues and therefore seek out reassurance feedback and avoid threatening stimuli. Future studies should test these directly and utilize a prospective design. The current study suggests that reassurance seeking may be involved in the attention bias process, providing additional data for current cognitive theories of social anxiety and additional support for reinforcement patterns of anxiety symptoms.

This complexity has hardened the task to find an adapted treatment for these patients. Consequently, several instruments, known as depression anxiety scales, have been developed and are now used internationally by physicians to determine the diagnosis of anxiety and depression and treat the patients accordingly. This study aims at testing the consistency and reliability of one of the main anxiety and depression scale which is composed of 14 items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We have used explanatory factor analysis (EFA) and factor extraction by principal component analysis (PCA) with orthogonal varimax (Kaiser Normalization) rotation on a cohort of 9706 French depressed patients. The relevance of the 14 items included in the HADS was also scrutinized by measuring the internal consistency and reliability of the global HADS removing each item one by one. Our conclusion is that the HADS could potentially gain in consistency in the detection of anxiety, notably through the revision of two of the anxiety items.

115,Reducing burnout and anxiety among doctors: Randomized controlled trial,"Prevalence studies show high levels of burnout, anxiety, fatigue and other symptoms of distress among medical doctors. However, there are very few randomized controlled trials testing interventions against these problems. This randomized controlled trial (NCT02838290; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) tested interventions teaching 227 doctors about the psychology of burnout, stress, coping with patient death, and managing distress, as well as giving them information about prevalence rates among doctors. Primary outcomes included burnout, anxiety, insomnia, grief, alcohol/drug use, binge eating, physical symptoms, and psychiatric morbidity. The outcomes were tested before and after the interventions with a 7-day time-lag. The intervention significantly decreased doctors’ levels of burnout (e.g. emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) and anxiety. Doctors in the control group had no significant changes in these signs of distress. The intervention did not significantly reduce other health and habit-related outcomes potentially because these need a longer time-lag than 7 days. Interventions teaching doctors about the psychology of work-related distress reduce burnout and anxiety by helping doctors realize that distress is a normal, human reaction to external stressors, common in medicine, and solvable by learning about psychological coping strategies.

Post hoc testing showed that, compared to the control group, the CBT-I group showed significant reductions in ISI and PSQI at both week 4 and week 8. For the PSYRATS, ASI, and BDI scores, the CBT-I and control groups showed significant time-group interactions, but post hoc testing revealed no significant group differences at either week 4 or week 8. Therefore, CBT-I was effective for reducing insomnia symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and the effect lasted for 4 weeks after the intervention.

117,The Revised Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) as an ultra-brief screening measure of bidimensional mental health in children and adolescents,"The Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) is a brief, valid, and reliable international instrument for assessing mental health in adults. The aim of the present study is to examine the psychometric properties of the MHI-5 in children and adolescents. A sample of 595 students (10–15 years old) completed the MHI-5 Spanish version adapted for this study, as well as another measure of anxiety and depression symptoms, and a clinical interview as a gold standard. The overall coefficient obtained indicate good internal consistency. A unique factor solution explaining a 53.70% and a two-factor structure explaining 69.20% of the total variance were obtained. The correlations with total and subscale scores of anxiety and depression were significant. A ROC analysis showed good properties as a screening test to predict anxiety and depressive diagnoses in children and adolescents. The Revised MHI-5 presents two essential changes: a simplified 4-point response format and a new factor solution including distress and well-being. These outcomes show that the Revised MHI-5 is a brief, valid, and reliable measure to bidimensionally assess mental health and screening emotional disorders in children and adolescents.

118,"Mental health and quality of life of Brazilian medical students: Incidence, prevalence, and associated factors within two years of follow-up","Medical students’ mental health and quality of life (QoL) cause growing concern worldwide, but, to date, few longitudinal studies have followed these students. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence, prevalence, and factors associated with quality of life and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of Brazilian medical students who were followed for a period of two years. Students’ mental health (DASS-21), QoL (WHOQOL-Bref), and religiousness (DUREL) were evaluated in four different waves(four semesters). A total of 312 (54.2%) medical students responded to all four waves. Medical students demonstrated a high prevalence and incidence of emotional disorders. Almost half of the students presented high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the two-year follow-up; approximately one out of five students without symptoms at the baseline were considered new cases and these problems have a cyclical nature. Baseline factors such as depression, anxiety, stress, having low income, being female, being in the early stages of medical training and non-white were associated with poorer mental health and quality of life in the follow-up. Our results show that medical students have a high prevalence and incidence of mental health disorders during their medical training. This data may help educators plan preventive strategies.

119,Evaluation of the Social Phobia Scale and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale as assessments of performance and interaction anxiety,"The DSM-5 classification of performance anxiety as distinct from social anxiety underlines the need for specific measurement instruments. The Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) are widely used assessments of performance and general interaction anxiety, yet few studies have examined their criterion validity using actual performance and interaction stressors. The current study is the first to assess the scales’ convergent and discriminant validity using multimodal anxiety indices including psychophysiological reactivity, which is a key characterizing feature of performance anxiety. Ninety-three individuals completed the SPS and SIAS and participated in performance and interaction challenges. Anxiety response was assessed with criterion measures of self-reported anxiety, observer-rated anxiety, heart rate and skin conductance. Both scales were moderately correlated with self-report and observer-rated anxiety ( r ’s = 0.21–0.62) and weakly correlated with physiological measures ( r ’s = 0.07–0.35), generally supporting convergent criterion validity. Discriminant criterion validity was not supported, however, with the SIAS and SPS showing similar correlations with each criterion measure for both social challenges. These findings suggest the SIAS and SPS are valid instruments for the assessment of social anxiety but may not be suitable for the specific measurement of performance and interaction anxiety.

120,"Pathways among sleep onset latency, relationship functioning, and negative affect differentiate patients with suicide attempt history from patients with suicidal ideation","Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and poor relationship functioning often co-occur with the confluence of these factors contributing to greater suicide risk. This study investigated whether the pathways between depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and relationship functioning differentiated patients with suicide attempt history from those with suicidal ideation history. Patients seeking partial hospital treatment for severe psychiatric symptoms ( N = 180) completed interviews assessing psychiatric and suicidal symptom histories, and self-report measures of sleep behaviors, anxiety, depression, and relationship functioning. Multiple sleep behaviors were examined: duration, sleep onset latency, and bedtime. Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation and moderated mediation analyses with suicide attempt as the moderator were used to evaluate pathways between variables. Among patients with ideation and attempt history, (1) sleep onset latency significantly mediated the association between depression and relationship functioning and that between anxiety and relationship functioning; (2) relationship functioning significantly mediated the association between depression and sleep onset latency and that between anxiety and sleep onset latency. These pathways were not significant among patients with suicidal ideation only. No other sleep behaviors were related to study variables. The reciprocal relationship between disrupted sleep onset latency and poor relationship functioning was specifically linked to more severe psychiatric symptoms among acute patients with suicide attempt histories.

121,Psychiatric disorders’ paradoxical protective effect on cardiovascular procedures and mortality,"Comments on an article by E. C. Pino et al. (see record 2018-14130-001). The recent study by Pino et al. is a thought-provoking study examining psychiatric comorbidity among patients with acute coronary artery disease. The authors demonstrated an interesting paradox where patients with a depression and/or anxiety diagnosis at the time of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have lower odds of revascularization (the primary treatment for STEMI) and in-hospital mortality. As the authors have noted, this is in direct contrast to majority of the previous literature which have shown that these comorbidities are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Few additional analyses may be helpful in disentangling this interesting finding.

122,"Body dysmorphic disorder and its relationship to sexuality, impulsivity, and addiction","This study sought to examine the prevalence of probable body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in a university sample and its associated physical and mental health correlates. A 156-item anonymous online survey was distributed via email to a randomly chosen subset of 10,000 university students, at a large public university. The survey queried current use of alcohol and drugs, psychological and physical status, academic performance, sexual behaviors, and questionnaire-based measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. A total of 3,459 participants (59.1% female) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of BDD was 1.7% ( n = 59). Compared to students without BDD, those with BDD were significantly more likely to endorse symptoms of compulsive sexual behavior, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Questionnaire-based measures revealed higher levels of both compulsivity and impulsivity associated with BDD. BDD appears to be common in young adults, and is associated with specific mental health comorbidities, as well as both impulsive and compulsive traits. Clinicians should be aware of the presentation of BDD and screen for it in primary care and mental health settings.

123,Dysmorphic concern in anorexia nervosa: Implications for recovery,"Body image disturbance (‘dysmorphic concern’) is a key diagnostic criterion for anorexia nervosa (AN). While dysmorphic concern has been described as a relapse predictor, relatively little is understood about the prevalence in AN, and the consequences upon wellbeing. The present study examined the rates of dysmorphic concern in a sample of treatment-seeking adults with AN ( N = 39), and explored the associations with general mental health, disability and eating disorder symptoms. The majority of participants (61.5%) had clinically significant levels of dysmorphic concern. Furthermore, higher dysmorphic concern scores were associated with increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. There was also a trend towards associations between dysmorphic concern and age of onset and stages of change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance), although replication is required. These findings suggest that strategies which specifically address body image distortions should be a key feature of treatment for anorexia nervosa to support long-term recovery and wellbeing.

124,Intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm predict nocturnal panic attacks,"Nocturnal panic involves waking suddenly from sleep in a state of panic, with no apparent cause, and affects more than half of patients with panic disorder. The Fear of Loss of Vigilance theory is the only proposed model for nocturnal panic, suggesting nocturnal panickers fear states in which they are unable to react to danger or protect themselves from threats. Prior work using a self-report questionnaire designed to test the theory (i.e., Fear of Loss of Vigilance Questionnaire; FLOVQ) was unsuccessful at differentiating nocturnal from daytime panickers. This study tested the theory using alternative measures to the FLOVQ. We predicted nocturnal panickers would show elevated responses to measures assessing fears of being unable to respond to or protect themselves from threats. A diverse community sample ( N = 218) completed self-report measures related to panic attacks, intolerance of uncertainty, responsibility for harm, and anxiety sensitivity dimensions. Nocturnal panickers endorsed greater inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm, but not prospective intolerance of uncertainty, or anxiety sensitivity physical or cognitive concerns. This study provides support for the fear of loss of vigilance theory and suggests intolerance of uncertainty and responsibility for harm reduction be targeted in treatment for nocturnal panic attacks.

125,Sorrow shared is halved? War trauma experienced by others and mental health among Darfuri asylum seekers,"Research suggests that the ethnic community plays a major role in the mental health of traumatized refugees arriving from collective societies. This study explored the relationships between war-related trauma and mental health separately for direct trauma exposure (i.e., events directly endorsed by asylum-seekers) and indirect trauma exposure (i.e., events endorsed by family, friends and other community members). Data for 300 Darfuri asylum-seekers living in Israel were obtained in a cross-sectional design. Hierarchical regressions were used to examine how direct versus indirect trauma exposure were associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychological well-being. Results showed that direct trauma exposure was associated with worse mental health symptoms and reduced well-being. In contrast, indirect trauma exposure to similar events of others was linked with fewer PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms and improved well-being. These findings offer preliminary insights into the nature of trauma and mental health in asylum-seekers from collective cultures: While trauma directly experienced by the individual is associated with increased risk for poor mental health; exposure to others’ similar experiences may be associated with reduced emotional distress. Findings are discussed in terms of their potential implications for culturally sensitive assessment and group therapy in refugees.

126,Latent typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in U.S. military veterans,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition that can be characterized by unique typologies of symptoms. To date, no study has examined predominant PTSD typologies using DSM-5 criteria. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in 158 U.S. veterans who screened positive for this condition. A three-class solution provided the best fit to the data, described as Dysphoric (36.2%), High Symptom (34.0%) and Threat (29.8%). The Threat class had higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance compared to the Dysphoric class; the Dysphoric class had higher probabilities of negative affect, anhedonia and externalizing behavior relative to Threat; the High Symptom class had high probabilities of all symptoms. Compared to the Threat class, the Dysphoric class was more likely to have a lifetime history of major depressive, alcohol and drug use disorders; the High Symptom class was more likely to have a lifetime history of alcohol, drug, and nicotine use disorder, current generalized anxiety, or to have attempted or currently contemplated suicide. The High Symptom class reported greater mental, physical and cognitive impairment and lower quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of a personalized approach to the assessment and treatment of DSM-5 PTSD.

127,Low total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein associated with aggression and hostility in recent suicide attempters,"Low cholesterol levels have been correlated with both suicidal and aggressive behavior in psychiatric patients. Few studies have investigated associations between serum lipid profiles and both aggressive state and trait. Fifty-two psychiatric medication-free inpatients were included in this study after a suicide attempt. Composite scores of “State Aggression” and “Trait Aggression” were calculated using relevant items from the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale and the Karolinska Scales of Personality. State Aggression was significantly and negatively correlated with total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Trait Aggression was also significantly and negatively correlated with LDL, but not TC. There were small but significant mediation effects of severity of anxiety symptoms on the relationship between State Aggression and TC as well as LDL. In exploratory analyses we found that low cholesterol was also associated with personality traits of hostility. Moreover, low cholesterol was more robustly associated with personality trait items related to interpersonal aggression, as opposed to items related to irritability or more indirect, non-overt aggression. Our findings suggest that low cholesterol is associated with both state and trait aggression in suicide attempters. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to better understand the relationship between low cholesterol and high aggression in suicide attempters.

Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (2007–2010) were analyzed. Associations between SB levels and the correlates were examined using multivariable linear and logistic regressions. Out of 42,469 individuals aged ≥ 18 years, there were 2630 participants with anxiety (47.6 ± 16.5 years; 66.6% female). Correlates significantly associated with being sedentary ≥ 8 h/day were being male, older age, a lower income, never married (vs. married/cohabiting), being unemployed, poor self-related health, alcohol consumption, and less social cohesion (highest quartile vs. lowest). Disability and bodily pain were associated with more time spent (min/day) sedentary. Future intervention research should target the risk groups based on identified sociodemographic correlates. Also, whether the promotion of social cohesion increases the efficacy of public health initiatives should be examined with prospective data.

129,"Addicted to Facebook? Relationship between Facebook Addiction Disorder, duration of Facebook use and narcissism in an inpatient sample","The present study explored the Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) in an inpatient sample in Germany. Of the 112 Facebook users (71.4% women; age(years): M ( SD ) = 49.43 (9.17)), who were patients of a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic with affective disorders and anxiety disorders as most common diagnoses, 28.6% reached the critical polythetic cutoff score of FAD, 0.9% researched the critical monothetic cutoff score, and 86.6% had enhanced values of withdrawal symptoms due to Facebook use. The mean level of FAD was significantly higher in inpatients with week depression than in inpatients with moderate depression. In the whole sample, FAD was significantly positively linked to duration of Facebook use and the personality trait narcissism. Present results provide first evidence of FAD in a non-student inpatient sample. They contribute to the understanding of the development of FAD and demonstrate that addictive Facebook use may impact persons who suffer from mental disorders, especially when they have enhanced levels of the personality trait narcissism. Practical applications for research and clinical treatment, as well as limitations of present results are discussed.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study population-based, involving 1037 people aged 18–35. MDD, BD, anxiety and suicide risk were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Serum IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA using a commercial kit. Results: The total sample comprised 1034 young adults, being 14.4% with MDD and 13.7% with BD. MDD and BD groups showed significantly higher serum IL-6 levels ( p ≤ 0.001) and IL-10 levels ( p ≤ 0.001) when compared to healthy control group. No correlation was found between serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels in health control group ( p = 0.830; r = − 0.008), non-suicide risk ( p = 0.337; r = 0.032) and non-anxiety disorder ( p = 0.375; r = 0.031). Covariance analysis showed that mood disorders alone, increase both interleukin levels (IL-6, p = 0.019; and IL-10, p = 0.026), whilst the interaction of mood disorders and suicide risk or anxiety disorders did not. Conclusion: Our results suggest that inflammatory dysregulation may be involved in the physiopathology of mood disorders and serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are putative biomarkers for these disorders.

131,Increased psychiatric symptoms in university students with autism spectrum disorder are associated with reduced adaptive behavior,"High variability in adaptive behavior in cognitively-able adults with autism spectrum disorder has been previously reported, and may be caused by the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in this population. This study's goals were to examine self-reported psychiatric symptoms in students with ASD, and to identify their relative contribution to the variance in adaptive behaviors. The study population included 95 students: 55 diagnosed with ASD (4 females; age range 18–34) who participated in a university integration program (ASD group), and 40 regularly matriculated students (non-ASD group, 7 females; age range 20–36). The ASD group showed a lower adaptive skill level than the non-ASD group as measured by the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (GAC-ABAS). Significantly higher scores for the ASD group were found for social anxiety, trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression symptoms. The level of adaptive skills correlated negatively and significantly with the severity of social anxiety symptoms in both groups and with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only in the ASD group. Additionally, in a regression model, significant contributions of having an ASD diagnosis and severity of social anxiety explained 41.7% of the variance in adaptive skills. Adequate evaluation and treatment, if needed, are recommended in this population.

132,An examination of the association between anxiety and social functioning in youth with ADHD: A systematic review,"Although up to 50% of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) meet criteria for an anxiety disorder, it is unclear how comorbid anxiety influences social functioning for this population. Understanding the factors associated with social functioning in ADHD is important given the limited efficacy of existing social skills interventions for this population. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between anxiety and social functioning (social problems, peer status, and social skills/ competence) in children and adolescents with ADHD. A standardised search protocol was used, identifying 4807 articles for screening with 31 included in the final review. Anxiety symptom severity was associated with lower levels of social skills and higher levels of social problems in young people with ADHD. However, few differences emerged when defining anxiety based on diagnostic measures. Although the results varied considerably amongst studies, a number of key variables emerged that influenced the associations between anxiety and social functioning including the type of reporter and sample characteristics such as age, sex, ADHD subtype and other mental health comorbidities. These findings have implications for social functioning interventions in ADHD given the role of anxiety symptoms in predicting poorer social functioning.

133,Interactive effect of sleep duration and physical activity on anxiety/depression in adolescents,"Although effects of sleep duration and physical activity (PA) have been demonstrated on mental health in adolescents, their interactive effect has not been studied. This cross-sectional study first examines this interactive effect on anxiety/depression in adolescents. A total of 983 Japanese students aged 12—17 were studied, using a self-report questionnaire. The interaction of sleep duration and amount of PA and their main effects on anxiety/depression, assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), were investigated employing multiple regression, adjusting for grade and sex. Sleep duration and amount of PA were classified as being adequate or not, according to the duration and amount recommended by the National Sleep Foundation and World Health Organization, respectively. As a result, the interaction between sleep duration and amount of PA and their main effects were statistically significant. GHQ-12 score was significantly better in adolescents with either adequate sleep or adequate PA, not both, than those with neither adequate sleep nor adequate PA. The score, however, seemed no further improved in those with both adequate sleep and PA. The present study suggests that effects of sleep and PA on mental health need to be studied with consideration to their interaction.

134,Coping resources and stress reactions among Bedouin Arab adolescents during three military operations,"This study aimed to examine coping resources (sense of coherence and hope) and stress reactions among Bedouin Arab adolescents in southern Israel during three periods of escalated political violence. Two main questions were examined: 1) Did adolescents report different coping resources and levels of stress reactions during these three different periods? 2) Were there any differences in the pattern of the associations between coping resources and stress reactions across those periods? Data were gathered from 81, 91, and 192 Bedouin Arab adolescents, who were 14–18 years old, during three periods. Participants completed self-report questionnaires including the sense of coherence (SOC) scale, a hope index, a measure or state anxiety and state anger, a measure of psychological distress, and a demographic questionnaire. Across the three periods, differences were observed in both coping resources and levels of stress reactions. Over time, SOC was found to be a significant predictor of those stress reactions; whereas the association between hope components and stress reactions weakened over time. These findings support the hypothesis that SOC is a significant component of coping with stressful political events and emphasize the importance of addressing differences in the roles of personal resources over time and transition processes.

135,Attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition predict depression maintenance,"Insecure attachment cognitions, emotion recognition biases, and their interaction are important contributors to depression susceptibility. The present study, with a prospective longitudinal design, investigated the role of negative emotion recognition in moderating the linkage from insecure attachment cognitions to elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 96 depression-prone individuals completed measures for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, depression symptom severity, and a computerized facial and prosodic emotion recognition task twice with a four-week interval. Results revealed that the interaction between attachment avoidance and fearful prosodic emotion recognition significantly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. More specifically, greater attachment avoidance with lower accuracy of fearful prosodic emotions at baseline predicted an increase of depressive symptoms over four-week interval. However, no moderating role of emotion recognition in the linkage from attachment anxiety to depression persistence was noted. The present study demonstrates that attachment avoidance and negative emotion recognition may together contribute to the maintenance of depression. The findings may be pertinent to attachment avoidance-related deactivating strategy that appears to be a specific cultural forbearance way for emotion regulation in collectivistic societies. Potential applications and future research are then suggested.

137,An epidemiological study on the prevalence of hallucinations in a general-population sample: Effects of age and sensory modality,"Epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that a significant minority of the general population have experienced hallucinations, however, a potential effect of age on the prevalence of hallucinations in the general population has never been previously examined in a specific study. The aim of the present study was thus to examine the effects of age and sensory modality on hallucination prevalence in a general population sample. A large, randomly selected and representative sample of the Norwegian population completed measures assessing different hallucination modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile) and types (sensed presence and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations). Three age groups were identified and compared: young (19–30 years), middle (31–60) and old (61–96). There was a significant main-effect of age for all hallucination modalities and types, whereby hallucination prevalence significantly decreased with age. We also found that anxiety partially mediated the effect of age on hallucinations whilst depression was a partial suppressor. Concerning the co-occurrence of hallucination modalities, there was very little co-occurrence of auditory and visual hallucinations in all three age groups. In summary, a main-effect of age for hallucination prevalence was observed. Furthermore, individuals reported a more diverse variety of hallucination modalities compared to what is commonly reported in clinical populations.

The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is a self-report scale used to measure GAD symptoms and has been validated in adult populations, but the measure's psychometric properties regarding adolescents are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability, factorial validity, and construct validity of the GAD-7 in adolescents in a nationally representative sample from a general population. Our study was based on Finnish survey data on 111,171 adolescents aged 14–18 years. Our results show that the GAD-7 demonstrates good psychometric properties in adolescents. The internal consistency of the GAD-7 was good (Cronbach's α = 0.91) and the instrument's unidimensional factor structure was supported. The associations of GAD-7 sum scores with self-report measures of depression and social anxiety supported construct validity. The psychometric properties of the GAD-7 in this sample of adolescents were similar to those reported among adults. However, studies in which diagnostic interviews are performed are needed to demonstrate the diagnostic efficacy of the measure in this age group.

This study compared the effectiveness of PA and LPP on personality and social functioning during a 10-year follow-up from the beginning of the treatments. The eligible patients, 41 self-selected for PA and 128 assigned to LPP, were 20–45 years of age and had anxiety or mood disorder. Outcomes were analyzed using ten standard measures of personality and social functioning, carried out 5–9 times during the follow-up. Different change patterns by time in PA and LPP emerged, suggesting less benefit of PA during the first years of follow-up and more benefit in most outcomes thereafter. Greater post-treatment improvement in PA than in LPP was seen up to 1–2 years after PA had ended in more mature defense style (DSQ), level of personality organization (LPO), more positive self-concept (SASB), more improved social adjustment (SAS-SR) and sense of coherence (SOC). However, at the 10-year follow-up the differences were non-significant. In conclusion, PA may give some additional benefits when long-term aims are linked to personality and social functioning. The relatively small differences and higher costs in comparison to LPP may restrict the feasibility of PA.

Increasingly, reports suggest that poor air quality may be associated with mental health problems, but these studies often use global measures and rarely focus on early development when psychopathology commonly emerges. To address this, we combined high-resolution air pollution exposure estimates and prospectively-collected phenotypic data to explore concurrent and longitudinal associations between air pollutants of major concern in urban areas and mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. Exploratory analyses were conducted on 284 London-based children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. Exposure to annualized PM 2.5 and NO₂ concentrations was estimated at address-level when children were aged 12. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder were assessed at ages 12 and 18. Psychiatric diagnoses were ascertained from interviews with the participants at age 18. We found no associations between age-12 pollution exposure and concurrent mental health problems. However, age-12 pollution estimates were significantly associated with increased odds of major depressive disorder at age 18, even after controlling for common risk factors. This study demonstrates the potential utility of incorporating high-resolution pollution estimates into large epidemiological cohorts to robustly investigate associations between air pollution and youth mental health.

This study examined ANS and HPA-axis response to a laboratory stressor in healthy child offspring of parents with ( n = 55) and without ( n = 98) a history of AD. High frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was assessed during sitting and standing baseline conditions and during a speech task where participants remained standing. Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-speech. Subjective anxiety was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Children of parents with AD displayed reduced HRV and a blunted cortisol response to the speech task compared to children of non-anxious parents. No risk group effect was found for anxiety ratings. These preliminary data suggest that healthy children of anxious parents exhibit altered stress reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor. Further research is needed to confirm findings and identify mechanisms that may account for altered self-regulation processes to a stressor in children at familial risk for AD.

142,"An exploration of the associations among positivity, general distress and internet addiction: The mediating effect of general distress","The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between positivity and general distress (including depression, anxiety, stress) and internet addiction and the mediating effects of general distress. The theoretical model was examined with 392 volunteers who were university students. Participants filled out the Positivity Scale (POS), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) and Short Form of Young's Internet Addiction Test (YIAT-SF). The results revealed that there were significant associations among positivity, general distress and internet addiction. According to the results of mediation analysis using structural equation modelling and bootstrapping, depression fully mediated the positivity-internet addiction relationship, whilst anxiety and stress partially mediated it. Bootstrap analysis indicated that positivity exerted a significant indirect effect on internet addiction through depression. Overall, the results implied the potential therapeutic effect of positivity which leads to a direct decrease in general distress and an indirect decrease in internet addiction through general distress. In addition, internet addiction may be considered as a secondary problem rather than a primary disorder. The results provide opportunities to design psychological interventions focused on improving positivity which may lead to a decrease in general distress which involves a mechanism preventing individuals from applying a positive reinforcement process.

143,The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder: Does comorbid anxiety disorder affect inflammatory response?,"Recent adult etiologic studies indicated evidence linking increased inflammatory parameters with psychiatric disorders. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio are easily obtainable clinical markers of inflammation and have been found to be increased in various medical and mental disorders. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Secondarily, the effect of comorbid anxiety disorder with OCD on the inflammatory response was investigated. Sixty drug-naïve adolescents with OCD aged 12 to 18 years were enrolled in the patient group. Twenty-three of the OCD group had comorbid anxiety disorder (AD) and 37 had no comorbidities. One hundred twenty-eight adolescents in the same age range with no psychiatric disorders were recruited as the healthy control group. The severity of OCD symptoms was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. There were statistically significant differences in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, white blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts among the three groups, even after adjusting for age and sex. The adolescents with OCD and AD had the highest neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and white blood cell counts. A comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis in addition to obsessive-compulsive disorder may increase the inflammatory response.

144,Temporal trends of co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety among female maternal and non-maternal hospitalizations: Results from Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004–2013,"Perinatal depression/anxiety is considered the most underdiagnosed pregnancy complication in the US and is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. However, despite its prevalence, most women who present with depressive symptoms are not screened and do not receive adequate treatment. We examined the clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety among maternal and non-maternal hospitalizations among females aged 14–49 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2004 and 2013 ( n = 83,472,775). Meta-regression was used to determine annual change and presence of temporal trends. Survey logistic regression was used to examine the association with sociodemographic factors. Rates of diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorders demonstrated a temporal increase from 2004–2013, and this increase was mainly driven by non-maternal hospitalizations compared to maternal. Furthermore, non-maternal hospitalizations demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression and/or anxiety diagnoses compared to maternal hospitalizations over the same time period (21•7% versus 2•8%). Among all female hospitalizations, whites were roughly twice as likely as minorities to have a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. These results add to the evidence suggestive of the underdiagnosed depression/anxiety present among women of reproductive age, particularly pregnant women and minorities, and underscore the critical role of obstetricians in treating both physical and mental health.

145,Social support moderates association between posttraumatic growth and trauma-related psychopathologies among victims of the Sewol Ferry Disaster,"Disasters have numerous harmful effects on the mental health status of trauma-exposed people. We investigated the differences in the association between trauma-related psychopathologies and posttraumatic growth according to the perceived social support level among victims of the Sewol Ferry disaster on April 16, 2014, in South Korea. Data from 241 bereaved family members, survivors, and family members of survivors were used. The Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, PTSD Checklist-5, Posttraumatic Embitterment Disorder Self-Rating Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were used to evaluate perceived social support, posttraumatic growth, and trauma-related psychopathologies. We found that the severity of depression and anxiety showed inverse correlations with posttraumatic growth only in the low-social support group, while they did not demonstrate significant correlations in the high-social support group. The social support level had correlations with posttraumatic growth and the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic embitterment disorder only in female respondents. Furthermore, there was a mediation pathway from social support level to posttraumatic growth through depressive symptoms. This study explored the complex relationship between social support, posttraumatic growth, trauma-related psychopathologies, and gender among trauma-exposed individuals in the aftermath of the Sewol Ferry disaster.

A total of 429 young adults (mean age 20.7 years) recruited from different forums dedicated to video games took part in the study and filled a questionnaire including type of video game use, the Game Addiction Scale, the TAS-20 (evaluating alexithymia) and the HADS (evaluation anxiety and depression). In the whole sample, being alexithymic, depression scores, and anxiety scores were associated with IGD. Nevertheless, results differed depending on gender and type of games played. In male gamers, being alexithymic, being young, and having high anxiety and depression scores was associated with IGD. In female gamers, having less than a high school education and a high depression score was associated with IGD. In MOBA gamers, only the difficulty describing feelings factor was associated with IGD while in MMORPGs gamers, graduation from high school and anxiety scores were associated with IGD. Playing MOBA games could be a strategy to regulate emotions while playing MMORPG appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy to deal with negative affective disturbances. Gender and gaming type are important factors in the relationship between alexithymia, depression, anxiety and IGD. These results have some interesting clinical implications, which are discussed.

This study investigated whether there is a difference in the psychological state of PE and non-PE in outpatients, and whether there is a correlation between ejaculatory latency and psychological disorders. We studied demographics informations and psychological indicators for PE patients and control group, including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale(SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale(SDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and recorded the ejaculatory latency. We analyzed the relationship between PE and psychological disorders by the Pearson correlation and multifactorial logistic regression. There were significant differences in SAS(p &lt; 0.01) and SDS(p &lt; 0.05) scores between the PE and non-PE groups. However, Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was no correlation between ejaculatory latency and SDS. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that anxiety(p &lt; 0.05) and sleep quality(p &lt; 0.05) were closely related to the attack of PE. The incidence of anxiety and depression in PE patients is high, anxiety is a risk factor of PE. Clinicians should pay close attention to the psychological state and sleep quality of patients with PE.

148,Does prolonged grief or suicide bereavement cause public stigma? A vignette-based experiment,"Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), characterized by severe, persistent and disabling grief, is newly included in the International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11). Receiving a PGD diagnosis could lead to stigmatizing public reactions (i.e. public stigma), yet research on this topic is limited. Additionally, while there is evidence that experiencing suicide bereavement causes public stigma, no studies to date have investigated the interaction between PGD and cause of death on public stigma. To fill these knowledge gaps, this experimental study tested if a PGD diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) and experiencing suicide bereavement (vs. homicide and natural loss) cause public stigma. Three hundred and seventeen adults from the general population were randomly assigned to read one of 6 different vignettes of a person with and without PGD who had lost a spouse through a suicide, homicide or a stroke. After reading a vignette, negative attributions, emotional reactions, and desire for social distance were assessed. Notably, only persons with PGD were attributed relatively more negative characteristics, and elicited more anger, anxiety and pro-social emotions, and a larger preferred social distance in participants. This study supports the claim that PGD causes public stigma, but nuances claims that suicide bereavement induces public stigma.

149,"Affect and worry during a checking episode: A comparison of individuals with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and panic disorder","Checking behavior (CB) occurs in a variety of disorders such as obsessive-compulsive (OCD), body dysmorphic (BDD), illness anxiety (IA), and panic disorder (PD), as well as anorexia (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Etiological models of these disorders—with the exception of those for PD—postulate that CB mainly occurs in situations characterized by negative affect and serves to regulate it. We aimed to test these assumptions: N = 386 individuals with a self-reported diagnosis of one of the disorders rated their affect at baseline, directly before a remembered CB episode, during, immediately afterwards, and 15 and 60 minutes afterwards, and rated their endorsement of different functions of CB. The results show that transdiagnostically negative affect is significantly higher before CB compared to baseline, and is significantly reduced from before CB to all post-CB assessments. Reduction of negative affect and Attainment of certainty were the sole functions predicting the affective course during CB, and most prominently reported transdiagnostically. Assumptions of the etiological models were confirmed, suggesting that exposure and ritual prevention should be examined across disorders. As attainment of certainty seems to be predictive for the course of CB, this might be targeted in cognitive interventions.

150,"Internalizing symptoms and chronotype in youth: A longitudinal assessment of anxiety, depression and tripartite model","Biological rhythm theories highlight the reciprocal relations between dysregulated circadian patterns and internalizing psychopathology. Chronotype characterizes individuals’ diurnal preference, as some exhibit more morningness or eveningness. Previous research suggests that eveningness prospectively predicts depression in adolescence. Anxiety often co-occurs with depression, but little is known about longitudinal, reciprocal associations between chronotype and anxiety, and whether this relationship remains after controlling for depression. We assessed different forms of anxiety (social, panic, separation), positive/negative affect, anxious arousal (from tripartite theory), and depression, in relation to chronotype to better understand the specificity and directionality of associations between chronotype and internalizing problems in adolescence. Community youth participated in three assessment time points: T1, T2 (18-months post-T1), and T3 (30-months post-T1) as part of a larger longitudinal study. Youth completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and chronotype. Regression analyses showed that eveningness: (1) concurrently associated with decreased separation anxiety, elevated symptoms of depression and low levels of positive affect, (2) was prospectively predicted by elevated depression, (3) did not predict later symptoms of anxiety. The reciprocal, prospective relationship between chronotype and internalizing psychopathology is specific to depression during adolescence.

151,What are the specificities of social cognition in schizophrenia? A cluster-analytic study comparing schizophrenia with the general population,"While social cognition (SC) is widely recognized as being impaired in schizophrenia, little is known about the potential heterogeneity in individuals’ functioning. Using a wide range of SC measures and a cluster-analytic approach, we compared SC profiles in the general population and in people with schizophrenia. A total of 131 healthy controls and 101 participants with schizophrenia were included. Groups were compared on sociodemographic, neurocognition, anxiety and depressive mood variables. Three profiles were identified in healthy controls: one with good SC abilities (Homogeneous SC group) and two with specific weaknesses in complex Facial Emotion Recognition (Low FER group) or Affective Theory of Mind (Low AToM group). However, these patterns were not found in participants with schizophrenia, who were characterized rather by levels of SC functioning (i.e., Low, Medium and High SC groups). Importantly, while the High SC group (47.9% of the sample) exhibited normal performances, the two others were underpinned by different pathological processes (i.e., alexithymia for Medium SC group or neurocognition dysfunctioning for Low SC group). These results have important implications for future research as well as for clinical practice regarding assessment methodology and therapeutic interventions.

152,Dysfunctional beliefs in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as assessed with the Beliefs Questionnaire (BQ),"There is an ongoing debate about the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as some of these beliefs seem to be relevant in depressed patients as well. The present study aimed to elucidate the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs using the newly developed Beliefs Questionnaire (BQ). A combination of an online assessment and clinical interviews was carried out. One hundred thirty OCD patients ( M = 38.7 years; 68% women) were compared to 85 patients with depression ( M = 36.6 years; 75% women) and 220 nonclinical controls ( M = 38.9 years; 71% women) on the BQ, which contains 13 items tapping cognitive beliefs. The BQ was validated against the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ). Patients with OCD and depression scored higher on the BQ compared to nonclinical controls. OCD patients displayed higher values on overestimation of threat and the fear of becoming insane. Correlation between BQ and OBQ total scores was high ( r = 0.751), supporting the validity of the new scale. Our results show that two beliefs are OCD-specific. However, the BQ covers mainly transdiagnostic features and should be replicated with the inclusion of an anxiety disorder sample.

Results from the national BOURBON study,"Background: Physicians are at risk of burnout, anxiety and depression. Prevention is needed from the beginning of the medical studies to detect early poor mental health outcomes. Objective: To determine the prevalence and associated of psychiatric or psychological follow-up in a national sample of undergraduate and postgraduate medical students (UPMS). Methods: UPMS of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and fulfilled Internet anonymised questionnaires. Results: Overall, 10,985 UPMS were included in the present study (2165 (19.7%) postgraduate, 31.6% males, mean aged 21.8 years). Overall, 1345 (12.2%) were followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist, 20.5% of them were regular anxiolytic consumers and 17.2% of them were regular antidepressant consumers. In multivariate analyses, being followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or psychologist was associated with older age (aOR = 1.2[1.2–1.2], p &lt; 0.0001), female gender (aOR = 0.5[0.5–0.7], p &lt; 0.0001), current alcohol use disorder (aOR = 1.3[1.3–1.5], p &lt; 0.0001), higher anxiolytic (aOR = 3.1[2.5–3.7], p &lt; 0.0001) and antidepressant (aOR = 11.7[7.6–18.0], p &lt; 0.0001) consumption, and with lower self-reported general health, social functioning and mental health quality of life (all aORs = 0.9, all p &lt; 0.05). The UPMS followed-up by psychiatrist and/or psychologist reported to have been more frequently exposed to sexual assault (5.1% vs. 0.9%, aOR = 2.5[1.3–4.7], p &lt; 0.0001), domestic violence (3.3% vs. 0.8% aOR = 2.1[1.2–4.0], p = 0.01) and parents divorce (11% vs. 6.4%, aOR = 1.5[1.2–1.9], p = 0.001). Students followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or psychologist reported more frequently to seek alleviating anxiety (aOR 1.9[1.6–2.3], p &lt; 0.0001), depression (aOR 1.7[1.3–2.1], p &lt; 0.0001), coping with studies difficulties (aOR 1.5[1.2–1.8], p &lt; 0.0001), experiencing more stress at hospital (aOR = 2.3[1.6–3.5], p &lt; 0.001) and more burnout syndrome (aOR = 1.4[1.1–1.8], p = 0.03). Conclusions: Around 12% of UPMS are followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. These students reported higher antidepressant and anxiolytic consumption, psychic suffering and altered quality of life, associated with professional pressure and personal issues. Public health programs should be developed to help these students through their studies to prevent later mental /addictive issues and professional suffering. Improving UPMS mental health may also improve the later quality of care of their patients and global stress at hospital.

155,Difficulties in emotion regulation and suicide ideation and attempt in adolescent inpatients,"This study aimed to examine the concurrent relation between six dimensions of emotion dysregulation, proposed by Gratz and Roemer (2004), and suicide ideation and attempt in a large sample of psychiatric adolescent inpatients. A sample of 547 adolescent inpatients completed measures on dimensions of emotion dysregulation, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicidal ideation and attempt. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that limited access to emotion regulation strategies, difficulties in impulse control, and mood disorder diagnosis, were significantly associated with past year suicidal ideation, covarying for other emotion dysregulation subscales, anxiety and externalizing diagnoses, sex, and age. However, difficulties in impulse control was not significantly related to suicide ideation when analyses were conducted separately by sex. Binary logistic regressions also revealed that past year suicidal ideation uniquely and significantly associated with lifetime attempt, covarying for sociodemographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and all emotion dysregulation subscales; these results held when analyses were also conducted separately by sex. Results indicating an association between perceived limited emotion regulation strategies and suicide ideation are consistent with existing research and suicide-focused theory. This finding may have some tentative benefit to informing clinical assessment and treatment of suicidal thoughts. Other findings are discussed.

The following study aimed to describe the effect of individual self-esteem as a mediator in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health (understood as the presence of anxious and depressive symptomatology) in South American migrants in Chile. We surveyed 853 people, of Peruvian and Colombian nationality, residing in three cities (Arica, Antofagasta and Santiago). Three ad-hoc scales were applied to evaluate the study variables, analyzing the measurement models for each of them using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis method. Subsequently, the hypothesized mediation model is evaluated through Structural Equations (SEM). The results show that discrimination has a positive and direct relationship with both anxiety and depression, and that the effect of interaction between the variables of discrimination, self-esteem and symptoms associated with depression and anxiety, had a simple partial mediating effect. Discrimination would have a positive and minor effect on anxious and depressive symptoms, as it is mediated by self-esteem.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (8 rats each): control, emotional stress model, three emotional stress + GABA-treated groups (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg). The rats were given empty water bottles after the training of drinking water to induce emotional stress. Each group was treated with saline or different doses of GABA respectively for 21 consecutive days. Then open field and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors. Both frontal cortex and plasma NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite (NO x ) levels were determined spectrophotometrically. Results showed that oral administration of GABA significantly reversed the stress-induced anxiety-like negative responses dose-dependently. The frontal cortex NO x levels were lower in stressed rats than in control group ( P &lt; 0.05), but higher in 2 mg/kg GABA-treated group than stress model group ( P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, NOx levels in plasma showed a gradual decline trend. Collectively, these results suggest that short repeated oral administration of GABA has an anxiolytic-like effect possibly via preventing NO reduction caused by stress and improving availability of NO in the frontal cortex.

The objective was to investigate factors that are associated with SC and to assess the relationships among SC, anxiety symptoms, and eating behavior in university students. This was a cross-sectional study involving 300 students of both sexes (20.5 ± 4.4 years) who were freshmen in a Brazilian public university. Eating behavior was evaluated using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, SC was identified by a yes/no question (“Have you had a very strong desire to eat sweet food over the last three months?”), and characterized by the Questionnaire for Assessment of Sweet Substance Dependence. Individuals with SC scored significantly higher for uncontrolled eating (UE), emotional eating (EE), and anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that anxiety symptoms are independently associated with SC. In conclusion, negative emotions, like anxiety, and eating guided by these emotions can contribute to the SC phenomenon.

Only two of seven dimensions of depression (including cognitive disturbance, helplessness, excluding anxiety dimension) and one of two dimensions of STAI anxiety (anxiety dimension, not depression dimension) were risk factors for suicide (all OR &gt; 1). Our main findings was that combined effects of depression and anxiety on suicide were complicated, and the effects of anxiety dimension of depression and depression dimension of anxiety must be cautiously evaluated, avoiding overlapping inclusion.

More research is needed to examine the associations between asthma and specific psychiatric disorders, and whether these associations hold true across racial groups in the general population of the United States. Using the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, we examined the associations between lifetime asthma and specific DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status. We found that when looking at the entire sample, self-reported diagnosis of asthma was associated with greater odds of reporting mood disorders (AOR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05–1.74). Asthma was not significantly associated with total anxiety disorders (AOR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.98–1.60), though it was specifically associated with generalized anxiety disorder. Asthma was associated with greater odds of having alcohol use disorders (AOR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.24–2.37), but was not associated with total eating disorders (AOR:1.36; 95% CI: 1.17–2.51) (though it was significantly associated with higher odds for binge eating disorder, but lower odds of reporting bulimia). The strength and the significance of the associations between asthma and psychiatric disorders varied when stratified by race, underscoring the importance of examining race as a potential explanation for the mixed findings observed previously in the literature.

These dimensions may help explain responsiveness to current treatments. The Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) is a validated instrument involving a self-report screening tool followed by a structured interview in which the presence/absence and severity of OCD symptom dimensions are assessed and rated. The present study investigated the validity of a briefer, interview-only version of the DY-BOCS modified for use in routine care. Clinically-referred children and adolescents ( N = 119) with OCD were administered the DY-BOCS along with other measures of OCD, anxiety, depression, and overall functioning and a subset ( N = 100) were reassessed on average 14 months after initial assessment. This briefer, interview-only version of the DY-BOCS demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and correlated in the moderate to strong range with alternative measures of OCD severity and OCD symptom dimensions. Change scores on the DY-BOCS from baseline to follow-up were significantly correlated with change scores on the alternative measures of OCD and clinician-rated improvement, suggesting that this brief version of the DY-BOCS is valid and sensitive to the effects of treatment for OCD delivered in routine clinical care.

Discrimination contributes to this burden. Social resources may buffer migrants from the effects of this discrimination. The present study explored the relationship between discrimination and common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms, anxiety and depression, and examined whether social capital (cognitive and structural) modified this association. A total of 131 female migrant Filipina domestic workers in Macao, China ( M age = 39.7) were sampled using snowball methods. Self-report data were obtained using tablet devices. Correlation analyses demonstrated that discrimination was significantly associated with depression ( r s = 0.43) and anxiety ( r s = 0.42). Mulitvariable regressions showed that cognitive, but not structural, social capital was significantly negatively associated with depression (β = −0.30) and anxiety (β = −0.32). Cognitive social capital modified the association between discrimination and depression (β = 0.39) and anxiety (β = 0.53). Contrary to predictions, as discrimination increased, compared to those with no cognitive social capital, those with moderate or high levels of cognitive social capital experienced worsening CMD symptoms. This finding provides greater nuance to our understanding of how and under what circumstances social resources are protective for mental health for migrant workers.

165,How does self-esteem affect mobile phone addiction? The mediating role of social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity,"Low self-esteem is an important factor influencing mobile phone addiction, which has been well documented. However, little research focused on the mechanism underlying the association between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. We hypothesized that social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity may mediate the relationship between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. Six hundred and fifty three (353 girls among them) college students with the mean age of 19.94 (SD = 1.34) were recruited for the study. Participants completed mobile phone addiction scale, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the social anxiety questionnaire and interpersonal sensitivity subscale of SCL-90. The findings were as follows: 1) interpersonal sensitivity mediated the relation between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. 2) social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity sequentially mediated the relation between self-esteem and mobile phone addiction. The result reveals that self-esteem has indirect effect on mobile phone addiction, which is mediated by social anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity.

166,Interpreter-mediated psychotherapy with trauma-affected refugees—A retrospective cohort study,"The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine if interpreter-mediated psychotherapy with trauma-affected refugees affects treatment outcome. The clinical sample consisted of 825 patients who, as part of treatment, were offered 16 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy. The cohort was allocated to two subsamples based on whether interpreters were used in psychotherapy or not and the treatment outcome for the two subsamples was compared. The primary outcome measure was severity of PTSD-symptoms (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ)) and secondary outcome measures were depression and anxiety symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), Hamilton Depression and Anxiety rating scales (HAM-D, HAM-A)), somatisation (somatisation items of SCL-90 (SI-SCL-90)), quality of life (WHO-5-Well-being Index (WHO-5)) and functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F, GAF-S)). Compared to no use of interpreter, the use of interpreter in psychotherapy was associated with less improvement during treatment on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the secondary outcome measures HSCL-25, SI-SCL-90, SDS, WHO-5, HAM-A, but not on GAF-S, GAF-F and HAM-D. Based on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the majority of the secondary ratings the subsample in interpreter-mediated psychotherapy had less improvement in their mental health status compared to the subsample without interpreter.

167,Withdrawal from chronic treatment with methamphetamine induces anxiety and depression-like behavior in mice,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit psychostimulant that is widely abused. After producing extreme pleasure, METH abuse leads to negative emotional states during withdrawal in clinical survey. However, the mood behavioral consequences of withdrawal from chronic METH exposure in animal experiments and related mechanisms have not been clarified yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the anxiety and depression-like phenotype in mice induced by withdrawal from chronic METH treatment and the potential molecular mechanism. We found that withdrawal from chronic METH treatment increased the immobility time during the forced swimming test and decreased central activities in open field test, indicating increased anxiety and depression-like behavior. Additional experiments showed that expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (p-TrkB), phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) were decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice in METH group and the level of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) was increased. Combined, our data show that withdrawal from chronic METH exposure induces anxiety and depression-like behavior associated with aberrant changes of proteins in BDNF-ERK-CREB pathway, providing new evidence for the involvement of BDNF pathway in the negative emotional states induced by withdrawal from METH.

168,"The roles of cognitive avoidance, rumination and negative affect in the association between abusive supervision in the workplace and non-clinical paranoia in a sample of workers working in France","This study examined the relationship between abusive supervision and non-clinical paranoia and explored which cognitive mechanisms are mediating this association (i.e. rumination, cognitive avoidance and negative affect). A sample of two hundred and five French-speaking workers currently in employment in France was recruited to fill in a battery of online questionnaires comprising of the French adaptations of the Abusive Supervision Scale, the State Social Paranoia Scales, the Depression and Anxiety and Stress Scales, the Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire and the Mini-Cambridge Exeter Repetitive Thought Scale. Mediation analyses showed that the experience of supervisory abuse directly influences state paranoia, however, there were significant mediation effects. Abusive supervision impacted on cognitive avoidance that led to more rumination, which in its turn increased negative affect and this increased state paranoia. Rumination impacted on state paranoia but through the effect of negative affect only. This study showed that abusive supervision works together with cognitive and affective factors to impact on non-clinical paranoia. It is recommended that Cognitive and Behavioural therapy (CBT) is tailored to help workers to cope with experiences of supervisory abuse and associated paranoid thoughts by focusing on replacing rumination and cognitive avoidance strategies for more adaptive cognitive strategies and on how to manage depression.

169,Randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese women with breast cancer,"Depressive and anxiety symptoms are frequently observed in breast cancer survivors. To date, few randomized controlled trials have been conducted on the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese population. This study aims to verify the efficacy of CBT in Chinese breast cancer survivors. Women ( n = 392) with breast cancer were randomly assigned to 3 groups: CBT ( n = 98), self-care management (SCM, n = 98), and usual care (UC, n = 196) using the proportion 1:1:2. Women in the CBT and SCM groups received a series of nine sessions for 12 weeks, while women in the UC group received their usual medical care only. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. A significant intergroup difference was found in the HAMD and HAMA scores. Women in the CBT group showed significantly less depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with women in the SCM and UC groups over time. In conclusion, this study supports the efficacy of CBT for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese breast cancer survivors.

170,The role of childhood emotional maltreatment and body image dissatisfaction in problematic smartphone use among adolescents,"Growing empirical evidence has identified specific psychological and contextual risk factors associated with problematic smartphone use (PSU). However, the potential direct and indirect impact of childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) on PSU remains largely unexplored, despite the established role of CEM in the onset of other excessive, problematic, and addictive behaviors. Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to test the direct and indirect relationships of emotional abuse and neglect (two facets of CEM) with PSU via specific mediational pathways including body image dissatisfaction (BID), social anxiety, and depression. The sample comprised 443 adolescents who completed a questionnaire that included assessment tools of aforementioned variables. Multiple mediation model results indicated that CEM was directly and indirectly associated with PSU via BID, depression, BID-related depression, and BID-related social anxiety. Results suggested that emotionally traumatic experiences were associated with PSU in adolescents and that this relationship may partially be explained by BID and psychosocial risk factors. The present study draws caution to the amplifying roles of CEM and BID on increased PSU. The results of the study have important clinical and public health implications, but additional research is needed before interventions can be developed and implemented on the basis of present results.

171,"Time to think: Subjective sleep quality, trait anxiety and university start time","Poor quality sleep is related to mental health and there is increasing interest in student wellbeing and mental health. The aim of the current study was to evaluate sleep quality, daytime dozing, anxiety proneness, chronotype and preferred start time in a sample of university students. A total of 546 university students (age range, 18–55) from two university located in South East England were included and completed an online survey. Participants’ self-reported age, gender, year and field of study. Sleep quality, anxiety, daytime dozing, coffee/caffeine/tobacco use (coded as binary variables), preferred start time and chronotype were also recorded. Data were analysed using independent samples t -tests, chi-square, simple mediation-analyses and Analysis of Variance. Across the entire sample 46% percent of participants rated their sleep as fairly bad or very bad. Poor quality sleep was associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety which was not mediated by chronotype. Poor quality sleep is more prevalent in the first year of university and our sample endorsed a start time for university activities approximately 2 h later than currently timetabled. The current findings demonstrate that a large proportion of students are chronically sleep deprived, obtaining, on average, less than 7 h sleep per night on week days and this was more marked in first year students. In addition, we show that poor sleep is associated with increased anxiety. Based on the current evidence the authors suggest a review of current university timetabling and examination scheduling merits immediate consideration by policy makers and educators.

172,Meaning in life buffers the association between clinical anxiety and global maladjustment in participants with common mental disorders on sick leave,"An important goal of mental health specialists is to improve the quality of life and the adaptation of people with common mental disorders on sick leave. Meaning in life is a protective factor for people adjusting to distress and negative events. This study explores the buffering role of meaning in life in the relationship between clinical anxiety or negative affect and maladjustment in participants with common mental disorders on sick leave. The sample was 167 participants with Adjustment, Anxiety and, Depressive Disorders; n = 115 were women and n = 52 men. Participants’ mean age M = 42.16 ( SD = 9.91) years. We performed zero-order correlations and hierarchical regression analyses. Meaning in life moderated and buffered the association between clinical anxiety or negative affect and global maladjustment to daily life. These findings suggest that Meaning in life is a relevant variable in the adjustment of common mental disorders on sick leave.

173,"The impact of depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and severity of internet addiction symptoms on the relationship between probable ADHD and severity of insomnia among young adults","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and severity of Internet addiction symptoms (IAS) on the relationship between probable attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and severity of insomnia among young adults. The study was conducted with online survey among 1010 volunteered university students in Ankara, people who are in the e-mail database of a company located in Istanbul that organizes e-sports tournaments and Turkish gamers from gaming forums. Scale scores were higher among the group with high probability of insomnia ( n = 200, 19.8%). Also risk of high probability of insomnia was 2.7 times higher among those with probable ADHD. In linear regression analysis, both inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions of ADHD were related with the severity of insomnia, together with severities of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and IAS. Similarly, presence of probable ADHD was related with the severity of insomnia in ANCOVA, together with severities of anxiety, depression, neuroticism and IAS. These findings suggest that the presence of probable ADHD and the severity of ADHD symptoms are related with the severity of insomnia, even after controlling the depression, anxiety, neuroticism and IAS, which are all related with the severity of insomnia, among young adults.

174,The roles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in predicting treatment remission in a Chinese Han population with generalized anxiety disorder,"Neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), are involved in neuroplasticity in the nervous system. To explore the characteristics of BDNF and GDNF and their roles in predicting treatment remission in a Chinese Han population with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), 85 GAD patients were treated with escitalopram or venlafaxine randomly for 8 weeks. The serum BDNF/GDNF levels were detected, while Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. The differences in serum BDNF/GDNF levels between GAD patients ( n = 85) and healthy controls ( n = 73) and between remission and nonremission were then compared. The serum BDNF levels were lower in GAD patients (1197.24 ± 367.41 µg/L) than in healthy controls (1378.09 ± 382.46 µg/L) ( P &lt; 0.05). The serum GDNF levels were also lower in GAD patients (10.19 ± 9.86 µg/L) than in healthy controls (13.73 ± 9.44 µg/L) ( P &lt; 0.05). The BDNF level was negatively correlated with baseline HAMA score ( P &lt; 0.05). The GDNF level was negatively correlated with baseline HAMA score ( P &lt; 0.05). The BDNF level was positively correlated with GDNF level ( P &lt; 0.05). Both baseline BDNF/GDNF levels in remission and nonremission showed no statistically significant differences. No significant correlation was found between baseline BDNF level and the HAMA reduction rate or between baseline GDNF levels and the HAMA reduction rate. Both serum BDNF and GDNF were demonstrated to be potential biomarkers of GAD, it seems that serum BDNF and GDNF levels can be used to assess the baseline anxiety severity of GAD but cannot serve as a factor to predict treatment remission.

175,Relationship between quality of life in young adults and impulsivity/compulsivity,"Impulsive and compulsive symptoms often become apparent during young adulthood, which is a critical time for brain development and establishment of life goals. The aim of this study was to identify important associations with quality of life in young adults, across a range of clinical, questionnaire, and cognitive measures, focusing on impulsivity and compulsivity. Significant relationships between exploratory variables and quality of life were identified using Partial Least Squares (PLS). In the 479 participants (mean age 22.3 [SD 3.6] years), quality of life was best explained by a one-factor model (p &lt; 0.001). Variables significantly associated with lower quality of life were: older age, greater alcohol consumption, and the presence of impulse control disorders (including gambling, compulsive buying, intermittent explosive disorder, compulsive sexual behavior, binge-eating, and skin picking), mood/anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. Worse quality of life was also significantly explained by higher impulsiveness on the Barratt scale, and by relative impairments in extra-dimensional set-shifting and quality of decision-making. These findings suggest that impulse disorders merit more public health attention, especially problematic gambling. Performance on decision-making and set-shifting tasks also appears particularly important in understanding quality of life in young adults.

176,"Sleep-wake, cognitive and clinical correlates of treatment outcome with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for young adults with depression","The utility of key phenotypes of depression in predicting response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), namely sleep-wake behaviour, cognition and illness chronicity, has been understudied and not been extended to young samples. This study aimed to determine whether sleep-wake disturbance, cognition or depression chronicity are associated with rTMS outcome in young depressed adults. Sixteen depressed young adults diagnosed with mood disorders (aged 18–29 years) completed this open-label study. Neuronavigationally targeted high-frequency rTMS was administered at 110% of motor threshold on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Clinical, sleep-wake and cognitive assessments were undertaken pre- and post-treatment. Repeated-measures and correlational analyses determined pre- and post-treatment changes and predictors of treatment outcome. rTMS significantly reduced depression and anxiety. Better cognitive flexibility, verbal learning, later age of onset and greater number of depressive episodes were associated with better treatment outcome. There were no other significant/trend-level associations. rTMS had no effect on sleep-wake or cognitive measures. We provide the first evidence for the utility of cognitive flexibility and verbal learning in predicting rTMS outcome in depressed young adults. This research provides preliminary support for rTMS as an early intervention for depression and supports the need for sham-controlled trials.

38,Effort valuation and psychopathology in children and adults,"Background The Research Domain Criteria initiative was launched by the US National Institute of Mental Health to establish a multi-level framework for understanding psychological constructs relevant to human psychiatric disorders, and identified ‘effort valuation/willingness to work’ as a clinically useful construct worthy of further study. This construct encompasses the processes by which the cost(s) of obtaining an outcome are calculated, and the tendency to overcome response costs to obtain a reinforcer. The current study aims to examine effort valuation as a correlate of psychopathology in children and adults, and the moderating effects of sex on this relationship. Methods Participants were 1215 children aged 6–12 and their parents ( n = 1044). All participants completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task as a measure of effort expenditure. Child psychopathology was measured via the Child Behavior Checklist, while adult psychopathology was measured via the Adult Self Report. Additionally, the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents and Injury Behavior Checklist were used to examine child social impairments/problem behaviors. Results In children, significant interactions between reward sensitivity and sex were observed in association with anxiety and thought problems, specifically at low reward sensitivity levels. In adults, main effects of effort expenditure were seen in drug and alcohol abuse, where higher effort was associated with higher degrees of abuse. Conclusions These results establish effort valuation as a relevant psychological construct for understanding psychopathology, but with different profiles of associated psychopathology across sex in children and adults.",2338502547.0, Journal Article,2019
39,Translating GWAS findings into therapies for depression and anxiety disorders: gene-set analyses reveal enrichment of psychiatric drug classes and implications for drug repositioning,"Background Depression and anxiety disorders (AD) are the first and sixth leading causes of disability worldwide. Despite their high prevalence and significant disability resulted, there are limited advances in new drug development. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have greatly advanced our understanding of the genetic basis underlying psychiatric disorders. Methods Here we employed gene-set analyses of GWAS summary statistics for drug repositioning. We explored five related GWAS datasets, including two on major depressive disorder (MDD2018 and MDD-CONVERGE, with the latter focusing on severe melancholic depression), one on AD, and two on depressive symptoms and neuroticism in the population. We extracted gene-sets associated with each drug from DSigDB and examined their association with each GWAS phenotype. We also performed repositioning analyses on meta-analyzed GWAS data, integrating evidence from all related phenotypes. Results Importantly, we showed that the repositioning hits are generally enriched for known psychiatric medications or those considered in clinical trials. Enrichment was seen for antidepressants and anxiolytics but also for antipsychotics. We also revealed new candidates or drug classes for repositioning, some of which were supported by experimental or clinical studies. For example, the top repositioning hit using meta-analyzed p values was fendiline, which was shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in mouse models by inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase. Conclusion Taken together, our findings suggest that human genomic data such as GWAS are useful in guiding drug discoveries for depression and AD.",2338502036.0, Journal Article,2019
40,Principal component analysis and brain-based predictors of emotion regulation in anxiety and depression,"Background Reappraisal, an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, is associated with frontal engagement. In internalizing psychopathologies (IPs) such as anxiety and depression frontal activity is atypically reduced suggesting impaired regulation capacity. Yet, successful reappraisal is often demonstrated at the behavioral level. A data-driven approach was used to clarify brain and behavioral relationships in IPs. Methods During functional magnetic resonance imaging, anxious [general anxiety disorder ( n = 43), social anxiety disorder ( n = 72)] and depressed ( n = 47) patients reappraised negative images to reduce negative affect (‘ReappNeg’) and viewed negative images (‘LookNeg’). After each trial, the affective state was reported. A cut-point (i.e. values &lt;0 based on ΔReappNeg-LookNeg) demarcated successful reappraisers. Neural activity for ReappNeg-LookNeg, derived from 37 regions of interest, was submitted to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify unique components of reappraisal-related brain response. PCA factors, symptom severity, and self-reported habitual reappraisal were submitted to discriminant function analysis and linear regression to examine whether these data predicted successful reappraisal (yes/no) and variance in reappraisal ability. Results Most patients (63%) were successful reappraisers according to the behavioral criterion (values&lt;0; ΔReappNeg-LookNeg). Discriminant function analysis was not significant for PCA factors, symptoms, or habitual reappraisal. For regression, more activation in a factor with high loadings for frontal regions predicted better reappraisal facility. Results were not significant for other variables. Conclusions At the individual level, more activation in a ‘frontal’ factor corresponded with better reappraisal facility. However, neither brain nor behavioral variables classified successful reappraisal (yes/no). Findings suggest individual differences in regions strongly implicated in reappraisal play a role in on-line reappraisal capability.",2338990986.0, Journal Article,2019
41,Childhood determinants of suicidality: comparing males in military and civilian employed populations,"Background To better understand the associations of childhood trauma and childhood disorder with past-year suicidality (thoughts, plans or attempts), we compared male military and civilian populations aged 18–60 years old. Methods Data derived from the 2010 Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study and the 2007 Australian Bureau of Statistics Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were compared using logistic regression and Generalized Structural Equation Modelling (GSEM). Results A greater proportion of the ADF experienced suicidality than civilians. Those who experienced childhood trauma that was not interpersonal in nature were not at increased odds of suicidality, in either population. A higher proportion of the ADF experienced three or more types of trauma in childhood and first experienced three or more types of trauma in adulthood. Both were associated with suicidality in the ADF and civilians. Childhood anxiety had a strong and independent association with suicidality in the ADF (controlling for demographics and childhood trauma, adult trauma and adult onset disorder). Childhood anxiety fully mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality in the ADF, but not in civilians. Conclusions These data highlight the need to take a whole life approach to understanding suicidality, and the importance of categorizing the nature of childhood trauma exposure. Importantly, childhood anxiety was not only associated with suicidality, it fully mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidality in the more trauma exposed (military) population only. These findings have the potential to inform the development of strategies for suicide prevention.",2338990450.0, Journal Article,2019
42,Pre-loss personal factors and prolonged grief disorder in bereaved mothers,"Background Identifying characteristics of individuals at greatest risk for prolonged grief disorder (PGD) can improve its detection and elucidate the etiology of the disorder. The Safe Passage Study, a study of women at high risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), prospectively examined the psychosocial functioning of women while monitoring their healthy pregnancies. Mothers whose infants died of SIDS were followed in bereavement. Methods Pre-loss data were collected from 12 000 pregnant mothers and analyzed for their associations with grief symptoms and PGD in 50 mothers whose infants died from SIDS, from 2 to 48 months after their infant's death, focusing on pre-loss risk factors of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, maternal age, the presence of other living children in the home, and previous child loss. Results The presence of any four risk factors significantly predicted PGD for 24 months post-loss ( p &lt; 0.003); 2–3 risk factors predicted PGD for 12 months ( p = 0.02). PGD rates increased in the second post-loss year, converging in all groups to approximately 40% by 3 years. Pre-loss depressive symptoms were significantly associated with PGD. Higher alcohol intake and older maternal age were consistently positively associated with PGD. Predicted risk scores showed good discrimination between PGD and no PGD 6–24 months after loss ( C -statistic = 0.83). Conclusions A combination of personal risk factors predicted PGD in 2 years of bereavement. There is a convergence of risk groups to high rates at 2–3 years, marked by increased PGD rates in mothers at low risk. The risk factors showed different effects on PGD.",2338989080.0, Journal Article,2019
43,"Performance anxiety in professional musicians: a systematic review on prevalence, risk factors and clinical treatment effects","Music performance anxiety (MPA) is one of the most common disorders among professional musicians, nevertheless, little is known about the disease. With this systematic review, prevalence, risk factors and treatment procedures for MPA were assessed, and for the first time, quality assessments were carried out for all studies using standardized assessment tools. A systematic literature search was conducted via search algorithms in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycArticles, PsycInfo and ERIC. Included were case reports, case–control, cohort, cross-sectional and intervention studies examining professional musicians with MPA. For quality assessment, adapted tools of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute were used. A total of 43 studies were included (10 case reports, 21 intervention, 11 cross-sectional, one cohort study). Quality ratings ranged from −11 to 6 out of a maximum of 15/16 points for cross-sectional/cohort studies and −4 to 11 out of 18 points for intervention studies. The prevalence of MPA was between 16.5% and 60%. More women than men were affected and musicians older than 45–50 years reported less MPA than younger musicians. Regarding treatment cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and β -blockers were most often researched with beneficial results for CBT. However, studies with adequate control groups for CBT interventions are needed to clarify its efficacy. Studies showed methodological weaknesses, especially in the selection of participants, recording of influencing factors, blinding of interventions, randomization of participants and analysis of comorbidity.

44,Body mass index in midlife and risk of attempted suicide and suicide: prospective study of 1 million UK women,"Background High body mass index (BMI) has been associated with lower risks of suicidal behaviour and being underweight with increased risks. However, evidence is inconsistent and sparse, particularly for women. We aim to study this relationship in a large cohort of UK women. Methods In total 1.2 million women, mean age 56 ( s.d. 5) years, without prior suicide attempts or other major illness, recruited in 1996–2001 were followed by record linkage to national hospital admission and death databases. Cox regression yielded relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for attempted suicide and suicide by BMI, adjusted for baseline lifestyle factors and self-reported treatment for depression or anxiety. Results After 16 ( s.d. 3) years of follow-up, 4930 women attempted suicide and 642 died by suicide. The small proportion (4%) with BMI &lt;20 kg/m 2 were at clearly greater risk of attempted suicide (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.23–1.56) and suicide (RR = 2.10, 1.59–2.78) than women of BMI 20–24.9 kg/m 2 ; p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons. Small body size at 10 and 20 years old was also associated with increased risks. Half the cohort had BMIs &gt;25 kg/m 2 and, while risks were somewhat lower than for BMI 20–24.9 kg/m 2 (attempted suicide RR = 0.91, 0.86–0.96; p = 0.001; suicide RR = 0.79, 0.67–0.93; p = 0.006), the reductions in risk were not strongly related to level of BMI. Conclusions Being underweight is associated with a definite increase in the risk of suicidal behaviour, particularly death by suicide. Residual confounding cannot be excluded for the small and inconsistent decreased risk of suicidal behaviour associated with being overweight or obese.",2293662474.0, Journal Article,2019
45,The roles of early-life adversity and rumination in neural response to emotional faces amongst anxious and depressed adults,"Background Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk factor for internalizing psychopathology (IP). ELA is also linked to alterations in neural phenotypes of emotion processing and maladaptive emotion regulatory strategies, such as ruminative brooding, in adulthood. We therefore expected that ELA would predict cortical brain activation to emotional faces in transdiagnostic IP and in turn, mediate the extent of rumination amongst patients with IPs and ELA (IP + ELA). Method One hundred and thirty-two individuals, including 102 treatment-seeking adults with heterogeneous IPs and 30 healthy controls (HCs) performed an Emotional Face-Matching Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain analyses compared HC ( n = 30), IP ( n = 52), and IP + ELA ( n = 50) neural responses to emotional (angry, fearful, happy, and sad) faces v. shapes, controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms. Parameter estimates of activation were extracted for significant between-group differences and tested as a mediator of ruminative brooding in IP + ELA. Results IP + ELA demonstrated increased activation in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (fear), superior parietal lobule, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal gyrus (fear only), and cuneus (fear and angry). These regions were preferentially correlated with ruminative brooding in IP + ELA, many of which mediated the link between IP + ELA and ruminative brooding. Conclusions Results provide evidence that ELA history amongst IP patients augments engagement of brain regions involved in emotion processing, above and beyond what is accounted for by current symptoms. Though longitudinal designs are needed, alterations in the neural correlates of maladaptive processing of socio-emotional information may be a common pathway by which ELA poses risk for psychopathology.",2293661376.0, Journal Article,2019
46,Racial/ethnic variation in trauma-related psychopathology in the United States: a population-based study,"Background The prevalence of mental disorders among Black, Latino, and Asian adults is lower than among Whites. Factors that explain these differences are largely unknown. We examined whether racial/ethnic differences in exposure to traumatic events (TEs) or vulnerability to trauma-related psychopathology explained the lower rates of psychopathology among racial/ethnic minorities. Methods We estimated the prevalence of TE exposure and associations with onset of DSM-IV depression, anxiety and substance disorders and with lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, a national sample ( N = 13 775) with substantial proportions of Black (35.9%), Latino (18.9%), and Asian Americans (14.9%). Results TE exposure varied across racial/ethnic groups. Asians were most likely to experience organized violence – particularly being a refugee – but had the lowest exposure to all other TEs. Blacks had the greatest exposure to participation in organized violence, sexual violence, and other TEs, Latinos had the highest exposure to physical violence, and Whites were most likely to experience accidents/injuries. Racial/ethnic minorities had lower odds ratios of depression, anxiety, and substance disorder onset relative to Whites. Neither variation in TE exposure nor vulnerability to psychopathology following TEs across racial/ethnic groups explained these differences. Vulnerability to PTSD did vary across groups, however, such that Asians were less likely and Blacks more likely to develop PTSD following TEs than Whites. Conclusions Lower prevalence of mental disorders among racial/ethnic minorities does not appear to reflect reduced vulnerability to TEs, with the exception of PTSD among Asians. This highlights the importance of investigating other potential mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in psychopathology.",2293660572.0, Journal Article,2019
47,Meditation techniques &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;. relaxation therapies when treating anxiety: a meta-analytic review,"To what extent meditation techniques (which incorporate practices to regulate attention, construct individual values, or deconstruct self-related assumptions), are more or less effective than relaxation therapy in the treatment of anxiety, is not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of meditation compared to relaxation in reducing anxiety. A systematic review from PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Central was conducted. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs ( n = 862 participants suffering from anxiety disorders or high trait anxiety) was performed. Effect sizes (ESs) were determined by Hedges’ g . Heterogeneity, risk of publication bias, quality of studies/interventions, and researcher allegiance, were evaluated. Meditation techniques incorporated attentional elements, and five of them also added constructive practices. No studies were found using deconstructive exercises. The overall ES was g = −0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) −0.40 to −0.07], favouring meditation (number needed to treat = 7.74). Heterogeneity was low ( I 2 = 2; 95% CI 0 to 56). There was no evidence of publication bias, but few studies and interventions were of high quality, and allegiance might be moderating results. Meditation seems to be a bit more effective than relaxation in the treatment of anxiety, and it might also remain more effective at 12-month follow-up. However, more research using the full spectrum of meditation practices to treat different anxiety disorders, including independent studies to avoid researcher allegiance, is needed if we are to have a precise idea of the potential of these techniques compared to relaxation therapy.",2293660409.0, Journal Article,2019
48,Examining the link between prior suicidality and subsequent suicidal ideation among high-risk US military service members,"Background Research is needed to identify the factors that explain the link between prior and future suicidality. This study evaluated possible mediators of the relationship between: (1) the severity of prior suicidality and (2) suicidal ideation severity at 3-month follow-up among a sample of high-risk military personnel. Methods US military service members referred to or seeking care for suicide risk ( N = 624) completed self-report psychiatric domain measures and a clinician interview assessing prior suicidality severity at baseline. Three months later, participants completed a self-report measure of suicidal ideation severity. Three separate percentile bootstrap mediation models were used to examine psychiatric factors (i.e. alcohol abuse, anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, suicidal ideation, and thwarted belongingness) as parallel mediators of the relationship between prior suicidality severity (specifically, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and overall suicidality – i.e. ideation/attempt severity combined) at baseline and suicidal ideation severity at follow-up. Results Hopelessness, specifically, and the total effect of all mediators, each significantly accounted for the relationship between prior suicidality severity and subsequent ideation severity across models. In the models with attempt severity and overall suicidality severity as predictors, thwarted belongingness was also a significant mediator. Conclusions Hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, and overall severity of psychiatric indices may explain the relationship between prior suicidality severity and future suicidal ideation severity among service members at elevated suicide risk. Research is needed to replicate these findings and examine other possible mediators.",2293659730.0, Journal Article,2019
49,Toward a paradigm shift in treatment and research of mental disorders,"According to these meta-analyses, presently most patients do not remit and about 50% or more do not respond to the available treatments. For depressive and anxiety disorders, placebo response rates range between 35% and 40% (Furukawa et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017). [...]the difference in response rates in comparison to placebo is between 10% and 15%, indicating small effect sizes in terms of success rate differences, corresponding to SMDs between 0.20 and &lt;0.30 (Kraemer and Kupfer, 2006). Overall, while a certain proportion of patients (who cannot be identified in advance) does benefit from available treatments, most patients do not remit and at least half of the patients do not respond to the available treatments (Cuijpers et al., 2014; Leucht, 2014; Li et al., 2017; Springer et al., 2018). [...]results for the efficacy of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are sobering, indicating only a small incremental gain over TAU or placebo and limited rates for remission and response. Conclusions Mental disorders were found to be associated with a ‘trillion-dollar brain drain’ (Gustavsson et al., 2011; Smith, 2011; Patel et al., 2018) which, as shown above, is presently not effectively addressed by the available treatments and research strategies. [...]improving treatment strategies for mental disorders can be regarded as a central health challenge of the twenty-first century.",2293658763.0, Editorial,2019
50,"Clinical, personality, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in borderline personality disorder: a family study","Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype that emerges from interactions among genetic, biological, neurodevelopmental, and psychosocial factors. In the present family study, we evaluated the familial aggregation of key clinical, personality, and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in probands with BPD ( n = 103), first-degree biological relatives ( n = 74; 43% without a history of psychiatric disorder), and non-psychiatric controls ( n = 99). Methods Participants were assessed on DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses, symptom dimensions of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity, ‘big five’ personality traits, and neurodevelopmental characteristics, as part of a larger family study on neurocognitive, biological, and genetic markers in BPD. Results The most common psychiatric diagnoses in probands and relatives were major depression, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and avoidant personality disorder. There was evidence of familial aggregation for specific dimensions of impulsivity and emotion dysregulation, and the big five traits neuroticism and conscientiousness. Both probands and relatives reported an elevated neurodevelopmental history of attentional and behavioral difficulties. Conclusions These results support the validity of negative affectivity- and impulse-spectrum phenotypes associated with BPD and its familial risk. Further research is needed to investigate the aggregation of neurocognitive, neural and genetic factors in families with BPD and their associations with core phenotypes underlying the disorder.",2281014384.0, Journal Article,2019
51,Maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness and child neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive development,"Background The prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women is over 50%, and daytime sleepiness is among the most common sleep problems. Previous studies have associated antenatal sleep problems with adverse maternal health and neonatal outcomes, but the consequences of antenatal sleep problems and particularly daytime sleepiness on child psychological development have not been assessed prospectively. Methods In this prospective cohort study including 111 mother-child dyads, we examined the associations of maternal daytime sleepiness during pregnancy, assessed at 17 and 28 weeks of gestation using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with child neuropsychiatric problems and neuropsychological development, assessed with mother-rated questionnaires and individually administered neuropsychological tests, at child age 2.6–5.7 years (mean = 4.3 years). Results Independently of sociodemographic and perinatal covariates and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during and/or after pregnancy, maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness was associated with increased total [unstandardized regression coefficient ( B ) = 0.25 standard deviation ( s.d. ) units; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01–0.48] and internalizing ( B = 0.25 s.d. s: 95% CI 0.01–0.49) psychiatric problems and ADHD symptoms ( B = 0.27 s.d. s: 95% CI 0.04–0.50) in children, and with poorer executive function, particularly in the areas of attention, working memory and inhibitory control ( B = −0.39 s.d. s: 95% CI −0.69 to −0.10). Conclusions Maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness carries adverse consequences for offspring psychological development. The assessment of sleep problems may be an important addition to standard antenatal care.",2281014281.0, Journal Article,2019
52,Individualized prediction of dispositional worry using white matter connectivity,"Background Excessive worry is a defining feature of generalized anxiety disorder and is present in a wide range of other psychiatric conditions. Therefore, individualized predictions of worry propensity could be highly relevant in clinical practice, with respect to the assessment of worry symptom severity at the individual level. Methods We applied a multivariate machine learning approach to predict dispositional worry based on microstructural integrity of white matter (WM) tracts. Results We demonstrated that the machine learning model was able to decode individual dispositional worry scores from microstructural properties in widely distributed WM tracts (mean absolute error = 10.46, p &lt; 0.001; root mean squared error = 12.82, p &lt; 0.001; prediction R 2 = 0.17, p &lt; 0.001). WM tracts that contributed to worry prediction included the posterior limb of internal capsule, anterior corona radiate, and cerebral peduncle, as well as the corticolimbic pathways (e.g. uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, and fornix) already known to be critical for emotion processing and regulation. Conclusions The current work thus elucidates potential neuromarkers for clinical assessment of worry symptoms across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. In addition, the identification of widely distributed pathways underlying worry propensity serves to better improve the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms associated with worry.",2281014274.0, Journal Article,2019
53,Trauma-associated anterior cingulate connectivity during reward learning predicts affective and anxiety states in young adults,"Background Trauma exposure is associated with development of depression and anxiety; yet, some individuals are resilient to these trauma-associated effects. Differentiating mechanisms underlying development of negative affect and resilience following trauma is critical for developing effective interventions. One pathway through which trauma could exert its effects on negative affect is reward-learning networks. In this study, we examined relationships among lifetime trauma, reward-learning network function, and emotional states in young adults. Methods One hundred eleven young adults self-reported trauma and emotional states and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary reward task. Trauma-associated neural activation and functional connectivity were analyzed during reward prediction error (RPE). Relationships between trauma-associated neural functioning and affective and anxiety symptoms were examined. Results Number of traumatic events was associated with greater ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activation, and lower vACC connectivity with the right insula, frontopolar, inferior parietal, and temporoparietal regions, during RPE. Lower trauma-associated vACC connectivity with frontoparietal regions implicated in regulatory and decision-making processes was associated with heightened affective and anxiety symptoms; lower vACC connectivity with insular regions implicated in interoception was associated with lower affective and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions In a young adult sample, two pathways linked the impact of trauma on reward-learning networks with higher v. lower negative affective and anxiety symptoms. The disconnection between vACC and regions implicated in decision-making and self-referential processes may reflect aberrant regulatory but appropriate self-focused mechanisms, respectively, conferring risk for v. resilience against negative affective and anxiety symptoms.",2262606313.0, Journal Article,2019
54,"Reasoning bias, working memory performance and a transdiagnostic phenotype of affective disturbances and psychotic experiences in the general population","Background The jumping to conclusions (JTC) reasoning bias and decreased working memory performance (WMP) are associated with psychosis, but associations with affective disturbances (i.e. depression, anxiety, mania) remain inconclusive. Recent findings also suggest a transdiagnostic phenotype of co-occurring affective disturbances and psychotic experiences (PEs). This study investigated whether JTC bias and decreased WMP are associated with co-occurring affective disturbances and PEs. Methods Data were derived from the second Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-2). Trained interviewers administered the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at three time points in a general population sample ( N = 4618). The beads and digit-span task were completed to assess JTC bias and WMP, respectively. CIDI was used to measure affective disturbances and an add-on instrument to measure PEs. Results Compared to individuals with neither affective disturbances nor PEs, the JTC bias was more likely to occur in individuals with co-occurring affective disturbances and PEs [moderate psychosis (1–2 PEs): adjusted relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.17, 95% CI 0.98–1.41; and high psychosis (3 or more PEs or psychosis-related help-seeking behaviour): adjusted RRR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19–2.08], but not with affective disturbances and PEs alone, whereas decreased WMP was more likely in all groups. There was some evidence of a dose–response relationship, as JTC bias and decreased WMP were more likely in individuals with affective disturbances as the level of PEs increased or help-seeking behaviour was reported. Conclusion The findings suggest that JTC bias and decreased WMP may contribute to a transdiagnostic phenotype of co-occurring affective disturbances and PEs.",2262605680.0, Journal Article,2019
55,Trajectories of psychiatric diagnoses and medication usage in youth with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a 9-year longitudinal study,"Background Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia in up to 30% of individuals with the syndrome. Despite this, we know relatively little about trajectories and predictors of persistence of psychiatric disorders from middle childhood to early adulthood. Accordingly, we followed youth over four timepoints, every 3 years, to assess long-term trajectories of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, mood, and psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSDs), as well as medication usage. Methods Eighty-seven youth with 22q11DS and 65 controls between the ages of 9 and 15 years at the first timepoint (T1; mean age 11.88 ± 2.1) were followed for 9 years (mean age of 21.22 ± 2.01 years at T4). Baseline cognitive, clinical, and familial predictors of persistence were identified for each class of psychiatric disorders. Results Baseline age and parent-rated hyperactivity scores predicted ADHD persistence [area under curve (AUC) = 0.81]. The presence of family conflict predicted persistence of anxiety disorders (ADs) whereas parent ratings of child internalizing symptoms predicted persistence of both anxiety and mood disorders (MDs) (AUC = 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Baseline prodromal symptoms predicted persistent and emergent PSDs (AUC = 0.83). Parent-reported use of anti-depressants/anxiolytics increased significantly from T1 to T4. Conclusions Psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive functioning during late childhood and early adolescence successfully predicted children with 22q11DS who were at highest risk for persistent psychiatric illness in young adulthood. These findings emphasize the critical importance of early assessments and interventions in youth with 22q11DS.",2262603238.0, Journal Article,2019
56,"Longitudinal association between trust, psychological symptoms and community engagement in resettled refugees","Background The mental health and social functioning of millions of forcibly displaced individuals worldwide represents a key public health priority for host governments. This is the first longitudinal study with a representative sample to examine the impact of interpersonal trust and psychological symptoms on community engagement in refugees. Methods Participants were 1894 resettled refugees, assessed within 6 months of receiving a permanent visa in Australia, and again 2–3 years later. Variables measured included post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression/anxiety symptoms, interpersonal trust and engagement with refugees’ own and other communities. Results A multilevel path analysis was conducted, with the final model evidencing good fit (Comparative Fit Index = 0.97, Tucker–Lewis Index = 0.89, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.05, Standardized Root-Mean-Square-Residual = 0.05). Findings revealed that high levels of depression symptoms were associated with lower subsequent engagement with refugees’ own communities. In contrast, low levels of interpersonal trust were associated with lower engagement with the host community over the same timeframe. Conclusions Findings point to differential pathways to social engagement in the medium-term post-resettlement. Results indicate that depression symptoms are linked to reduced engagement with one's own community, while interpersonal trust is implicated in engagement with the broader community in the host country. These findings have potentially important implications for policy and clinical practice, suggesting that clinical and support services should target psychological symptoms and interpersonal processes when fostering positive adaptation in resettled refugees.",2280495662.0, Journal Article,2019
57,Depression and cause-specific mortality in an ethnically diverse cohort from the UK: 8-year prospective study,"Background Depression is associated with increased mortality, however, little is known about its variation by ethnicity. Methods We conducted a cohort study of individuals with ICD-10 unipolar depression from secondary mental healthcare, from an ethnically diverse location in southeast London, followed for 8 years (2007–2014) linked to death certificates. Age- and sex- standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), with the population of England and Wales as a standard population were derived. Hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were derived through multivariable regression procedures. Results Data from 20 320 individuals contributing 91 635 person-years at risk with 2366 deaths were used for analyses. SMR for all-cause mortality in depression was 2.55(95% CI 2.45–2.65), with similar trends by ethnicity. Within the cohort with unipolar depression, adjusted HR (aHRs) for all-cause mortality in ethnic minority groups relative to the White British group were 0.62(95% CI 0.53–0.74) (Black Caribbean), 0.53(95% CI 0.39–0.72) (Black African) and 0.69(95% CI 0.52–0.90) (South Asian). Male sex and alcohol/substance misuse were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk [aHR:1.94 (95% CI 1.68–2.24) and aHR:1.18 (95% CI 1.01–1.37) respectively], whereas comorbid anxiety was associated with a decreased risk [aHR: 0.72(95% CI 0.58–0.89)]. Similar associations were noted for natural-cause mortality. Alcohol/substance misuse and male sex were associated with a near-doubling in unnatural-cause mortality risk, whereas Black Caribbean individuals with depression had a reduced unnatural-cause mortality risk, relative to White British people with depression. Conclusions Although individuals with depression experience an increased mortality risk, marked heterogeneity exists by ethnicity. Research and practice should focus on addressing tractable causes underlying increased mortality in depression.",2280492814.0, Journal Article,2019
58,Childhood and adolescent psychotic experiences and risk of mental disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Psychotic experiences (PEs) are common in childhood and adolescence and their association with mental disorders is well-established. We aim to conduct a quantitative synthesis the literature on the relationship between childhood and adolescent PEs and (i) any mental disorder; and (ii) specific categories of mental disorder, while stratifying by study design. Method Three electronic databases (PUBMED, PsycINFO and EMBASE) were searched from inception to August 2017 for all the published literature on childhood and adolescent PEs and mental disorder (outcome) in non-help-seeking community samples. Study quality was assessed using a recognised quality assessment tool for observational studies. Two authors conducted independent data extraction. Pooled odds ratios were calculated for mental disorders using random-effects models. Additional analyses were conducted investigating different categories of mental disorder while stratifying by study design. Results Fourteen studies from 13 community samples ( n = 29 517) were identified with 9.8% of participants reporting PEs. PEs were associated with a three-fold increased risk of any mental disorder [odds ratio (OR) 3.08, confidence interval (CI) 2.26–4.21, k = 12]. PEs were associated with four-fold increase risk of psychotic disorder (OR 3.96, CI 2.03–7.73, population-attributable-fraction: 23.2%, k = 5). In addition, PEs were associated with an increased risk of affective disorders, anxiety disorders, behavioural disorders and substance-use disorders. Few longitudinal studies have investigated childhood and adolescent PEs and subsequent non-psychotic disorders which limited a meaningful synthesis and interpretation of these results. Conclusion This meta-analysis confirms that PEs are prevalent in childhood and adolescent community samples and are associated with a variety of mental disorders beyond psychotic disorders. Further longitudinal research is necessary to fully determine the longitudinal relationship between PEs and non-psychotic disorders.",2280491912.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
59,"Depression, anxiety and perceived stress in women with and without PCOS: a community-based study","Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased psychological distress in clinical populations. We aimed to assess depression, anxiety and perceived stress in women with and without PCOS in a large community-based sample and investigate the role of stress in contributing to and mediating the relationship between PCOS, depression and anxiety. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was performed from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health (ALWSH) comparing women with ( n = 478) or without ( n = 8134) a self-reported diagnosis of PCOS. Main outcome measures were depression, anxiety and perceived stress measured using validated scales. The χ 2 and t tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariable and multivariable regression were performed to determine factors contributing to each outcome. Results Women reporting PCOS, compared with women not reporting PCOS, reported higher prevalence of depression (27.3% v. 18.8%), anxiety symptoms (50% v. 39.2%) and greater score for perceived stress (1.01 ± 0.03 v. 0.88 ± 0.01). After adjusting for body mass index, infertility and socio-demographic factors, women with PCOS were still more likely to be depressed, anxious and to have a higher level of perceived stress. There was a high-level mediation effect of stress between PCOS and both depression and anxiety. Conclusion Compared with women not reporting PCOS, women reporting PCOS have increased depression, anxiety and perceived stress. Stress may play a role in the association between PCOS, depression and anxiety. Further studies should consider assessment and management of stress in PCOS as it may be relevant for understanding the aetiology and treatment of psychological distress.",2231375237.0, Journal Article,2019
60,CBT for schizophrenia: a critical viewpoint,"In the wake of a ‘viewpoint’ article examining whether it is right to continue to regard CBT as a gold standard for depression and anxiety (Leichsenring and Steinert, 2017), we consider the current status of this form of therapy in schizophrenia and the related psychotic disorders that are typically included in trials (schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and psychosis not otherwise specified). [...]there was no evidence of effectiveness against relapse, when compared with either standard care [relative risk (RR) 0.85 (95% CI 0.50–1.41), three trials] or with other active treatments [RR 1.05 (CI 0.85–1.30), four trials]. [...]a view finds echoes in UK clinical guidelines: NICE (2009) emphasized not only effects on psychotic symptoms but also reduction of distress associated with symptoms, promotion of social and educational recovery, and reduction of depression and social anxiety. A preliminary report of this study (Bechdolf et al., 2017) found a smaller number of transitions in the CBT group compared with clinical management (19.2% v. 30.0%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance.",2224251445.0, Editorial,2019
61,"Error-related brain activity as a transdiagnostic endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and substance use disorder","Background Increased neural error-signals have been observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and inconsistently in depression. Reduced neural error-signals have been observed in substance use disorders (SUD). Thus, alterations in error-monitoring are proposed as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. To strengthen this notion, data from unaffected individuals with a family history for the respective disorders are needed. Methods The error-related negativity (ERN) as a neural indicator of error-monitoring was measured during a flanker task from 117 OCD patients, 50 unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients, and 130 healthy comparison participants. Family history information indicated, that 76 healthy controls were free of a family history for psychopathology, whereas the remaining had first-degree relatives with depression ( n = 28), anxiety ( n = 27), and/or SUD ( n = 27). Results Increased ERN amplitudes were found in OCD patients and unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients. In addition, unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with anxiety disorders were also characterized by increased ERN amplitudes, whereas relatives of individuals with SUD showed reduced amplitudes. Conclusions Alterations in neural error-signals in unaffected first-degree relatives with a family history of OCD, anxiety, or SUD support the utility of the ERN as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. Reduced neural error-signals may indicate vulnerability for under-controlled behavior and risk for substance use, whereas a harm- or error-avoidant response style and vulnerability for OCD and anxiety appears to be associated with increased ERN. This adds to findings suggesting a common neurobiological substrate across psychiatric disorders involving the anterior cingulate cortex and deficits in cognitive control.",2220071874.0, Journal Article,2019
62,"New onset of depression in aging women and men: contributions of social, psychological, behavioral, and somatic predictors in the community","Background Based on the vulnerability–stress model, we aimed to (1) determine new onset of depression in individuals who had not shown evidence of depression at baseline (5 years earlier) and (2) identify social, psychological, behavioral, and somatic predictors. Methods Longitudinal data of N = 10 036 participants (40–79 years) were evaluated who had no evidence of depression at baseline based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), no history of depression, or intake of antidepressants. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict the onset of depression. Results Prevalence of new cases of depression was 4.4%. Higher rates of women (5.1%) than men (3.8%) were due to their excess incidence &lt;60 years of age. Regression analyses revealed significant social, psychological, behavioral, and somatic predictors: loneliness [odds ratio (OR) 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48–2.71], generalized anxiety (OR 2.65; 1.79–3.85), social phobia (OR 1.87; 1.34–2.57), panic (OR 1.67; 1.01–2.64), type D personality (OR 1.85; 1.47–2.32), smoking (OR 1.35; 1.05–1.71), and comorbid cancer (OR 1.58; 1.09–2.24). Protective factors were age (OR 0.88; 0.83–0.93) and social support (OR 0.93; 0.90–0.95). Stratified by sex, cancer was predictive for women; for men smoking and life events. Entered additionally, the PHQ-9 baseline score was strongly predictive (OR 1.40; 1.34–1.47), generalized anxiety became only marginally, and panic was no longer predictive. Other predictors remained significant, albeit weaker. Conclusions Psychobiological vulnerability, stress, and illness-related factors were predictive of new onset of depression, whereas social support was protective. Baseline subclinical depression was an additional risk weakening the relationship between anxiety and depression by taking their overlap into account. Vulnerability factors differed between men and women.",2220071818.0, Journal Article,2019
63,A 6-year longitudinal study of predictors for suicide attempts in major depressive disorder,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD), represent a major source of risk for suicidality. However, knowledge about risk factors for future suicide attempts (SAs) within MDD is limited. The present longitudinal study examined a wide range of putative non-clinical risk factors (demographic, social, lifestyle, personality) and clinical risk factors (depressive and suicidal indicators) for future SAs among persons with MDD. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between a number of significant predictors and the incidence of a future SA. Methods Data are from 1713 persons (18–65 years) with a lifetime MDD at the baseline measurement of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety who were subsequently followed up 2, 4 and 6 years. SAs were assessed in the face-to-face measurements. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine a wide range of possible non-clinical and clinical predictors for subsequent SAs during 6-year follow-up. Results Over a period of 6 years, 3.4% of the respondents attempted suicide. Younger age, lower education, unemployment, insomnia, antidepressant use, a previous SA and current suicidal thoughts independently predicted a future SA. The number of significant risk factors (ranging from 0 to 7) linearly predicted the incidence of future SAs: in those with 0 predictors the SA incidence was 0%, which increased to 32% incidence in those with 6+ predictors. Conclusion Of the non-clinical factors, particularly socio-economic factors predicted a SA independently. Furthermore, preexisting suicidal ideation and insomnia appear to be important clinical risk factors for subsequent SA that are open to preventative intervention.",2272717991.0, Journal Article,2019
64,Hearing loss and psychiatric disorders: a review,"Hearing loss is one of the most common yet unrecognized impairments experienced by adults, especially as they age. Mental health investigators and practitioners require better understanding of hearing loss, its association with psychiatric disorders, and the treatment of these disorders in the presence of hearing loss as well as the treatment of hearing loss itself. In this review, the authors briefly explore the global burden of hearing loss. Next we provide an overview of the extant literature on hearing loss associated with cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety disorders, psychoses, and quality of life with attention focused on the strength of the association, possible mechanisms explaining the association, data on treatment options specific to these disorders, and future research opportunities for these disorders. Current approaches to the treatment of hearing loss are presented, including hearing aids, rehabilitation including psychotherapies, surgical procedures (specifically cochlear implants), and induction loops connected to telecoils. Finally, cutting edge research into the pathophysiology and potential biological treatments of hearing loss is described.",2272717918.0, Journal Article,2019
65,"Dimensional analysis of depressive, anxious and somatic symptoms presented by primary care patients and their relationship with ICD-11 PHC proposed diagnoses","Background A study conducted as part of the development of the Eleventh International Classification of Mental Disorders for Primary Health Care (ICD-11 PHC) provided an opportunity to test the relationships among depressive, anxious and somatic symptoms in PHC. Method Primary care physicians participating in the ICD-11 PHC field studies in five countries selected patients who presented with somatic symptoms not explained by known physical pathology by applying a 29-item screening on somatic complaints that were under study for bodily stress disorder. Patients were interviewed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised and assessed using two five-item scales that measure depressive and anxious symptoms. Structural models of anxious-depressive symptoms and somatic complaints were tested using a bi-factor approach. Results A total of 797 patients completed the study procedures. Two bi-factor models fit the data well: Model 1 had all symptoms loaded on a general factor, along with one of three specific depression, anxiety and somatic factors [ x 2 (627) = 741.016, p &lt; 0.0011, RMSEA = 0.015, CFI = 0.911, TLI = 0.9]. Model 2 had a general factor and two specific anxious depression and somatic factors [ x 2 (627) = 663.065, p = 0.1543, RMSEA = 0.008, CFI = 0.954, TLI = 0.948]. Conclusions These data along with those of previous studies suggest that depressive, anxious and somatic symptoms are largely different presentations of a common latent phenomenon. This study provides support for the ICD-11 PHC conceptualization of mood disturbance, especially anxious depression, as central among patients who present multiple somatic symptoms.",2193568343.0, Journal Article,2019
66,Posttraumatic psychopathology and the pace of the epigenetic clock: a longitudinal investigation,"Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and stress/trauma exposure are cross-sectionally associated with advanced DNA methylation age relative to chronological age. However, longitudinal inquiry and examination of associations between advanced DNA methylation age and a broader range of psychiatric disorders is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine if PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety, and alcohol-use disorders predicted acceleration of DNA methylation age over time (i.e. an increasing pace, or rate of advancement, of the epigenetic clock). Methods Genome-wide DNA methylation and a comprehensive set of psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses were assessed in 179 Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans who completed two assessments over the course of approximately 2 years. Two DNA methylation age indices (Horvath and Hannum), each a weighted index of an array of genome-wide DNA methylation probes, were quantified. The pace of the epigenetic clock was operationalized as change in DNA methylation age as a function of time between assessments. Results Analyses revealed that alcohol-use disorders ( p = 0.001) and PTSD avoidance and numbing symptoms ( p = 0.02) at Time 1 were associated with an increasing pace of the epigenetic clock over time, per the Horvath (but not the Hannum) index of cellular aging. Conclusions This is the first study to suggest that posttraumatic psychopathology is longitudinally associated with a quickened pace of the epigenetic clock. Results raise the possibility that accelerated cellular aging is a common biological consequence of stress-related psychopathology, which carries implications for identifying mechanisms of stress-related cellular aging and developing interventions to slow its pace.",2193568291.0, Journal Article,2019
67,"The symptomatology of psychological trauma in the aftermath of war (1945–1980): UK army veterans, civilians and emergency responders","Background UK veterans suffering from a psychological or psychiatric illness as a consequence of service in the Second World War were entitled to a war pension. Their case files, which include regular medical assessments, are a valuable resource to investigate the nature, distribution and duration of symptoms. Methods A standardised form was used to collect data from pension records of a random sample of 500 UK army veterans from the first presentation in the 1940s until 1980. Data were also gathered from 50 civilians and 54 emergency responders with a pension for post-traumatic illness following air-raids. Results The 10 most common symptoms reported by veterans were anxiety, depression, sleep problems, headache, irritability/anger, tremor/shaking, difficulty completing tasks, poor concentration, repeated fears and avoidance of social contact. Nine of the 10 were widely distributed across the veteran population when symptoms were ranked by the number of subjects who reported them. Nine symptoms persisted significantly longer in the veteran sample than in emergency responders. These included seven of the most common symptoms, together with two others: muscle pain and restlessness. The persistence of these symptoms in the veteran group suggests a post-traumatic illness linked to lengthy overseas service in combat units. Conclusions The nature and duration of symptoms exhibited by veterans may be associated with their experience of heightened risks. Exposure to severe or prolonged trauma seems to be associated with chronic multi-symptom illness, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and somatic expressions of pain that may delay or complicate the recovery process.",2193567063.0, Journal Article,2019
68,Anxiety and depression in adults with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to be at disproportionate risk of developing mental health comorbidities, with anxiety and depression being considered most prominent amongst these. Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the rates of anxiety and depression in adults with ASD and the impact of factors such as assessment methods and presence of comorbid intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis on estimated prevalence rates. Electronic database searches for studies published between January 2000 and September 2017 identified a total of 35 studies, including 30 studies measuring anxiety ( n = 26 070; mean age = 30.9, s.d. = 6.2 years) and 29 studies measuring depression ( n = 26 117; mean age = 31.1, s.d. = 6.8 years). The pooled estimation of current and lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27% and 42% for any anxiety disorder, and 23% and 37% for depressive disorder. Further analyses revealed that the use of questionnaire measures and the presence of ID may significantly influence estimates of prevalence. The current literature suffers from a high degree of heterogeneity in study method and an overreliance on clinical samples. These results highlight the importance of community-based studies and the identification and inclusion of well-characterized samples to reduce heterogeneity and bias in estimates of prevalence for comorbidity in adults with ASD and other populations with complex psychiatric presentations.",2178520884.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
69,Biomarker-based subtyping of depression and anxiety disorders using Latent Class Analysis. A NESDA study,"Background Etiological research of depression and anxiety disorders has been hampered by diagnostic heterogeneity. In order to address this, researchers have tried to identify more homogeneous patient subgroups. This work has predominantly focused on explaining interpersonal heterogeneity based on clinical features (i.e. symptom profiles). However, to explain interpersonal variations in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, it might be more effective to take biological heterogeneity as the point of departure when trying to identify subgroups. Therefore, this study aimed to identify data-driven subgroups of patients based on biomarker profiles. Methods Data of patients with a current depressive and/or anxiety disorder came from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a large, multi-site naturalistic cohort study ( n = 1460). Thirty-six biomarkers (e.g. leptin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tryptophan) were measured, as well as sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Latent class analysis of the discretized (lower 10%, middle, upper 10%) biomarkers were used to identify different patient clusters. Results The analyses resulted in three classes, which were primarily characterized by different levels of metabolic health: ‘lean’ (21.6%), ‘average’ (62.2%) and ‘overweight’ (16.2%). Inspection of the classes’ clinical features showed the highest levels of psychopathology, severity and medication use in the overweight class. Conclusions The identified classes were strongly tied to general (metabolic) health, and did not reflect any natural cutoffs along the lines of the traditional diagnostic classifications. Our analyses suggested that especially poor metabolic health could be seen as a distal marker for depression and anxiety, suggesting a relationship between the ‘overweight’ subtype and internalizing psychopathology.",2178520765.0, Journal Article,2019
70,Does online insomnia treatment reduce depressive symptoms? A randomized controlled trial in individuals with both insomnia and depressive symptoms,"Background Insomnia is effectively treated with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Previous research has suggested the effects might not be limited to sleep and insomnia severity, but also apply to depressive symptoms. Results, however, are mixed. Methods In this randomized controlled trial we investigated the effects of guided online CBT-I on depression and insomnia in people suffering from symptoms of both. Participants ( n = 104) with clinical insomnia and at least subclinical depression levels were randomized to (1) guided online CBT-I and sleep diary monitoring (i-Sleep) or (2) control group (sleep diary monitoring only). The primary outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item; PHQ-WS). Secondary outcomes were insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, fatigue, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. Results At post-test, participants in the i-Sleep condition reported significantly less depressive symptoms (PHQ-WS) compared with participants in the sleep-diary condition ( d = 0.76). Large significant effects were also observed for insomnia severity ( d = 2.36), most sleep diary parameters, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. Effects were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow-up. We did not find significant post-test effects on fatigue or total sleep time. Conclusions Findings indicate that guided online CBT-I is not only effective for insomnia complaints but also for depressive symptoms. The effects are large and comparable with those of depression therapy.

71,Affective problems and decline in cognitive state in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Evidence suggests that affective problems, such as depression and anxiety, increase risk for late-life dementia. However, the extent to which affective problems influence cognitive decline, even many years prior to clinical diagnosis of dementia, is not clear. The present study systematically reviews and synthesises the evidence for the association between affective problems and decline in cognitive state (i.e., decline in non-specific cognitive function) in older adults. An electronic search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect was conducted to identify studies of the association between depression and anxiety separately and decline in cognitive state. Key inclusion criteria were prospective, longitudinal designs with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment using the STROBE checklist were conducted independently by two raters. A total of 34 studies ( n = 71 244) met eligibility criteria, with 32 studies measuring depression ( n = 68 793), and five measuring anxiety ( n = 4698). A multi-level meta-analysis revealed that depression assessed as a binary predictor (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05–1.76, p = 0.02) or a continuous predictor ( B = −0.008, 95% CI −0.015 to −0.002, p = 0.012; OR 0.992, 95% CI 0.985–0.998) was significantly associated with decline in cognitive state. The number of anxiety studies was insufficient for meta-analysis, and they are described in a narrative review. Results of the present study improve current understanding of the temporal nature of the association between affective problems and decline in cognitive state. They also suggest that cognitive function may need to be monitored closely in individuals with affective disorders, as these individuals may be at particular risk of greater cognitive decline.",2166019290.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
72,Links between psychotic and neurotic symptoms in the general population: an analysis of longitudinal British National Survey data using Directed Acyclic Graphs,"Background Non-psychotic affective symptoms are important components of psychotic syndromes. They are frequent and are now thought to influence the emergence of paranoia and hallucinations. Evidence supporting this model of psychosis comes from recent cross-fertilising epidemiological and intervention studies. Epidemiological studies identify plausible targets for intervention but must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, causal inference can be strengthened substantially using modern statistical methods. Methods Directed Acyclic Graphs were used in a dynamic Bayesian network approach to learn the overall dependence structure of chosen variables. DAG-based inference identifies the most likely directional links between multiple variables, thereby locating them in a putative causal cascade. We used initial and 18-month follow-up data from the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity survey ( N = 8580 and N = 2406). Results We analysed persecutory ideation, hallucinations, a range of affective symptoms and the effects of cannabis and problematic alcohol use. Worry was central to the links between symptoms, with plausible direct effects on insomnia, depressed mood and generalised anxiety, and recent cannabis use. Worry linked the other affective phenomena with paranoia. Hallucinations were connected only to worry and persecutory ideation. General anxiety, worry, sleep problems, and persecutory ideation were strongly self-predicting. Worry and persecutory ideation were connected over the 18-month interval in an apparent feedback loop. Conclusions These results have implications for understanding dynamic processes in psychosis and for targeting psychological interventions. The reciprocal influence of worry and paranoia implies that treating either symptom is likely to ameliorate the other.",2166018472.0, Journal Article,2019
73,Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality predict next-day suicidal ideation: an ecological momentary assessment study,"Background Sleep problems are a modifiable risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Yet, sparse research has examined temporal relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and psychological factors implicated in suicide, such as entrapment. This is the first in-the-moment investigation of relationships between suicidal ideation, objective and subjective sleep parameters, and perceptions of entrapment. Methods Fifty-one participants with current suicidal ideation completed week-long ecological momentary assessments. An actigraph watch was worn for the duration of the study, which monitored total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep latency. Daily sleep diaries captured subjective ratings of the same sleep parameters, with the addition of sleep quality. Suicidal ideation and entrapment were measured at six quasi-random time points each day. Multi-level random intercept models and moderation analyses were conducted to examine the links between sleep, entrapment, and suicidal ideation, adjusting for anxiety and depression severity. Results Analyses revealed a unidirectional relationship whereby short sleep duration (both objective and subjective measures), and poor sleep quality, predicted the higher severity of next-day suicidal ideation. However, there was no significant association between daytime suicidal ideation and sleep the following night. Sleep quality moderated the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening levels of suicidal ideation. Conclusions This is the first study to report night-to-day relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and entrapment. Findings suggest that sleep quality may alter the strength of the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening suicidal ideation. Clinically, results underscore the importance of assessing and treating sleep disturbance when working with those experiencing suicidal ideation.",2166017445.0, Journal Article,2019
74,Clinical implications of the proposed ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic criteria,"Background Projected changes to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria in the upcoming International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 may affect the prevalence and severity of identified cases. This study examined differences in rates, severity, and overlap of diagnoses using ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic criteria during consecutive assessments of recent survivors of traumatic events. Methods The study sample comprised 3863 survivors of traumatic events, evaluated in 11 longitudinal studies of PTSD. ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnostic rules were applied to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to derive ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses at different time intervals between trauma occurrence and 15 months. Results The ICD-11 criteria identified fewer cases than the ICD-10 across assessment intervals (range −47.09% to −57.14%). Over 97% of ICD-11 PTSD cases met concurrent ICD-10 PTSD criteria. PTSD symptom severity of individuals identified by the ICD-11 criteria (CAPS total scores) was 31.38–36.49% higher than those identified by ICD-10 criteria alone. The latter, however, had CAPS scores indicative of moderate PTSD. ICD-11 was associated with similar or higher rates of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Individuals identified by either ICD-10 or ICD-11 shortly after traumatic events had similar longitudinal course. Conclusions This study indicates that significantly fewer individuals would be diagnosed with PTSD using the proposed ICD-11 criteria. Though ICD-11 criteria identify more severe cases, those meeting ICD-10 but not ICD-11 criteria remain in the moderate range of PTSD symptoms. Use of ICD-11 criteria will have critical implications for case identification in clinical practice, national reporting, and research.",2166017313.0, Journal Article,2019
75,A comparative network analysis of eating disorder psychopathology and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms before and after treatment,"Background Network analysis is an emerging approach in the study of psychopathology, yet few applications have been seen in eating disorders (EDs). Furthermore, little research exists regarding changes in network strength after interventions. Therefore the present study examined the network structures of ED and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms before and after treatment for EDs. Method Participants from residential or partial hospital ED treatment programs ( N = 446) completed assessments upon admission and discharge. Networks were estimated using regularized Graphical Gaussian Models using 38 items from the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results ED symptoms with high centrality indices included a desire to lose weight, guilt about eating, shape overvaluation, and wanting an empty stomach, while restlessness, self-esteem, lack of energy, and feeling overwhelmed bridged ED to depression and anxiety symptoms. Comparisons between admission and discharge networks indicated the global network strength did not change significantly, though symptom severity decreased. Participants with denser networks at admission evidenced less change in ED symptomatology during treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that symptoms related to shape and weight concerns and guilt are central ED symptoms, while physical symptoms, self-esteem, and feeling overwhelmed are links that may underlie comorbidities in EDs. Results provided some support for the validity of network approaches, in that admission networks conveyed prognostic information. However, the lack of correspondence between symptom reduction and change in network strength indicates that future research is needed to examine network dynamics in the context of intervention and relapse prevention.",2187587471.0, Journal Article,2019
76,Genetic risk for neuroticism predicts emotional health depending on childhood adversity,"Background Existing evidence for gene × environment interaction (G × E) in neuroticism largely relies on candidate gene studies, although neuroticism is highly polygenic. This study aimed to investigate the long-term associations between polygenic risk scores for neuroticism (PRS N ), objective childhood adversity and their interplay on emotional health aspects such as neuroticism itself, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness and life satisfaction. Methods The sample consisted of reared-apart (TRA) and reared-together (TRT) middle- and old age twins ( N = 699; median age at separation = 2). PRS N were created under nine p value cut-off thresholds ( p T -s) and the p T with the highest degree of neuroticism variance explained was chosen for subsequent analyses. Linear regressions were used to assess the associations between PRS N , childhood adversity (being reared apart) and emotional health. G × E was further investigated using a discordant twin design. Results PRS N explained up to 1.7% ( p T &lt; 0.01) of phenotypic neuroticism in the total sample. Analyses across two separation groups revealed substantial heterogeneity in the variance explained by PRS N ; 4.3% was explained in TRT, but almost no effect was observed in TRA. Similarly, PRS N explained 4% and 1.7% of the variance in depressive symptoms and loneliness, respectively, only in TRT. A significant G × E interaction was identified for depressive symptoms. Conclusions By taking advantage of a unique sample of adopted twins, we demonstrated the presence of G × E in neuroticism and emotional health using PRS N and childhood adversity. Our results may indicate that genome-wide association studies are detecting genetic main effects associated with neuroticism, but not those susceptible to early environmental influences.",2187586237.0, Journal Article,2019
77,"Association between traumatic stress load, psychopathology, and cognition in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort","Background Traumatic stressors during childhood and adolescence are associated with psychopathology, mostly studied in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We investigated broader associations of traumatic stress exposure with psychopathology and cognition in a youth community sample. Methods The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort ( N = 9498) is an investigation of clinical and neurobehavioral phenotypes in a diverse (56% Caucasian, 33% African American, 11% other) US youth community population (aged 8–21). Participants were ascertained through children's hospital pediatric (not psychiatric) healthcare network in 2009–2011. Structured psychiatric evaluation included screening for lifetime exposure to traumatic stressors, and a neurocognitive battery was administered. Results Exposure rate to traumatic stressful events was high (none, N = 5204; one, N = 2182; two, N = 1092; three or more, N = 830). Higher stress load was associated with increased psychopathology across all clinical domains evaluated: mood/anxiety (standardized β = .378); psychosis spectrum ( β = .360); externalizing behaviors ( β = .311); and fear ( β = .256) (controlling for covariates, all p &lt; 0.001). Associations remained significant controlling for lifetime PTSD and depression. Exposure to high-stress load was robustly associated with suicidal ideation and cannabis use (odds ratio compared with non-exposed 5.3 and 3.2, respectively, both p &lt; 0.001). Among youths who experienced traumatic stress ( N = 4104), history of assaultive trauma was associated with greater psychopathology and, in males, vulnerability to psychosis and externalizing symptoms. Stress load was negatively associated with performance on executive functioning, complex reasoning, and social cognition. Conclusions Traumatic stress exposure in community non-psychiatric help-seeking youth is substantial, and is associated with more severe psychopathology and neurocognitive deficits across domains, beyond PTSD and depression.",2187585670.0, Journal Article,2019
78,"Decision-making ability in psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the magnitude, specificity and correlates of impaired performance on the Iowa and Cambridge Gambling Tasks","To identify factors which may help or hinder decision-making ability in people with psychosis, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of their performance on the Iowa and Cambridge Gambling Tasks. Analysis of 47 samples found they had moderately poorer performance than healthy individuals ( N = 4264, g = −0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.66 to −0.48). Few studies ( k = 8) used non-psychotic clinical comparator groups, although very low-quality evidence ( k = 3) found people with bipolar disorder may perform better. Negative symptoms ( k = 13, N = 648, r = −0.17, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.07) and lower IQ ( k = 11, N = 525, r = 0.20, 95% CI 0.29–0.10), but not positive symptoms ( k = 10, N = 512, r = −0.01, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.08), each had small-moderate associations with poorer decision-making. Lower quality evidence suggested general symptoms, working memory, social functioning, awareness of emotional responses to information, and attentional bias towards gain are associated with decision-making, but not education, executive functioning or overall symptoms. Meta-regression suggested an inverse association between decision-making and depression severity ( k = 6, Q = 6.41, R 2 100%, p = 0.01). Those taking first-generation ( k = 6, N = 305, g = −0.17, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.06, p = 0.147) or low-dose antipsychotics ( k = 5, N = 442, g = −0.19, 95% CI −0.44 to 0.06, p = 0.139) had unimpaired decision-making. Although meta-regression found no linear association between dose and performance, non-reporting of the dose was common and associated with larger impairments ( k = 46, Q = 4.71, R 2 14%, p = 0.03). Those supporting people with psychosis to make decisions, including treatment decisions, should consider the potential effect of these factors. Interventionist-causal trials are required to test whether reducing antipsychotic dose and treating anxiety and depression can improve decision-making in this group.",2157826540.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
79,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and risk for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in siblings,"Background Probands with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The risk of these disorders among the siblings of probands has not been thoroughly assessed in a population-based cohort. Methods Every child born in Finland in 1991–2005 and diagnosed with ADHD in 1995–2011 were identified from national registers. Each case was matched with four controls on sex, place, and date of birth. The full siblings of the cases and controls were born in 1981–2007 and diagnosed in 1981–2013. In total, 7369 cases with 12 565 siblings and 23 181 controls with 42 753 siblings were included in the analyses conducted using generalized estimating equations. Results 44.2% of the cases and 22.2% of the controls had at least one sibling diagnosed with any psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder (risk ratio, RR = 2.1; 95% CI 2.0–2.2). The strongest associations were demonstrated for childhood-onset disorders including ADHD (RR = 5.7; 95% CI 5.1–6.3), conduct and oppositional disorders (RR = 4.0; 95% CI 3.5–4.5), autism spectrum disorders (RR = 3.9; 95% CI 3.3–4.6), other emotional and social interaction disorders (RR = 2.7; 95% CI 2.4–3.1), learning and coordination disorders (RR = 2.6; 95% CI 2.4–2.8), and intellectual disability (RR = 2.4; 95% CI 2.0–2.8). Also, bipolar disorder, unipolar mood disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, other neurotic and personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, and anxiety disorders occurred at increased frequency among the siblings of cases. Conclusions The results offer potential utility for early identification of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in at-risk siblings of ADHD probands and also argue for more studies on common etiologies.",2157825899.0, Journal Article,2019
80,"Not urbanization level but socioeconomic, physical and social neighbourhood characteristics are associated with presence and severity of depressive and anxiety disorders","Background Which neighbourhood factors most consistently impact on depression and anxiety remains unclear. This study examines whether objectively obtained socioeconomic, physical and social aspects of the neighbourhood in which persons live are associated with the presence and severity of depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods Cross-sectional data are from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety including participants ( n = 2980) with and without depressive and anxiety disorders in the past year (based on DSM-based psychiatric interviews). We also determined symptom severity of depression (Inventory of Depression Symptomatology), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and fear (Fear Questionnaire). Neighbourhood characteristics comprised socioeconomic factors (socioeconomic status, home value, number of social security beneficiaries and percentage of immigrants), physical factors (air pollution, traffic noise and availability of green space and water) and social factors (social cohesion and safety). Multilevel regression analyses were performed with the municipality as the second level while adjusting for individual sociodemographic variables and household income. Results Not urbanization grade, but rather neighbourhood socioecononomic factors (low socioeconomic status, more social security beneficiaries and more immigrants), physical factors (high levels of traffic noise) and social factors (lower social cohesion and less safety) were associated with the presence of depressive and anxiety disorders. Most of these neighbourhood characteristics were also associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptoms severity. Conclusion These findings suggest that it is not population density in the neighbourhood, but rather the quality of socioeconomic, physical and social neighbourhood characteristics that is associated with the presence and severity of affective disorders.",2157825209.0, Journal Article,2019
