69,Maximizing the generalization of fear extinction: Exposures to a peak generalization stimulus,"Experimental research has shown that generalization of fear extinction from a generalization stimulus (GS) is minimal compared to generalization of fear extinction from the conditional stimulus itself (CS+). This poses a challenge to extinction-based treatments of anxiety because the exact CS is often not known or unavailable. However, experimental studies failed to disentangle differences in stimulus identity (CS + or GS) from differences in the level of fear (GS typically elicits less fear than CS+). Here, we test the hypothesis that a high level of fear is key to extinction learning and generalization, rather than the identity of the stimulus under extinction (CS + or GS). For that purpose, we took advantage of the peak-shift phenomenon that describes the conditions under which a GS can elicit equal or higher levels of responding, compared to the CS+. Hence, we compared the generalizability of fear extinction following exposure to the CS + itself, to a ‘weak’ GS that elicits less fear, and to a ‘peak’ GS that elicits as much fear as the CS+. First, the results replicated, with a new set of stimuli, the observation that extinction of a skin conductance response and US-expectancy generalizes only weakly from a weak GS to CS+. Second, extinction generalized strongly from a peak GS towards CS+, as hypothesized. Third, extinction with the peak GS even outperformed extinction with the CS+, as it generalized more strongly across the generalization gradient. Together, these results support exposure treatment strategies that focus on the fear-eliciting potential of stimuli (often described as a fear hierarchy), rather than their learning history. We propose that stimulus typicality and/or intensity may explain the enhanced effects of a ‘peak’ GS over the CS+ in enhancing the generalization of fear extinction.",2159932691.0, Journal Article,2018
70,The validity of human avoidance paradigms,"Excessive avoidance towards innocuous cues is a central diagnostic criterion across anxiety-related disorders. Relevant laboratory paradigms typically include instrumental learning procedures, where the presentation of an aversive cue (e.g., a shock) can be prevented by executing an experimenter-defined response (e.g., a button press) during the presentation of a warning cue (e.g., a square). Despite the popularity of these paradigms, there is no evaluation of how well the experimental findings of conditioned avoidance extend to maladaptive avoidance, or whether findings from animal studies could be informative for human studies. Here, we present a validation of the conditioned avoidance paradigm. We show that although this procedure meets the majority of the tested validity criteria (i.e. face, construct, predictive, and diagnostic validity), it also faces a number of challenges, including the non-consideration of individual differences in learning or the use of procedures that cannot be easily translated to clinical settings. For meeting these challenges, we suggest extensions of the paradigm including the test of individual differences by using ambiguous stimuli as well as the use of virtual reality procedures. Our main conclusion is that despite the significant knowledge provided in conditioned avoidance paradigms, their expansion will allow reaching more theoretical and clinical insights.",2159932577.0, Journal Article,2018
71,Model-based learning and individual differences in depression: The moderating role of stress,"Inflexible decision-making has been proposed as a transdiagnostic risk factor for mood disorders. Evidence suggests that inflexible decision-making may emerge only when individuals are experiencing increased negative affect or stress. 151 participants completed symptom measures of depression and anxiety, followed by a two-stage decision-making task that distinguishes between habitual and goal-directed choice. An experimental manipulation to induce stress was introduced halfway through the task. Individuals with higher depression levels became less model-based after the manipulation than those with lower depression levels. There was no relationship between trait anxiety and the impact of the manipulation on decision-making. Controlling for main effects of anxiety did not attenuate the association between depression and impact of stress. Anhedonia was associated with the impact of the manipulation on model-based decision-making. These results suggest that risk for depression is associated with reflexive decision-making, but these effects may only emerge under conditions of stress.",2159932300.0, Journal Article,2018
72,Improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) for people with bipolar disorder: Summary of outcomes from the IAPT demonstration site,"Access to structured psychological therapy recommended for bipolar disorder (BD) is poor. The UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies initiative commissioned a demonstration site for BD to explore the outcomes of routine delivery of psychological therapy in clinical practice, which this report summarises. All clinically diagnosed patients with BD who wanted a psychological intervention and were not in acute mood episode were eligible. Patients were offered a 10-session group intervention (Mood on Track) which delivered NICE congruent care. Outcomes were evaluated using an open (uncontrolled), pre-post design. Access to psychological therapy increased compared to preceding 6 years by 54%. 202 people began treatment; 81% completed &gt;5 sessions; median 9 sessions (range 6–11). Pre-post outcomes included personal recovery (primary outcome), quality of life, work and social functioning, mood and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes). Personal recovery significantly improved from pre to post-therapy; medium effect-size (d = 0.52). Secondary outcomes all improved (except mania symptoms) with smaller effect sizes (d = 0.20–0.39). Patient satisfaction was high. Use of crisis services, and acute admissions were reduced compared to pre-treatment. It is possible to deliver group psychological therapy for bipolar disorder in a routine NHS setting. Improvements were observed in personal recovery, symptoms and wider functioning with high patient satisfaction and reduced service use.",2159932285.0, Journal Article,2018
73,Time of day effects on the relationship between daily sleep and anxiety: An ecological momentary assessment approach,"Previous research has linked sleep disturbance to anxiety. However, evidence for this relation has been inconsistent, largely limited to retrospective reports that do not account for daily variability, and silent on when the association is most pronounced. Thus, the present study utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the effects of daily deviations in total sleep time (TST) and person-average TST on anxiety and whether these effects varied as a function of time of day in a sample of unselected adults (N = 138). Results indicate that the amount of TST on a given night, relative to personal average TST, negatively predicted anxiety, and this relation was significant in the morning and afternoon, but not evening. In contrast, person-average TST was unrelated to average anxiety. Relations between TST and anxiety did not differ across objective (e.g., actigraphy) and subjective (e.g., sleep diary) measures. Furthermore, the pattern of results remained the same when controlling for previous day's anxiety and were not bidirectional. These findings suggest that getting less sleep than is typical for the individual predicts subsequent anxiety, and this effect is particularly strong in the morning. Average sleep duration may be less important to the experience of anxiety than deviations from that average. These findings highlight the importance of EMA to examine how and when variability in sleep confers vulnerability for anxiety symptoms.",2159932128.0, Journal Article,2018
74,Susceptibility to others' emotions moderates immediate self-reported and biological stress responses to witnessing trauma,"Background The peri-traumatic stress response is a strong predictor of symptom development after trauma exposure. Regarding witnessing trauma, the stress response might depend on the susceptibility to others' emotions (emotional contagion, EC). This study investigated whether EC moderates the immediate stress response using a trauma film paradigm. Methods Ninety-five healthy participants were randomly exposed to a trauma or a neutral film. Perceived stressfulness of the film and pre-to post-film changes in self-reported anxiety, heart rate and saliva cortisol levels were assessed. EC towards negative and positive emotions was measured using the emotional contagion scale and its emotion-specific subscales. Results Overall, the trauma film was perceived as distressing and elicited an increase in self-reported anxiety, heart rate and saliva cortisol levels relative to the neutral film. EC towards negative emotions was positively related to the perceived stressfulness of the film, increased anxiety and increased heart rate. The association with saliva cortisol levels was also in the expected direction, but not statistically significant. These associations were not found for EC towards positive emotions. Discussion EC towards negative emotions may be an important predictor of trauma exposure outcomes. Further research should clarify its specific contribution in witnessing and undergoing trauma.",2127424688.0, Journal Article,2018
75,Exercise as a buffer against difficulties with emotion regulation: A pathway to emotional wellbeing,"Though exercise is associated with emotional health, it remains unclear what psychological processes account for this relationship. The present study explores emotional recovery from and responses to stress as links. It extends prior research by exploring whether poor response tendencies, such as a ruminative response style, could mediate the relationship between regular exercise and clinical symptoms, and whether acute exercise facilitates emotional recovery from a stressor in a heterogeneous sample comprising sedentary as well as active individuals and those reporting mood and anxiety symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires, performed 30 min of cycling or stretching, and underwent a stressful speech task. State affect and difficulties with emotion regulation and rumination were measured at various time points. Minimal regular exercise predicted more depression, anxiety, and stress, and cross-sectional data suggest that poor stress response tendencies (more habitual rumination and low coping self-efficacy) could partially mediate these relationships. Relative to stretching, prior exercise did not affect initial reactions to the stressor or reports of struggling to regulate one's emotions. However, it attenuated the effects that rumination and difficulties with emotion regulation had on delaying emotional recovery. Results suggest that enhanced emotional resilience to the prolonged effects of stress accounts, at least in part, for the emotional benefits of regular exercise. There appear to be benefits afforded by even single sessions of exercise and cumulative benefits from regular activity for coping with stress.",2117582348.0, Journal Article,2018
76,An experimental test of the impact of adolescent anxiety on parental sick role reinforcement behavior,"A large body of work links parental sick role reinforcement behavior to adolescent panic vulnerability. To date, however, little work has examined the role of the adolescent in this process. The current study addressed this gap in the literature, using a novel method to experimentally test the impact of adolescent anxiety during a straw-breathing task on parental propensity to engage in sick role reinforcement behavior. An unselected sample of 51 early adolescents (26 female, 10–14 years) and their parents participated in the study. Adolescents were trained to mimic a straw-breathing task, and adolescent reactions to the task were scripted. Parents were randomly assigned to watch their adolescent react either a) anxiously or b) non-anxiously to the straw-breathing task. Parents who viewed their adolescent react anxiously ended the task earlier, reported that they would reinforce more sick role behavior, and reported more negatively valenced reactions during the task than parents who viewed their adolescent react non-anxiously to the task. No group differences emerged in terms of parental self-reported or physiological arousal during the task. Results suggest that adolescent anxiety increases parental sick role reinforcement behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of future directions for reducing parenting behaviors thought to increase vulnerability for panic among adolescents.",2117578525.0, Journal Article,2018
77,A randomized controlled trial of three smartphone apps for enhancing public mental health,"Many smartphone applications (apps) for mental health (MHapps) are available to the public. However, few have been the subject of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the change processes that are hypothesized to mediate claimed effects have not been previously studied. This RCT compared the efficacy of three publicly available MHapps to a waitlist control condition in a community sample, in which no MHapp was provided. The three MHapps included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) toolkit app MoodKit, mood tracking app MoodPrism, and CBT strategy app MoodMission. Participants were randomly allocated to each condition, completed a baseline assessment, downloaded their allocated MHapp, and completed a second assessment 30 days later, with n = 226 included in final analyses (81% female; M age = 34 years). Compared to the control condition, all MHapp groups experienced increases in mental wellbeing, MoodKit and MoodMission groups experienced decreases in depression, and no groups experienced effects on anxiety. Mediated regressions revealed that increasing coping self-efficacy, rather than emotional self-awareness or mental health literacy, was the underlying process contributing to effects on mental health for all three MHapps. MHapps appear to be an effective solution for improving public mental health, notably by improving users' confidence in their ability to cope.",2117385937.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
78,Fathers' challenging parenting behavior predicts less subsequent anxiety symptoms in early childhood,"Recent theories propose that (especially fathers') challenging parenting behavior (CPB) serves to reduce offspring's anxiety development, and that fearful children are more susceptible to parenting. Using a longitudinal design we explored whether more CPB (and less overprotection) of both parents, (1) separately, (2) relatively, and (3) jointly predicts less anxiety in early childhood, and (4) whether child fearful temperament moderates these relations. Participants were 132 couples with their first-born child. Child fearful temperament was observed at 4 months and 1 year, and parents' CPB and overprotection at 1 and 2.5 years. Child anxiety symptoms were assessed at 2.5 and 4.5 years. Multilevel analyses showed that more CPB and, unexpectedly, more overprotection predicted less child anxiety. Relatively, fathers' CPB and mothers' overprotection predicted less anxiety. An interaction showed that if one parent shows low CPB, the other parent's higher CPB predicts less child anxiety. A trend interaction suggested that fathers' CPB predicts less anxiety most strongly for fearful children. Thus, fathers' CPB appears to play a protective role in anxiety development, possibly in particular for children most vulnerable to develop anxiety problems. Parents can compensate for a less challenging partner. The finding that maternal overprotection mitigates child anxiety requires further investigation.",2117384449.0, Journal Article,2018
79,Does a novel training in mental imagery reduce pathological worry?,"Worry is a verbal and abstract thought activity with only little mental imagery involved. It has been shown that this processing bias leads to hampered emotional processing of worry topics so that worry is maintained in the long run. However, there is some evidence that mental imagery during worrying has the opposite effect: It leads to stronger emotional reactions than verbal thoughts and thereby fosters emotional processing of worry topics. In the present study, we examined whether training mental imagery reduces pathological worry. We compared the effect of a novel training in mental imagery (TMI; n = 37) on various worry-related outcomes to a control training in verbal thinking (TVT; n = 38) and a waiting-list control group (n = 36) in a sample of pathologically high worriers. Both trainings showed significant within-group decline regarding e.g. pathological worry activity, worry-related impairment and anxiety assessed both one and five weeks after the training. Cohen's d on different outcome measures ranged from .39 to 1.17. However, unexpectedly, there were no significant differences between groups on any worry- or affect-related outcome measures. In, sum our training in general mental imagery skills turned out to be a promising intervention for the reduction of pathological worry. However, we found a training in verbal thinking to also have unexpected beneficial effects. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings and methodological limitations of our study are discussed.",2117380882.0, Journal Article,2018
80,Novelty-facilitated extinction and the reinstatement of conditional human fear,"Although contemporary treatments for anxiety disorders are very efficient in reducing anxiety, return of fear after successful treatment is common which signifies a need for interventions that have a more enduring outcome. A recent laboratory study suggested that novelty-facilitated extinction, a simple modification of standard extinction which involves presenting a novel non-aversive stimulus during extinction, prevents spontaneous recovery, one laboratory analogue of return of fear. The current study assessed whether novelty-facilitated extinction can also prevent reinstatement, a second laboratory analogue of return of fear. Following differential fear conditioning, one group of participants underwent standard extinction training whereas the second was presented with a novel tone after the conditional stimulus that previously predicted the aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Three presentations of the USs alone reinstated differential electrodermal fear responses after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction. Moreover, replicating previous findings, the extent of return of fear was correlated with self-reported intolerance of uncertainty after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction. These results support the proposal that novelty-facilitated extinction training can reduce the extent of return of fear.",2117377616.0, Journal Article,2018
81,Cost-effectiveness and long-term follow-up of three forms of minimal-contact cognitive behaviour therapy for severe health anxiety: Results from a randomised controlled trial,"Strategies to increase the availability of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for severe health anxiety (SHA) are needed, and this study investigated the cost-effectiveness and long-term efficacy of three forms of minimal-contact CBT for SHA. We hypothesised that therapist-guided internet CBT (G-ICBT), unguided internet CBT (U-ICBT), and cognitive behavioural bibliotherapy (BIB-CBT) would all be more cost-effective than a waiting-list condition (WLC), as assessed over the main phase of the trial. We also hypothesised that improvements would remain stable up to one-year follow-up. Adults (N = 132) with principal SHA were randomised to 12 weeks of G-ICBT, U-ICBT, BIB-CBT, or WLC. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, or the between-group difference in per capita costs divided by the between-group difference in proportion of participants in remission. The Health anxiety inventory (HAI) was the primary efficacy outcome. G-ICBT, U-ICBT, and BIB-CBT were more cost-effective than the WLC. Over the follow-up period, the G-ICBT and BIB-CBT groups made further improvements in health anxiety, whereas the U-ICBT group did not change. As expected, all three treatments were cost-effective with persistent long-term effects. CBT without therapist support appears to be a valuable alternative to G-ICBT for scaling up treatment for SHA.",2099980221.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
82,Excessive generalisation of conditioned fear in trait anxious individuals under ambiguity,"Trait anxiety has been widely accepted as a vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety disorders. However, few studies have examined how trait anxiety may affect fear generalisation, which is believed to be a core feature of anxiety disorders. Using a single-cue conditioning paradigm, the current study found a range of discrete generalisation gradients in both expectancy ratings and skin conductance, which were highly consistent with participants’ reported abstract rules. Trait anxious participants showed the same level of threat expectancy to the conditioned cue as low anxious participants. However they showed over-generalisation to novel test stimuli, but only when they failed to identify a clear rule. This result suggests that over-generalisation of fear may be a special case of the more general principle that trait anxiety is associated with excessive threat appraisal under conditions of ambiguity.",2099979106.0, Journal Article,2018
83,Autobiographical memory retrieval and appraisal in social anxiety disorder,"Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SADs; n = 41) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 40) were administered the Waterloo Images and Memories Interview, in which they described mental images that they tend to experience in both anxiety-provoking and non-anxiety-provoking social situations. Participants then recalled, in as much detail as possible, specific autobiographical memories of salient aversive and non-aversive social experiences that they believed led to the formation of these images. Audio-recorded memory narratives were transcribed and coded based on the procedure of the Autobiographical Interview, which provides a precise measure of the degree of episodic detail contained within each memory. Participants also rated the subjective properties of their recalled memories. Results revealed that participants across the two groups retrieved equivalent rates of both aversive and non-aversive social memories. However, SAD participants' memories of aversive events contained significantly more episodic detail than those of HCs, suggesting that they may be more highly accessible. Moreover, participants with SAD appraised their memories of aversive experiences as more distressing and intrusive than HCs, and perceived them as having a significantly greater influence on their self-perception. In contrast, no group differences were observed for memories of non-aversive events. Findings have the potential to shed new light on autobiographical memory in SAD, with implications for psychotherapeutic intervention.",2099979104.0, Journal Article,2018
84,"Pavlovian extinction of fear with the original conditional stimulus, a generalization stimulus, or multiple generalization stimuli","Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is derived from Pavlovian extinction learning. With the aim of optimizing exposure therapy, the present study evaluated the effects of multiple extinction stimuli on inhibitory learning. In a differential fear conditioning procedure, participants were randomized to one of three extinction conditions: Extinction_CS+ received nine presentations of the original conditional stimulus (CS+); Extinction_Singular received nine presentations of a generalization stimulus (GS; stimulus similar to the CS+); and Extinction_Variety received one presentation each of nine GSs. One week later, participants returned for extinction test to the CS+, CS-, a GS from Extinction_Variety (Variable_GS), the GS from Extinction_Singular (Single_GS), and a novel GS (Novel_GS). Results showed that Extinction_CS+ exhibited less fear of the CS+ than Extinction_Singular (two dependent measures) and Extinction_Variety (three dependent measures). Additionally, Extinction_Singular had more fear of the Variable_GS than Extinction_Variety (two dependent measures) and Extinction_CS+ (one dependent measure). The results suggest that conducting extinction to the CS+ lessens conditional fear of the CS + more than extinction with GSs. Additionally, extinction with a variety of GSs lessens fear of those GSs more than repeated extinction with one GS. Results are discussed with relevance to exposure therapy for anxiety disorders.",2099978728.0, Journal Article,2018
85,Change in anxiety sensitivity and substance use coping motives as putative mediators of treatment efficacy among substance users,"Objective: Anxiety sensitivity and coping motives for substance use are processes implicated in anxiety and substance use disorder (SUD) comorbidity, and are malleable treatment targets. Little is known about whether changes in anxiety sensitivity or coping motives during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders (with or without CBT for SUD) mediate substance use outcomes among patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and SUD. We examined whether changes in anxiety sensitivity and coping motives during treatment for comorbid SUD and anxiety disorders (either CBT for SUD only or CBT for SUD and anxiety disorders) were associated with substance use outcomes. Methods: Repeated measurements of anxiety sensitivity and coping motives throughout treatment were examined from a randomized clinical trial comparing usual, CBT-based treatment at a substance use disorder specialty clinic (UC) to that usual care plus a brief CBT for anxiety program for patients with comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders (CALM ARC). Results: Anxiety sensitivity decline during treatment was significantly steeper among those who received CALM ARC than those in UC. Decreases in anxiety sensitivity mediated the effect of treatment group on alcohol use following treatment such that the greater reduction in anxiety sensitivity in CALM ARC explained the superior outcomes for alcohol use in CALM ARC compared to UC. Declines in substance use coping motives were not observed in either condition, and did not differ between CALM ARC and UC. Thus, declines in coping motives did not mediate substance use after treatment. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting alcohol use outcomes were related to decreasing anxiety sensitivity rather than decreasing coping motives. Implications and future directions are discussed.d coping motives for substance use are processes implicated in anxiety and substance use disorder (SUD) comorbidity, and are malleable treatment targets.

86,Who needs more than standard care? Treatment moderators in a randomized clinical trial comparing addiction treatment alone to addiction treatment plus anxiety disorder treatment for comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders,"Introduction: Understanding for whom treatments exert their greatest effects is crucial for prescriptive recommendations that can improve overall treatment efficacy. Anxiety and substance use disorder comorbidity is prevalent and a significant public health concern. Little is known about who should receive specialized, integrated treatments to address both problems. This study aimed to examine baseline patient characteristics that predict differential outcome between typical treatment for substance use disorders (UC) compared to that treatment combined with cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders (UC + CALM ARC). Methods: We examined several putative treatment moderators in a dataset of community-based participants (N = 75) from a randomized clinical trial at an outpatient community substance use disorder (SUD) specialty clinic. Participants who met criteria for any anxiety disorder and any SUD were randomized to UC (the Intensive Outpatient Program at the clinic) or UC + CALM ARC. Outcome measures included anxiety symptoms, drug use, and alcohol use, and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a 6-month follow-up assessment. Results: Older age and female gender were associated with greater improvement on anxiety outcomes in UC + CALM ARC compared to UC. The presence of an alcohol use disorder was associated with greater improvement in alcohol use in UC + CALM ARC compared to UC. Higher opiate-related withdrawal symptoms and the presence of more SUDs were associated with greater improvement in drug use outcomes in UC + CALM ARC compared to UC. Conclusions: Several pre-treatment characteristics are associated with a return of symptoms for those who receive only UC, whereas the addition of CALM ARC prevented the return of symptoms. Implications for future research and preliminary clinical recommendations are discussed.",2099978583.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
87,"Momentary experiential avoidance: Within-person correlates, antecedents, and consequences and between-person moderators","We used ecological momentary assessment to investigate momentary correlates, antecedents, and consequences of experiential avoidance (EA), and to explore whether depression and anxiety moderate these within-person relationships. Participants recorded their mood, thoughts, stress, and EA four times daily for one week. Baseline depression and anxiety were associated with EA. EA was lower when participants reported more positive mood and thoughts, and higher when participants reported more negative mood, negative thoughts, and stress. The EA-stress relationship was stronger for participants with higher depression. Lag analyses showed that negative mood, negative thoughts, and stress predicted subsequent EA. In turn, EA predicted subsequent negative mood, negative thoughts, and stress. The relationship between EA and subsequent negative thoughts was stronger for participants with higher anxiety. Participants with higher depression and anxiety had a less negative association between positive thoughts and subsequent EA. This study adds to a growing body of literature on the process of EA as it unfolds in vivo, in real-time. Findings highlight links between momentary negative internal experiences and EA (which may be especially strong for people with depression or anxiety) and suggest that certain positive subjective experiences may buffer against EA. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.",2099978363.0, Journal Article,2018
88,Meal and snack-time eating disorder cognitions predict eating disorder behaviors and vice versa in a treatment seeking sample: A mobile technology based ecological momentary assessment study,"Individuals with eating disorders experience high anxiety when eating, which may contribute to the high relapse rates seen in the eating disorders. However, it is unknown if specific cognitions associated with such anxiety (e.g., fears of gaining weight) may lead to engagement in eating disorder behaviors (e.g., weighing oneself). Participants (N = 66) recently treated at a residential eating disorder facility and diagnosed with an eating disorder (primarily anorexia nervosa; n = 40; 60.6%) utilized a mobile application to answer questions about mealtime cognitions, anxiety, and eating disorder behaviors four times a day for one week. Hierarchical linear models using cross-lag analyses identified that there were quasi-causal (and sometimes reciprocal) within-person relationships between specific eating disorder cognitions and subsequent eating disorder behaviors. These cognitions predicted higher anxiety during the next meal and eating disorder pathology at one-month follow-up. Interventions personalized to target these specific cognitions in real time might reduce eating disorder relapse.",2085842055.0, Journal Article,2018
89,Intolerance of uncertainty as a vulnerability factor for excessive and inflexible avoidance behavior,"Recent studies have shown that avoidance behavior may become excessive and inflexible (i.e., detached from its incentive value and resistant to extinction). On the other hand, prospective intolerance of uncertainty (P-IU) has been defined as a factor leading to excessive responding in uncertain situations. Thus, uncertain avoidance situations may be taken as a relevant scenario to examine the role of intolerance of uncertainty as a factor that facilitates excessive and inflexible avoidance behavior. In our experiment, we tested the hypothesis that P-IU is associated with excessive and inflexible avoidance in an outcome devaluation paradigm. Specifically, healthy participants learned in a free-operant discriminative task to avoid an aversive sound, and were tested in extinction to measure the sensitivity of avoidance responses to the devaluation of the sound aversiveness. The results showed that an increase in P-IU was positively associated to an increase in insensitivity to the devaluation. Moreover, P-IU was also related to an increase in the frequency of avoidance responses during the instrumental learning phase, and to resistance to extinction. Interestingly, these associations involving P-IU were still significant when trait anxiety was controlled for. The pattern of results suggests that P-IU may be a vulnerability factor for excessive and inflexible avoidance, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with several mental disorders.",2080276214.0, Journal Article,2018
90,Avoidance and escape: Defensive reactivity and trait anxiety,"Although avoidance and escape behaviors each contribute to maintaining anxiety disorders, only avoidance completely eliminates exposure to the aversive context. Current research compared anticipatory defensive engagement when aversion could either be completely avoided or escaped after initial exposure; in addition, this research examined the impact of trait anxiety on coping-related defensive engagement. Cues signaled that upcoming rapid action would avoid (block), escape (terminate), or not affect subsequent aversive exposure; the acoustic startle reflex was measured during each anticipatory interval to index defensive engagement, and blink magnitudes were compared across low-, moderate-, and high-anxious individuals. For all participants, startle was potentiated when aversive exposure was uncontrollable and attenuated when aversion was avoidable. On escape trials, on the other hand, startle potentiation increased with rising participant anxiety. Results suggest 1) defensive engagement is generally reduced in avoidance contexts relative to contexts in which exposure is certain, and; 2) trait anxiety increases defensive engagement specifically when aversive exposure can be controlled but remains certain.",2080276112.0, Journal Article,2018
91,Attention avoidance of the threat conditioned stimulus during extinction increases physiological arousal generalisation and retention,"Exposure therapy is a key component of efficacious treatment for anxiety. Biases in the allocation of attention towards versus away from threat assessed prior to exposure-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy differentially predict treatment outcomes. However, it is unclear whether monitoring versus avoiding threat stimuli influences learning during exposure. Extinction paradigms are the experimental analogue of exposure therapy. Therefore, manipulating attention towards versus away from threat during extinction trials may shed light on the role of attention during exposure therapy. This study utilised a Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction paradigm to examine whether directing attention towards versus away from the threat conditioned stimulus (CS+) related to differences in extinction, as indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR), CS evaluations and subjective measures of anxiety. Following a fear conditioning phase in which a dog image (CS+) was paired with an aversive tone unconditioned stimulus (US) and another dog image (CS-) was presented alone, 57 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions during extinction in which both CSs were presented alone: monitor the CS+ (N = 19), avoid the CS+ and attend to another stimulus (N = 18), no attention manipulation control (N = 20). Eye movements were monitored for visual adherence to assigned location using horizontal electro-oculogram. In the context of the acquisition of differential conditioning and visual adherence during extinction, both active groups exhibited larger SCRs to the CS + relative to the CS- during the first extinction block compared to the control group, and the avoid group exhibited significantly larger SCRs on CS+ and CS- trials throughout the extinction phase compared to the other groups. The avoid group also exhibited less decline in SCRs to the CS+ during the extinction retest phase relative to the control group. No significant group differences were observed in between-phase CS evaluations and subjective anxiety ratings. Avoidance of threat conditioned stimuli may impair extinction learning and increase physiological arousal generalisation to safe stimuli.",2080273999.0, Journal Article,2018
92,"We cannot change the past, but we can change its meaning. A randomized controlled trial on the effects of self-help imagery rescripting on depression","Background Imagery rescripting is a psychotherapeutic technique that aims to ameliorate negative emotions by altering (i.e., rescripting) inner representations of negative memories and images. Although the treatment was initially developed for traumatized individuals, face-to-face interventions have yielded promising results for patients with other diagnoses as well. The present study explored the feasibility and efficacy of the approach when used as a self-help intervention for depression. Method A total of 127 individuals with diagnosed depression were randomly allocated to either a wait-list control condition or received a brief or long version of a manual teaching imagery rescripting. Six weeks after inclusion, patients were invited to participate in the post assessment. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) served as the primary outcome (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03299127). Results The long version was superior to the wait-list control condition on the BDI-II, self-esteem, and quality of life at a medium effect size. No effects emerged for anxiety. No significant between-group differences were found for the brief version. Moderation analyses indicated that the self-help approach seems particularly beneficial for those scoring high on symptoms, willingness to change, and expectancy (baseline). Most patients indicated they would use the technique in the future. Discussion The efficacy of imagery rescripting was confirmed when applied via self-help. Use of the long form of the manual is recommended. Future studies are needed to ascertain whether treatment effects are sustained over time.",2080273962.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
93,Processes and pathways mediating the experience of social anxiety and negative rumination,"Negative rumination in social anxiety disorder (SAD) occurs in anticipation of a social event (pre-event rumination) and in its aftermath (post-event rumination). Both are proposed to be key maintaining factors of the vicious cycle of social anxiety. Despite this, there is a dearth of research investigating the processes that mediate the relationship between social anxiety and pre-event rumination and uncertainty regarding the cognitive and attentional processes that mediate the relationship between social anxiety and post-event rumination. To investigate this further, the current study utilised a clinical sample of participants with SAD to determine the hypothesised mediators of a social anxiety and pre-event model (N = 239) and a social anxiety and post-event rumination model (N = 216). Results from path analyses were broadly consistent with cognitive models of SAD that posit several interrelated processes mediate the relationship between social anxiety and pre- and post-event rumination. Results also indicated slightly different processes showed stronger prediction of pre-event rumination (i.e., biased performance appraisals) and post-event rumination (i.e., negative attentional focus). Treatment recommendations that aim to address the maladaptive role of negative rumination in social anxiety are made in keeping with the inter-connected and dynamic role played by cognitive and attentional processes in heightening social anxiety.",2065253288.0, Journal Article,2018
94,Individual variation in working memory is associated with fear extinction performance,"PTSD has been associated consistently with abnormalities in fear acquisition and extinction learning and retention. Fear acquisition refers to learning to discriminate between threat and safety cues. Extinction learning reflects the formation of a new inhibitory-memory that competes with a previously learned threat-related memory. Adjudicating the competition between threat memory and the new inhibitory memory during extinction may rely, in part, on cognitive processes such as working memory (WM). Despite significant shared neural circuits and signaling pathways the relationship between WM, fear acquisition, and extinction is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed data from a large sample of healthy Marines who underwent an assessment battery including tests of fear acquisition, extinction learning, and WM (N-back). Fear potentiated startle (FPS), fear expectancy ratings, and self-reported anxiety served as the primary dependent variables. High WM ability (N = 192) was associated with greater CS + fear inhibition during the late block of extinction and greater US expectancy change during extinction learning compared to individuals with low WM ability (N = 204). WM ability was not associated with magnitude of fear conditioning/expression. Attention ability was unrelated to fear acquisition or extinction supporting specificity of WM associations with extinction. These results support the conclusion that individual differences in WM may contribute to regulating fear responses.",2049941566.0, Journal Article,2018
95,Effects of mindfulness exercises as stand-alone intervention on symptoms of anxiety and depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are currently well established in psychotherapy with meta-analyses demonstrating their efficacy. In these multifaceted interventions, the concrete performance of mindfulness exercises is typically integrated in a larger therapeutic framework. Thus, it is unclear whether stand-alone mindfulness exercises (SAMs) without such a framework are beneficial, as well. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the effects of SAMs on symptoms of anxiety and depression. Systematic searching of electronic databases resulted in 18 eligible studies (n = 1150) for meta-analyses. After exclusion of one outlier SAMs had small to medium effects on anxiety (SMD = 0.39; CI: 0.22, 0.56; PI: 0.07, 0.70; p &lt; .001, I 2 = 18.90%) and on depression (SMD = 0.41; CI: 0.19, 0.64; PI: −0.05, 0.88; p &lt; .001; I 2 = 33.43%), when compared with controls. Summary effect estimates decreased, but remained significant when corrected for potential publication bias. This is the first meta-analysis to show that the mere, regular performance of mindfulness exercises is beneficial, even without being integrated in larger therapeutic frameworks.",2049940037.0, Journal Article,2018
96,Evaluating the role of repetitive negative thinking in the maintenance of social appearance anxiety: An experimental manipulation,"Social appearance anxiety (SAA), or fear of having one's appearance negatively evaluated by others, is a risk factor for eating pathology and social anxiety, but maintenance processes for SAA remain unclear. The current study evaluated repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as a process through which SAA is maintained over time. Undergraduates (N = 126) completed self-report measurements, made an impromptu speech task to induce SAA, and were randomized to either engage in RNT or distraction following the speech task. Participants then attended a second appointment one day later and were asked to make a second speech. Results indicated positive associations between self-reported trait SAA and RNT. Individuals asked to engage in RNT following the appointment 1 speech task reported significantly higher state SAA than those who engaged in distraction. Findings indicated no significant effect of group on appointment 2 SAA, but post-hoc analyses suggested that naturally-occurring RNT may have accounted for increases in SAA across appointments. Overall, results provide support for the importance of RNT in maintaining various internalizing symptoms.",2049939096.0, Journal Article,2018
97,A randomised controlled trial investigating the benefits of adaptive working memory training for working memory capacity and attentional control in high worriers,"The process of worry has been associated with reductions in working memory capacity and availability of resources necessary for efficient attentional control. This, in turn, can lead to escalating worry. Recent investigations into working memory training have shown improvements in attentional control and cognitive performance in high trait-anxious individuals and individuals with sub-clinical depression. The current randomised controlled trial investigated the effects of 15 days of adaptive n-back working memory training, or an active control task, on working memory capacity, attentional control and worry in a sample of high worriers. Pre-training, post-training and one-month follow-up measures of working memory capacity were assessed using a Change Detection task, while a Flanker task was used to assess attentional control. A breathing focus task was used as a behavioural measure of worry in addition to a number of self-report assessments of worry and anxiety. Overall there was no difference between the active training and the active control condition with both groups demonstrating similar improvements in working memory capacity and worry, post-training and at follow-up. However, training-related improvements on the n-back task were associated with gains in working memory capacity and reductions in worry symptoms in the active training condition. These results highlight the need for further research investigating the role of individual differences in working memory training.",2018028010.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
98,A return to the psychiatric dark ages with a two-system framework for fear,"The past several decades has seen considerable progress in our understanding of the neurobiology of fear and anxiety. These advancements were spurred on by envisioning fear as emerging from the coordinated activation of brain and behavioral systems that evolved for the purpose of defense from environmental dangers. Recently, Joseph LeDoux, a previous proponent of this view, published a series of papers in which he challenges the value of this approach. As an alternative, he and colleagues propose that a 'two-system' framework for the study of responses to threat will expedite the advancement of medical treatments for fear disorders. This view suggests one system for autonomic and behavioral responses and a second for the subjective feeling of fear. They argue that these two systems operate orthogonally and thus inferences concerning the emotion of fear cannot be gleaned from physiological and behavioral measures; confounding these systems has impeded the mechanistic understanding and treatment of fear disorders. Counter to the claim that this view will advance scientific progress, it carries the frightening implication that we ought to reduce the study of fear to subjective report. Here, we outline why we believe that fear is best considered an integrated autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive-emotional response to danger emerging from a central fear generator whose evolutionarily conserved function is that of defense. Furthermore, we argue that although components of the fear response can be independently modulated and studied, common upstream brain regions dictate their genesis, and therefore inferences about a central fear state can be garnered from measures of each.",2018027148.0, Journal Article,2018
99,Individual differences in fear relapse,"Vulnerability to anxiety disorders might be due to enhanced acquisition of aversive associations, impaired inhibition of those associations (extinction), and/or vulnerability to the return of fear (relapse). Animal research investigating the processes underpinning fear learning, extinction, and relapse will be critical to further advancing our understanding of anxiety disorders and their treatment. Here we examined whether individual differences in the rate of extinction might be related to vulnerability to relapse. Relapse of fear was examined by testing animals for conditioned freezing using renewal, reinstatement, and spontaneous recovery procedures. Across all three experiments we found that when tested under ""milder"" relapse conditions (in a novel context, after a mild reinstatement procedure, or 8 days after extinction training) Slow Extinguishers exhibited relapse of fear whereas Fast Extinguishers did not. However, when tested under ""stronger"" relapse conditions (in the training context, after a strong reinstatement procedure, or 29 days after extinction training) both Fast and Slow Extinguishers exhibited comparable relapse of fear. These results show that Slow Extinguishers are more vulnerable to relapse than Fast Extinguishers. These findings have clinical implications for identifying those most at risk of relapse following treatment and highlight the importance of developing further strategies to reduce relapse.",2018027031.0, Journal Article,2018
225,Perceptions of free will in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A quantitative analysis,"Background: The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of free will in the repetitive behaviors of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to explore their relation with core clinical characteristics. Methods: Experiences of free will were assessed with the Symptomatology And Perceived Free will rating scale (SAPF) in 295 subjects with a lifetime diagnosis of OCD. Patients’ scores on the SAPF were subjected to an explorative principal axis factor analysis (PAF). Factor scores were regressed on five OCD symptom dimensions and on seven clinical variables: illness duration, severity of OCD, insight, anxiety and depression, suicidal ideation and quality of life. Results: The PAF revealed three factors: the perceived ability to control and change one’s course of action when faced with an obsession or compulsion (the “alternative possibilities” factor); the experience of obsessions or compulsions as intentional (the “intentionality” factor); and the experience of being the source or owner of the obsessions or compulsions (the “ownership” factor). Lower scores on the “alternative possibilities” factor were associated with lower scores on the washing dimension (β = 0.237, p = 0.004) and higher scores on the precision dimension (β = − 0.190, p = 0.025) and independently associated with longer illness duration (β = − 0.134, p = 0.039), higher illness severity (β = − 0.298, p &lt; 0.001) and lower quality of life (β = 0.172, p = 0.046). Lower scores on the “intentionality” factor were independently associated with lower quality of life (β = 0.233, p = 0.027). Higher scores on the “ownership” factor were associated with higher scores on the precision dimension (β = 0.207, p = 0.023) and independently associated with poorer insight (β = 0.170, p = 0.045). Conclusions: The most notable finding of this study is that a diminished experience of free will in OCD is associated with core clinical characteristics: illness duration and severity, insight and quality of life.

226,Validation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale against both DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for depression,"Background: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is widely used in many countries to screen women for depression in the perinatal period. However, across studies the psychometric properties and cutoff scores of the EPDS have varied considerably; potentially due to different depression criteria and diagnostic systems being used. Therefore, we validated the Danish EPDS against a depression diagnosis according to both DSM-5 and ICD-10. Furthermore, we examined whether the Danish EPDS is multidimensional, as it has previously been suggested. Methods: Women ( N = 324) were recruited after routine screenings with the EPDS between 2 and 10 months postpartum (T1). At a subsequent home visit (T2), the EPDS and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 were administered. Diagnostic interviews were audio recorded to enable subsequent coding for ICD-10 diagnoses and inter-rater reliability analysis. A two-phase stratified sampling strategy with three sampling categories (EPDS-score at T1) was used. Using the distribution of 4931 T1 EPDS-scores from the same population from which we sampled the participants, we used sampling weighing to reweight the sample. The calculation of weights was based upon the mother’s sampling category at T1 (i.e. the probability of being sampled) and the weights were applied when assessing the receiver operation characteristics (ROCs) of the EPDS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the ROC curve were computed from the reweighted data for all relevant cutoff values. CIs were computed by embedding the calculations in a weighted logistic regression. Exploratory factor analysis was done using oblique rotation. Parallel analysis was used to assess the number of factors. Results: A score of 11 or more was found to be the optimal cutoff for depression according to both DSM-5 and ICD-10 criteria. Factor analysis suggested that the Danish EPDS consists of three factors, including an ‘anxiety factor’. Conclusions: The Danish EPDS has reasonable sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff score of 11 or more. There are no notable differences with respect to using ICD-10 or DSM-5 criteria for depression in terms of optimal cutoff. The variation in cutoff scores is likely to be due to cultural variations in the expression of depressive symptoms.

227,The impact of immigration detention on mental health: A systematic review,"Background: The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has increased dramatically over the past 5 years. Many countries are continuing to resort to detaining asylum seekers and other migrants, despite concerns that this may be harmful. In light of the considerable body of recent research, this review aims to update and expand on a 2009 systematic review on the mental health consequences of detention on adult, adolescent and child immigration detainees, which found (on the basis on 9 studies) that there was consistent evidence that immigration detention had adverse effects on mental health. Methods: Three databases were searched using key terms relating to immigration detention and mental health. Electronic searches were supplemented by reference screening. Studies were included if they were quantitative, included individuals detained for immigration purposes, reported on mental health problems and were published in peer-reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently screened papers for eligibility, and a further two reviewers completed quality appraisals for included studies. Results: Twenty-six studies (21 of which were not included in the 2009 review) reporting on a total of 2099 participants were included in the review. Overall, these studies indicated that adults, adolescents and children experienced high levels of mental health problems. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were most commonly reported both during and following detention. Higher symptom scores were found in detained compared to non-detained refugees. In addition (and more clearly than was evident in 2009), detention duration was positively associated with severity of mental symptoms. Greater trauma exposure prior to detention was also associated with symptom severity. Conclusions: The literature base reviewed in this paper consistently demonstrated severe mental health consequences amongst detainees across a wide range of settings and jurisdictions. There is a pressing need for the proper consideration of mental health and consequent risk of detention-related harm in decisions surrounding detention as well as for improved care for individuals within detention facilities. Recommendations based on these findings are presented, including increased focus on the identification of vulnerability and on minimising the duration of detention.

228,"Mental health outcomes among Arab refugees, immigrants, and U.S. born Arab Americans in Southeast Michigan: A cross-sectional study","Background: Arab refugees and immigrants living in the United States may be exposed to political, economic, social, and environmental stressors that may affect their mental health. Yet, little is known regarding mental health outcomes among Arab Americans. The purpose of this study was to measure depression and anxiety levels among Arabs in Southeast Michigan and determine whether these levels differ by resident status: refugee, immigrant, or U.S. born.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of 275 adults who self-identify as Arab living in Southeast Michigan. Participants were recruited from a non-profit health and social services organization between August–November 2015. Data were collected via self-administered questionnaires, using standardized instruments to assess depression and anxiety symptoms.Results: All three resident groups exhibited high mean levels of depression and anxiety. Refugees reported higher levels of depression and anxiety than either immigrants or U.S. born Arab Americans. After adjustment for sociodemographics, differences between U.S. born Arab Americans and refugees were statistically significant for depression (b = 2.84; 95% CI: 0.21, 5.47), but not for anxiety. Refugees had significantly higher depression scores (b = 3.18, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.84) and anxiety scores (b = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.11, 2.50) than immigrants. Those reporting political violence and religious persecution as reasons for immigration had the highest levels of depression and anxiety.Conclusions: This convenience sample of Arab Americans reported high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. Refugees appear to have poorer mental health outcomes than either immigrants or U.S.-born Arab Americans.

229,Preliminary evaluation of an intensive integrated individual and family therapy model for self-harming adolescents,"Background: To investigate the outcome of an integrated individual and family therapy (Intensive Contextual Treatment: ICT) in terms of reducing suffering and increasing functional adjustment among self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents with high symptom loads and their families. Methods: Forty-nine self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents, M age = 14.6, of predominantly Swedish origin and female gender (85.7%) participated with their parents. The study had a within group design with repeated measures at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six- and twelve-months follow-ups. Self-reports were used for the main outcomes; self-harm rates, suicide attempts, parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care, internalized and externalized symptoms, perceived stress, emotion regulation, school hours and adjustment. Secondary outcomes were levels of reported expressed emotions within family dyads, as well as parental anxiety, depression and stress. Results: From pre- to post-assessment, the adolescents reported significant reductions of self-harm ( p = .001, d = 0.54) and suicide attempts ( p &lt; .0001, d = 1.38). Parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care were reduced, as well as parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, school attendance and adjustment were improved, and the adolescents reported experiencing less criticism while parents reported less emotional over-involvement. The results were maintained at follow-ups. Conclusions: The adolescents and the parents reported improvements for the main outcomes. This treatment appears promising in keeping the families in treatment and out of hospital, suggesting that an integrative approach may be beneficial and feasible for this group.

230,"Diagnosis of somatoform disorders in primary care: Diagnostic agreement, predictors, and comaprisons with depression and anxiety","Background: To investigate (a) the diagnostic agreement between diagnoses of somatoform disorders, depressive and anxiety disorders obtained from a structured clinical interview and diagnoses reported from primary care physicians (PCPs) and (b) to identify patient and PCP-related predictors for the diagnostic agreement regarding the presence of a somatoform disorder. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional study comprising 112 primary care patients at high risk for somatoform disorders were analyzed. Diagnoses according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) for somatoform, depressive and anxiety disorders were obtained from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and compared with the diagnoses of the patients’ PCPs documented in their medical records. Using multiple regression analyses, predictors for the PCPs’ diagnosis of a somatoform disorder were analyzed. Results: The agreement between PCP diagnoses and CIDI diagnoses was 32.3% for somatoform disorders, 48.0% for depressive disorders and 25.0% for anxiety disorders. Multiple regression analyses revealed the likelihood of being diagnosed with a somatoform disorder by PCP increased with somatic symptom severity (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.03–1.44). Regarding PCP-related characteristics, a specialization in internal medicine (OR = 5.95, 95% CI 1.70–20.80) and working in a solo practice (OR = 2.92, 95% CI 1.02–8.38) increased the likelihood that patients were diagnosed with a somatoform disorder. Conclusions: The present results indicate that the process of diagnosing somatoform disorders in primary care needs to be improved. Findings further underline the necessity to implement appropriate strategies to improve early detection of patients.

231,Collaborative mental health care program versus a general practitioner program and usual care for treatment of patients with mental or neurological disorders in Germany: Protocol of a multiperspective evaluation study,"Background: German statutory health insurances are pursuing the goal of improving treatment of chronically ill people by promoting networks of health care providers and supporting treatments that reflect the current medical knowledge. The so-called PNP program is a collaborative care program developed by a German statutory health insurance, which defines specific rules on psychiatric, neurological, psychosomatic, and psychotherapeutic treatment. It aims to strengthen provision of guideline-based outpatient treatment and collaboration between different health care providers. It includes the general practitioners’ program, which aims to strengthen the coordinating role of GPs. This study aims to evaluate the PNP program. Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of the PNP program, we will conduct a prospective non-randomized controlled trial with primary data comparing patients enrolled in the PNP program and in the general practitioner program (intervention group) to patients enrolled only in the general practitioner program and patients who receive usual care (control groups). To evaluate costs and level of detail of diagnoses in care of patients with PNP program, we will use routinely collected secondary administrative health data in a retrospective quasi-experimental design. Patients who are at least 18 years old, insured by the statutory health insurance AOK, and on sick leave due to one of the mental or neurological diagnoses (affective, anxiety, somatoform or adjustment disorders, alcohol use disorders, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis) will be included. We will collect data at baseline and at 12-months follow-up. Health-related quality of life (primary data) and direct costs (secondary data) caused by outpatient and inpatient service utilization and medication will be the primary outcomes. We will analyze data using (generalized) linear mixed models and exploratory analyses. We will use entropy balancing to control for possible differences between the groups. We will use an exploratory sequential design including qualitative and descriptive statistical analyses to assess the structure and process quality of the PNP program among health care providers. Discussion: The results will help to develop a comprehensive picture of collaborative care programs for mental and neurological health care from the perspective of patients, health care providers, and health insurance companies.

Bryant, Katie Dawson, Syed Usman Hamdani, Anna Chiumento, Fareed Minhas, Khalid Saeed, Atif Rahman and Mark van Ommeren ( BMC Psychiatry , 2015[Dec], Vol 15[232]). In the original article, the first author reported an error in referring a paper. Both the incorrect and corrected references are presented in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-45932-001). Background: In humanitarian settings common mental disorders (depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder) are highly prevalent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a 5-session, individual psychological intervention program, delivered by paraprofessionals that addresses common mental disorders in people in communities affected by adversity. The objectives of this study are to test effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the locally adapted PM+ compared to Treatment as usual (TAU) in Peshawar District, Pakistan. Methods: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 346 primary care attendees in 3 health care centres in Peshawar District, Pakistan. After informed consent, primary care attendees with high levels of psychological distress according to the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS)) will be assigned to PM+ (n = 173) or TAU (n = 173). At baseline, 1 week and 3 months following PM+, independent assessors will assess psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and functional disability with the WHODAS. Secondary outcomes are posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and client-perceived priority problems. Further, cost-effectiveness will be assessed using the Service Receipt Inventory (SRI). Discussion: If proven effective, PM+ will be rolled out to other areas for further adaptation and testing in diverse humanitarian settings.

233,A pragmatic randomized controlled trial of group transdiagnostic cognitive-behaviour therapy for anxiety disorders in primary care: Study protocol,"Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in community settings, and they are associated with significant psychological distress, functional and social impairment. While cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most consistently efficacious psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, barriers preclude widespread implementation of CBT in primary care. Transdiagnostic group CBT (tCBT) focuses on cognitive and behavioural processes and intervention strategies common to different anxiety disorders, and could be a promising alternative to conventional CBT. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety disorders program as a complement to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in primary mental health care. Methods/Design: The trial is a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up at 4, 8 and 12-months design. Treatment and control groups . a) tCBT (12 weekly 2-h group sessions following a manualized treatment protocol); b) TAU for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria comprise meeting DSM-5 criteria for primary Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients are recruited in three regions in the province of Quebec, Canada. The primary outcome measures are the self-reported Beck Anxiety Inventory and the clinician-administered Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5); secondary outcome measures include treatment responder status based on the ADIS-5, and self-reported instruments for specific anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and service utilisation. Statistical analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects regression model will be used to account for between- and within-subject variations in the analysis of the longitudinal effects of the intervention. Discussion: This rigorous evaluation of tCBT in the real world will provide invaluable information to decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. Widespread implementation of tCBT protocols in primary care could lead to better effectiveness, efficiency, access and equity for the large number of patients suffering from anxiety disorders that are currently not obtaining evidence-based psychotherapy.

234,Mental and physical comorbidity in an Arab primary health care setting,"Background: There are no published studies on the comorbidity of common mental conditions (anxiety, depression, and somatization) and physical illnesses in the Arab world. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of common mental conditions comorbid with physical illnesses among primary care attenders in Kuwait, and the sociodemographic characteristics associated with this comorbidity. Methods: The Patient Health Questionnaires for somatization, anxiety and depression (PHQ-SAD) were administered to a representative sample of 1046 attenders (M: F = 429: 617; mean age 37.6, SD 12.7) seen in primary care clinics in Kuwait. Based on well-established cut-off scores, the presence and severity of three mental conditions –depression, anxiety, and somatization—was ascertained; physical diagnoses were ascertained by the attending physicians. Results: Of 1046 respondents, 442 (42.3%) had at least one mental condition and 670 (64.1%) had a physical illness diagnosis, viz.: diabetes mellitus (248/670 = 37.0%), hypertension (229/670 = 34.2%), asthma (82/670 = 12.2%), non-chronic physical illnesses (63/670 = 9.4%), or heart disease (48/670 = 7.2%), with 34.4% (360/1046) having mental-physical comorbidity. Male: female ratio for the 670 subjects was 287: 383. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for having a mental condition in those with a physical illness vs. those without a physical illness was 4.16 (95% C.I. = 3.12, 5.55). Comorbidity was associated with older age, being divorced or widowed, a lower level of education, and poorer living conditions. Regardless of the physical illness, the most frequent comorbid mental disorder was somatization. The prevalence and severity of mental conditions were associated with the number of physical illnesses. Conclusion: As has been reported in other parts of the world, somatization, anxiety, and depression are highly prevalent among primary care attenders in Kuwait and they are typically comorbid with physical illness. Strategies for their prevention and treatment need to take into consideration their association with physical illness and social disadvantage.

235,The relationship between marital satisfaction and depression in infertile couples: An actor–partner interdependence model approach,"Background: Much evidence consistent with the Marital Discord Model of Depression (MDMD) suggests that marital discord is associated with depression, but no studies examine the relationship between marital satisfaction and depression at the dyadic level in infertile couples. This study examined the effect of actors’ and partners’ marital satisfaction on depressive symptoms in husband-wife dyads with infertility using an innovative dyadic analysis approach, the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the sample comprised of 141 infertile couples in the evaluation phase of treatment. We collected data in a referral infertility center in Tehran, Iran between February and May 2017. Marital satisfaction and depression were measured using ENRICH marital satisfaction scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively, before starting the treatment. Dyadic analysis applying the APIM was used. In this study, actor effect is the impact of a person’s marital satisfaction on his/her own depression. Partner effect is the impact of a person’s marital satisfaction on his/her partner’s depression. Results: The APIM analysis revealed that both men and women’s marital satisfaction excreted an actor effect on their own depression (β = −0.412, P &lt; 0.001; β = −0.263, P = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, men’s marital satisfaction exerted a significant partner effect on their wives’ depression symptoms (β = −0.170, p = 0.047). However, the wives’ marital satisfaction was not related to their husbands’ depressive symptoms (β = −0.028, P = 0.735). Conclusions: The findings support that the MDMD is a valid theoretical model for the conceptualization of marital satisfaction and depressive symptoms among infertile couples and suggest that interventions to reduce depressive symptoms should include both men and women.

236,Related but different: Distinguishing postpartum depression and fatigue among women seeking help for unsettled infant behaviours,"Background: A growing body of evidence in relatively healthy populations suggests that postpartum depression and fatigue are likely distinct but related experiences. However, differentiating depression and fatigue in clinical settings remains a challenge. This study aimed to assess if depression and fatigue are distinct constructs in women with relatively high fatigue and psychological distress symptoms attending a residential program that assists with unsettled infant behaviour. Methods: 167 women (age: M = 34.26, SD = 4.23) attending a private residential early parenting program completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21-D), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and self-report sleep variables before program commencement. Confirmatory Factor Analysis examined the associations between depression and fatigue latent factors. Results: A two-factor model of separate but related depression and fatigue constructs provided a significantly better fit to the data than a one-factor model of combined depression and fatigue ( p &lt; .001). In the two-factor model, the depression and fatigue latent factors were moderately correlated (.41). Further predictive utility of this two-factor model was demonstrated as both depression and fatigue factors were independently predicted by worse self-reported sleep efficiency. Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence that for women attending a clinical service with relatively high fatigue and psychological distress, postpartum depression and fatigue remain separate but related experiences. These findings suggest that in women seeking clinical support in the postpartum period, both depression and fatigue need to be carefully assessed to ensure accurate diagnoses, and (b) whilst depression intervention may improve fatigue, targeted fatigue intervention may also be warranted.

237,Suicidal ideation in primary care patients suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia,"Background: Suicidal ideation is common in patients suffering from panic disorder. The present study investigated rates of suicidal ideation and risk factors for suicidal ideation in a sample of primary care patients suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Methods: A total of N = 296 patients [ n = 215 (72.6%) women; age: M = 43.99, SD = 13.44] were investigated. Anxiety severity, anxiety symptoms, avoidance behavior, comorbid depression diagnosis, severity of depression, age, sex, employment status, living situation and frequency of visits at the general practitioner were considered as risk factors of suicidal ideation. Results: Suicidal ideation was experienced by 25% of the respondents. In a logistic regression analysis, depression diagnosis and depression severity emerged as significant risk factors for suicidal ideation. Anxiety measures were not associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is common in primary care patients suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Individuals with greater burden of mental illness in terms of mood disorder comorbidity and depressive symptomatology are especially likely to suffer from suicidal ideation.

238,The moderating roles of bedtime activities and anxiety/depression in the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and sleep problems in children,"Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience sleep problems, but the comorbidity mechanism has not been sufficiently studied. This study aimed to determine the comorbidity of ADHD symptoms and sleep problems as well as the moderating effects of bedtime activities and depression/anxiety symptoms on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems. Methods: We recruited 934 primary students from third to fifth grade and their parents by stratified random sampling from three primary schools in Shanghai, China. This study used parent-reported versions of the ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. We used hierarchical linear regression analysis to clarify the moderating effects of bedtime activities and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: We found that children with more ADHD symptoms had shorter sleep durations and more sleep problems on weekdays. Screen time before bedtime strengthened the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep-disordered breathing. Children with more screen time were more likely to have sleep onset delay, while those with less screen time had more sleep onset problems with increasing ADHD symptoms. The high bedtime eating group experienced more night waking with increasing ADHD symptoms compared with the low bedtime eating group. Anxiety/depression exacerbated total sleep problems and further interacted with ADHD symptoms to predict sleep length and sleep duration problems. Conclusions: Bedtime activities and emotional problems had important moderating effects on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems. These findings indicate that appropriate bedtime management and emotional management may reduce sleep problems and improve sleep duration for children with ADHD symptoms.

239,Personality functioning in anxiety disorders,"Background: The Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders as well as the upcoming IDC-11 have established a new focus on diagnosing personality disorders (PD): personality functioning. An impairment of self and interpersonal functioning in these models represents a general diagnostic criterion for a personality disorder. Little is known so far about the impairment of personality functioning in patients with other mental disorders than PD. This study aims to assess personality functioning in patients with anxiety disorders. Methods: Ninety-seven patients with the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or phobia, and 16 healthy control persons were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I and -II) and were assessed by means of the Structured Interview for Personality Organization (STIPO) to determine the level of personality functioning. Results: While all three patient groups showed significant impairment in personality functioning compared to the control group, no significant differences were observed between the different patient groups. In all three groups of anxiety disorders patients with comorbid PD showed significantly worse personality functioning than patients without. Patients without comorbid PD also yielded a significant impairment in their personality functioning when compared to the control group. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are associated with a significant impairment in personality functioning, which is significantly increased by comorbid PD. There are no differences in terms of personality functioning between patients with different anxiety disorders.

240,"Sleep better, feel better? Effects of a CBT-I and HT-I sleep training on mental health, quality of life and stress coping in university students: A randomized pilot controlled trial","Background: The SWIS sleep training for university students showed promising results regarding subjective and objective sleep parameters. As sleep disorders and impaired sleep quality are closely related to various aspects of mental health, the current study examines the effects of the SWIS sleep training on mental health in university students. Methods: Fifty six university students (M = 25.84, SD = 5.06) participated in the study, 68% were women. Forty one were randomly assigned to the SWIS treatment (pre-post-follow-up), 15 to a Waiting List Control condition (WLC, pre-post). Besides sleep-related measures, the students completed four online questionnaires measuring mental health, quality of life and stress coping strategies. Effect sizes for the pre-post data were compared between the conditions, long-term effects were calculated with repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman ANOVA. Long-term clinical changes were analyzed with the Reliable Change Index (RCI). Results: The pre-post comparisons between SWIS and WLC revealed lower depression scores in both conditions, a better physical state in the SWIS condition and less maladaptive stress coping strategies in the WLC students. The long-term results of SWIS provided significant improvements regarding the students’ somatic complaints, reduced anxiety, an improved physical state and a better quality of life with moderate to large effect sizes. Most of the significant improvements occurred between pre- and follow-up measurement. These statistically significant results were also reflected in clinically significant changes from pre- to follow-up-test. Conclusions: SWIS and WLC condition both improved in two mental health variables immediately after the training. These findings may be explained by unspecific treatment expectation effects in the WLC. Interestingly, most mental health outcomes showed significant improvements after 3 months, but not immediately after the training. These positive long-term effects of the SWIS training on mental health indicate that the transfer of strategies might simply need more time to affect the students’ mental health.

241,Towards sustainable mental health promotion: Trial-based health-economic evaluation of a positive psychology intervention versus usual care,"Background: Mental well-being could be promoted and protected by positive psychology (PP) based interventions. Such interventions may be appealing for people at risk of anxiety and depressive disorders, but health-economic evaluations are scarce. The aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of a PP intervention. Methods: Participants with suboptimal levels of mental well-being were randomly assigned to an email guided PP-intervention ( n = 137) or a wait-list control group ( n = 138) with access to usual care (UC). At baseline and 6 months follow-up, data were collected on health care costs. Outcomes of interest were flourishing mental health and treatment response on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: Bootstrapped mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €2359 ($2899) for flourishing, €2959 ($3637) for anxiety and €2578 ($3168) for depression, suggesting appreciable health gains for low additional costs. At a willingness to pay ceiling of €10,000 ($12,290) for a treatment response, the probability that the intervention is deemed cost-effective ranged between 90 and 93%. Conclusions: The guided PP intervention appears to be a promising strategy as seen from both a public health and a health-economic perspective, especially when there is some willingness to pay. When the PP-intervention is scaled up, then outcome monitoring is recommended to better guarantee the longer term cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

242,"Major anxiety disorders in Iran: Prevalence, sociodemographic correlates and service utilization","Background: It has been shown in the past two decades that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in general population across the world. This study sought to assess the prevalence of major anxiety disorders, their sociodemographic correlates and mental health service utilization as part of the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS). Methods: A national household face-to-face survey was carried out on a representative sample of Iranian adults from January to June 2011 using Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). A total of 7886 subjects between 15 and 64 years who can understand Persian language were included. The 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), their socio-demographic correlates, health service use and days out of role were measured in this study. Results: The 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders (not including specific phobias) was 15.6%. The prevalence was 12.0% in males and 19.4% in females. The three most prevalent anxiety disorders were generalized anxiety disorder (5.2%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (5.1%) and social phobia (3.2%), respectively. Factors found to be significantly associated with anxiety disorders were: female gender (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09–1.23), middle (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.01–1.50) or low (OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.31–2.10) socioeconomic status, unemployment (OR = 1.98, 95%CI: 1.49–2.62), and urban residence (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.10–1.57). Comorbidity with non-anxiety disorders significantly increased service utilization. In all subgroups, service utilization was higher among females while the number of days out of role was higher among males. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders are common conditions with a higher prevalence among the female gender, unemployed individuals, and people with low socioeconomic conditions living in urban areas. Comorbidity of anxiety disorders with other psychological disorders aggravates the disability and significantly increases the number of days out of role.

243,"Prompt mental health care, the Norwegian version of IAPT: Clinical outcomes and predictors of change in a multicenter cohort study","Background: Prompt mental health care (PMHC) is a Norwegian initiative, inspired by the English ‘Improving Access to Psychological Therapy’ (IAPT), aimed to provide low-threshold access to primary care treatment for persons with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The objectives of the present study are to describe the PMHC service, to examine changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression following treatment and to identify predictors of change, using data from the 12 first pilot sites. Methods: A prospective cohort design was used. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, before each treatment session and at the end of treatment. Effect sizes (ES) for pre-post changes and recovery rates were calculated based on the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Multiple imputation (MI) was used in order to handle missing data. We examined predictors through latent difference score models and reported the contribution of each predictor level in terms of ES. Results: In total, N = 2512 clients received treatment at PMHC between October 2014 and December 2016, whereof 61% consented to participate. The changes from pre- to post-treatment were large for symptoms of both depression (ES = 1.1) and anxiety (ES = 1.0), with an MI-based reliable recovery rate of 58%. The reliable recovery rate comparable to IAPT based on last-observation-carried-forward was 48%. The strongest predictors for less improvement were having immigrant background (ES change depression −0.27, ES change anxiety −0.26), being out of work at baseline (ES change depression −0.18, ES change anxiety −0.35), taking antidepressants (ES change anxiety −0.36) and reporting bullying as cause of problems (ES change depression −0.29). Taking sleep medication did on the other hand predict more improvement (ES change depression 0.23, ES change anxiety 0.45). Conclusions: Results in terms of clinical outcomes were promising, compared to both the IAPT pilots and other benchmark samples. Though all groups of clients showed substantial improvements, having immigrant background, being out of work, taking antidepressant medication and reporting bullying as cause stood out as predictors of poorer treatment response. Altogether, PMHC was successfully implemented in Norway. Areas for improvement of the service are discussed.

244,"Attachment, mentalisation and expressed emotion in carers of people with long-term mental health difficulties","Background: Expressed emotion (EE) is a global index of familial emotional climate, which is comprised of emotional over-involvement (EOI) and critical comments (CC)/hostility. Although EE is an established predictor of negative outcomes for both people with long-term mental health difficulties and their family carers, its psychological underpinnings remain relatively poorly understood. This paper examined associations between attachment, mentalisation ability and aspects of EE. Methods: Carers of people with long-term mental health difficulties ( n = 106) completed measures of adult attachment (the Experiences in Close Relationships-Short Form questionnaire), mentalisation (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Emotional Self-Efficacy Scale) and EE (the Family Questionnaire). Data were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Attachment avoidance and facets of mentalisation were directly and uniquely positively associated with CC/hostility, with attachment avoidance and other-directed emotional self-efficacy (one facet of mentalisation) each significantly predicting CC/hostility scores after controlling for the effects of EOI and demographic variables. However, no associations were observed between EOI, attachment anxiety and mentalisation. Furthermore, no indirect effects from attachment to EE via mentalisation was found. Conclusions: Although it would be premature to propose firm clinical implications based on these findings, data indicate that it may be beneficial for clinicians to consider attachment and mentalisation in their conceptualisation of carers’ criticism and hostility. However, further research is needed to clarify the magnitude of these associations and their direction of effect before firm conclusions can be drawn.

245,"The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among students aged 6~16 years old in central Hunan, China","Background: Though several epidemiological surveys of psychiatric disorders have been carried out in China, only a few of them are concerned about the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in central Hunan and reveal the distribution of common psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities. Methods: Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) were administered to a stratified sample of 17,071 participants aged 6 to 16 years old from two cities in the central part of Hunan province. Twelve-month prevalence rates were calculated. Results: Twelve-month prevalence of the population was 9.74%. The most common psychiatric disorders were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (4.96%), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (2.98%) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (1.77%). Of those with a 12-month prevalence diagnosis, 34.6% had one or more comorbid psychiatric disorders. Most notably, ADHD had comorbidity rates of 25.15% with ODD, 18.18% with CD, 6.38% with GAD, and 3.66% with MDD. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders are common in Chinese children and adolescents. Being the most prevalent mental disorder, ADHD requires continued focus and support in awareness and education.

246,What might affect acceptability of online positive psychology interventions for depression: A qualitative study on patient expectations’,"Background: Positive psychology interventions are brief self-administered exercises designed to promote positive emotions, behaviours, or thoughts. They are potentially effective for reducing depression and are considered suitable for online dissemination to people with depression and related conditions, as they are assumed to be more acceptable than traditional symptom-focused approaches. However, there is little investigation into perceived acceptability and potential factors that might affect it. This might limit the development and evaluation of effective interventions. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with patients with depression and/or anxiety ( n = 18) and professionals, including GPs and psychologists ( n = 5) were conducted on their perceptions of a proposed online intervention using positive psychology. Thematic analysis, according to Braun and Clarke, was used to identify meaningful patterns in the data. Results: Four key themes were identified. The fit between the positive psychological approach and the patient’s context, including their personality, symptoms and other treatments, was important in determining acceptability. Social aspects of interventions were thought to facilitate acceptability, as long as these were balanced. Support was identified as important in facilitating intervention suitability, although it was not without limitations. Finally, participants identified how design features can enhance acceptability. Conclusions: The findings suggest that positive psychology interventions might not be acceptable to all and that specific exercises might be more or less appropriate to deliver online. Design aspects can help to facilitate acceptability, beyond the psychological content. These findings may inform the design of future online psychology interventions for people with depression and anxiety, which can then be evaluated in future research.

247,Health-related quality of life and burden of illness in adults with newly diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Sweden,"Background: This observational, cross-sectional, retrospective chart review aimed to identify factors determining health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with newly diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Sweden. Methods: Adult participants with a new clinical diagnosis of ADHD were enrolled from two specialist outpatient clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2013 to 2015. Data extracted from patient records included demographics, clinical characteristics and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses identified using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale—Self-reported (MADRS-S). The self-rated five-dimension EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to measure HRQoL. Predictors of EQ-5D index score were identified using multivariate linear regression adjusting for age, sex, education level, and main income source. Results: The mean age of the 189 enrolled patients was 35.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 12.3), and 107 (57%) were female. Psychiatric comorbidities were present in 92 patients (49%), with anxiety and depression being the most common diagnoses. The mean EQ-5D index score was 0.63 (SD, 0.28). Low EQ-5D index scores were significantly associated with high MADRS-S scores, multiple comorbid psychiatric disorders, low educational achievement, female sex, and not having a main income derived from employment or self-employment. Conclusions: These findings suggest that adults with newly diagnosed ADHD experience low HRQoL, which may often be exacerbated by psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Patients presenting with ADHD and psychiatric comorbidities in adulthood may require particular care and resources in the management of their ADHD.

248,Web-based intervention to improve quality of life in late stage bipolar disorder (ORBIT): Randomised controlled trial protocol,"Background: The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to establish the effectiveness of a novel online quality of life (QoL) intervention tailored for people with late stage (≥ 10 episodes) bipolar disorder (BD) compared with psychoeducation. Relative to early stage individuals, this late stage group may not benefit as much from existing psychosocial treatments. The intervention is a guided self-help, mindfulness based intervention (MBI) developed in consultation with consumers, designed specifically for web-based delivery, with email coaching support. Methods/design: This international RCT will involve a comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 5-week adjunctive online self-management interventions: Mindfulness for Bipolar 2.0 and an active control (Psychoeducation for Bipolar). A total of 300 participants will be recruited primarily via social media channels. Main inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of BD (confirmed via a phone-administered structured diagnostic interview), no current mood episode, history of 10 or more mood episodes, no current psychotic features or active suicidality, under the care of a medical practitioner. Block randomisation will be used for allocation to the interventions, and participants will retain access to the program for 6 months. Evaluations will be conducted at pre- and post- treatment, and at 3- and 6- months follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale (Brief QoL.BD), collected immediately post-intervention at 5 weeks (T1). Secondary measures include BD-related symptoms (mania, depression, anxiety, stress), time to first relapse, functioning, sleep quality, social rhythm stability and resource use. Measurements will be collected online and via telephone assessments at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), three months (T2) and six months (T3). Candidate moderators (diagnosis, anxiety or substance comorbidities, demographics and current treatments) will be investigated as will putative therapeutic mechanisms including mindfulness, emotion regulation and self-compassion. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Acceptability and any unwanted events (including adverse treatment reactions) will be documented and explored. Discussion: This definitive trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel QoL focused, mindfulness based, online guided self-help intervention for late stage BD, and investigate its putative mechanisms of therapeutic action.

249,Youth at-risk for serious mental illness: Methods of the PROCAN study,"Background: Most mental disorders begin in adolescence; however, there are gaps in our understanding of youth mental health. Clinical and policy gaps arise from our current inability to predict, from amongst all youth who experience mild behavioural disturbances, who will go on to develop a mental illness, what that illness will be, and what can be done to change its course and prevent its worsening to a serious mental illness (SMI). There are also gaps in our understanding of how known risk factors set off neurobiological changes that may play a role in determining who will develop a SMI. Project goals are (i) to identify youth at different stages of risk of SMI so that intervention can begin as soon as possible and (ii) to understand the triggers of these mental illnesses. Method: This 2-site longitudinal study will recruit 240 youth, ages 12–25, who are at different stages of risk for developing a SMI. The sample includes (a) healthy individuals, (b) symptom-free individuals who have a first-degree relative with a SMI, (c) youth who are experiencing distress and may have mild symptoms of anxiety or depression, and (d) youth who are already demonstrating attenuated symptoms of SMI such as bipolar disorder or psychosis. We will assess, every 6 months for one year, a wide range of clinical and psychosocial factors to determine which factors can be used to predict key outcomes. We will also assess neuroimaging and peripheral markers. We will develop and validate a prediction algorithm that includes demographic, clinical and psychosocial predictors. We will also determine if adding biological markers to our algorithm improves prediction. Discussion: Outcomes from this study include an improved clinical staging model for SMI and prediction algorithms that can be used by health care providers as decision-support tools in their practices. Secondly, we may have a greater understanding of clinical, social and cognitive factors associated with the clinical stages of development of a SMI, as well as new insights from neuroimaging and later neurochemical biomarker studies regarding predisposition to SMI development and progression through the clinical stages of illness.

250,The impact of psychotic experiences in the early stages of mental health problems in young people,"Background: Anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychotic experiences constitute common features of emerging mental disorders in young people. Psychotic experiences and the ultra-high risk (UHR) state for psychosis appear to have a particular importance for clinical presentation, progression of symptomatology, quality of life and functioning, but the impact of psychotic experiences in individuals seeking help at non-UHR services, compared to UHR services, is under-researched. Methods: Sixty-nine young people (M age ± SD at baseline = 20.8 ± 2.6, range 16–26 years, 48 females) presenting to mental health services were grouped according to UHR and non-UHR status. They were assessed at baseline for anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. They were followed up at three, six, and 12 months. Data were analysed using mixed linear modelling. Results: UHR individuals reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and psychological distress, and lower levels of role functioning and quality of life compared to non-UHR individuals. No differences were reported for anxiety symptoms or social functioning. Decline in psychosocial functioning was not associated with clinical deterioration or reduction of quality of life. Conclusions: Psychotic experiences appear to be particularly associated with depressive symptoms and psychological distress, impaired role functioning and quality of life in help-seeking young people in the medium-term. It is therefore important to pay special attention to psychotic experiences in the early stages of mental health problems even if psychotic symptoms are not the main motivation for help-seeking.

251,The effect of positive psychology interventions on well-being and distress in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Although positive psychology interventions (PPIs) show beneficial effects on mental health in non-clinical populations, the current literature is inconclusive regarding its effectiveness in clinical settings. We aimed to examine the effects of PPIs on well-being (primary outcome), depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) in clinical samples with psychiatric or somatic disorders. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for controlled studies of PPIs in clinical samples between Jan 1, 1998 and May 31, 2017. Methodological quality of each study was rated. We used Hedges’ adjusted g to calculate effect sizes and pooled results using random-effect models. Results: Thirty studies were included, representing 1864 patients with clinical disorders. At post-intervention, PPIs showed significant, small effect sizes for well-being (Hedges’ g = 0.24) and depression ( g = 0.23) compared to control conditions when omitting outliers. Significant moderate improvements were observed for anxiety ( g = 0.36). Effect sizes for stress were not significant. Follow-up effects (8–12 weeks), when available, yielded similar effect sizes. Quality of the studies was low to moderate. Conclusion: These findings indicate that PPIs, wherein the focus is on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors, not only have the potential to improve well-being, but can also reduce distress in populations with clinical disorders. Given the growing interest for PPIs in clinical settings, more high quality research is warranted as to determine the effectiveness of PPIs in clinical samples.

252,"Depression and the relationship between sleep disturbances, nightmares, and suicidal ideation in treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans","Background: Research on the relationship between insomnia and nightmares, and suicidal ideation (SI) has produced variable findings, especially with regard to military samples. This study investigates whether depression mediated the relationship between: 1) sleep disturbances and SI, and 2) trauma-related nightmares and SI, in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel and veterans ( N = 663). Method: Regression analyses were used to investigate associations between sleep disturbances or trauma-related nightmares and SI while controlling for depressive symptom severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, anxiety symptom severity, and alcohol use severity. Bootstrapped resampling analyses were used to investigate the mediating effect of depression. Results: Approximately two-thirds of the sample (68%; N = 400) endorsed sleep disturbances and 88% ( N = 516) reported experiencing trauma-related nightmares. Although sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares were both significantly associated with SI on their own, these relationships were no longer significant when other psychiatric conditions were included in the models. Instead, depressive symptom severity emerged as the only variable significantly associated with SI in both equations. Bootstrap resampling analyses confirmed a significant mediating role of depression for sleep disturbances. Conclusions: The findings suggest that sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares are associated with SI as a function of depressive symptoms in treatment-seeking CAF personnel and veterans. Treating depression in patients who present with sleep difficulties may subsequently help mitigate suicide risk.

253,Prevalence and determinants of antepartum depressive and anxiety symptoms in expectant mothers and fathers: Results from a perinatal psychiatric morbidity cohort study in the east and west coasts of Malaysia,"Background: Research on antepartum psychiatric morbidities investigating depressive and anxiety symptoms in expectant mothers and fathers is lacking in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of antepartum depressive, anxiety and co-occurring significant symptoms and explore the associated factors in a cross-section of Malaysian expectant mothers and fathers. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from a prospective cohort study of 911 expectant mothers and 587 expectant fathers during their third trimester of pregnancy, from health clinics of two states in the east and west coasts of Malaysia. The validated Malay version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the anxiety sub-scale of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were used to measure the depressive and anxiety symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified the determinants of antepartum depressive and anxiety symptoms (ADS and AAS). Results: Prevalence of ADS was 12.2% in expectant mothers and 8.4% in expectant fathers, while AAS was 28.8% in expectant mothers and 13.3% in expectant fathers, and co-occurring significant symptoms was 8.0% in expectant mothers and 4.0% in expectant fathers. Expectant mothers and fathers having perceived social/family support were less likely to suffer from ADS. Intimate partner violence, poor relationship with husbands, depression in earlier pregnancy and husband’s depression in current pregnancy in expectant mothers, and living in rented house, sex preference for the unborn child, stressful life events and wife’s depression in current pregnancy in expectant fathers were associated with a greater likelihood of ADS. The determinants for AAS were living in rented house and with parents/in-laws, poor relationship with husbands, restrictions during pregnancy and stressful life events for expectant mothers, and stressful life events and being unsupportive towards wives in household chores for expectant fathers. Conclusion: Both ADS and AAS are prevalent in expectant mothers and fathers, and largely an undetected problem in Malaysia. Administration of couple-based screening and referral program during antenatal check-up should be universal practices to identify and treat the psychiatric morbidities.

254,Patient care activities by community pharmacists in a capitation funding model mental health and addictions program,"Background: Community pharmacists are autonomous, regulated health care professionals located in urban and rural communities in Canada. The accessibility, knowledge, and skills of community pharmacists can be leveraged to increase mental illness and addictions care in communities. Methods: The Bloom Program was designed, developed, and implemented based on the Behaviour Change Wheel and a program of research in community pharmacy mental healthcare capacity building. We evaluated the Bloom Program as a demonstration project using mixed methods. A retrospective chart audit was conducted to examine outcomes and these are reported in this paper. Results: We collected 201 patient charts from 23 pharmacies in Nova Scotia with 182 patients having at least one or more follow-up visits. Anxiety ( n = 126, 69%), depression ( n = 112, 62%), and sleep disorders ( n = 64, 35%) were the most frequent mental health problems. Comorbid physical health problems were documented in 57% ( n = 104). The average number of prescribed medications was 5.5 (range 0 to 24). Sixty seven percent ( n = 122) were taking multiple psychotropics and 71% ( n = 130) reported taking more than one medication for physical health problems. Treatment optimization was the leading reason for enrollment with more than 80% seeking improvements in symptom management and daily functioning. There were a total of 1233 patient-care meetings documented, of which the duration was recorded in 1098. The median time for enrolling, assessing, and providing follow-up care by pharmacists was 142 min (mean 176, SD 128) per patient. The median follow-up encounter duration was 15 min. A total of 146 patient care encounters were 60 min or longer, representing 13.3% of all timed encounters. Conclusions: Pharmacists work with patients with lived experience of mental illness and addictions to improve medication related outcomes including those related to treatment optimization, reducing polytherapy, and facilitating withdrawal from medications. Pharmacists can offer their services frequently and routinely without the need for an appointment while affording patient confidentiality and privacy. Important roles for pharmacists around the deprescribing of various medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) have previously been supported and should be optimized and more broadly implemented. Further research on the best mechanisms to incentivize pharmacists in mental illness and addiction’s care should be explored.

255,Psychopathological sequelae of female genital mutilation and their neuroendocrinological associations,"Background: Anecdotal evidence suggests the frequently traumatic nature of female genital mutilation (FGM). At present, systematic research on the psychological sequelae of this tradition has remained limited. The study provides preliminary, high-quality psychodiagnostic data on potential psychopathological consequences of FGM, with a focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), shutdown dissociation and other stress-related variables. Methods: We investigated a convenience sample of N = 167 women, supported by the women’s affairs headquarters in Jijiga (capital of the Ethiopian Somali Region) and a local Ethiopian non-governmental organization. Our main outcome measures were PTSD (PSS-I) and shutdown dissociation (ShuD). We also assessed depression and anxiety (HSCL-25), major depression, substance abuse and dependence, suicidality and psychotic disorders (M.I.N.I.; sub-scales A., B., K., and L.). In addition, we collected hair samples to assess hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) as a neuroendocrinological measure. Results: The majority of women endured FGM (FGM I: 36%, FGM II/III: 52%) and, regardless of the level of the physical invasiveness, almost all women reported having felt intense fear and/or helplessness. FGM II/III, the more invasive form, was associated with a greater vulnerability to PTSD symptoms ( p &lt; .001) and shutdown dissociation ( p &lt; .001). Symptoms of depression ( p &lt; .05) and anxiety ( p &lt; .01) were also elevated. Random forest regression with conditional inference trees revealed evidence of an alteration of the cortisol levels in relation to the age when FGM was experienced (&lt; 1 year) and the invasiveness of the procedure. Conclusion: More extensive forms of FGM are associated with more severe psychopathological symptoms—particularly with an increased vulnerability to PTSD. Higher hair cortisol levels in women who experienced FGM before their first year of age or had more severe forms of FGM indicate long-term neuroendocrinological consequences of FGM and trauma in general on the stress system.

256,The impact of child maltreatment on non-suicidal self-injury: Data from a representative sample of the general population,"Background: Child maltreatment is an identified risk factor for Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). The aim of the current study was to investigate effects of different types of maltreatment, and mediating effects of depression and anxiety on NSSI in the general population. Methods: A representative sample of the German population, comprising N = 2498 participants (mean age = 48.4 years (SD = 18.2), 53.3% female) participated in this study. Child maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), NSSI was assessed with a question on lifetime engagement in NSSI, depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and anxiety symptoms by the General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2). Results: Lifetime prevalence of NSSI in this sample was 3.3, and 30.8% reported at least one type of child maltreatment. Participants in the NSSI group reported significantly more experiences of child maltreatment. Emotional abuse was endorsed by 72% of all participants with NSSI. A path analytic model demonstrated an unmediated direct effect of emotional neglect, a partially mediated effect of emotional abuse, and a fully mediated effect of sexual abuse and physical neglect by depression and anxiety on NSSI. Conclusions: Especially emotional neglect and abuse seem to play a role in the etiology of NSSI above and beyond depression and anxiety, while sexual and physical abuse seem to have a rather indirect effect.

257,"Study protocol for The Emory 3q29 Project: Evaluation of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and medical symptoms in 3q29 deletion syndrome","Background: 3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by a recurrent hemizygous 1.6 Mb deletion on the long arm of chromosome 3. The syndrome is rare (1 in 30,000 individuals) and is associated with mild to moderate intellectual disability, increased risk for autism and anxiety, and a 40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia, along with a host of physical manifestations. However, the disorder is poorly characterized, the range of manifestations is not well described, and the underlying molecular mechanism is not understood. We designed the Emory 3q29 Project to document the range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric manifestations associated with 3q29 deletion syndrome. We will also create a biobank of samples from our 3q29 deletion carriers for mechanistic studies, which will be a publicly-available resource for qualified investigators. The ultimate goals of our study are three-fold: first, to improve management and treatment of 3q29 deletion syndrome. Second, to uncover the molecular mechanism of the disorder. Third, to enable cross-disorder comparison with other rare genetic syndromes associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Methods: We will ascertain study subjects, age 6 and older, from our existing registry (3q29deletion.org). Participants and their families will travel to Atlanta, GA for phenotypic assessments, with particular emphasis on evaluation of anxiety, cognitive ability, autism symptomatology, and risk for psychosis via prodromal symptoms and syndromes. Evaluations will be performed using standardized instruments. Structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI data will be collected from eligible study participants. We will also collect blood from the 3q29 deletion carrier and participating family members, to be banked at the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource (NRGR). Discussion: The study of 3q29 deletion has the potential to transform our understanding of complex disease. Study of individuals with the deletion may provide insights into long term care and management of the disorder. Our project describes the protocol for a prospective study of the behavioral and clinical phenotype associated with 3q29 deletion syndrome. The paradigm described here could easily be adapted to study additional CNV or single gene disorders with high risk for neuropsychiatric phenotypes, and/or transferred to other study sites, providing a means for data harmonization and cross-disorder analysis.

258,Collective interaction effects associated with mammalian behavioral traits reveal genetic factors connecting fear and hemostasis,"Background: Investigation of the genetic architectures that influence the behavioral traits of animals can provide important insights into human neuropsychiatric phenotypes. These traits, however, are often highly polygenic, with individual loci contributing only small effects to the overall association. The polygenicity makes it challenging to explain, for example, the widely observed comorbidity between stress and cardiac disease. Methods: We present an algorithm for inferring the collective association of a large number of interacting gene variants with a quantitative trait. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by taking into account the non-uniform distribution of genotypes within a cohort, we can achieve greater power than regression-based methods for high-dimensional inference. Results: We analyzed genome-wide data sets of outbred mice and pet dogs, and found neurobiological pathways whose associations with behavioral traits arose primarily from interaction effects: γ-carboxylated coagulation factors and downstream neuronal signaling were highly associated with conditioned fear, consistent with our previous finding in human post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) data. Prepulse inhibition in mice was associated with serotonin transporter and platelet homeostasis, and noise-induced fear in dogs with hemostasis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a novel explanation for the observed comorbidity between PTSD/anxiety and cardiovascular diseases: key coagulation factors modulating hemostasis also regulate synaptic plasticity affecting the learning and extinction of fear.

259,The associations between psychological distress and healthcare use in patients with non-cardiac chest pain: Does a history of cardiac disease matter?,"Background: Psychological distress such as somatization, fear of body sensations, cardiac anxiety and depressive symptoms is common among patients with non-cardiac chest pain, and this may lead to increased healthcare use. However, the relationships between the psychological distress variables and healthcare use, and the differences in relation to history of cardiac disease in these patients has not been studied earlier. Therefore, our aim was to explore and model the associations between different variables of psychological distress (i.e. somatization, fear of body sensations, cardiac anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and healthcare use in patients with non-cardiac chest pain in relation to history of cardiac disease. Methods: In total, 552 patients with non-cardiac chest pain (mean age 64 years, 51% women) responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Body Sensations Questionnaire, Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and one question regarding number of healthcare visits. The relationships between the psychological distress variables and healthcare visits were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling in two models representing patients with or without history of cardiac disease. Results: A total of 34% of the patients had previous cardiac disease. These patients were older, more males, and reported more comorbidities, psychological distress and healthcare visits. In both models, no direct association between depressive symptoms and healthcare use was found. However, depressive symptoms had an indirect effect on healthcare use, which was mediated by somatization, fear of body sensations, and cardiac anxiety, and this effect was significantly stronger in patients with history of cardiac disease. Additionally, all the direct and indirect effects between depressive symptoms, somatization, fear of body sensations, cardiac anxiety, and healthcare use were significantly stronger in patients with history of cardiac disease. Conclusions: In patients with non-cardiac chest pain, in particular those with history of cardiac disease, psychological mechanisms play an important role for seeking healthcare. Development of interventions targeting psychological distress in these patients is warranted. Furthermore, there is also a need of more research to clarify as to whether such interventions should be tailored with regard to history of cardiac disease or not.

260,Anxiety in women—A Swedish national three-generational cohort study,"Background: Findings from animal and human studies indicate that anxiety and stress have a negative influence on the child and mother. The aim of this study was to explore the risk for having an anxiety diagnosis and the impact of the diagnosis in a three generational perspective. Methods: The information was retrieved from Swedish population-based registries. All women who gave birth between 1973 and 1977 (n 169,782), their daughters (n 244,152), and subsequently also the offspring of the daughters (n 381,953) were followed until 2013. Results: We found that 4% of the mothers and 6% of the grandmothers had been diagnosed with anxiety. Women who had mothers with an anxiety disorder were more than twice as likely to have an anxiety disorder themselves compared to all other women (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 2.04–2.30). In the third generation, the children born to mothers with an anxiety disorder, the odds ratio of being diagnosed with anxiety was more than twice as high than for the rest of the population (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 2.01–3.20). If both the mother and the grandmother had had an anxiety disorder the odds ratio for the child having a diagnosis of anxiety was three times higher (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 2.04–4.75). Anxiety diagnosis in the two previous generations also increased the likelihood of the child having either more than two inpatient visits or more than 10 outpatient visits (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 2.40–2.91 and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 2.01–2.43, respectively). Conclusions: The intergenerational effect on anxiety is high. In order to minimize the risk for further transmission of anxiety disorders, increased awareness and generous use of effective treatment regimes might be of importance.

261,Compromised dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: A study using transfer function analysis,"Background: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) usually present with various neurological symptoms, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to analyze the characteristics of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) in patients with GAD. Methods: Patients (aged ≥18 years) who were diagnosed with GAD were enrolled in this study. Medically and psychiatrically healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. Subjects received the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) evaluation. Noninvasive continuous arterial blood pressure and bilateral middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity were recorded simultaneously from each subject. Transfer function analysis was used to derive the autoregulatory parameters, including phase difference, gain, and coherence function. Results: A total of 57 patients with GAD and 40 healthy volunteers were enrolled. We found that the phase difference values were significantly compromised in patients with GAD. In the Spearman correlation analysis, the phase difference values were negatively correlated with the HAMA scores and the HAMD scores. In the multiple linear regression analysis, GAD is negatively correlated with the phase difference values, whereas age is positively correlated with the phase difference values. Conclusions: Our results suggested that the dCA was compromised in patients with GAD and negatively correlated with the score of anxiety. Improving the dCA may be a potential therapeutic method for treating the neurological symptoms of GAD patients.

262,The role of oxytocin receptor gene ( &lt;i&gt;OXTR&lt;/i&gt;) DNA methylation (DNAm) in human social and emotional functioning: A systematic narrative review,"Background: The neuropeptide Oxytocin (OXT) plays a central role in birthing, mother-infant bonding and a broad range of related social behaviours in mammals. More recently, interest has extended to epigenetic programming of genes involved in oxytocinergic neurotransmission. This review brings together early findings in a rapidly developing field of research, examining relationships between DNA methylation (DNAm) of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene ( OXTR ) and social and emotional behaviour in human populations. Method: A systematic search across Web of Knowledge/Science, Scopus, Medline and EMBASE captured all published studies prior to June 2017 examining the association between OXTR DNAm and human social and emotional outcomes. Search terms included ‘oxytocin gene’ or ‘oxytocin receptor gene’ and ‘epigenetics’ or ‘DNA methylation’. Any article with a focus on social and emotional functioning was then identified from this set by manual review. Results: Nineteen studies met eligibility criteria. There was considerable heterogeneity of study populations, tissue samples, instrumentation, measurement, and OXTR site foci. Only three studies examined functional consequences of OXTR DNAm on gene expression and protein synthesis. Increases in OXTR DNAm were associated with callous-unemotional traits in youth, social cognitive deficits in Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), rigid thinking in anorexia nervosa, affect regulation problems, and problems with facial and emotional recognition. In contrast, reductions in DNAm were associated with perinatal stress, postnatal depression, social anxiety and autism in children.Conclusions: Consistent with an emerging field of inquiry, there is not yet sufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the role of OXTR DNAm in human social and emotional behaviour. However, taken together, findings point to increased OXTR DNAm in general impairments in social, cognitive and emotional functioning, and decreased OXTR DNAm in specific patterns of impairment related to mood and anxiety disorders (but not in all). Future progress in this field would be enhanced by adequately powered designs, greater phenotypic precision, and methodological improvements including longitudinal studies with multiple time-points to facilitate causal inference.

263,Associations between loneliness and perceived social support and outcomes of mental health problems: A systematic review,"Background: The adverse effects of loneliness and of poor perceived social support on physical health and mortality are established, but no systematic synthesis is available of their relationship with the outcomes of mental health problems over time. In this systematic review, we aim to examine the evidence on whether loneliness and closely related concepts predict poor outcomes among adults with mental health problems. Methods: We searched six databases and reference lists for longitudinal quantitative studies that examined the relationship between baseline measures of loneliness and poor perceived social support and outcomes at follow up. Thirty-four eligible papers were retrieved. Due to heterogeneity among included studies in clinical populations, predictor measures and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: We found substantial evidence from prospective studies that people with depression who perceive their social support as poorer have worse outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery and social functioning. Loneliness has been investigated much less than perceived social support, but there is some evidence that greater loneliness predicts poorer depression outcome. There is also some preliminary evidence of associations between perceived social support and outcomes in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Loneliness and quality of social support in depression are potential targets for development and testing of interventions, while for other conditions further evidence is needed regarding relationships with outcomes.

264,Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness training to reduce burnout and promote quality of life in police officers: The POLICE study,"Background: Police officers experience a high degree of chronic stress. Policing ranks among the highest professions in terms of disease and accident rates. Mental health is particularly impacted, evidenced by elevated rates of burnout, anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life than the general public. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, burnout and promote quality of life in a variety of settings, although its efficacy in this context has yet to be systematically evaluated. Therefore, this trial will investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention versus a waitlist control in improving quality of life and reducing negative mental health symptoms in police officers. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial has three assessment points: baseline, post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. Active police officers ( n = 160) will be randomized to Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP) or waitlist control group at two Brazilian major cities: Porto Alegre and São Paulo. The primary outcomes are burnout symptoms and quality of life. Consistent with the MBHP conceptual model, assessed secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and the potential mechanisms of resilience, mindfulness, decentering, self-compassion, spirituality, and religiosity. Discussion: Findings from this study will inform and guide future research, practice, and policy regarding police offer health and quality of life in Brazil and globally.

265,Selected psychiatric problems among college students in two Arab countries: Comparison with the USA,"Background: Psychiatric problems among college students on USA campuses are common. Little is known about similar problems in developing countries, particularly the Arab region. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of selected psychiatric problems among college students in two Arab countries: Qatar and Lebanon, and to compare them to the USA. Methods: The Healthy Minds Study, an online confidential survey of common psychiatric symptoms designed for college campuses was used. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for major depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to screen for generalized anxiety and the SCOFF questionnaire to screen for eating disorders. Comparisons were made using ANOVA, Chi-Square tests and logistic regressions. Results: A total of 1841 students participated in the study. The rates of depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 12), generalized anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10) and eating disorders (SCOFF≥3) at the combined Arab universities were 34.6, 36.1 and 20.4% respectively. The corresponding rates in the USA were: 12.8, 15.9 and 6.8% ( p &lt; 0.001 for all measures). The impact of psychiatric problems on functioning in general and academic performance in particular was more severe in the Arab countries compared to the USA ( p &lt; 0.001). Independent predictors of psychiatric problems in general included location, female gender, financial difficulties and poor grades. Being religious had a protective association with mental health. Conclusion: The rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders were significantly higher among college students in Qatar and Lebanon compared to the USA. Additional research is needed to determine whether these results reflect methodological limitations or true differences in psychopathology across these populations. If replicated, the results indicate that the psychiatric problems on college campuses in the USA are a microcosm of a global problem that needs global solutions.

266,Sleep disturbance and psychological distress are associated with functional dyspepsia based on Rome III criteria,"Background: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is considered a bio-psychosocial disorder. The role of psychosocial factors in FD pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: This study evaluated sleep quality and mood symptoms in patients with FD, assessing the associations of FD severity, disordered sleep, and psychological symptoms. One-hundred-and-fifteen adult patients with typical FD symptoms were enrolled alongside 61 healthy volunteers. Rome III criteria were used to evaluate FD symptoms; sleep disorder was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R) was utilized to determine the status of depression, anxiety and other psychological symptoms. Results: PSQI scores and nine symptomatic dimensions of SCL-90R were significantly higher in FD patients than in controls. Multiple logistic regression indicated that lower BMI, lower level of education, and sleep disturbance were independently associated with FD and FD subgroups. Hostility and phobic anxiety were independent risk factors for FD. Further analysis showed that hostility was an independent risk factor for both FD subgroups, and somatization and additional psychiatric symptoms for epigastric pain syndrome. Conclusions: We found that FD was associated with sleep disorder and psychopathological factors. These findings suggest that implementing sleeping and/or psychological therapies may help reduce FD symptoms.

267,Anxiety and depression in primary Sjögren’s syndrome: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Prevalence of anxiety and depression is high in people with Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). However, there are currently no known reported studies about anxiety/depression in pSS patients from China. Our aim was to compare anxiety/depression in pSS patients and healthy controls; to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among pSS patients in China; to evaluate its relationship with the disease activity, fatigue, pain, education, ocular surface disease, oral health, swallowing disorders, employment status, European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index(ESSPRI) as well as to analyze potential determinants of anxiety and depression. Methods: In this study, 160 pSS patients and 170 age- and sex- matched healthy controls were included. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and so on. Independent samples t-tests, χ² analyses and multivariable stepwise logistic regression modeling were used to analyze the data. Results: We found 33.8% pSS patients were anxiety, and 36.9% had depression, which were significantly higher than controls. And there were significant correlations among education, employment status, disease activity, fatigue, ocular surface disease, ESSPRI, oral health, swallowing disorders and anxiety/depression. Meanwhile, logistic regression analysis revealed that oral health and swallowing disorders were significantly associated with anxiety in pSS patients; as well as fatigue was significantly associated with depression. Conclusions: The prevalence of depression and anxiety was high in adult pSS patients. Interestingly, oral health and swallowing disorders were the most important predictors of anxiety in pSS patients. Therefore, rheumatologists should pay attention to the potential mental comorbidities while managing patients with pSS and provide the basis for mental health providers in order to identify effective strategies for preventing and treating depression and anxiety among adult pSS patients. Simultaneously, rheumatologists should also focus on the oral health and swallowing disorders in pSS patients.

268,There is more to mental illness than negative affect: Comprehensive temperament profiles in depression and generalized anxiety,"Background: Temperament and mental illness are thought to represent varying degrees along the same continuum of neurotransmitter imbalances. A taxonomy of temperament could provide the basis for a new taxonomy of mental illness. Most popular models of temperament, being based heavily on emotionality traits, show very poor ability to discriminate between mental disorders. The main goal of this study was to examine whether a temperament model based on modern neurophysiology and possessing an extensive set of non-emotionality traits provides better discrimination between Major Depression (MD), Generalized Anxiety (GAD) and Comorbid MD and GAD, in comparison to emotionality-based temperament models. Methods: Using the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire, the temperament profiles of 687 individuals (396 clients of private psychiatric and psychological practice, and 291 control subjects) were compared across four adult age groups (18–24, 25–45, 46–65, 66–84). Results: MD and GAD appear to be accurately distinguished by the traits of Motor Endurance and Motor Tempo (much lower values in depression), and Neuroticism (much higher value in anxiety). Comorbids can be distinguished based on a significant decrease in the traits of Plasticity, Intellectual Endurance, Sensitivity to Probabilities, and increased Impulsivity. These effects seemed independent of age and gender. Conclusions: The results suggest the benefits of including non-emotionality-related traits and the usefulness of a functional approach to both taxonomy of temperament and classification of mental disorders.

269,Evaluation of an electronic consultation service in psychiatry for primary care providers,"Background: This study explores the effectiveness of an electronic consultation (eConsult) service between primary care providers and psychiatry, and the types and content of the clinical questions that were asked. Methods: This is a retrospective eConsult review study. All eConsults directed to Psychiatry from July 2011 to January 2015 by Primary care providers were reviewed. Response time and the amount of time reported by the specialist to answer each eConsult was analyzed. Each eConsult was also categorized by clinical topic and question type in predetermined categories. Mandatory post-eConsult surveys for primary care providers were analyzed to determine the number of traditional consults avoided and to gain insight into the perceived value of eConsults. Results: Of the 5597 eConsults, 169 psychiatry eConsults were completed during the study period. The average response time for a specialist to a primary care provider was 2.3 days. Eighty-seven percent of clinical responses were completed by the psychiatrist in less than 15 min. The primary care providers most commonly asked clinical questions were about depressive and anxiety disorders. 88.7% of PCPs rated the eConsult service a 5 (excellent value) or 4. Conclusions: This study indicates that an eConsult psychiatry service has tremendous potential to improve access to psychiatric advice and expand the capacity to treat mental illness in primary care. Future research may include follow-up with PCPs regarding the implementation of specialist advice.

270,A video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program for internalizing problems in adolescents: Study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background: Internalizing problems are the most prevalent mental health problems in adolescents. Transdiagnostic programs are promising manners to treat multiple problems within the same protocol, however, there is limited research regarding the efficacy of such programs delivered as universal prevention programs in school settings. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of a video-based transdiagnostic rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT) universal prevention program, for internalizing problems. The second objective of the present paper will be to investigate the subsequent mechanisms of change, namely maladaptive cognitions. Methods: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted, with two groups: a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program and a wait list control. Power analysis indicated that the study will involve 338 participants. Adolescents with ages between 12 and 17 years old, from several middle schools and high schools, will be invited to participate. Assessments will be conducted at four time points: baseline (T₁), post-intervention (T₂), 3 months follow-up (T₃) and 12 months follow-up (T₄). Intent-to-treat analysis will be used in order to investigate significant differences between the two groups in both primary and secondary outcomes. Discussion: This is the first randomized controlled trial that aims to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of change of a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program, delivered in a school context. The present study has important implications for developing efficient prevention programs, interactive, that will aim to target within the same protocol both anxiety and depressive symptoms.

271,"Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa clinical trial on the effects of an estrogen-progestin combination as add-on to inpatient psychotherapy in adult female patients suffering from anorexia nervosa","Background: There is a need for novel treatment approaches in anorexia nervosa (AN). While there is broad knowledge with regard to altered appetite regulation and neuropsychological deficits in AN patients on the one hand, and the effects of estrogen replacement upon neuropsychological performance in healthy subjects on the other, up to now, no study has implemented estrogen replacement in AN patients, in order to examine its effects upon AN-associated and general psychopathology, neuropsychological performance and concentrations of peptide components of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and within appetite-regulating circuits. Methods: This is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effects of a 10-week oral estrogen replacement (combination of ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg and dienogest 2 mg) in adult female AN patients. The primary target is the assessment of the impact of sex hormone replacement upon neuropsychological performance by means of a neuropsychological test battery consisting of a test for verbal intelligence, the Trail making test A and B, a Go/No-go paradigm with food cues and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Secondary targets include a) the examination of safety and tolerability (as mirrored by the number of adverse events), b) assessments of the impact upon eating disorder-specific psychopathology by means of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), c) the influence upon anxiety using the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), d) assessments of plasma cortisol levels during a dexamethasone-suppression test and appetite-regulating plasma peptides (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, glucose) during an oral glucose tolerance test and, e) a possible impact upon the prescription of antidepressants. Discussion: This is the first study of its kind. There are no evidence-based psychopharmacological options for the treatment of AN. Thus, the results of this clinical trial may have a relevant impact on future treatment regimens. Novel approaches are necessary to improve rates of AN symptom remission and increase the rapidity of treatment response. Identifying the underlying biological (e.g. neuroendocrinological) factors that maintain AN or may predict patient treatment response represent critical future research directions. Continued efforts to incorporate novel pharmacological aspects into treatments will increase access to evidence-based care and help reduce the burden of AN.

272,"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and their associated factors in mild COPD patients from community settings, Shanghai, China: A cross-sectional study","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious disease frequently accompanied by anxiety and depression. Few studies have focused on anxiety and depression for mild COPD patients in China. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors for anxiety and depression among patients with mild COPD in urban communities. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 275 mild COPD patients was conducted in 6 communities randomly sampled from Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China, in 2016. Data on socioeconomic factors and health conditions were acquired through a face-to-face interview as well as a physical examination. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and EQ-5D visual analogue (EQ-5D vas ) were applied to evaluate their mental health and quality of life, respectively. Logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidential intervals (CI) for risk factors associated with anxiety or depression. Results: Among 275 subjects, 8.1% had anxiety and 13.4% had depression. Logistic regression analysis indicated that female patients were more likely to suffer from anxiety than male patients (aOR = 6.41, 95% CI:1.73-23.80). Poor health status (EQ-5Dvas score &lt; 70) was significantly associated with increased risks of anxiety (aOR = 5.99, 95% CI: 2.13-16.82) and depression (aOR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.29-5.52). Conclusions: There were increased risks of anxiety and depression in mild COPD patients living in urban communities. Female sex and poor health status were significantly correlated to anxiety or depression. More interventions should be developed to reduce the risks of anxiety and depression at the early stage of COPD.

273,A research study review of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients: Needs assessment for future research and an impassioned plea,"Background: Rates of psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients (delirium, depression, anxiety disorders) remain unchanged. However, patient numbers have increased as the population has aged; indeed, cancer is a chief cause of mortality and morbidity in older populations. Effectiveness of psychiatric interventions and research to evaluate, inform, and improve interventions is critical to these patients’ care. This article’s intent is to report results from a recent review study on the effectiveness of interventions for psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients; the review study assessed the state of research regarding treatment effectiveness. Unlike previous review studies, this one included non-traditional/alternative therapies and spirituality interventions that have undergone scientific inquiry. Methods: A five-phase systematic strategy and a theoretic grounded iterative methodology were used to identify studies for inclusion and to craft an integrated, synthesized, comprehensive, and reasonably current end-product. Results: Psychiatric medication therapies undoubtedly are the most powerful treatments. Among them, the most effective (i.e., “best practices benchmarks”) are: (1) for delirium, typical antipsychotics—though there is no difference between typical vs. atypical and other antipsychotics, except for different side-effect profiles, (2) for depression, if patient life expectancy is ≥ 4–6 weeks, then a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and if &lt; 3 weeks, then psychostimulants or ketamine, and these generally are useful anytime in the cancer disease course, and (3) for anxiety disorders, bio-diazepams (BDZs) are most used and most effective. A universal consensus suggests that psychosocial (i.e., talk) therapy and spirituality interventions fortify the therapeutic alliance and psychiatric medication protocols. However, trial studies have had mixed results regarding effectiveness in reducing psychiatric symptoms, even for touted psychotherapies. Conclusions: This study’s findings prompted a testable linear conceptual model of co-factors and their importance for providing effective psychiatric care for end-stage cancer patients. The complicated and tricky part is negotiating patients’ diagnoses while articulating internal intricacies within and between each of the model’s co-factors. There is a relative absence of scientifically derived information and need for more large-scale, diverse scientific inquiry. Thus, this article is an impassioned plea for accelerated study and better care for end-stage cancer patients’ psychiatric conditions.

274,"How to customize a bona fide psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder? A two-arms, patient blinded, ABAB crossed-therapist randomized clinical implementation trial design [IMPLEMENT 2.0]","Background: Bona fide psychotherapy approaches are effective treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared to no-treatment conditions. Treatment manuals and protocols allow a relatively high degree of freedom for the way therapists implement these overall treatment packages and there is a systematic lack of knowledge on how therapists should customize these treatments. The present study experimentally examines two implementation strategies of customizing a bona fide psychotherapy approach based on a 16 session time-limited cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol and their relation to the post-session and ultimate treatment outcomes. Methods: This trial contrasts two different implementation strategies of how to customize the in-session structure of a manual-based CBT-protocol for GAD. The patients will be randomly assigned to two implementation conditions: (1) a systematic focus on subtle changes lasting from 7 to 20 min at the check-in phase of every psychotherapy session and (2) a state-of-the-art (SOTA) check-in phase lasting several minutes mainly focused on the session goals. Potential therapist effects will be examined based on an ABAB crossed-therapist design. Treatment outcomes will be assessed at the following times: post-session outcomes, treatment outcome at post assessment and 6- as well as 12-month follow-up. Discussion: The proposed randomized clinical implementation trial addresses the clinically relevant question of how to customize a bona fide psychotherapy protocol experimentally contrasting two implementation strategies. Through the development and testing of the proposed implementation design, this trial has the potential to inform therapists about efficacious implementation strategies of how to customize a manual-based treatment protocol in respect to the timing of the in-session structure.

275,Anxiety and its predictive value for pain and regular analgesic intake after lumbar disc surgery—A prospective observational longitudinal study,"Background: Ongoing pain after surgery is a major problem and influences recovery and the quality of life of the patient. Associations between anxiety and their impact on postoperative pain after herniated disc surgery have been reported, but the results are inconsistent. The aim of the present longitudinal study was to evaluate the predictive value of preoperative anxiety for postoperative ongoing pain and prolonged analgesic intake after herniated disc surgery. Methods: 106 patients with lumbar disc herniation were evaluated in the study. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) before surgery. Pain intensity was assessed on a numeric rating scale (NRS) at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months after surgery. Regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of pain and regular utilization of analgesics up to 6 months after surgery while controlling for confounding variables. Results: 42.5% of the patients were rated as anxiety cases (sum scores GAD-7 &gt; 5), mean scores of anxiety showed mild to moderate symptom severity, and 43% suffered from chronic pain before surgery. Six months after surgery, 55.6% of the patients indicated pain levels of 4/10 (NRS) or higher and about 40% still took pain medication on a regular basis, regardless of their preoperative classification as anxiety-case (37.7% and 41.5%). The preoperative pain level was statistically significant for ongoing postsurgical pain in all four analyses ( p &lt; 0.001). With binary logistic regression analyses, preoperative pain intensity, but neither demographic factors nor preoperative anxiety, was identified as predictor for postoperative pain and need for analgesic medication up to 6 months after lumbar disc surgery. Conclusion: We found no evidence for the presence of anxiety before disc surgery being a prognostic factor for ongoing pain and regular postoperative intake of analgesics. Only preoperative pain intensity was predictive for increased pain and continued need for analgesic medication up to 6 months after lumbar disc surgery.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01488617.

276,Characteristics of patients with depression initiating or switching antidepressant treatment: Baseline analyses of the PERFORM cohort study,"Background: Patients who require a switch in their antidepressant therapy may have different clinical profiles and treatment needs compared with patients initiating or maintaining a first-line antidepressant therapy. Methods: The Prospective Epidemiological Research on Functioning Outcomes Related to Major depressive disorder (MDD) (PERFORM) study was a 2-year observational cohort study in outpatients with MDD in five European countries. Enrolled patients were either initiating or undergoing the first switch to an antidepressant monotherapy. Baseline data on patients’ clinical status, functioning, productivity, quality of life and medical-resource use were compared in a cross-sectional baseline analysis. Results: A total of 1402 patients were enrolled, of whom 1159 (82.7%) provided analysable baseline data. The majority (78.7%) of the analysable population were initiating antidepressant treatment and most (83.6%) were enrolled and followed up by general practitioners. Compared with patients initiating antidepressants, those switching antidepressants (21.3%) tended to have more severe depressive symptoms, greater anxiety, worse health-related quality of life, greater functional impairment, greater medical-resource use and had a different medical history. Limitations included an over-representation of switches due to lack of efficacy among patients who were switching treatment, as patients were selected based on presence of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with MDD who are switching treatment for the first time have a different profile and different depression-associated health needs compared with those initiating treatment. Therapeutic management should therefore be adapted for patients who switch.

277,Pragmatic RAndomised controlled trial of a trauma-focused guided self-help Programme versus InDividual traumafocused cognitive Behavioural therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (RAPID): Trial protocol,"Background: There is good evidence that trauma-focused therapies for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder are effective. However, they are not always feasible to deliver due a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the patient. An online trauma-focused Guided Self-Help (GSH) programme which could overcome these barriers has shown promise in a pilot study. This study will be the first to evaluate GSH against standard face-to-face therapy to assess its suitability for use in the NHS. Methods: The study is a large-scale multi-centre pragmatic randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, with assessors masked to treatment allocation. One hundred and ninety-two participants will be randomly allocated to receive either face-to-face trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TFCBT) or trauma-focused online guided self-help (GSH). The primary outcome will be the severity of symptoms of PTSD over the previous week as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM5 (CAPS-5) at 16 weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include PTSD symptoms over the previous month as measured by the CAPS-5 at 52 weeks plus the Impact of Event Scale—revised (IES-R), Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT-O), Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), short Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES) measured at 16 and 52 weeks post-randomisation. Changes in health-related quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D and the level of healthcare resource utilisation for health economic analysis will be determined by an amended version of the Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt Inventory European Version. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) will be collected at 16 weeks post-randomisation to evaluate treatment satisfaction. Discussion: This study will be the first to compare online GSH with usual face-to-face therapy for PTSD. The strengths are that it will test a rigorously developed intervention in a real world setting to inform NHS commissioning. The potential challenges of delivering such a pragmatic study may include participant recruitment, retention and adherence, therapist retention, and fidelity of intervention delivery.

278,Yoga for posttraumatic stress disorder—A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Yoga is increasingly used as a therapeutic treatment and seems to improve psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence of yoga for reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and IndMED were searched through July 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of yoga on symptoms of PTSD. Mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. The quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation were graded according to the GRADE recommendations. Results: Seven RCT s ( N = 284) were included. Meta-analysis revealed low quality evidence for clinically relevant effects of yoga on PTSD symptoms compared to no treatment (SMD = − 1.10, 95% CI [− 1.72, − 0.47], p &lt; .001, I² = 72%; MD = − 13.11, 95% CI [− 17.95, − 8.27]); and very low evidence for comparable effects of yoga and attention control interventions (SMD = − 0.31, 95%CI = [− 0.84, 0.22], p = .25; I² = 43%). Very low evidence was found for comparable retention of patients in the trial for yoga and no treatment (OR = 0.68, 95%CI [0.06, 7.72]) or attention control interventions (OR = 0.66, 95%CI [0.10, 4.46]). No serious adverse events were reported. Limitations: Few RCTs with only limited sample size were available. Conclusions: Only a weak recommendation for yoga as an adjunctive intervention for PTSD can be made. More high quality research is needed to confirm or disconfirm these findings.

279,Towards characterizing the regional cerebral perfusion in evaluating the severity of major depression disorder with SPECT/CT,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder worldwide, but now there is a lack of clinically effective assessment and management of MDD. In this study, we used technetium-99 m ethylcysteinate dimer ([99mTc]ECD) SPECT/CT to characterize the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) status of MDD patients, and to explore an objective image assessment model of MDD which is non- or minimally-invasive, convenient and accurate in a clinical setting. Methods: The severity of MDD was assessed by three trained psychiatrists, based on scores obtained from HAMD and HAMA. [⁹⁹mTc]ECD rCBF SPECT/CT was performed in 20 healthy controls and 74 unipolar MDD patients before receiving the treatment. The CT attenuation-corrected SPECT images data were automatically registered, analyzed simultaneously by 3D-SSP and eZIS. Results: The mean score of HAMD and HAMA in the MDD patients was 25.49 ± 6.00, and 23.12 ± 5.83, respectively. There was a positive correlation between two scores. The MDD women had higher HAMD scores than MDD men. The decreased rCBF of MDD patients in frontal lobes (bilateral B11, B47 and right B4, B6, B10, B46), temporal lobe (right B21, B41, B42) and cingulated cortex (bilateral B24, B33), while their increased rCBF in occipital lobe (bilateral B17, B19 and left B18). Additionally, the depression severity was negatively correlated with decreased rCBF in left ventral anterior cingulate cortex B24, and was positively correlated with decreased rCBF in left inferior prefrontal gyrus B47 and increased rCBF in right associative visual cortex B19. The anxiety severity was negatively correlated with decreased rCBF in left subgenual cortex B25. Conclusions: Although the mechanism underlying the correlation is not yet fully understood, our findings indicated that the rCBF SPECT/CT may provide an objective assessment for MDD severity. It might be used monitoring therapeutic efficacy in the management of MDD.

280,"Risk and protective factors associated with the mental health of young adults in Kabul, Afghanistan","Background: We examined the mental health status and severity of psychological distress symptoms among young adults residing in Kabul, Afghanistan and determined how such outcomes might be influenced by an array of risk and protective factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was adopted using convenience, snowball, and street-intercept recruitment techniques. Surveys were completed by 232 young adults between 18 and 35 years of age in September 2015. We used both etic (mental health component of the SF-8) and emic (Afghan Symptom Checklist) measures of mental health and psychological distress, respectively, and regressed these outcome measures against socio-demographic, physical health, and psychological variables (resilience, hope-optimism) using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods. Results: We found that poor mental health is common in this sample, affecting 75% of participants; and, that distress symptoms (depressive, anxiety, and somatoform symptoms) occur often. Regression models were consistent in showing higher education as a risk-factor for both outcomes, whereas, age, ethnicity, and income significantly contributed only to the ASCL model as risk-factors. However, both outcomes were strongly influenced by protective factors such as good physical health status and higher perceived hope-optimism. Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence of how current economic conditions in Kabul contribute to poor mental health and symptom severity, but also show how positive physical health and perceived hope-optimism can be protective. This study provides support for developing culturally-competent policies and interventions that build on protective factors.

281,Psychopathological and sociodemographic features in treatment-resistant unipolar depression versus bipolar depression: A comparative study,"Background: Some authors have hypothesized that Treatment-Resistant Unipolar Depression (TRD-UP) should be considered within the bipolar spectrum disorders and that hidden bipolarity may be a risk factor for TRD-UP. However, there are neither studies comparing clinical and sociodemographic data of patients with TRD-UP versus Bipolar (BP) disorders nor are there any examining differences versus Bipolar type I (BP-I) and Bipolar type II (BP-II). Methods: Charts analysis was conducted on 194 patients followed at the Mood Disorders Clinic of the McGill University Health Center. Sociodemographic, clinical features and depression scales were collected from patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for TRD-UP ( n = 100) and BP (n = 94). Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine clinical predictors independently associated with the two disorders. Results: Compared to BP, TRD-UP patients exhibited greater severity of depression, prevalence of anxiety and panic disorders, melancholic features, Cluster-C personality disorders, later onset of depression and fewer hospitalizations. Binary logistic regression indicated that higher comorbidity with anxiety disorders, higher depression scale scores and lower global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores, and lower number of hospitalizations and psychotherapies differentiated TRD-UP from BP patients. We also found that the rate of unemployment and the number of hospitalizations for depression was higher in BP-I than in BP-II, while the rate of suicide attempts was lower in BP-I than in BP-II depressed patients. Conclusions: These results suggest that TRD-UP constitutes a distinct psychopathological condition and not necessarily a prodromal state of BP depression.

282,Prevalence and stability of mental disorders among young adults: Findings from a longitudinal study,"Background: Mental disorders often have onset early in life, contribute substantially to the global disease burden, and may interfere with young people’s ability to complete age-relevant tasks in important developmental periods. However, knowledge about prevalence and course of mental disorders in young adulthood is sparse. The aim of the current study was to estimate prevalence and stability of mental disorders from the twenties to the thirties/forties. Methods: DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in two waves (1999–2004 and 2010–2011) in 1623 young adult Norwegian twins (63.2% women, aged 19–29 years in wave 1). Results: In wave 1, the 12-month prevalence of any mental disorder among people in the twenties was 19.8% (men) and 32.4% (women), anxiety disorders: 9.6% (men) and 26.7% (women), anxiety disorders excluding specific phobias: 2.5% (men) and 6.9% (women), major depressive disorder (MDD): 4.4% (men) and 7.2% (women), and alcohol use disorder (AUD): 8.7% (men) and 4.4% (women). The prevalence of any mental disorder decreased from the twenties to the thirties/forties. This was due to a decrease in AUD and specific phobias. Anxiety disorders in the twenties predicted anxiety disorders and MDD ten years later, even when controlling for the association between these disorders in the twenties. MDD in the twenties predicted MDD ten years later. At both ages, two-week and 12-month prevalence estimates differed markedly for MDD - indicating an episodic course. Conclusions: Common mental disorders are highly prevalent among young adults in the twenties, and somewhat less prevalent in the thirties/forties. Those who suffer from one mental disorder in the twenties are at considerably increased risk for suffering from a disorder ten years later as well. This may have significant implications for young people’s ability to attain education, establish a family, and participate in occupational life.

283,Does Chinese calligraphy therapy reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: There are currently no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of Chinese calligraphy therapy (CCT) to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the efficacy of CCT for people with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Methods: We searched Chinese and English databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Wanfang Data for relevant articles published between the earliest year available and December 2016. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical studies and the associated keywords were “handwriting,” “Chinese calligraphy,” “Chinese calligraphy therapy,” “Calligraphy exercise,” and “Calligraphy training.” The 21 articles that met these criteria were used in the analysis. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used to assess methodological quality. Results: CCT significantly reduced psychosis (10 studies, 965 subjects, standardized mean difference [SMD] = − 0.17, 95% confidence intervals [CI] [− 0.30, − 0.40], Z = 2.60, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety symptoms (9 studies, 579 subjects, SMD = − 0.78, 95% CI [− 0.95, − 0.61], Z = 8.98, p &lt; 0.001), and depressive symptoms (7 studies, 456 subjects, SMD = − 0.69, 95% CI [− 0.88, − 0.50], Z = 7.11, p &lt; 0.001). CCT also significantly improved cognitive function (2 studies, 55 subjects, MD = 2.17, 95% CI [− 0.03, 4.38], Z = 1.93, p = 0.05) and neurofeedback (3 studies, 148 subjects, SMD = − 1.09, 95% CI [− 1.44, − 0.73], Z = 6.01, p &lt; 0.001). The therapy also significantly reduced the positive psychopathological expression of schizophrenia symptoms (4 studies, 287 subjects, SMD = − 0.35, 95% CI [− 0.59, − 0.12], Z = 2.96, p = 0.003) and reduced the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (4 studies, 276 subjects, SMD = − 1.39, 95% CI [− 1.65, − 1.12], Z = 10.23, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: CCT exerts a curative effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the evidence remains insufficient. A large number of RCTs are needed to facilitate additional systematic reviews of evidence for CCT.

284,Digital IAPT: The effectiveness &amp;amp; cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for depression and anxiety disorders in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme: Study protocol for a randomised control trial,"Background: Depression and anxiety are common mental health disorders worldwide. The UK’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme is part of the National Health Service (NHS) designed to provide a stepped care approach to treating people with anxiety and depressive disorders. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is widely used, with computerised and internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT and iCBT, respectively) being a suitable IAPT approved treatment alternative for step 2, low- intensity treatment. iCBT has accumulated a large empirical base for treating depression and anxiety disorders. However, the cost-effectiveness and impact of these interventions in the longer-term is not routinely assessed by IAPT services. The current study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders in IAPT. Methods: The study is a parallel-groups, randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT interventions for depression and anxiety disorders, against a waitlist control group. The iCBT treatments are of 8 weeks duration and will be supported by regular post-session feedback by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, during, and at the end of the 8-week treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-up. A diagnostic interview will be employed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Participants in the waitlist control group will complete measures at baseline and week 8, at which point they will receive access to the treatment. All adult users of the Berkshire NHS Trust IAPT Talking Therapies Step 2 services will be approached to participate and measured against set eligibility criteria. Primary outcome measures will assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Secondary outcome measures will allow for the evaluation of long-term outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Analysis will be conducted on a per protocol and intention-to-treat basis. Discussion: This study seeks to evaluate the immediate and longer-term impact, as well as the cost effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for depression and anxiety. This study will contribute to the already established literature on internet-delivered interventions worldwide. The study has the potential to show how iCBT can enhance service provision, and the findings will likely be generalisable to other health services.

285,Stability of personality traits over a five-year period in Swedish patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and non-psychotic individuals: A study using the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 19[109] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2019-20248-001). After publication of the original article, it was brought to our attention that some of the numbers in Table 3 were incorrectly reported due to data entry errors. The corrected Table 3 can be found in the erratum—Modified values are marked with bold. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.] Background: Personality is considered as an important aspect in persons with psychotic disorders. Several studies have investigated personality in schizophrenia. However, no study has investigated stability of personality traits exceeding three years in patients with schizophrenia. This study aims to investigate the stability of personality traits over a five-year period among patients with schizophrenia and non-psychotic individuals and to evaluate case-control differences. Methods: Patients with psychotic disorders ( n = 36) and non-psychotic individuals ( n = 76) completed Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP) at two occasions five years apart. SSP scores were analysed for effect of time and case-control differences by multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and within-subjects correlation. Results: MANCOVA within-subjects analysis did not show any effect of time. Thus, SSP mean scale scores did not significantly vary during the five-year interval. Within subject correlations (Spearman) ranged 0.30–0.68 and 0.54–0.75 for the different SSP scales in patients and controls, respectively. Patients scored higher than controls in SSP scales Somatic Trait Anxiety, Psychic Trait Anxiety, Stress Susceptibility, Lack of Assertiveness, Detachment, Embitterment, and Mistrust. Conclusion: The stability of the SSP personality trait was reasonably high among patients with psychotic disorder, although lower than among non-psychotic individuals, which is in accordance with previous research.

286,Internet-based grief therapy for bereaved individuals after loss due to Haematological cancer: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Approximately 10% of the individuals experiencing the death of a loved one develop prolonged grief disorder (PGD) after bereavement. Family members of haematological cancer patients might be particularly burdened since their loss experience is preceded by a very strenuous time of disease and aggressive treatment. However, support needs of relatives of cancer patients often remain unmet, also after the death of the patient. Therapeutic possibilities are enhanced by providing easily available and accessible Internet-based therapies. This study will adapt and evaluate an Internet-based grief therapy for bereaved individuals after the loss of a significant other due to haematological cancer. Methods: The efficacy of the Internet-based grief therapy is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group. Inclusion criteria are bereavement due to hematological cancer and meeting the diagnostic criteria for PGD. Exclusion criteria are severe depression, suicidality, dissociative tendency, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, and current psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment. The main outcome is PGD severity. Secondary outcomes are depression, anxiety, somatization, posttraumatic stress, quality of life, sleep quality, and posttraumatic growth. Data is collected pre- and posttreatment. Follow-up assessments will be conducted 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of the intervention. The Internet-based grief therapy is assumed to have at least moderate effects regarding PGD and other bereavement-related mental health outcomes. Predictors and moderators of the treatment outcome and PGD will be determined. Discussion: Individuals bereaved due to haematological cancer are at high risk for psychological distress. Tailored treatment for this particularly burdened target group is missing. Our study results will contribute to a closing of this healthcare gap.

287,Trajectories of antidepressant medication use in individuals before and after being granted disability pension due to common mental disorders- a nationwide register-based study,"Background: Early retirement caused by disability pension (DP) due to common mental disorders (CMDs) is frequent in European countries. Inadequate treatment, e.g., suboptimal antidepressant (AD) medication before DP can be crucial in such DP. This explorative study aimed to disentangle trajectories of AD based on defined daily dose (DDD) before and after granted DP, and to characterize the trajectories by socio-demographics and medical factors. Methods: All 4642 individuals in Sweden aged 19–64 with incident DP due to CMD in 2009–2010 were included. Trajectories of annual DDDs of AD were analysed over a 6-year period by a group-based trajectory method. Associations between socio-demographic or medical factors and different trajectories were estimated by chi2-test and multinomial logistic regression. Results: Five trajectories of ADs were identified. Three groups, comprising 34%, 34%, and 21% of the cohort, had constant AD levels before and after DP with mean annual DDDs of 29, 234, and 580, respectively. Two groups, each including 6% of the cohort, had increasing levels of DDDs, levelling off at around 1150 and 785 DDDs after DP. Particularly age, outpatient care due to mental diagnoses and DP diagnoses were significantly associated with different trajectories ( p &lt; 0.05). All the groups had a larger proportion of older individuals (&gt; 50%, 45–64 years), except for the ‘increasing low’ group, where younger individuals were in majority (&gt; 60%, 18–44 years), who more frequently exited labour market due to ‘anxiety disorders’, with lower education and more specialised healthcare before DP than the other groups. Conclusion: The heterogeneity among the five trajectory groups was partly explained by age, the severity of the mental disorder and the DP diagnoses. DDDs of ADs, though on different levels, varied marginally before and after granted DP in the majority. Moreover, AD levels were very low in one third of the individuals. Early identification and focus on the ‘increasing low’ group might be important in order to identify individuals at risk for further increase in annual DDDs of ADs even after granted DP, and might also contribute in prevention of DP. Further detailed research regarding different groups is warranted.

288,Assessment of grief-related rumination: Validation of the German version of the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS),"Background: Bereavement can result in severe mental health problems, including persistent, severe and disabling grief symptoms, termed complicated grief. Grief rumination (i.e., repetitive thought about the causes and consequences of the loss) is a malleable cognitive risk-factor in adjustment to bereavement. The Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS) was recently developed to assess grief rumination. The present study aimed to develop and validate a German version of the UGRS. Methods: An online survey including measures of demographic and loss-related variables, grief rumination (UGRS), depressive rumination (brooding and reflection), and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and complicated grief, was administered online among 159 persons (87% women) who had lost a first-degree relative in the past three years. UGRS item analyses, a confirmatory factor analysis and associations of grief rumination with brooding, reflection and symptom levels were performed. Results: The internal consistency of the UGRS was good. The confirmatory factor analysis obtained a good fit for a model with five correlated grief rumination subscales. The UGRS contributed uniquely to the prediction of complicated grief symptoms even when controlling for symptoms of anxiety and depression, brooding, reflection, and demographic and loss-related variables. Discriminant validity of the UGRS was demonstrated by the fact that higher UGRS scores were found in participants with a higher likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of complicated grief ( d &gt; 1.60). Conclusion: The translated UGRS showed very good psychometric properties and the correlations with maladaptive ruminative styles and complicated grief symptoms demonstrated the clinical relevance of grief rumination. Limitations concerning generalisability of the results are discussed.

289,"Patients admitted to hospital after suicide attempt with violent methods compared to patients with deliberate self-poisoning -a study of background variables, somatic and psychiatric health and suicidal behavior","Background: In Norway, there are about 550 suicides recorded each year. The number of suicide attempts is 10–15 times higher. Suicide attempt is a major risk factor for suicide, in particular when violent methods are used. Suicide attempts with violent methods have hardly been studied in Norway. This study describes demographic, psychiatric and somatic health in patients admitted to somatic hospitals in Norway after suicide attempt by violent methods compared with suicide attempters using deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Methods: Patients admitted to somatic hospital after suicide attempt aged &gt; 18 years were included in a prospective cohort study, enrolled from December 2010 to April 2015. Demographics (gender, age, marital and living condition, educational and employment status), previous somatic and psychological health were registered. Patients who had used violent methods were compared with patients admitted after suicide attempt by DSP. Results: The study included 80 patients with violent methods and 81 patients with DSP (mean age both groups 42 yrs.). Violent methods used were cutting (34%), jumping from heights (32%), hanging (14%), others (10%), shooting (7%) and drowning (4%). Patients with violent methods had more often psychosis than patients admitted with DSP (14% vs 4%, p &lt; 0. 05), less anxiety disorders (4% vs 19%, p &lt; 0.01) and less affective disorders (21% vs. 36%, p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between the numbers of patients who received psychiatric treatment at the time of the suicide attempt (violent 55% versus DSP 48%) or reported previous suicide attempt, 58% in patients with violent methods and 47% in DSP. Patients with violent methods stayed longer in hospital (14.3 (mean 8.3–20.3) vs. 2.3 (mean 1.6–3.1) days, p &lt; 0.001), stayed longer in intensive care unit (5 days vs. 0.5 days, p &lt; 0.001) and were in need of longer mechanical ventilation (1.4 vs 0.1 days, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with violent methods had more often psychosis, less anxiety disorders and affective disorders than patients with DSP. Psychiatric treatment before the attempt and previous suicide attempt was not significantly different between the groups and about half of the patients in both groups were in psychiatric treatment at the time of the suicide attempt.

290,"“Happy feet”: Evaluating the benefits of a 100-day 10,000 step challenge on mental health and wellbeing","Background: An increased awareness of the health benefits of walking has emerged with the development and refinement of accelerometer equipment. Evidence is beginning to highlight the value of promoting walking, particularly focusing on the Japanese mark of obtaining 10,000 steps per day. Workplace based step challenges have become popular to engage large cohorts in increasing their daily physical activity in a sustainable and enjoyable way. Findings are now highlighting the positive health effects of these medium-term programs (typically conducted over a few months) in terms of cardiovascular health, reducing diabetes risk and improving lifestyle factors such as weight and blood pressure. As yet, research has not focused on whether similar improvements in psychological health and wellbeing are present. Methods: This study investigated the impact of a 100-day, 10,000 step program on signs of depression, anxiety and stress as well as general wellbeing using standardised psychological scales. Results: The results indicated a small but consistent effect on all of these measures of mental health over the term of the program. This effect appeared irrespective of whether a person reached the 10,000 step mark. Conclusions: These results highlight improved mental health and wellbeing in people undertaking this 100-day 10,000 step program and indicates the efficacy and potential of these programs for a modest, yet important improvement in mental health. Notably, targets reached may be less important than participation itself.

291,Problematic internet use and psychiatric co-morbidity in a population of Japanese adult psychiatric patients,"Background: Many studies reported the high prevalence of problematic internet use (PIU) among adolescents (13–50%), and PIU was associated with various psychiatric symptoms. In contrast, only a few studies investigated the prevalence among the adult population (6%). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PIU and psychiatric co-morbidity among adult psychiatric patients. Methods: Three hundred thirty-three adult psychiatric patients were recruited over a 3-month period. Two hundred thirty-one of them completed the survey (response rate: 69.4%, 231/333; Male/Female/Transgender: 90/139/2; mean age = 42.2). We divided participants into “normal internet users” and “problematic internet users” using a combination of Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS). Demographic data and comorbid psychiatric symptoms were compared between the two groups using self-rating scales measuring insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale, AIS), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), anxiety (State-trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Adult ADHD Self-report Scale, ASRS), autism (Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, OCI), social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS), alcohol abuse, and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsive Scale, BIS). Results: Among 231 respondents, 58 (25.1%) were defined as problematic internet users, as they scored high on the IAT (40 or more) or CIUS (21 or more). The age of problematic internet users was significantly lower than that of normal internet users (p &lt; 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). The problematic internet users scored significantly higher on scales measuring sleep problems (AIS, 8.8 for problematic internet users vs 6.3 for normal internet users, p &lt; 0.001), depression (BDI, 27.4 vs 18.3, p &lt; 0.001), trait anxiety (STAI, 61.8 vs 53.9, p &lt; 0.001), ADHD (ASRS, part A 3.1 vs 1.8 and part B 3.5 vs 1.8, p &lt; 0.001), autism (AQ, 25.9 vs 21.6, p &lt; 0.001), OCD (OCI, 63.2 vs 36.3, p &lt; 0.001), SAD (LSAS, 71.4 vs 54.0, p &lt; 0.001), and impulsivity (BIS, 67.4 vs 63.5, p = 0.004). Conclusions: The prevalence of PIU among adult psychiatric patients is relatively high. As previous studies reported in the general population, lower age and psychiatric comorbidity were associated with PIU among adult psychiatric patients. More research is needed to determine any causal relations between PIU and psychopathological illnesses.

292,Gender differences in mental health problems among adolescents and the role of social support: Results from the Belgian health interview surveys 2008 and 2013,"Background: To investigate how social support relates to mental health problems for Belgian late adolescents and young adults 15–25 years of age. Additionally, we examine changes in mental health problems between 2008 and 2013 and investigate gender differences. Methods: Multivariate analysis of variance was used to investigate (1) psychological distress, (2) anxiety and (3) depression among 713 boys and 720 girls taken from two successive waves (2008 and 2013) of a representative sample of the Belgian population (Belgian Health Interview survey). Psychological distress was measured by the General Health Questionnaire, anxiety and depression by the Symptom Check-List-90-Revised. Results: Gender differences were found for psychological distress, anxiety and depression with girls reporting significantly higher scores than boys. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that adolescents who are dissatisfied with their social contacts and experience poor social support reported more psychological distress, anxiety and depression. In addition, young adult boys (20–25 years of age) were more likely to experience psychological distress when compared to late adolescent boys (15–19 years of age). Finally, the prevalence of anxiety and depression increased substantially between 2008 and 2013 for girls and to a lesser extent for boys. Conclusions: Especially girls and young people with poor social support experience mental health problems more frequently than boys and those with strong social support. Improving social support among young people may serve as a protective buffer to mental health problems.

293,Does presence of metabolic syndrome impact anxiety and depressive disorder screening results in middle aged and elderly individuals? A population based study,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are common in primary care setting but often remain undiagnosed. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is also prevalent in the general population and can impair recognition of common mental disorders due to significant co-morbidity and overlap with psychiatric symptoms included in self-reported depression/anxiety screening tools. We investigated if MetS has an impact on the accuracy of current major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) screening results using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Methods: A total of 1115 (562 men; mean age 62.0 ± 9.6 years) individuals of 45+ years of age were randomly selected from the general population and evaluated for current MetS; depressive and anxiety symptoms (HADS); and current MDD and GAD (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]). Results: The MetS was diagnosed in 34.4% of the study participants. Current MDD and GAD were more common in individuals with MetS relative to individuals without MetS (25.3% vs 14.2%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001; and 30.2% vs 20.9%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). The ROC analyses demonstrated that optimal thresholds of the HADS-Depression subscale for current MDE were ≥ 9 in individuals with MetS (sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 73% and PPV = 52%) and ≥ 8 in individuals without MetS (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 78% and PPV = 38%). At threshold of ≥ 9 the HADS-Anxiety subscale demonstrated optimal psychometric properties for current GAD screening in individuals with MetS (sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 85% and PPV = 72%) and without MetS (sensitivity = 84%, specificity = 83% and PPV = 56%). Conclusions: The HADS is a reliable screening tool for current MDE and GAD in middle aged and elderly population with and without MetS. Optimal thresholds of the HADS-Depression subscale for current MDD is ≥ 9 for individuals with MetS and ≥ 8 - without MetS. Optimal threshold of the HADS-Anxiety subscale is ≥ 9 for current GAD in individuals with and without MetS. The presence of MetS should be considered when interpreting depression screening results.

294,Attentional bias modification in reducing test anxiety vulnerability: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: A tendency to selectively process a threat to positive information may be involved in the etiology of anxiety disorders. The aim of this study is to examine whether attentional bias modification (ABM) can be used to modify high test-anxiety individuals’ attention to emotional information and whether this change is related to anxiety vulnerability. Methods: Seventy-seven undergraduates were included: 28 individuals received a 5-day modified dot probe task as ABM training, 29 individuals received a 5-day classic dot probe task as placebo, and 20 individuals did not receive an intervention between the two test sections. In addition to the measure of biased attention, salivary α-amylase (sAA) and the visual analogue scale of anxiety were assessed as emotional reactivity to stress. Results: A repeated measurement of variance analysis and paired sample t-test indicated that the ABM group showed a significant change in attentional bias scores after the 5-day training, whereas there were no changes in the attentional bias scores in the placebo or waiting list groups. Importantly, anxiety vulnerability with attention to threats was significantly decreased in the training group. Conclusions: These results suggest that attentional bias toward threat stimuli may play an important role in anxiety vulnerability. The attentional bias modification away from the threat is effective for the individuals preparing for an exam.

257,School-related and individual predictors of subjective well-being and academic achievement,"Recent research in the educational context has focused not only on academic achievement but also on subjective well-being (SWB) as both play a major role in students’ lives. Whereas the determinants of academic achievement have been extensively investigated, little research has been conducted on school-related determinants of SWB in comparison with other students’ characteristics. In the present cross-sectional study, we set out to investigate whether perceived school climate predicts school grades and SWB above and beyond other variables that are important for SWB and academic achievement. A sample of 767 8th and 9th grade students ( n = 361 female adolescents; age: M = 14.07 years, SD = 0.92) completed measures of SWB, perceived school climate, test anxiety, self-efficacy, and interest. Grade point average (GPA) indicated students’ academic achievement. Data were analyzed with latent structural equation models in which GPA and SWB were regressed on the school climate variables and students’ characteristics. Results indicated that a positive school climate as well as self-efficacy and the worry component of test anxiety predicted SWB and/or GPA after all other variables were controlled for. Directions for future research and the importance of school climate variables on adolescents’ SWB and academic achievement are discussed.

258,Preliminary validation of the Italian Night Eating Questionnaire (I-NEQ-16): Item analysis and factor structure,"Night eating syndrome (NES) severity is usually assessed with the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ). Although the most common version of the NEQ is composed of 14 items (NEQ-14), two additional items measuring distress associated with the night eating have been proposed, but they have never been included in past psychometric studies. The aim of the present study was to create an Italian version of the NEQ-16 (I-NEQ-16), with the inclusion of the proposed items for assessing the distress associated with night eating. A major objective of the study was to propose a unidimensional version of the I-NEQ-16 and investigate its psychometric properties. 482 Italian adults (380 women and 102 men; mean age = 25.5, SD = 10.9 years old) were administered the Italian versions of the NEQ, the Night Eating Diagnostic Questionnaire (NEDQ), and questionnaires measuring binge eating, emotional and external eating, diurnal chronotype, insomnia, and anxiety and depression severity. In order to improve the unidimensionality of the I-NEQ-16, we removed from further analyses items 1, 4, and 7, because they increased the heterogeneity of the measure. Confirmatory factor analysis, indicated the fit of a modified one-factor model, allowing correlated errors between three pairs of items. I-NEQ-16 scores were significantly associated with all concurrent questionnaire scores and were able to categorize individuals according to their diagnosis of NES according to the NEDQ. Thus, the I-NEQ-16 is a valid measure that is potentially useful for investigating correlates of night eating in the general population.

259,"Lower trait stability, stronger normative beliefs, habitual phone use, and unimpeded phone access predict distracted college student messaging in social, academic, and driving contexts","The goal of the present study was to test two models of phone messaging behaviors among college students—a sociocognitive connection model and a cybernetic personality system model—across three contexts, where messaging behaviors represented disengagement from the primary context: a meal time with friends, attending class, and driving. Using a sample of university students ( N = 634), path analyses with boot-strapping procedures were used to model direct and indirect effects of behavioral, social cognition, and personality trait predictors of primary context disengagement via message checking, message reading, and message sending behaviors. Internal and comparative model fit information showed the cybernetic personality system model represented the data well across all three contexts. Across the contexts, phone related habits and normative beliefs about phone usage mediated relations between personality traits and messaging behaviors. In addition, stronger normative beliefs for messaging behaviors and stronger phone related habits predicted unimpeded physical phone access across the contexts. Across contexts, more frequent messaging behaviors were most strongly predicted by the variance shared by low trait self-discipline, high trait anxiety, and high trait altruism via phone-related habits. The results are discussed in terms of the predictive utility of testing process models of messaging behaviors across varying contexts, as well as possible forms of intervention for reducing primary context disengagement via messaging behaviors.

260,Assessment of burden among family caregivers of schizophrenia: Psychometric testing for short-form Zarit Burden Interviews,"Objective: Although various short forms of Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) have been developed, there is a lack of standard psychometric testing and comparison among them. The study aims to examine the psychometric properties of ten short versions of the most frequently used ZBI among a sample of schizophrenia caregivers and to find the one with the best performance. Methods: Cross-sectional door-to-door survey of ZBI-22 and a series of validated instrument data from 327 family caregivers of schizophrenia patients in a Chinese rural community were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016. Reliability was assessed using McDonald's omega coefficient (ω). Validity including concurrent validity, known group's validity, and criterion validity were assessed by Spearman correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. Overall discrimination ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Reliability was generally good for all short forms (ω = 0.69–0.84), except for the Gort ZBI-4 (ω = 0.58), which is acceptable considering its small item numbers. Concurrent validity was good across all various ZBI forms with significant negative correlations with patient's function ( r = −0.34 to −0.48, p &lt; 0.01), as well as significant positive correlations with caregiver's depression ( r = 0.49–0.65, p &lt; 0.01), and anxiety symptoms ( r = 0.45–0.58, p &lt; 0.01). Known groups' validity (carers with disease vs. without disease; carers being parents vs. spouse vs. others) showed inconsistent results among various short forms. Criterion validity was generally good for all short forms with significant positive correlations with Family Burden Interview Schedule ( r = 0.67–0.75, p &lt; 0.01), except for the Higginson ZBI-1( r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01). Discriminative ability was also good for all short forms (AUC range: 0.85–0.99), with various cutpoints proposed. Among all ten short forms, the Ballesteros ZBI-12 and the Gort ZBI-7 outperformed others with almost equally good performance in comprehensive psychometric testing. Conclusions: This study provides support for the reliability, validity, and discriminative ability of the ten various short forms of ZBI for use among schizophrenia family caregivers, with the Ballesteros ZBI-12 and the Gort ZBI-7 endorsed as the best ones.

261,Cognitive and affective correlates of Chinese children’s mathematical word problem solving,"Mathematical word problem solving (MWPS) involves multiple steps, including comprehending the problem statements, determining the arithmetic operations that have to be performed, and finding the answers. This study investigated the relative contributions of different cognitive and affective variables to children’s MWPS. To achieve this goal, 116 third-grade Chinese children were tested. Results showed that after controlling for age and non-verbal intelligence, the abilities to solve direct and indirect mathematical word problems were positively correlated with the working memory component of executive function, reading comprehension ability, math fact fluency and math anxiety. Moreover, math anxiety was found to fully mediate the relationships between reading anxiety and MWPS. Implications of the findings on how to promote children’s MWPS skills were discussed.

262,State anxiety impairs proactive but enhances reactive control,"Cognitive control is a construct that prioritizes how we process stimuli and information to flexibly and efficiently adapt to internal goals and external environmental changes. The Dual Mechanism of Control (DMC) theory delineates two distinct cognitive control operations: proactive control and reactive control (Braver, 2012). Anxiety has been posited to differentially affect proactive and reactive control, due to its influence on working memory and attention allocation (Eysenck et al., 2007; Fales et al., 2008). However, no study has yet directly compared the influence of anxiety on proactive and reactive control in the same individuals. In this study, we examined how state anxiety affected proactive control, using the AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), and reactive control, using the classic Stroop task. Based on theory and previous investigations, we expected that state anxiety would enhance reactive control but impair proactive control. Consistent with our predictions, we found that state anxiety, induced with a threat of shock manipulation, inhibited proactive control on the AX-CPT test, but increased reactive control in the Stroop task. Anxiety may impair proactive control in contexts requiring goal maintenance by occupying limited working memory capacity, whereas it may enhance reactive control via facilitated attention allocation to threat and engaging the conflict monitoring system to quickly modify behavior.

263,Structure of Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety with Chinese college students: A bifactor approach,"The Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety (ASDA), as one of the most widely used measures of death anxiety (DA), has increasingly been applied in many studies. However, the structures derived from different studies are highly inconsistent. In this study, both traditional and novel (bifactor) modeling approaches were used, to investigate the most optimal structure of the ASDA in a sample of 984 Chinese college students. After a series of comparisons, the results showed that the bifactor model, with a dominant general DA factor and three distinct sub-dimensions, was the most optimal measurement structure, and measurement invariance of this bifactor model between sexes was also confirmed. Based on the implications of this bifactor model, the discussion was focused mainly on whether distinct dimensions should be interpreted or not. Some strengths and limitations of the study were also discussed at the end of the paper.

264,Does emotional intelligence mediate the relation between mindfulness and anxiety and depression in adolescents?,"High anxiety and depression are often observed in the Australian adolescent population, and if left untreated, can have long-term negative consequences impacting educational attainment and a range of important life outcomes. The utilization of mindfulness techniques has been associated with decreased anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms for this is only beginning to be understood. Previous research with adult samples has suggested that the development of emotional intelligence (EI) may be one mechanism by which mindfulness confers its benefits on wellbeing. This study is the first to examine the relation between mindfulness, EI, anxiety, and depression in an adolescent population. It was hypothesized that EI would mediate the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety, as well as mindfulness and depression. The sample consisted of 108 adolescents from a public secondary school, aged between 13 and 15 years ( M age = 13.68, SD age = 0.56, 51 males and 57 females). Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire which measured dispositional mindfulness, EI, anxiety, and depression. The results indicated that one subscale of EI – Emotional Recognition and Expression (ERE) mediated the relation between mindfulness and anxiety, while two subscales of EI—ERE and Emotional Management and Control (EMC) mediated the relation between mindfulness and depression. Future research utilizing a mindfulness intervention should be conducted to examine whether the use of mindfulness increases EI and decreases anxiety and depression in adolescents.

265,Anticipation of uncertain threat modulates subsequent affective responses and covariation bias,"Uncertainty contributes to stress and anxiety-like behaviors by impairing the ability of participants to objectively estimate threat. Our study used the cue-picture paradigm in conjunction with the event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the temporal dynamics of anticipation for and response to uncertain threat in healthy individuals. This task used two types of cue. While ‘certain’ cues precisely forecasted the valence of the subsequent pictures (negative or neutral), the valence of pictures following ‘uncertain’ cues was not predictable. ERP data showed that, during anticipation, uncertain cues elicited similar Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN) to certain-negative cues, while both of them elicited larger SPN than certain-neutral cues. During affective processing, uncertainty enlarged the mean amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) for both negative and neutral pictures. Behavioral data showed that participants reported more negative mood ratings of uncertain-neutral pictures relative to certain-neutral pictures and overestimated the probability of negative pictures following uncertain cues. Importantly, the enlarged anticipatory activity evoked by uncertain cues relative to that evoked by certain-neutral cues positively modulated the more negative mood ratings of uncertain-neutral pictures relative to certain-neutral pictures. Further, this more negative mood ratings and the general arousal anticipation during anticipatory stage contributed to the covariation bias. These results can provide a novel insight into understanding the neural mechanism and pathological basis of anxiety.

266,Caregiver depression and early child development: A mixed-methods study from rural China,"Half of rural toddlers aged 0–3 years in China's Qinling Mountainous region are cognitively delayed. While recent studies have linked poor child development measures to the absence of positive parenting behaviors, much less is known about the role that caregiver depression might play in shaping child development. In this paper, a mixed methods analysis is used to explore the prevalence of depression; measure the association between caregiver depression and children's developmental delays, correlates of depression, and the potential reasons for caregiver depression among women in rural China. The analysis brings together results from a large-scale survey of 1,787 caregivers across 118 villages in one northwestern province, as well as information from in-depth interviews with 55 female caregivers from these same study sites. Participants were asked to respond to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) as well as a scale to measure children's social-emotional development, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ-SE). We also administered a test of early childhood development, the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III), to all of the study household's infants and toddlers. The results show that the prevalence of depression may be as high as 23.5 percent among all female caregivers (defined as scoring in the mild or higher category of the DASS-21). Grandmothers have higher prevalence of depression than mother caregivers ( p &lt; 0.01). Caregiver depression also is significantly associated with a 0.53 SD worsening of children's social-emotional development ( p &lt; 0.01) and a 0.12 SD decrease in children's language development ( p &lt; 0.05). Our qualitative findings reveal six predominant reasons for caregiver depression: lack of social support from family and friends; the burden of caregiving; lack of control and agency within the household; within-family conflict; poverty; the perception of material wealth as a measure of self-worth. Our findings show a serious lack of understanding of mental health issues among rural women, and suggest that rural communities could benefit greatly from an educational program concerning mental health and its influence on child development. Our findings confirm the need for a comprehensive approach toward rural health, with particular attention paid to mental health awareness and support to elderly caregivers.

267,No time like the present: Thinking about the past and the future is related to state dissociation among individuals with high levels of psychopathological symptoms,"Several short-term pathways have been implicated in relation to dissociative experiences, among them are daily stress, sleepiness, and rumination. In addition, it has been claimed that mechanisms contributing to dissociative experiences may differ, according to specific psychopathological symptoms. Accordingly, this study had two aims. The first was to sample moment-to-moment increases or decreases in current stress, sleepiness, and rumination, in order to assess their temporal relations with state dissociation. Rumination was broken down to its basic two subcomponents: the negative value of the thoughts and thinking about the past (in comparison to present or future), in order to differentiate it from other repetitive thought patterns (e.g., worry). The second goal was to explore whether depression, anxiety, and obsessive–compulsive symptoms may moderate the links between the three mechanisms and specific state dissociation scales [specifically, depersonalization-derealization (DEP-DER) and absorption (ABS)]. Ninety-nine undergraduate students completed trait questionnaires and then answered state items four times a day for 4 days. These experience sampling data were analyzed using multilevel linear modeling (MLM) with Level 1 state measurements and Level 2 demographic and trait variables of the participants. Moments of stress, sleepiness, thinking about the past and negative thoughts were all associated both with state DEP-DER and with state ABS. Dissociation, negative thinking, stress, and sleepiness were positively associated with moments of thinking about the past and the future but inversely associated with moments of thinking about the present. Finally, in accordance with our expectations, the links between DEP-DER and hypothesized mechanisms were mostly moderated by depression and anxiety symptoms, whereas the links between ABS and hypothesized mechanisms were moderated mainly by obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Our findings are in accordance with literature on the efficacy of mindfulness as well as the maladaptive correlates of mind-wandering, as they suggest that dissociative detachment from one’s present occupation is associated with decreased well-being.

268,"Pathways to improving mental health in compassion-focused therapy: Self-reassurance, self-criticism and affect as mediators of change","Objective: The working mechanisms of compassion-focused therapy (CFT) remain understudied. Drawing on the theoretical model underlying CFT, we examined four putative working mechanisms—self-reassurance, self-criticism, positive/negative affect-in relation to changes in well-being and psychological distress. Methods: Data of a waitlist randomised controlled trial (N = 242) investigating the effectiveness of a self-help CFT-intervention in a non-clinical sample were analysed. Using single and multiple mediation models, we assessed if changes in self-reassurance, self-criticism and positive/negative affect during the intervention (3-month interval) mediated changes in well-being and depressive/anxiety symptoms from baseline to follow-up (6-month interval) compared to the waitlist condition. Results: For each outcome, single analyses revealed that the effects of CFT were significantly mediated by self-reassurance and self-criticism. The mediating role of affect differed across outcomes. In combined models, self-reassurance emerged as a significant mediator for well-being and anxiety symptoms. Additionally, positive and negative affect were found significant mediators of the effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary empirical evidence that CFT operates through cultivating self-reassurance, reducing self-criticism and regulating positive and negative affect in a non-clinical sample. To advance the development of CFT, further exploration of therapeutic change processes and their interplay is needed.

269,Emotional “patient-oriented” support in young patients with I–II stage breast cancer: Pilot study,"Objective: The recent increased survival rate after breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and treatment is mostly related to early screening in younger age. Evidence gained from newly detected assessed psychological needs as well as certain emotional regulatory patterns in younger survivors has been related in the literature to an extremely low rate of adherence to the psychological therapies offered. Tailored psychological support is necessary. The aim of the present study was to verify the preliminary efficacy of supportive psychological intervention with an innovative orientation: the Early BC Psychological Intervention (EBC-Psy). Methods: A controlled study design was used to investigate the efficacy of EBC-Psy intervention. Preliminary data involved twenty-four patients in the age range of 35–50 years, diagnosed with cancer at the early stage (I–II), who were exposed to the EBC-Psy intervention. To address the effect of intervention, emotional variables were tested before the treatment (Time 1) and then again after 6 months of the treatment (Time 2); evaluated emotional dimensions were anxiety, anger, depression, and psychological distress. Results: EBC-Psy intervention appears to be effective on both depression ( p = 0.02) and psychological distress ( p = 0.01), even in a short time, highlighting the strength of a reinforced positive psychological conceptual approach to deal with the “disease condition” in younger patients; on the contrary, the control group evidenced an increase in the same emotional variables in timing. Conclusion: Our findings, even if limited by this small-scale protocol, seemed to confirm the role of positive psychotherapy after BC diagnosis and treatment through the impact of cognitive processes, coping strategies, and psychological resilience. Future theoretical framework could boost the intervention to design an innovative survivorship model.

270,How do men and women perceive a high-stakes test situation?,"The results of some high-stakes aptitude tests in Austria have revealed sex differences. We suggest that such discrepancies are mediated not principally by differences in aptitudes, skills, and knowledge but sex differences in test takers' perceptions of the test situation. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that candidates' evaluations of the fairness of the testing tool are of great importance from an institutional point of view because such perceptions are known to influence an organization's attractiveness. In this study, we aimed to investigate how women and men perceive and evaluate certain aspects of a high-stakes test situation by using the results and evaluations of an actual medical school aptitude test (747 applicants; 59% women). Test takers voluntarily evaluated the test situation and rated specific aspects of it (e.g., the fairness of the selection tool) and provided information regarding their test anxiety immediately after they completed the 4-h test. Data analyses indicated small, albeit significant sex differences in participants' perceptions of the test. Men described the test situation as slightly giving more opportunity to socialize and possessing more opportunity to deceive than women did. Furthermore, the perception of the test situation did not directly predict the test results, but it served as a moderator for the indirect effect of test anxiety on test results. By contrast, there were significant direct effects but no indirect effects of situation perception on evaluations of the fairness of the selection tool: The more the test situation was perceived as a high-pressure situation, the lower the fairness ratings of the testing tool. Results were discussed with reference to gender roles and test fairness.

271,"Psychopathology, dissociation and somatic symptoms in adolescents who were exposed to traumatic experiences","Background: The direct and long-term effects of children’s exposure to traumatic events can be seen in a complex continuum, based first of all on the type of trauma. Children’s reactions to trauma may have different manifestations from the clinical picture of the PTSD, exhibiting dissociative, somatic, depressive or anxiety symptoms, and/or disruptiveness. Aim: we conducted a cross-sectional study in a psychiatric patients sample to determine the extent to which complex trauma history is associated with disease-related characteristics (diagnosis, dissociative symptoms, somatic symptomatology, impairment degree). Methods: We have enrolled 107 subjects, aged between 12 and 18 years, who consecutively referred for a psychiatric evaluation to the Child Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Del Ponte Hospital in Varese. All subjects underwent a clinical evaluation performed by infantile neuropsychiatrists. The battery of tests that was administered to patients included CGI and CGAS (filled out by the clinician), CBCL (filled out by parents), MMPI-A and TSSC-A (filled out by patients), and Wechsler scale. Results: We found out that 35.5% of subjects had a mood disorder, 23.4% a personality disorder, 13.1% a psychotic disorder, 20.6% a post-traumatic stress disorder, while 26.2% were classified as other diagnostic categories (more frequently ADHD, DOP and conduct disorders). 58.9% of patients had at least one comorbidity. 33.6% of subjects also experienced a complex trauma. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, subgroup fellows were collapsed to compare the single trauma and no trauma versus complex trauma group. Gender, age and affective disorders were generally unrelated to subjects’, clinicians’, and parents’ scores. About subjects’ self-assessment (MMPI-A Structural Summary Factors), complex trauma history was a statistically significant contributor to high scores on the Immaturity, Health Concerns, Familial Alienation and Psychoticism Factors, followed by presence of dissociative symptoms (except for Familial Alienation factor). Presence of dissociative symptoms, personality and psychotic disorder diagnosis was related to higher clinician impairment scores (CGI-S &gt; 4). Conclusion: These results reinforce available evidence that in trauma-exposed adolescents, the full burden of trauma, including other psychiatric diagnosis than PTSD (such as affective, personality, and psychotic disorders), dissociative and somatic symptomatology, is substantial and needs appropriate assessment and therapeutic interventions.

272,The assertive resolution of conflicts in school with a gamified emotion education program,"Coexistence in schools inevitably carries a higher risk of conflicts among peers. This fact can be detrimental to the well-being and academic achievement of the students. In many developed countries, about 90% of the pupils in compulsory secondary education report witnessing assaults among peers. In this regard, recognizing, controlling and managing emotions is key to ensure a healthy and effective interaction with others. Negative emotions, such as anger, can trigger conflicts or even episodes of violence if not regulated properly. Interactive tools, such as specialized software’s, have shown high rates of efficacy for the training of different kinds of competences like the regulation of emotions. The aim of the present work is to describe the Happy Emotional Education Program and its effects over a sample of secondary school students. This software focuses in the training of emotional competences of the students with the objective of solving conflicts in a more assertive way. The design employed in the present work was a quasiexperimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. Results show that Happy Emotional Education Program contributes to the management of emotions and the absence of negative affect or anxiety in a significant way. Additionally, the constant use of this interactive tool enhances motivation and the learning process of students. Results also indicate the importance of assessing the effects of the program in the long term. This would enable researchers to further assess the effects of the program over those emotional competences that are more resistant to change given its stable nature.

273,Metacognitive therapy versus cognitive behavioral therapy: A network approach,"A network perspective on mental problems represents a new alternative to the latent variable perspective. Diagnoses are assumed to refer to a causal network of observable mental problems or symptoms (observables). The observable symptoms that traditionally have been considered indicators of latent traits (disorders) are taken to be directly related causal entities. Few studies have investigated how different therapies affect a network-structure of symptoms and processes. In this study, three anxiety symptoms, three depression symptoms and mechanisms in the form of cognitions, metacognitions, worry and threat monitoring were selected. The network structure over the course of therapy for metacognitive therapy (MCT) and Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was investigated. It was hypothesized that worry, attention, and metacognition would be important nodes in MCT and that cognitions would be important in CBT. The data used in the analysis are from a RCT where 74 patients with comorbid anxiety disorders were randomized to either transdiagnostic MCT or disorder-specific CBT. Symptoms and mechanisms were measured every week. The data was analyzed using the multilevel vector autoregressive (mlVAR) model, which is currently the most developed method to analyze multivariate time series in multiple subjects and construct networks. The results indicate that there were different networks of symptoms and mechanisms in MCT and CBT. Central nodes in both treatments are worry and attention, however, the node of negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability was more central in the MCT treatment. The results are consistent with predictions from the S-REF model.

274,"A multilevel analysis of job characteristics, emotion regulation, and teacher well-being: A job demands-resources model","This study integrated personal factors into the job demands-resources (JD-R) model to examine school- and individual-level predictors of teacher well-being. Survey data were gathered from 1,656 teachers from 54 schools. The results of hierarchical linear modeling indicated that the school-level emotional job demands of teaching and suppression at the individual level were positively related to teachers' anxiety and depression whereas school-level trust in colleagues and individual-level reappraisal were positively associated with enthusiasm and contentment. Positive relationship between emotional job demands and suppression was also found. These findings support the claim that reappraisal should be considered a personal resource and suppression a personal demand.

275,Exploring the incorporation of a positive psychology component in a cognitive behavioral internet-based program for depressive symptoms. Results throughout the intervention process,"Traditionally, evidence-based treatments for depression have focused on negative symptoms. Different authors describe the need to include positive affect as a major target of treatment. Positive psychology aims to fill this gap. Reaching everyone in need is also important, and Internet-based interventions can help in this task. The present study is a secondary analysis derived from a randomized controlled trial aimed to test the efficacy of an Internet-based intervention for patients with depressive symptoms. This intervention consisted of an 8-module Internet-based program that combined four modules based on cognitive-behavioral therapy strategies and four modules based on positive psychology strategies. The main goal of this secondary analysis is to report the data collected after each module from the participants who completed the intervention, explore the changes throughout the intervention process, and examine the changes observed in the different variables before versus after the introduction of the positive psychology component. A total of 103 patients completed the intervention. At pre-, post-intervention, and post-module evaluations, they completed positive and negative affect, depression, and anxiety measures. Negative affect and anxiety decreased significantly during the implementation of the cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychology modules. However, depression and positive affect improved only after the introduction of the positive psychology modules. This is the first study to explore, throughout the intervention process (module by module), the incorporation of a positive psychology component in an Internet-based program. Results suggest that positive psychology techniques might have an impact on clinical symptomatology, and they emphasize the need to include these techniques to achieve a more profound change in positive functioning measures.

276,Plasma protein pattern correlates with pain intensity and psychological distress in women with chronic widespread pain,"Objectives: Although generalized muscle pain, tiredness, anxiety, and depression are commonly present among chronic widespread pain (CWP) patients, the molecular mechanisms behind CWP are not fully elucidated. Moreover, the lack of biomarkers often makes diagnosis and treatment problematic. In this study, we investigated the correlation between pain intensity, psychological distress, and plasma proteins among CWP patients and controls (CON). Methods: The plasma proteome of CWP ( n = 15) and CON ( n = 23) was analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Orthogonal Partial Least Square analysis (OPLS) was used to determine proteins associated with pain intensity (numeric rating scale) in CWP and psychological distress (Hospital and Depression Scale, HADS) in CWP and CON. Significant proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF and tandem MS. Results: In CWP, pain intensity was associated with plasma proteins mostly involved in metabolic and immunity processes (e.g., kininogen-1, fibrinogen gamma chain, and ceruloplasmin), and psychological distress was associated with plasma proteins related to immunity response, iron ion, and lipid metabolism (e.g., complement factor B, complement C1r subcomponent, hemopexin, and clusterin). Discussion: This study suggests that different plasma protein patterns are associated with different pain intensity and psychological distress in CWP. Proteins belonging to the coagulation cascade and immunity processes showed strong associations to each clinical outcome. Using the plasma proteome profile of CWP to study potential biomarker candidates provides a snapshot of ongoing systemic mechanisms in CWP.

277,"Maternal attachment style, interpersonal trauma history, and childbirth-related post-traumatic stress","Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress has potentially negative and enduring consequences for the well-being of women and their families. Although research to date has identified attachment style and trauma history as individual risk factors, they have yet to be examined as integrative processes in the development and maintenance of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. The current investigation aimed to examine whether attachment style may moderate the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology across the first 6 months of the postpartum period. A large community sample of women were recruited from two Canadian urban hospitals. Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed longitudinally at 5 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months postpartum. Latent growth curve modeling ( n = 251) revealed that attachment style moderated the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology, while controlling for other well-established psychosocial (e.g., trait anxiety, previous psychopathology, lack of perceived support) and childbirth-related (e.g., mode of birth, labor pain, subjective experience) risk factors. More secure attachment conferred resiliency and more fearful attachment conferred vulnerability among women without a history of interpersonal trauma, while more preoccupied and more dismissing attachment conferred resiliency among women with a history of interpersonal trauma. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the integrative processes among risk and protective factors underlying the development of and ability to cope with childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. Attachment style and trauma history, which can be quickly measured, should be considered as targets in antenatal screening.

278,Promoting emotional well-being in older breast cancer patients: Results from an ehealth intervention,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with increases in diagnoses at all ages. Due to several age-related factors, older breast cancer patients show particular difficulties in adjusting to breast cancer and its related treatments. One consistent indicator of vulnerability to long-term complications is emotional distress occurring within 3 months of diagnosis. Thus, it is critical to develop early interventions specifically aimed at mitigating distress and promoting emotional wellbeing in older breast cancer patients. By taking advantage of the opportunities of online interventions, the present study aimed to test the efficacy of a 2 weeks e-health stress inoculation training (SIT) intervention on emotion regulation and cancer-related well-being, compared with a control group without such intervention. Twenty-nine women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, who had received radical surgery and who were suitable candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxanes (mean age = 62.76; SD = 6.19) voluntarily took part in the current study after giving written informed consent. To test intervention efficacy, self-report questionnaires were administered to all participants at baseline, at the end of the 2 weeks intervention, and 3 months after the end of the intervention. Results showed that after 2 weeks of ehealth intervention, patients did not achieve significant change, however, they significantly reduced emotional suppression and increased cancer-related emotional well-being 3 months after the end of the intervention. Furthermore, by monitoring at a distance the emotional experience during the online intervention, we found an increase in relaxation and a reduction of anxiety. Finally, patients in the experimental group reported a good level of acceptance of the ehealth intervention. To conclude, designing and developing eHealth interventions as part of the regular care path for breast cancer patients of all ages represents both a challenge and an opportunity; in particular, online interventions can be an important step in universal psychosocial care within a tiered model of care.

279,"Dimensions of anxiety, age, and gender: Assessing dimensionality and measurement invariance of the State-Trait for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA) in an Italian sample","The State–Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA) is a widely used measure of state and trait anxiety that permits a specific assessment of cognitive and somatic anxiety. Previous research provided inconsistent findings about its factor structure in non-clinical samples (e.g., hierarchical or bi-factor structure). To date, no psychometric validation of the Italian version of the STICSA has been conducted. Our study aimed to determine the psychometric functioning of the Italian version of the STICSA, including its dimensionality, gender and age measurement equivalence, and convergent/divergent validity in a large sample of community-dwelling participants ( N = 2,938; 55.9% female). Through confirmatory factor analysis, the multidimensional structure of both State and Trait STICSA scales, with each including Cognitive and Somatic dimensions, was supported. Factor structure invariance was tested and established at configural, metric, and scalar levels for males and females. Additionally, full factorial measurement invariance was supported for the State scale across young, middle age, and old adult groups whereas the Trait scale was partially invariant across age groups. The STICSA also showed good convergent validity with concurrent anxiety measures (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory), and satisfactory internal discriminant validity with two depression measures (Teate Depression Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory-II). Results provided support for the multidimensionality of the STICSA, as well as the generalizability of the State and Trait scales as independent measures of Cognitive and Somatic symptomatology across gender in the general population. Implications for research and personality and clinical assessment are discussed.

280,A latent class approach for classifying the problem and disordered gamers in a group of adolescence,"Gaming disorder is not yet recognized as a formal psychiatric disorder, and consensus is still lacking in the field concerning the definition of gaming disorder and what methods should be used to measure it. In order to deal with methodological challenges related to previously suggested approaches, the aim of the present study was to develop an alternative assessment procedure for gaming disorder using a latent class cluster approach, and to compare the criterion validity of this procedure with existing assessment procedures. A representative sample of 3,000 adolescents ( n = 1,500 female) aged 17.5 years was drawn from the National Registry, and 2,055 participants responded (yielding a response rate of 70.3%). The Gaming Addiction Scale for Adolescents was used to measure gaming disorder and measures of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and aggression were used to test criterion validity. A model with five Latent Class Clusters represented the best fit [BIC(LL) = 21,253,7; L² = 3,881,204; df = 1,978; Class. Err. = 0.1239]. The five different groups were labeled never symptoms (46.2%), rarely symptoms (22.3%), occasionally symptoms (23.5%), problem gamers (6.9%), and disordered gamers (1.2%). The groups displayed different probabilities of responses (never/rarely/sometimes/often/very often) to the seven Gaming Addiction Scale items. Regarding criterion validity, MANOVA revealed a significant overall main effect of latent classes [ F (20, 6359) = 13.50, p &lt; 0.001; Wilks Lambda = 0.871]. All dependent variables (loneliness, depression, anxiety, verbal, and physical aggression) reached statistical significance when results from the dependent variables were considered separately. Comparing the present approach with previous suggested classifications of gaming addiction offered by Lemmens et al. and Charlton and Danforth, the present approach showed greater specificity in terms of number of classes identified. We conclude that the Latent Class approach identifying five different groups of gamers offers a more refined view on addiction compared to previous assessment procedures.

281,Validation of the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS) with Bulgarian substance dependent individuals,"Background: The Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS) is a 23-item self-report questionnaire that assesses four well-validated personality risk factors for substance misuse (Impulsivity, Sensation Seeking, Anxiety Sensitivity, and Hopelessness). While the SURPS has been used extensively with adolescents at risk for substance dependence, its properties with adult substance-dependent populations have been understudied. Further, the validity of the Bulgarian version of the SURPS has not been evaluated. The aims of the present study were to examine the factor structure of the Bulgarian version of the SURPS, its psychometric properties, and its ability to distinguish individuals with substance dependence from healthy controls. Methods: Participants included 238 individuals ages 18 to 50 (45% female): 36 “pure” (i.e., mono-substance dependent) heroin users, 34 “pure” amphetamine users, 32 polysubstance users, 64 controls with no history of substance dependence, 43 unaffected siblings of heroin users, and 29 unaffected siblings of amphetamine users. We explored the factor structure of the Bulgarian version of the SURPS with confirmatory factor analyses, examined its reliability and validity, and tested for group differences between substance dependent and non-dependent groups. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) replicated the original four-factor model of the SURPS. The four subscales of the SURPS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.71 to 0.85) and adequate concurrent validity. Significant group differences were found on the Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking subscales, with the three substance dependent groups scoring higher than controls. Conclusions: The SURPS is a valid instrument for measuring personality risk for substance use disorders in the Bulgarian population. The Bulgarian version of the SURPS demonstrates adequate to good reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Its ability to distinguish between groups with and without a history of substance dependence was specific to externalizing traits such as Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking, on which opiate, stimulant, and polysubstance dependent individuals scored higher than non-dependent controls.

282,"A cross-lagged study of developmental trajectories of video game engagement, addiction, and mental health","Objectives: Video game addiction has been associated with an array of mental health variables. There is a paucity of longitudinal studies investigating such associations, and studies differentiating addicted gaming from problem and engaged (i.e., frequent but non-problem) gaming. The current explorative study investigate the natural course of gaming behavior in three sub-studies. The aim of study 1 was to investigate antecedents and consequences of video game addiction measured as a unidimensional construct (pathological gaming). Aim of study 2 was to investigate the same associations in terms of typologies of gamers (“engaged,” “problem,” “addicted”). Furthermore, study 3 aimed to investigate the estimated stability and transitions occurring between the aforementioned typologies, and a non-pathological gaming group. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 3,000 adolescents aged 17.5 years was drawn from the population registry of Norway in 2012 and invited to participate in annual surveys spanning 3 years (NT1 = 2,059, NT2 = 1,334, NT3 = 1,277). The respondents completed measures of video game addiction, depression, anxiety, loneliness, aggression, and alcohol use disorder. Statistical analysis comprised cross-lagged path modeling, Satorra-Bentler chi square test (study 1), regression analyses (study 2), hidden Markov model of transition probabilities (study 3). Results: Findings in study 1 showed that depression and loneliness were reciprocally associated with pathological gaming. Physical aggression was identified as an antecedent, and anxiety was a consequence of pathological gaming. Investigation of the three typologies of gamers (study 2) identified loneliness and physical aggression as antecedents, and depression as a consequence of all typologies. Depression was found to be an antecedent of problem and engaged gamers. Loneliness was found as a consequence of problem gamers, and anxiety was a consequence of addicted gamers. High alcohol consumption was found antecedent to addicted gamers, and low alcohol consumption was found antecedent to problem gamers. The estimated stability of video game addiction was 35%. Conclusion: A reciprocal relationship between pathological gaming and measures of mental health problems seems to exist. The stability of video game addiction indicates a condition that for a substantial number of people does not resolve spontaneously over the course of 2 years.

283,Emotional roles of mono-aminergic neurotransmitters in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders,"A growing body of researches support a role for dysfunction of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems in the neurobiological processes involved in major depression disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (ADs). The physiological changes underlying abnormal signaling of 5-HT, NE, and DA may be due to either reduced presynaptic release of these neurotransmitters or aberrant signal transductions, and thus contributing to the alterations in regulation or function of receptors and/or impaired intracellular signal processing. Animal models demonstrate crucial responsiveness to disturbance of 5-HT, NE, and DA neurotransmissions. Postmortem and biochemical studies have shown altered concentrations of 5-HT, NE, and DA metabolites in brain regions that contribute importantly to regulation of mood and motivation in patients with MDD or ADs. Neuroimaging studies have found abnormal 5-HT, NE, and DA receptors binding and regulation in regard to receptor numbers. Medications that act on 5-HT, NE, and DA neurons or receptors, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, show efficacy in both MDD and ADs. The overlapping treatment response presumably suggests a common mechanism underlying the interaction of these disorders. In this paper, we reviewed studies from multiple disciplines to interpret the role of altered 5-HT, NE and DA mono-amine neurotransmitter functions in both MDD and ADs.

284,Emotion regulation and the experience of future negative mood: The importance of assessing social support,"Emotion regulation refers to the use of various strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, to help manage our negative experiences, emotions, and thoughts. Although such emotion regulation often occurs within broader social dynamics and interactions, little is known about how social contexts interact with specific regulation strategies to shape the experience of negative emotions. Using data from 544 young adult university students, we provide initial evidence that habitual use of cognitive reappraisal is associated with lower future experience of depression and anxiety primarily through higher perceived social support (PSS). In contrast, expressive suppression is associated with higher future depression and anxiety primarily through lower PSS. These patterns are consistent with the importance of interpersonal influences on emotion regulation and suggest that assessment of social support can help elucidate the mechanisms of successfully regulating negative mood.

285,Cognitive control and flexibility in the context of stress and depressive symptoms: The cognitive control and flexibility questionnaire,"Cognitive control and (cognitive) flexibility play an important role in an individual’s ability to adapt to continuously changing environments. In addition to facilitating goal-directed behaviors, cognitive control and flexibility have been implicated in emotion regulation, and disturbances of these abilities are present in mood and anxiety disorders. In the context of stressful experiences, the reported studies examined processes related to cognitive control and flexibility, emotional regulation and depressive symptoms. To this end, a brief (18-item) self-report measure – the Cognitive Control and Flexibility Questionnaire (CCFQ) – was developed. This questionnaire measures an individual’s perceived ability to exert control over intrusive, unwanted (negative) thoughts and emotions, and their ability to flexibly cope with a stressful situation. In Study 1, the CCFQ was assessed among both university students (N = 300) and a community sample (N = 302). Preliminary analyses suggested a stable and reliable two-factor structure, that of cognitive control over emotion, and appraisal and coping flexibility. Scores on the CCFQ were strongly associated with greater depressive symptoms, even after controlling for other measures that had been taken to reflect cognitive control and (in)flexibility (e.g., the Ruminative Response Scale; Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire). In Study 2 (N = 368), lower scores on the CCFQ were related to more negative stressor appraisals (i.e., greater perceived threat and uncontrollability) of a personally meaningful stressful event. Perceptions of threat and uncontrollability, in turn, partially accounted for the association between CCFQ subscale scores and depressive symptoms. The relation between lower CCFQ scores and heightened depressive symptoms was also partially accounted for by less frequent engagement in problem-focused coping and more use of emotion-focused methods. In Study 3 (N = 47 females), lower scores on the cognitive control over emotion component of the CCFQ predicted elevated negative affect and an exacerbated cortisol response following an acute psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). The present research points to the CCFQ as a useful self-report tool to identify ways through which cognitive control and flexibility might be manifested in stressful situations, and how reductions in flexibility might be accompanied by elevated symptoms of depression.

286,Introducing and testing the Creepiness of Situation Scale (CRoSS),"When people interact with novel technologies (e.g., robots, novel technological tools), the word “creepy” regularly pops up. We define creepy situations as eliciting uneasy feelings and involving ambiguity (e.g., on how the behave or how to judge the situation). A common metric for creepiness would help evaluating creepiness of situations and developing adequate interventions against creepiness. Following psychometrical guidelines, we developed the Creepiness of Situation Scale (CRoSS) across four studies with a total of N = 882 American and German participants. In Studies 1–3, participants watched a video of a creepy situation involving technology. Study 1 used exploratory factor analysis in an American sample and showed that creepiness consists of emotional creepiness and creepy ambiguity. In a German sample, Study 2 confirmed these subdimensions. Study 3 supported validity of the CRoSS as creepiness correlated positively with privacy concerns and computer anxiety, but negatively with controllability and transparency. Study 4 used the scale in a 2 (male vs. female experimenter) × 2 (male vs. female participant) × 2 (day vs. night) field study to demonstrate its usefulness for non-technological settings and its sensitivity to theory-based predictions. Results indicate that participants contacted by an experimenter at night-time reported higher feelings of creepiness. Overall, these studies suggest that the CRoSS is a psychometrically sound measure for research and practice.

287,The efficacy of metacognitive therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Metacognitive therapy (MCT) continues to gain increased ground as a treatment for psychological complaints. During the last years, several clinical trials on the efficacy of MCT have been published. The aim of the current study was to provide an updated meta-analytic review of the effect of MCT for psychological complaints. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of trials on MCT for young and adult patients with psychological complaints published until January 2018, using PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Trials with a minimum of 10 participants in the MCT condition were included. Results: A total of 25 studies that examined a variety of psychological complaints met our inclusion criteria, of which 15 were randomized controlled trials. We identified only one trial that was conducted with children and adolescents. In trials with adult patients, large uncontrolled effect size estimates from pre- to post-treatment and follow-up suggest that MCT is effective at reducing symptoms of the targeted primary complaints, anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional metacognitions. The comparison with waitlist control conditions also resulted in a large effect (Hedges' g = 2.06). The comparison of MCT to cognitive and behavioral interventions at post-treatment and at follow-up showed pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) of 0.69 and 0.37 at post-treatment ( k = 8) and follow-up ( k = 7), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MCT is an effective treatment for a range of psychological complaints. To date, strongest evidence exists for anxiety and depression. Current results suggest that MCT may be superior to other psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral interventions. However, more trials with larger number of participants are needed in order to draw firm conclusions.

288,Dysregulated anxiety and dysregulating defenses: Toward an emotion regulation informed dynamic psychotherapy,"One of the main objectives of psychotherapy is to address emotion dysregulation that causes pathological symptoms and distress in patients. Following psychodynamic theory, we propose that in humans, the combination of emotions plus conditioned anxiety due to traumatic attachment can lead to dysregulated affects. Likewise, defenses can generate and maintain dysregulated affects (altogether Dysregulated Affective States, DAS). We propose the Experiential-Dynamic Emotion Regulation methodology, a framework to understand emotion dysregulation by integrating scientific evidence coming from the fields of affective neuroscience and Experiential-Dynamic Psychotherapy aimed at resolving DAS. This method and the techniques proposed can be integrated within other approaches. Similarities and differences with the Cognitive model of emotion regulation and cognitive-behavioral approaches are discussed within the paper.

289,How do I narrate my marriage: The relationship between attachment orientation and quality of autobiographical memory,"Attachment orientations play important roles in the generation of emotional autobiographical memory (AM). However, little research has considered the quality of autographical narratives, which may reflect the structure and content of internal working models (IWMs) of attachment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between attachment orientations and narrative quality of marriage-related autobiographical memories. Ninety-four married adults were asked to retrieve two episodes of emotional autobiographical memories. The coherence and vividness of their narratives were then coded. Results indicated that adults who were highly avoidant were more likely to present their memories in a less coherent way and to describe negative memories with more perceptual details. In contrast, attachment anxiety was associated with lower vividness of negative memories. The current findings suggest that an attachment schematic-processing strategy was used in narrating the attachment-related experiences.

290,Socially anxious tendencies affect impressions of others’ positive and negative emotional gazes,"Socially anxious tendencies have potential to become social anxiety disorder (SAD), which is characterized by fear of social situations associated with being evaluated or embarrassed by others. In particular, others’ gazes induce social anxiety. People with SAD have a negative interpretation bias toward ambiguous emotions in others’ faces; however, negative interpretation bias toward ambiguous emotions in others’ gazes has not been fully investigated. We used an impression judgment task to examine negative interpretation bias toward others’ gazes among people with socially anxious tendencies. We generated emotionally ambiguous gazes (positive, negative, and neutral) using a morphing technique with 10% steps (neutral, 10–100% negative, and 10–100% positive). Participants (all male) were asked to judge whether the stimulus was positive or negative. Each participant’s level of social anxiety was examined using the Japanese version of the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN-J), which measures three symptom dimensions: fear, avoidance, and physiological arousal. To examine the influence of socially anxious tendencies in the impression judgment task, we calculated the point of subjective equality (PSE) using a two-step logistic curve fitted to individual participant’s responses. The negative emotional intensity of the PSE became lower as the fear score became higher ( p &lt; 0.05). This result suggests individuals with a high tendency toward social anxiety tend to interpret subtle negative emotional gazes as a negative emotion and regard these gazes as a threat.

291,Measurement invariance of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 across gender in a sample of Chinese university students,"The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) has three 7-item subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress). The current study aims assess the gender-based measurement invariance of the DASS-21 questionnaire in a Chinese university student sample from five different cities. The sample was composed of 13208 participants (62.3% female, mean age of 19.7 years, and SD age = 1.8). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis supported full measurement invariance for the three subscales. The findings support the measurement invariance of DASS-21 scores across gender. Future research on the DASS should include additional validation across ethnicities and testing of all versions of the DASS.

292,Effectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions on psychological distress and the mediating role of emotion regulation,"Online mindfulness-based intervention as a feasible and acceptable approach has received mounting attention in recent years, yet more evidence is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness. The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of online mindfulness-based programs on psychological distress (depression and anxiety). The randomized controlled intervention design consisted of four conditions: group mindfulness-based intervention (GMBI), self-direct mindfulness-based intervention (SDMBI), discussion group (DG) and blank control group (BCG). The program lasted 8 weeks and a total of 76 participants completed the pre- and post-test. Results showed that participants in GMBI and SDMBI had significant pre- and post-test differences on mindfulness, emotion regulation difficulties, and psychological distress, with medium to large effect sizes. In addition, ANCOVA results indicated significant effects of group membership on post-test scores of mindfulness, depression and anxiety when controlling the pretest scores, with medium to large effect sizes. The GMBI appeared to exert the greatest effects on outcome variables in comparison with other groups. In addition, changes in emotion regulation difficulties across groups could mediate the relationship between changes in mindfulness dimensions (Observing and Describing) and changes in psychological distress across groups. These results provided encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress, and the possible mediating role of emotion regulation, while also underlining the importance of group discussion in online mindfulness-based interventions.

293,"Relationship between attachment style in adulthood, alexithymia, and dissociation in alcohol use disorder inpatients. Mediational model","Background: Attachment theory is a widely used framework for understanding emotion regulation as well as alexithymia, and dissociation and this perspective has also been applied to understand alcohol use disorders. Apart from these theoretical suggestions, there has been scarce empirical research on this subject-matter. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate potential associations between attachment style in adulthood, alexithymia, and dissociation in alcohol use disorder inpatients. Methods: The Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), and the Curious Experiences Survey (CES) were administered to a sample of 97 alcohol use disorder inpatients recruited from drug and alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, and 104 persons in control groups, Poland. Results: A comparative analysis between the group of alcohol addicts and non-addicts showed statistically significant differences related to: alexithymia, dissociation, and attachment styles. The analysis of models related to the impact of attachment styles on the level of alcohol addiction with regard to a mediatory role of alexithymia and dissociation showed that all models are well fitted to data and statistically significant: intimacy F (3.197) = 34.41; p &lt; 0.001 and explains 34% (R² = 0.3438); depend F (3.197) = 36.55; p &lt; 0.001, and explains 36% (R² = 0.3576); anxiety F (3.197) = 34.71; p &lt; 0.001, and explains 35% (R² = 0.3458) of the variability of alcohol addiction scores. Mediation analysis found that alexithymia and dissociation enhance the fear of intimacy and rejection in a romantic relationship. Conclusion: These findings support the broad attachment theory suggesting that attachment is associated with and predicts alexithymia and dissociation in the sample of substance use disorder inpatients. Alexithymia and dissociation, by inhibiting the processes of emotions’ identification and verbalization, cause that language does not serve for the purpose of changing self or others, as the communication is distorted. Absent are common meanings and accurate mutual understanding in a relationship.

294,Metacognitive beliefs predict greater mental contamination severity after an evoking source,"Mental contamination occurs when individuals experience feelings of internal dirtiness and distress in the absence of physical contact with a contaminant. Women who experience sexual trauma frequently report mental contamination. The self-regulatory executive function (S-REF) model proposes that metacognitive beliefs contribute to the appraisal and regulation of thinking, leading to expectations that metacognitive beliefs would predict greater mental contamination severity following an evoking source. Women who reported directly experiencing sexual trauma ( N = 102) completed self-report measures of metacognitive beliefs and covariates during an online study session, and subsequently completed a task that evoked mental contamination during a follow-up in-person study session. Metacognitive beliefs surrounding the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts, cognitive confidence, and the need to control thoughts positively correlated with mental contamination severity following the evoking source. Metacognitive beliefs surrounding the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts predicted greater mental contamination severity following the evoking source in multivariate analyses that statistically controlled for baseline mental contamination severity, trait anxiety, and overlap among the metacognitive beliefs. The present results provide preliminary support for the S-REF model as a potential framework for conceptualizing mental contamination.

295,The assessment of grief in refugees and post-conflict survivors: A narrative review of etic and emic research,"Background: Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is a new mental health disorder that will be recognized by the World Health Organization’s disorder classification, the ICD-11, in 2018. Current assessment measures of PGD are largely based on North American and European conceptualizations of grief (etic i.e., from the perspective of the observer). However, research is emerging from communities outside of the Global North, in particular, conflict-exposed communities, exploring local models (emic i.e., from within the cultural group), assessment measures and symptoms of grief. Several reviews have found that refugees have higher rates of mental illness, defined by etic standards as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders and psychotic symptoms. Yet, presently there are no reviews documenting the assessment of PGD in refugees and post conflict survivors. Method: This narrative review will provide an overview of studies that assess grief in refugees to (1) identify current assessment measures of grief in refugees (i.e., type and frequency of questionnaires used, whether Global North-based, etic, or locally developed, emic, and the level of cultural adaptation) and (2) to document the variety and rate of grief symptoms identified with Global North standard measures and/or local measures (i.e., the endorsement of standard symptom items and the identification of culturally specific symptoms of grief). Results: This review revealed 24 studies that assessed disordered grief in refugee or post conflict samples. Studies were heterogeneous in their assessment methods; the majority ( n = 17) used an etic approach, four used a combined etic/emic approach, and three used a predominantly emic approach. The rate of disordered grief was high depending on cultural adaptation approach (31–76%) and when standard etic measures were used the disordered grief rate was 32%. Conclusion: These findings will help to guide future studies to provide accurate assessment of grief in refugee and post conflict populations and has implications for improving cultural knowledge in clinical practice.

296,Altered neuronal responses during an affective Stroop task in adolescents with conduct disorder,"Conduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric disorder of childhood and adolescence which has been linked to deficient emotion processing and regulation. The behavioral and neuronal correlates targeting the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition are still under investigation. Whole-brain event-related fMRI was applied during an affective Stroop task in 39 adolescents with CD and 39 typically developing adolescents (TD). Participants were presented with an emotional stimulus (negative/neutral) followed by a Stroop task with varying cognitive load (congruent/incongruent/blank trials). fMRI analysis included standard preprocessing, region of interest analyses (amygdala, insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and whole-brain analyses based on a 2( group ) × 2( emotion ) × 3( task ) full-factorial ANOVA. Adolescents with CD made significantly more errors, while reaction times did not significantly differ compared to TD. Additionally, we observed a lack of downregulation of left amygdala activity in response to incongruent trials and increased anterior insula activity for CD relative to TD during affective Stroop task processing [cluster-level family-wise error-corrected ( p &lt; 0.05)]. Even though no three-way interaction ( group × emotion × task ) interaction was detected, the findings presented still provide evidence for altered neuronal underpinnings of the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD. Moreover, our results may corroborate previous evidence of emotion dysregulation as a core dysfunction in CD. Future studies shall focus on investigating the interaction of emotion processing and response inhibition in CD subgroups (e.g., variations in callous-unemotional traits, impulsivity, or anxiety).

297,Dyadic coping in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer and their spouses,"Background: Head and neck cancer (HNC) adversely affects the psychological (i.e., depression, anxiety) and marital adjustment of patients and their spouses. Dyadic coping refers to how couples cope with stress. It includes positive actions like sharing practical or emotional concerns (i.e., problem- and emotion-focused stress communication; PFSC, EFSC), and engaging in problem- or emotion-focused actions to support each other (problem- and emotion-focused dyadic coping; PFDC, EFDC). It also includes negative actions like avoidance (negative dyadic coping; NEGDC). In this secondary analysis of a randomized pilot trial of a couple-based intervention called SHARE (Spouses coping with the Head And neck Radiation Experience), we first examined associations between patients’ and spouses’ dyadic coping (and satisfaction with dyadic coping; SATDC) and their own/each other’s psychological and marital adjustment. Next, we examined the effects of SHARE relative to usual medical care (UMC) on patients’ and spouses’ dyadic coping. Finally, we examined whether changes in dyadic coping were associated with changes in patients’ and spouses’ psychological and marital adjustment. Methods and Measures: Thirty HNC patients (80% men) and their spouses ( N = 60) completed baseline surveys prior to initiating radiotherapy (RT) and were randomized to SHARE or UMC. One month after RT, they completed follow-up surveys. Results: Baseline multilevel Actor-Partner Interdependence Models revealed significant actor effects of PFSC (effect size r = −0.32) and PFDC ( r = −0.29) on depression. For marital adjustment, significant actor effects were found for PFSC, PFDC, EFDC, and SATDC ( p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.23 to 0.38). Actor ( r = −0.35) and partner effects ( r = −0.27) for NEGDC were also significant. Moderate to large effect sizes were found in favor of SHARE on PFSC (Cohen’s d = 1.14), PFDC ( d = 0.64), NEGDC ( d = −0.68), and SATDC ( d = 1.03). Improvements in PFDC were associated with reductions in depression and anxiety ( p &lt; 0.05); and, improvements in SATDC were associated with improvements in anxiety and marital adjustment ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The SHARE intervention improved positive and decreased negative dyadic coping for patients and spouses. Increases in positive dyadic coping were also associated with improvements in psychological and marital adjustment. Although findings are preliminary, more research on ways to integrate dyadic coping into oncology supportive care interventions appears warranted.

298,"Longitudinal examination of everyday executive functioning in children with ASD: Relations with social, emotional, and behavioral functioning over time","Executive functioning (EF) deficits are well-documented in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet little is known about the longitudinal trajectory of “everyday” EF and links to social, emotional and behavioral outcomes in ASD. This study examined the profile of everyday EF utilizing parent-reported measures over 2 years, and explored whether prior estimates of EF were related to later co-morbid psychopathology and social functioning in 39 children with ASD and 34 typically developing (TD) children (ages 7–14 years). According to parent reports, children with ASD had impaired scores of EF in all domains at both time points, and showed no significant improvement across 2 years, compared to controls. Regression analyses showed that prior estimates of behavior regulation difficulties at time 1 uniquely predicted later emotional (i.e., symptoms of anxiety/depression) and behavioral (i.e., oppositionality/aggressiveness) problems in children with ASD 2 years later. Furthermore, an improvement of metacognitive skills predicted a reduction of social difficulties over 2 years in ASD. These results imply that EF may be a potential target of intervention for preventing and reducing co-morbid psychopathology and promoting social competence in youth with ASD. Furthermore, the findings that EF related to behavior is more critical for later emotional and behavioral functioning, whereas EF related to cognition is more critical for social functioning, indicates that it may be beneficial to tailor treatment. Future studies investigating the effectiveness of EF-based interventions in improving the cognitive, psychological and social outcomes in ASD are of high priority.

299,Nature-based guided imagery as an intervention for state anxiety,"Anxiety is a significant mental health issue in modern society and empirical research into effective interventions to address anxiety has been extensive. Spending time in nature is one approach that has demonstrated anxiolytic effects. However, in some situations and contexts spending time in nature in order to reduce anxiety symptoms may not be possible. For example, in therapeutic settings delivered in a space with no access or exposure to any nature stimuli in the immediate surrounding environment. Guided imagery (GI) has also proven to be effective for reducing anxiety symptoms. Thus, nature-based GI might help to overcome the limitation of access to nature and strengthen the impact of GI interventions. The current study investigated the effectiveness of nature-based GI on anxiety reduction. Participants ( n = 48, 18 males, 30 females, M age = 34.54, SD age = 12.91, age range = 19 – 71 years) with moderate levels of either trait or state anxiety as measured by the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were recruited. Participants undertook both a nature-based GI session and a traditional non-nature-based GI session and their pre- and post- state anxiety levels were measured in each GI session. It was anticipated that post state anxiety scores would be significantly lower for both GI conditions and that a significantly greater anxiety reduction would be found in the nature-based GI than the urban-based GI. A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed results that supported both hypotheses. This study was the first to compare a nature based GI intervention with a traditional (non-nature based) GI intervention. Findings indicate that nature-based GI interventions are effective anxiety management interventions that have the added benefit of being cost-effective and easily accessible.

300,Explicit mental health messaging promotes serious video game selection in youth with elevated mental health symptoms,"Serious games aimed at promoting well-being in youth have promising effects and potential for far-reaching impact. Considering that most mental health disorders remain untreated in youth, therapeutic games may be most valuable when they are aimed at untreated youth with internalizing symptoms. However, when targeting youth outside of a clinical setting, the first impression of therapeutic video games may determine whether and how a game is played. Thus, understanding the influence of messaging used in the promotion of therapeutic games on game choice and experience is critical. The current study examined two alternatives in promoting mental health games: one included explicit mental health messaging (e.g., learn to manage stress) and the other was a stealth promotion that did not mention mental health but highlighted the entertainment value. Young adults with mild to severe internalizing mental health symptoms (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) were shown two distinct trailer designs, with random assignment determining which design held which message. Participants ( n = 129, M age = 21.33, SD age = 3.20), unaware that both trailers promoted the same commercial video game, were 3.71 times more likely to choose what they believed was the mental health game. Additionally, an unforeseen difference in the attractiveness of the two trailer designs resulted in participants being 5.65 times more likely to select the mental health game promoted in one trailer design over the other. Messaging did not influence game experience (i.e., gameplay duration, autonomy, competence, intrinsic motivation and affect). Exploratory analyses indicated that game experience, but not game choice, was influenced by symptom severity, symptom type and the interaction between symptom severity and messaging. The present study suggests that explicit mental health messages attract youth with mental health symptoms. Ultimately, youth may be empowered to seek out mental health games if they are promoted properly, allowing for far-reaching positive influences on well-being. Toward this aim, future research is needed on the game selection process, addressing underlying motivations, the balance between explicit health and entertainment messaging, and multiple interacting influences on game selection (e.g., promotion and peers).

301,“To suffer in paradise”: Feelings mothers share on Portuguese Facebook sites,"Background: Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster. This is overlooked by most literature, which tends to refer mothers’ pathological states of postpartum depression and anxiety, mainly seeking to understand their causes or predicting factors, and consequences on children’s development. Objective: In this study, we aim to observe the diversity of mothers’ emotional states, and to analyze both positive and negative feelings they disclose on specific public and closed motherhood sites on Facebook. We hypothesize that the intensive motherhood model is prevalent in Portuguese society, thus influencing the type of feelings and circumstances in which mothers disclose them. Methods: We collected posts and comments from the four most popular Portuguese Facebook motherhood sites during 2015 and, then, conducted a quantitative and content analysis to identify the expressed range of feelings concerning motherhood. Results: Mothers preferably share their positive feelings on public pages, whereas negative feelings are shared more in closed groups (CGs). Expressed positive and negative feelings were significantly different whether we look at normative or non-normative, public or closed sites. Discussion: We assume that motherhood sites on Portuguese Facebook reflect an intensive motherhood model that is normative in Portuguese society. Positive feelings toward children are promoted and openly shared in public normative sites, while negative feelings concerning motherhood are dealt with in the privacy of CGs. We propose an extensive motherhood model to overcome this duality and to allow women to pursue several different social roles simultaneously in an equally rewarding way.

302,The perception of facial emotional change in social anxiety: An ERP study,"Social anxiety is one of the psychological symptoms that most commonly occur in social interaction. Although previous behavioral studies have investigated the neutral-angry facial emotion change in social anxiety, none of the previous studies have, however, directly investigated the angry-neutral facial emotional change. Furthermore, less is known about the neural correlates of the facial emotion changes in individuals with social anxiety. The main goal of the present study was to explore the perception of facial emotional changes in individuals with social anxiety, using high temporal resolution event-related potential techniques. Behaviorally, accuracy in the angry-neutral facial emotional change trail was lower than that in the neutral-neutral case. Neurally, we found that the N170 amplitudes in angry-neutral facial emotional change trial were larger than those in the neutral-neutral case for high social anxiety (HAS) participants, probably reflecting that they might engage in more analytical processing of different facial elements. Interestingly, HSA participants showed smaller P200 left hemisphere amplitudes in the angry-neutral facial emotional change trial when compared with the neutral-neutral case, which suggested that they might have difficulties in processing emotions when they encounter these facial emotional changes. Finally, the late positive potential amplitudes in the neutral-angry and angry-neutral facial emotional change trials were smaller than those in the neutral-neutral case, regardless of the social anxiety. These results suggest that social anxiety influences the facial emotional changes mainly at an earlier stage of processing.

303,Psychological support for health professionals: An interpretative phenomenological analysis,"Background: The work of health care professionals (HCPs) exposes them to emotionally difficult situations, anxiety, suffering and death, so they are at risk of burnout. Objectives: To describe HCPs’ experiences of a psychological support intervention and its influence on the daily work of a sample caring for patients with neuromuscular and chronic respiratory illnesses. Methods: This exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study was carried out at the Respiratory Rehabilitation Unit of IRCCS Santa Maria Nascente, in Milan, Italy. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 10 HCPs were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results: Five related themes emerged: psychological support; repeating the experience; relationships; the role of homework; competences. HCPs perceived that the intervention influenced their daily life, giving them a secure base and a new perspective on their professional role. Conclusion: Psychological support interventions may not be appropriate for all HCPs, but they may help some HCPs to handle the demands of a stressful work life. Further studies are needed to determine its efficacy in reducing stress and prevent burnout.

One way to advance treatments is identifying process variables associated with good treatment outcomes. There is little knowledge regarding a possible association between insomnia and long-term outcomes in the treatment of chronic fatigue. Aims: Testing whether (1) improvement in insomnia is associated with improvement in levels of fatigue at 1-year follow-up, and (2) if such a relationship remains when controlling for improvement in levels of anxiety and depression, and pain in patients with chronic fatigue. Methods: Patients having been on sick leave 8 weeks or more due to chronic fatigue were referred to a return-to-work program. They received an intensive 3.5-week inpatient treatment program based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Before treatment and at 1-year follow-up the patients completed questionnaires assessing levels of insomnia severity, pain, anxiety and depression, and fatigue. Results: A regression analysis found that changes in insomnia-severity were associated with changes in fatigue-levels at 1-year follow-up. When changes in levels of anxiety and depression were entered in the regression analysis, anxiety and depression was significantly associated with levels of fatigue but insomnia was not. The association between anxiety and depression and fatigue was at a trend level when pain was entered into the model. Conclusion: Long-term improvement in insomnia severity was significantly associated with long-term improvement in chronic fatigue, but not independently of long-term improvement in anxiety and depression, and pain.

305,Perpetuating inequality: Junior women do not see queen bee behavior as negative but are nonetheless negatively affected by it,"Previous research has revealed that women may attempt to avoid negative gender stereotypes in organizations through self-group distancing, or “queen bee”, behaviors: emphasizing masculine qualities, distancing themselves from other women, and legitimizing organizational inequality. Factors that increase self-group distancing have been identified (e.g., existing discrimination and low group identification), but it is unknown how self-group distancing by an ingroup leader is perceived by and affects subordinates of the negatively stereotyped group. In the current study, female participants received ambiguous negative feedback from a male versus female leader displaying queen bee-type versus neutral behavior. As expected, a male leader displaying queen bee-type behavior was seen as having less positive intent than a male leader displaying neutral behavior, which in turn increased how sexist he was perceived to be. A female leader displaying queen bee (vs. neutral) behavior was not seen as having less positive intent, which thus did not indirectly influence perceived sexism. Behavior of both male and female leaders did affect junior women: participants exposed to a leader displaying queen bee-type behavior reported more anger, sadness, and anxiety than participants exposed to a leader displaying neutral behavior. These data provide further evidence that simply adding more women or minorities in key senior positions is insufficient to change inequality if bias in the organization is not tackled. Specifically, exposure to gender inequality can steer female leaders to endorse–rather than change–stereotypes about women, and this behavior is particularly consequential because it (a) might not be recognized as bias and (b) exerts negative effects.

Lai, Cynthia Leung, Sylvia Y. C. Kwok, Anna N. N. Hui, Herman H. M. Lo, Janet T. Y. Leung and Cherry H. L. Tam ( Frontiers in Psychology , 2018[Jun][29], Vol 9[1090]). In the original article, there was an error in the Funding statement. The correct Name for the Funder ""Bei Shan Tong Foundation"" is Bei Shan Tang Foundation. The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-33424-001). The multidimensional PERMA-H positive education model provided evaluation and education framework for the theoretical and practice development of positive psychology in schools. Character strengths use mediates the association of strength knowledge and well-being. Using the Assessment Program for Affective and Social Outcomes (2nd Version) (APASO-II), the Subjective Happiness Scale, and the Physical Health Subscale of the PERMA-profiler, a multidimensional measure of PERMA-H was validated using confirmatory factor analysis in the context of a positive education program evaluation in senior primary school students. The association of PERMA-H measurements with school well-being as measured by general satisfaction of school life, and levels of depression and anxiety, and the mediation mechanism of character strengths use in such association were studied using path analysis. A cross-sectional sample of 726 senior primary school students (i.e., grade 4–6) aged 8–13 from the two primary schools completed a baseline evaluation questionnaire of a positive education program. Satisfactory internal reliability of the scales was obtained with Cronbach's alpha coefficients &lt; 0.70. The scales were generally positively and moderately inter-correlated, except for level of anxiety and depression symptoms which was negative. Good psychometric properties of APASO-II were evidenced from the factor structure of sub-scale scores conforming to six factors of the PERMA-H model by confirmatory factor analysis. Path analyses showed that the APASO-II factors together with measures of subject happiness and positive health as the multidimensional PERMA-H model of positive education differentially predicted general satisfaction of school life, level of anxiety and depression, and character strengths use. Character strengths use mediated the relationship of Positive Engagement with general satisfaction of school life. Positive education utilizes knowledge and research findings from positive psychology in schools to produce intended positive outcomes like enhanced well-being and reduced level of depression in students. This study provided a solid foundation for related scientific research and the understanding of the multidimensional framework of positive psychology concepts. Systematic promotion and longitudinal evaluation of positive education at the institutional level in Hong Kong can be achieved with the use of APASO-II and the positive education scales of subjective happiness and physical health.

307,Moderating effects of physical activity and global self-worth on internalizing problems in school-aged children with developmental coordination disorder,"School-aged children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are at greater risk for physical inactivity, lower global self-worth, and internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Based on the environmental stress hypothesis (ESH), recent research has shown that physical inactivity and lower global self-worth sequentially mediate the relationship between DCD and internalizing problems, suggesting that DCD leads to lower levels of physical activity, which in turn leads to lower levels of global self-worth, and ultimately, a greater amount of internalizing problems. However, physical activity and global self-worth may also buffer (i.e., moderate) the adverse effect of DCD on internalizing problems. To date, this has yet to be tested. Participants were 1206 children aged 12–14 years [611 boys, 79 with probable DCD (pDCD)]. All children received assessments of motor coordination, physical activity, global self-worth, and internalizing problems. Children with pDCD were less physically active, had lower self-worth, and experienced more internalizing problems compared to typically developing (TD) children ( p ’s &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the moderated moderating effect (three-way interaction) of physical activity and global self-worth was also evident ( p &lt; 0.05), indicating that internalizing problems in both TD and pDCD groups decreased with concurrent increases in physical activity and global self-worth. Importantly, when compared to TD children, increases in physical activity and global self-worth were associated with a greater reduction in internalizing problems among children with pDCD. The findings support several pathways in the ESH and highlight that, in addition to improving motor skills, interventions should also target both physical activity and global self-worth to mitigate potential mental health issues for children with motor difficulties.

308,Factorial validity and invariance of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) among populations with and without self-reported psychiatric diagnostic status,"The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is commonly used to monitor anxiety symptoms. However, its factor structure has been inconsistent among competing models: unidimensional, two-dimensional, or higher order models. Additionally, it is unknown whether the scale has measurement invariance between populations with and without self-reported psychiatric diagnostic status. Participants were Japanese adults with self-reported anxiety disorder (AD; n = 479), self-reported AD and major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 314), or without self-reported psychiatric diagnostic status (self-reported non-MDD/AD; n = 654), who completed this questionnaire on the Internet. Confirmatory factor analyses showed the higher order model had similar fit indices to the unidimensional and two-dimensional factor models. For the higher order model of GAD-7, metric invariance was supported between the self-reported non-MDD/AD and self-reported AD status groups, and scalar invariance was supported between the self-reported AD status and self-reported AD with MDD status groups. Moreover, convergent and discriminant validity were consistent with previous findings in Western cultures. These results suggest that factor loadings are equivalent and the construct has the same meaning between the self-reported non-MDD/AD and self-reported AD status groups, and the total or sub-scale scores were comparable between self-reported AD status and self-reported AD with MDD status groups. The major limitation of this study is that the participants’ diagnoses were self-reported, not confirmed by clinical structured interview. Further studies that incorporate clinical structured interviews are needed.

309,Failure of the anticoagulant therapy and psychological distress: Still far from a bridge,"Background: The procoagulant stress response reflects part of a beneficial adaptation of the organism to environmental threats, but a protracted procoagulant state generates a thrombotic risk. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the general population. Patients with AF have a higher risk of thromboembolic events and stroke, therefore they are treated with long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate if there is any association between psychological distress and clinically unexplained variations of the International Normalized Ratio (INR), that is the index used to monitor both thromboembolic and bleeding risk in the case of patients under OAC therapy. Methods: Fifty-eight patients (men = 27; women = 31; mean age = 74.98) were recruited. The sample was divided according to the recognition (or not) of the reason why the INR was subtherapeutic (&lt; 2) and classified as “Known Reasons” (KR = 32.8%) and “Unknown Reasons” (UR = 67.2%). Psychological assessment included the following dimensions: symptoms of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, emotional regulation strategies, and alexithymia. Results: Considering Mann–Whitney test results, no significant difference was found in the scores of anxiety, depression, stress, and emotional regulation strategies. With regard to alexithymia, UR patients are characterized by a moderate tendency to an outward-oriented thinking ( r = 0.25). Conclusion: A clear role for the detected psychological factors in determining abnormal INR range in patients under OAC therapy could not be found. Further studies are needed to support our findings, if possible exploring factors other than psychological distress and the related emotion regulation strategies.

310,Hormonal correlates of exploratory and play-soliciting behavior in domestic dogs,"Exploration and play are considered to be crucial behaviors during mammalian development. Even though the relationship between glucocorticoids and exploratory behavior, stress, and anxiety is well described in the literature, very little is known about their role in play behavior in non-rodents. Likewise, the functional role of the “social hormone” oxytocin in exploration, play, stress, and anxiety is still unknown. The present work addresses this literature gap by studying plasma hormone profiles for cortisol (CORT) and oxytocin (OT) of domestic dogs exposed to a novel arena containing two unfamiliar trainers who did not interact with the dogs. We provide evidence suggesting a functional relationship between hormonal measures of cortisol and oxytocin and adaptive behavior (play-soliciting and exploration) in freely behaving domestic dogs. We have taken into account several possible factors in our analyses and interpretations, from the nature and quality of the measurements to demographic factors to statistical robustness. Our results indicate that reduced CORT levels are associated with increments of both play-soliciting behavior frequency and exploratory behavior duration. Furthermore, taken together, our data and our simulations suggest a relationship between OT and the enactment of play-soliciting behaviors by freely behaving domestic dogs that must be further investigated. Future studies should consider naturalistic structured and semi-structured experimental approaches linking behavior with (neuro) physiological measures, taking into account demographic factors such as age and relevant interphase factors such as the sex of the dog; and socio-historic factors such as the playfulness of the dog, history of interaction with young humans, among others, to take full account of interaction between humans and animals in comparative studies (Parada and Rossi, 2018).

311,The predictive value of dyadic coping in the explanation of PTSD symptoms and subjective well-being of work accident victims,"Objective: Work accidents may be considered dyadic stressors in so far as they not only affect the worker, but also the couple’s relationship. Dyadic coping, as the process by which couples manage the stress experienced by each partner, can strengthen individual health and well-being as well as couple relationship functioning. Accidents at work have progressively been studied from a perspective that focuses on their negative effects on PTSS, anxiety, and depression. However, to a large extent, the dyadic coping processes and results following a work accident are still to be identified and clarified. In this study, we examined the predictive value of dyadic coping in the explanation of PTSS and subjective well-being of work accident victims. Method: This study comprised a sample of 62 individuals involved in work accidents within the last 24 months (61.3% males) and their partners ( N = 124; M = 46.25 years, SD = 11.18). All participants responded to the Dyadic Coping Inventory and the work accident victims also answered the PTSD Checklist—Civilian (PCL-C) and the Mental Health Continuum—Short Form (MHC-SF). Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed using two different variable set models: Model 1 comprised the control variables gender and age, and Model 2 included the workers’ and the partners’ dyadic coping variables. Results: Results showed that dyadic coping reported by both workers and their respective partners (Model 2) was a significant predictor of workers’ PTSS ( p &lt; 0.01) and subjective well-being ( p &lt; 0.001), explaining 31.2% of the variance in PCL-C and 68.7% in MHC-SF results. More specifically, the partners’ supportive dyadic coping (by the self) and delegated dyadic coping (by the partner) were significant predictors of the workers’ lower PTSS and virtually all the dyadic copying strategies of both the workers’ and their partners’ were significant predictors of the workers’ higher subjective well-being. Conclusion: Dyadic coping of both the workers and their partners predicts the workers’ PTSS and subjective well-being. These findings point to the need to work with couples who have experienced a work accident, with a view to improving the workers’ mental health outcomes.

312,Direct experience while eating in a sample with eating disorders and obesity,"Background: Individuals with eating disorders might be characterized by lower levels of direct engagement with the eating experience. This study aims to explore similarities and differences in direct experience while eating in four different weight conditions and healthy controls (HCs): anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), and obesity (OB). Methods: A total sample of 143 women were recruited. Participants were asked to eat an orange slice and write down 10 things about the experience of eating, classifying the focus of these thoughts as either experiential (“direct experience”) or analytical (“thinking about”). A direct experience index (DEI) was calculated by dividing the number of times a participant classified an experience as a “direct experience” (the numerator) by the total number of observations. Participants completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and rated their level of anxiety after the task. Results: Between-groups significant differences were found on the DEI, with individuals in the OB group scoring higher than AN and BN, and similar to HC. After the task, the AN group reported significantly higher anxiety levels than HC, and EDNOS reported more anxiety than HC and OB. Between-group significant differences were also found for all the FFMQ facets. Conclusion: AN and BN presented lower access to direct experience while eating. Individuals with OB did not respond in the same way as the other clinical groups, showing a similar performance to HC.

313,Trait emotional intelligence profiles of parents with drug addiction and of their offspring,"This study examines the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) and general health (General Health; GHQ-28) in two samples of Greek parents with ( n = 52; Mage = 39.78; SDage = 6.68; 41 men and 11 women) and without ( n = 51; Mage = 43.53; SDage = 4.61; 40 men and 11 women) addiction problems. In addition, it compares the trait EI scores of their offspring ( N = 81; Mage = 11.71; SDage = 2.15; 51 boys and 30 girls). Results showed that parents with drug addiction exhibited lower levels of trait EI and poorer general health than peers. In addition, global trait EI and two of its subscales, Well-being and Emotionality, had stronger correlations with depression in the addiction than in the comparison group. Well-being was a significant predictor of general health and its subscales (Somatic symptoms, Anxiety/insomnia, Social dysfunction, and severe depression) in both groups. No differences were found between the offspring of the two groups.

314,Therapy dogs as a crisis intervention after traumatic events?—An experimental study,"Animal-assisted therapy has been proposed as a treatment adjunct for traumatized patients. In animal-assisted crisis response, dogs are used directly after a traumatic event to reduce stress and anxiety. However, to date there are few controlled studies investigating the effects of therapy dogs on PTSD symptoms and to our knowledge there is no study investigating the effects of a therapy dog intervention directly after a traumatic event. In this study, 60 healthy female participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: after exposure to a “traumatic” film clip (trauma-film paradigm), one group of participants interacted with a friendly dog for 15 min, another group of participants watched a film clip showing a person interacting with a friendly dog and the last group was instructed to relax. Participants who had interacted with the dog after the film reported lower anxiety levels, less negative affect, and more positive affect after the intervention as compared to the other two groups. However, the participants who interacted with the dog showed a smaller decrease in physiological arousal after the traumatic film clip compared to both other groups. There were no differences in intrusion symptoms between the three groups. Our results show that dogs are able to lessen subjectively experienced stress and anxiety after a “traumatic” stress situation.

315,Activation vs. experiential avoidance as a transdiagnostic condition of emotional distress: An empirical study,"Background: From a contextual transdiagnostic approach, this study focuses on the importance of the processes of Experiential Avoidance and Activation in explaining and treating psychological problems. There exists widespread empirical evidence to suggest that the response pattern known as Experiential Avoidance, a general unwillingness to remain in contact with particular private experiences through the use of maladaptive avoidance strategies, acts as a functional dimension in various psychological problems. Activation, that is, maintaining contact with experiences/conditions of life and consequently with associated sources of reward, is a condition present in most therapeutic processes. Although a great deal of research has analyzed the relationship of the value of reward with the etiology and maintenance of psychological problems, Activation, as a transdiagnostic factor, has been studied less. The aim of this paper is to carry out an empirical study of the relationship between Activation, EA and emotional state and analyze the capacity of these two conditions to discriminate the intensity and symptomatology type in subjects with emotional distress. Methods: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Environmental Reward Observation Scale (EROS) and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) were completed by 240 health center users. Results: Of the participants, 55% showed clinically relevant emotional distress. All cases of depression showed clinical anxiety. To discriminate between subjects without ( n = 109) and with emotional distress ( n = 131), analyses of the ROC curves and logistic regression analysis identified the BADS-Avoidance/Rumination followed by the EROS. To discriminate between subjects with anxiety but without depression ( n = 61) and with anxiety and depression ( n = 70), the most efficient scales were EROS followed by BADS-Social Impairment. Conclusion: It was shown that people with no emotional complaints maintained greater contact with life experiences and with environmental sources of reward than those with emotional distress. Response patterns showing Experiential Avoidance and a reduction in Activation responses were associated with clinical distress. A reduction in Activation was the condition which distinguished those people with the greatest distress and also the greatest comorbidity of symptoms of depression and anxiety. These data support the transdiagnostic nature of Activation and suggest greater attention should be paid to this concept.

316,Targeting procrastination using psychological treatments: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Procrastination can be stressful and frustrating, but it seldom causes any major distress. However, for some people, it can become problematic, resulting in anxiety, lowered mood, physical complaints, and decreased well-being. Still, few studies have investigated the benefits of targeting procrastination. In addition, no attempt has previously been made to determine the overall efficacy of providing psychological treatments. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching for eligible records in Scopus, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Only randomized controlled trials comparing psychological treatments for procrastination to an inactive comparator and assessing the outcomes by a self-report measure were included. A random effects model was used to determine the standardized mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment. Furthermore, test for heterogeneity was performed, fail-safe N was calculated, and the risk of bias was explored. The study was pre-registered at Prospero: CRD42017069981. Results: A total of 1,639 records were identified, with 12 studies (21 comparisons, N = 718) being included in the quantitative synthesis. Overall effect size g when comparing treatment to control was 0.34, 95% Confidence Interval [0.11, 0.56], but revealing significant heterogeneity, Q(20) = 46.99, p &lt; 0.00, and I ² = 61.14%, 95% CI [32.83, 84.24]. Conducting a subgroup analysis of three out of four studies using cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) found an effect size g of 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.77], and no longer showing any heterogeneity, Q(4) = 3.92, p = 0.42, I ² = 0.00%, 95% CI [0.00, 91.02] ( N = 236). Risk of publication bias, as assessed by the Egger's test was not significant, z = −1.05, p = 0.30, fail-safe N was 370 studies, and there was some risk of bias as rated by two independent researchers. In terms of secondary outcomes, the self-report measures were too varied to present an aggregated estimate. Conclusions: Psychological treatments seem to have small benefits on procrastination, but the studies displayed significant between-study variation. Meanwhile, CBT was associated with a moderate benefit, but consisted of only three studies. Recommendations for future research are provided, including the use of more valid and reliable outcomes and a screening interview at intake.

317,A review of the academic and psychological impact of the transition to secondary education,"The transition from primary to secondary education is one of the most stressful events in a young person’s life (Zeedyk et al., 2003) and can have a negative impact on psychological well-being and academic achievement. One explanation for these negative impacts is that the transition coincides with early adolescence, a period during which certain psychological disorders (i.e., anxiety disorders) become more salient (Kessler et al., 2005) and marked social, biological, and psychological development occurs (Anderson et al., 2000). This review evaluates the existing literature on the psychological and academic impacts of the transition to secondary education on young adolescents. We examine the factors that plausibly increase or mitigate the risk of developing mental health issues and/or a decline in academic performance during the transition to secondary education. We also review the interplay between psychological health and academic achievement across and beyond the transition. We conclude with a summary of what schools and parents can learn from these findings to support children in a successful transition into secondary education.

318,Feedback-related electroencephalogram oscillations of athletes with high and low sports anxiety,"We investigated the relationship between performance-related anxiety and the neural response to error feedback that was delivered during the execution of a time estimation task. Using the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS-2), we selected university athletes high and low in sports anxiety. Participants executed a time estimation task where they were instructed to estimate 1 s by pressing a button after a sound cue. They performed this task while their performance was being evaluated by an experimenter (evaluation condition) and also while alone (in a no-evaluation condition). We tested whether feedback-related brain activities may increase in amplitude in the evaluation condition compared to the control condition – especially for athletes who report high performance-related anxiety. We focused on oscillations of sub-delta, delta, and theta frequency bands phase-locked to the feedback onset. Time-frequency analyses revealed that the magnitude of both the sub-delta component (0.3–1.2 Hz) and the theta component (4–8 Hz) were larger in incorrect than correct trials. In addition, the theta component was smaller for athletes high in sports anxiety than for athletes low in sports anxiety. The delta component was overall larger for correct than incorrect feedback. Further, athletes high in sports anxiety exhibited a larger delta component (1.5–3.5 Hz) for correct feedback in the evaluation condition than in the no-evaluation condition. Our results suggest that evaluation by others may increase the delta oscillation associated with correct feedback processing – especially among athletes high in sports anxiety.

319,Anxiety and psycho-physiological stress response to competitive sport exercise,"Introduction: Sport is recognized as beneficial for health. In certain situation of practice, it nevertheless appears likely to induce a stress response. Anxiety is a stress response-modulating factor. Our objective is to characterize the role of anxiety in the stress response induced by a selective physical exercise. Method: Sixty-three young male military conducted a selective sporting running event (a 8-km commando-walk) and were recorded the day before, the day of the race, and the day after. The variables were psychometric [personality questionnaires, coping and anxious/stress state, and physiological (nocturnal heart rate variability and actigraphy)]. The subjects were classified, using scores on anxiety questionnaires at baseline, into two groups according to their anxious (G ANX) or non-anxious (G N-ANX). Results: Before the race, the G ANX was characterized by a lower level of self-esteem, higher scores in dysfunctional coping and a greater perceived stress compared to the G N-ANX. Compared to G N-ANX, the stress response to the exercise was higher in G ANX: G ANX exhibited (Selye, 1950) in immediate post-exercise, greater level in activation markers, and mental fatigue associated with a same level of physical fatigue and (Kim et al., 2018) in nocturnal post-exercise, an increase in sympathetic activation associated with a higher sleep fragmentation. Conclusion: A competition selection sport exercise causes a stress response, particularly for anxious subjects. Anxious status could be involved in the risk of emergence of overtraining in sport practice. These results must be taken into account when sport practice is used for anxiety management.

320,Subclinically anxious adolescents do not display attention biases when processing emotional faces—An eye-tracking study,"Recent research suggests that early difficulties with emotion regulation go along with an increased risk for developing psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders for example. Adolescent anxiety is often referred to as a gateway disorder, due to its high predictability for lifelong persistent mental health problems. It has been shown that clinically anxious adolescents exhibit attention biases toward negative stimuli, yet whether these biases can also be found in the subclinical range of subclinically anxious adolescents is currently unclear. In this study, we set out to investigate this question by combining an emotional Go-Nogo task with eye-tracking techniques to assess attention biases for emotional faces in a subclinical sample of 23 subclinically anxious adolescent girls. This combined approach allowed us to look at both, behavioral and covert attention biases. Using both traditional and Bayesian hypothesis testing, we found no evidence for a bias toward negative, threat-relevant stimuli in the behavioral level or eye-tracking data. We believe that the results can help close a gap in the current literature by showing that like low-anxious adolescents, subclinically anxious adolescents do not exhibit attention biases when viewing de-contextualized emotional stimuli in the Overlap task. Together with previous research findings in clinically anxious participants which have reported high levels of attention biases, our results seem to suggest that attention biases do no increase linearly as a function of individual anxiety level. Future research is now needed to explore the contribution of additional factors, such as depression for example.

321,Induced negative mood increases dictator game giving,"The study examines the influence of induced negative mood on dictator game giving (DGG) with two recipients. Participants ( N = 63) played the role of a dictator in a three-player dictator game. They could choose among two options: an altruistic option, where two receivers receive 10 Euros and the dictator himself receives nothing, or a selfish option, where the dictator himself receives 5 Euros and both receivers receive nothing. For half of the participants, the second option entailed that only one receiver receives nothing and the other receives 10 Euros. After four rounds, participants were randomly assigned to look at 10 pictures with either positive or negative emotional content with the purpose of inducing positive or negative mood. The results show that looking at pictures with negative emotional content increases anxiety and skin conductance and increases DGG in the remaining four rounds of the game. On the other hand, whether the selfish option would imply that one or both recipients receive nothing does not seem to have a strong influence on DGG.

322,Creative sparks or paralysis traps? The effects of contradictions on creative processing and creative products,"Paradoxes are an unavoidable part of work life. The unusualness of attempting to simultaneously satisfy contradictory imperatives can result in creative outcomes that simultaneously satisfy both imperatives by inducing search for, and selection of, novel and useful solutions. Likewise, extant research suggests that paradoxes can also result in anxiety, defensiveness, and persistence of old ways of doing things. However, there is little work attempting to describe how paradoxes affect cognition and when it results in higher or lower creativity. To tackle this issue, a theory of paradoxical creativity is developed. Paradoxical creativity is the attempt by an individual to creatively resolve a contradiction by simultaneously achieving competing demands. The theory is implemented into a computational model and a simulation is used to describe how paradoxes affect creative cognitive process and how these processes in turn result in higher or lower degrees of creativity. The results show that creative output is enhanced when paradoxes have a balanced effect on the cognitive processes responsible for an individual's capacity to search for new information and willingness to tolerate new ideas. Hence, individuals with high baseline levels of creative cognition are more likely to suffer negative creative performance consequences resulting from contradictory demands. For those individuals, contradictory demands may produce more alternatives, which increases uncertainty and time to insight (if insight is ever reached). This suggests that incentives or rewards to resolve contradictions may have the unintentional effect of reducing creative output in some circumstance.

323,Benefits of mindfulness for parenting in mothers of preschoolers in Chile,"The present study evaluated whether mothers’ participation in a mindfulness-based intervention led to statistically significant differences in their general levels of stress, depression, anxiety, parental stress, mindful parenting, and mindfulness. Forty-three mothers of preschool-age children participated, 21 in the intervention group and 22 in the comparison group. Scores of mental health variables were within normal ranges before the intervention. All of the participants worked at the Universidad Católica de Chile (Catholic University of Chile), and their children attended university preschool centers. Repeated measured ANOVA analysis were performed considering differences between gain scores of each group, rather than post-treatment group differences. This was chosen in order to approach initial differences in some of the measures (mindfulness, mindful parenting, and stress) probably due to self-selection. As predicted, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in general and parental stress and an increase in mindful parenting and general mindfulness variables when compared with the comparison group. Effect sizes ranged from small to medium, with the highest Cohen’s d in stress (general and parental) and mindful parenting. In most cases, the significant change was observed between pre- and post-test measures. Follow-up measures indicated that the effects were maintained after 2 months.

324,Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Neuroticism subscale of the NEO-PI,"Neuroticism is an important concept in psychology, self-report measures of neuroticism are important for both research and clinical practice. The neuroticism subscale of the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) is a brief measure of neuroticism, and it was widely used in the world. This study was aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the neuroticism subscale of the NEO-PI. A total of 5,494 undergraduates from three universities and 551 clinical patients with mental disorders from a psychological clinic had completed the Chinese version of the neuroticism subscale of the NEO-PI. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine how well the three hypothetical models fit the data and the measurement equivalence of neuroticism subscale across gender. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability were also evaluated. Both the six-facet model and the bi-factor model (six-facet model with one general factor) achieved satisfactory fit, while the six-facet model had best fit (Undergraduate sample: TLI = 0.919, CFI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.044, SRMR = 0.033; Clinical sample: TLI = 0.921, CFI = 0.935, RMSEA = 0.047, SRMR = 0.041), and it had measurement equivalence across gender. The neuroticism subscale also showed acceptable internal consistency and good stability. Within the undergraduate sample, there were statistically significant gender differences in neuroticism total scores and scores of six facets, while there were no significant gender differences in the neuroticism scores in the clinical sample. Both in the undergraduate sample and the clinical sample, anxiety facet, depression facet and vulnerability facet of the neuroticism subscale significantly predicted the depression level, while anxiety facet, angry-hostility facet and vulnerability facet significantly predicted the anxiety level. In conclusion, the Chinese version of the neuroticism subscale is a reliable and valid measurement of neuroticism in both undergraduate and clinical population.

325,Experimental studies on state self-objectification: A review and an integrative process model,"This paper provides an organizing framework for the experimental research on the effects of state self-objectification on women. We explain why this body of work, which had grown rapidly in the last 20 years, departs from the original formulation of objectification theory (Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997). We compare the different operationalizations of state self-objectification and examine how they map onto its theoretical definition, concluding that the operationalizations have focused mostly on one component of this construct (concerns about one's physical appearance) while neglecting others (adopting a third-person perspective and treating oneself as a dehumanized object). We review the main findings of studies that experimentally induced state self-objectification and examined its affective, motivational, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological outcomes. We note that three core outcomes of this state as specified by objectification theory (safety anxiety, reduced flow experiences, and awareness of internal body states) have hardly been examined so far. Most importantly, we introduce an integrative process model, suggesting that the reported effects are triggered by four different mechanisms: appearance monitoring, experience of discrepancy from appearance standards, stereotype threat, and activation of the “sex object” schema. We propose strategies for distinguishing between these mechanisms and explain the theoretical and practical importance of doing so.

326,Cognitive interpretation bias: The effect of a single session moderate exercise protocol on anxiety and depression,"Research conducted within the cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigm has revealed that cognitive biases such as negative cognitive interpretation biases contribute to mental health disorders such as anxiety (Beard, 2011). It has been shown that exercise reduces anxiety (Ensari et al., 2015). Exercise has also been found to reduce negative cognitive attention biases (Tian and Smith, 2011), however, no research to date has investigated the effect of exercise on cognitive interpretation bias. The key aims of the current project is to investigate whether moderate exercise reduces self-reported symptoms of depression and stress. Additionally, to establish which intensity of exercise is required to achieve anxiety reduction and reduce an individual’s negative cognitive interpretation biases. Study 1 recruited a healthy sample of adult participants who were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a walking exercise protocol or a control condition ( n = 2 × 12). Participants completed anxiety and cognitive interpretation bias measures before and after the walking exercise or control condition. Those in the walking exercise condition presented less symptoms of trait anxiety on a measure of state and trait anxiety inventory (STAI), compared to controls relative to baseline measures following the intervention. Study 2 recruited frequent exercisers who were assigned to an exercise or control group ( n = 2 × 24). Participants completed anxiety, depression, psychological stress, and cognitive interpretation bias measures before and after the exercise or control condition. Following the intervention, negative interpretation biases decreased in the exercise group and stayed stable in the control group. The exercise group also had significantly decreased anxiety, depression, and stress measures after the exercise condition, while controls did not. The research concludes that CBM holds promise for the management of mood disorders and exercise is an effective accompaniment to psychotherapy.

327,Psychometric properties and factor structures of Chinese Smartphone Addiction Inventory: Test of two models,"There has been a growing concern of excessive smartphone use that interferes with people’s daily functioning, most notably among youngsters. The Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) was constructed to assess this type of information technology addiction. Although the SPAI was developed in a Taiwanese adolescent sample, this measure has not been validated on Chinese youngsters in other regions. Moreover, the initial evidence yielded a four-factor structure, but recent findings obtained an alternative five-factor structure. As no studies have systematically compared these two factor structures, which of the models fits the data better remained unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the empirical validity of both the four- and five-factor structures of the SPAI in a sample of university students from Mainland China ( n = 463). Four psychometric properties of the SPAI were examined. First, the structural validity of both factor models was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. Satisfactory fit was found for both the five-factor model (RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.05, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99) and the four-factor model (RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.06, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.98), but the five-factor model demonstrated an overall better model fit. Second, the five-factor model yielded good internal consistencies (all Cronbach α’s &gt; 0.70). Third, concurrent validity of the SPAI was supported by its moderately strong correlations with four widely adopted criterion variables (i.e., loneliness, social anxiety, depression, and impulsivity). Lastly, the convergent validity of the SPAI was demonstrated by its strong, positive correlation with a popular, validated measure of Internet addiction. This study is the first to demonstrate the validity of the newly proposed five-factor model of the SPAI in a sample of Mainland Chinese youngsters.

328,"The higher the score, the darker the core: The nonlinear association between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism","Narcissism is a truly Janusian phenomenon, consisting of both narcissistic grandiosity, exhibitionism, admiration-seeking, boldness, and dominance on the one hand, and narcissistic vulnerability, introversion, withdrawal, hypersensitivity, and anxiety on the other hand. While there is broad consensus that these two seemingly contradictory faces of narcissism can be empirically discerned and have different implications for psychological functioning and mental health, there is not yet agreement on whether grandiose and vulnerable narcissism should be regarded as independent traits or as two manifestations of one personality trait. Previous research indicates that both views hold true when the level of grandiosity is considered a moderating factor: while grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are largely unrelated in the range of normal personality variation, they are correlated in the range of high grandiosity (Jauk et al., 2017b). Here, we replicate and extend this work in an independent sample ( N = 891) using a more comprehensive narcissism inventory grounded in a new trifurcated model of narcissism. The trifurcated model partitions narcissism into three main personality dimensions: agentic extraversion, antagonism, and neuroticism. We found a significant breakpoint in the association between narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability at 75% cumulative frequency of grandiosity. While grandiosity and vulnerability are unrelated below this breakpoint ( r = 0.02), they are strongly correlated above ( r = 0.45). In the lower range of grandiose narcissism, grandiosity draws more upon agentic extraversion and is largely associated with mental health. In the upper range, however, grandiosity is more strongly linked to antagonism and is substantially associated with fear, negative affect, and depression. These findings provide evidence for the view that grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are distinct traits at lower levels of grandiosity, but blend into an antagonistic core with signs of psychological maladjustment at higher levels. Implications for research on narcissism as a personality trait, as well as clinical practice, are discussed.

329,When words hurt: Affective word use in daily news coverage impacts mental health,"[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 11[630044] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record 2021-01100-001). The original article has been retracted. The authors recently discovered a clerical error in how the data were merged across time points. Specifically, data collected during the final longitudinal time point (wave 3) were incorrectly assigned to the wrong participants when merging data files. The authors have corrected this error and re-conducted the analyses and the pattern of findings reported in the paper are no longer supported by the analyses.] Media exposure influences mental health symptomology in response to salient aversive events, like terrorist attacks, but little has been done to explore the impact of news coverage that varies more subtly in affective content. Here, we utilized an existing data set in which participants self-reported physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and completed a potentiated startle task assessing their physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli at three time points (waves) over a 9-month period. Using a computational linguistics approach, we then calculated an average ratio of words with positive vs. negative affective connotations for only articles from news sources to which each participant self-reported being exposed over the prior 2 weeks at each wave of data collection. As hypothesized, individuals exposed to news coverage with more negative affective tone over the prior 2 weeks reported significantly greater physical and depressive symptoms, and had significantly greater physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli.

330,Is parent–child disagreement on child anxiety explained by differences in measurement properties? An examination of measurement invariance across informants and time,"There are numerous empirical studies demonstrating that agreement between parent-reports of youth and youth self-reports of internalizing behavior problems is modest at best. This has spurred much research on factors that influence the magnitude of associations between informants, including individual difference characteristics of the informants and contexts through which individuals interact with the child. There is also tremendous interest in understanding symptom trajectories longitudinally. However, each of these lines of work are predicated on the assumptions that the psychometric construct that is being assessed from each informant and at each measurement occasion is the same. This study examined measurement invariance between maternal and child reports and longitudinally across ages 9 and 12 on five dimensions of anxiety using the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher et al., 1999). No cross-informant models for anxiety dimensions achieved acceptable fit and at least partial metric and scalar invariance. Moreover, few longitudinal models demonstrated acceptable fit and at least partial metric and scalar invariance. Thus, using the SCARED as an example, these results show that inter-informant agreement may be compromised by different item functioning, and highlight the need for testing invariance before using measures for longitudinal tracking of symptoms.

331,"Women’s word use in pregnancy: Associations with maternal characteristics, prenatal stress, and neonatal birth outcome","Background: Experiencing high levels of stress during pregnancy can impair maternal well-being and fetal development. Consequently, unbiased assessment of maternal psychological state is crucial. Self-report measures are vulnerable to social desirability effects. Thus, implicit measures, such as word choice analysis, may offer an alternative. Methods: In this longitudinal online-study, 427 pregnant women described their emotional experiences in writing and additionally responded to self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms of prenatal stress and depression. The written texts were analyzed with a computerized text analysis program. After birth, 253 women provided information on birth outcome. Results: Word use differed significantly depending on maternal socioeconomic (e.g., marital status) and pregnancy-related characteristics (e.g., parity). Prenatal stress and depressive symptoms were associated with more frequent use of negative emotion words and words of anxiety, as well as with less first-person plural, but not singular pronoun use. Negative emotion and cognitive mechanism words predicted birth outcome, while self-report measures did not. Conclusion: In addition to self-report measures, word choice may serve as a useful screening tool for symptoms of depression and stress in pregnant women. The findings on pronoun use may reflect women’s changing experience of self-identity during the transition to motherhood.

332,Virtual reality for anxiety reduction demonstrated by quantitative EEG: A pilot study,"While previous research has established that virtual reality (VR) can be successfully used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, including phobias and PTSD, no research has examined changes in brain patterns associated with the use of VR for generalized anxiety management. In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of VR for anxiety management and stress reduction programs.

333,Psychosocial and sociocultural factors influencing antenatal anxiety and depression in non-precarious migrant women,"The aims of this paper are (1) to assess the role of sociodemographic and psychosocial risk factors on antenatal anxiety (AA) and antenatal depression (AD) in first-generation migrant women in Geneva, as compared to a control group of native Swiss women, and (2) to examine the role of acculturation and other sociocultural factors in the development of antenatal distress in migrant women. A sample of 43 migrant and 41 Swiss pregnant women were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. AA was assessed by using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and AD by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Acculturation was assessed as a bidimensional process comprising attachment to the heritage culture and adaptation to the local Swiss culture , using the Vancouver Index of Acculturation. AA in migrant women was mainly predicted by psychosocial factors, namely socioeconomic status, marital support, family presence in Geneva and parity, while AD was predicted by one dimension of acculturation, i.e., attachment to the heritage culture. Our study can inform perinatal health care professionals about some specific risk factors for antenatal distress in migrant women in order to increase systematic screening procedures.

334,Health education for musicians,"Context and aims: Many musicians suffer for their art, and health is often compromised during training. The Health Promotion in Schools of Music (HPSM) project has recommended that health education should be included in core curricula, although few such courses have been evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to design, implement and evaluate a compulsory health education course at a UK conservatoire of music. Methods: The course design was informed by a critical appraisal of the literature on musicians' health problems and their management, existing health education courses for musicians, and the HPSM recommendations. It was delivered by a team of appropriately-qualified tutors over 5 months to 104 first-year undergraduate students, and evaluated by means of questionnaires at the beginning and end of the course. Thirty-three students who had been in their first year the year before the course was introduced served as a control group, completing the questionnaire on one occasion only. Items concerned: hearing and use of hearing protection; primary outcomes including perceived knowledge and importance of the topics taught on the course; and secondary outcomes including physical and psychological health and health-promoting behaviors. The content of the essays written by the first-year students as part of their course assessment served as a guide to the topics they found most interesting and relevant. Results: Comparatively few respondents reported using hearing protection when practicing alone, although there was some evidence of hearing loss, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Perceived knowledge of the topics on the course, and awareness of the risks to health associated with performing music, increased, as did self-efficacy; otherwise, there were negative effects on secondary outcomes, and few differences between the intervention and control groups. The topics most frequently covered in students' essays were managing music performance anxiety, and life skills and behavior change techniques. Conclusion: There is considerable scope for improving music students' physical and psychological health and health-related behaviors through health education, and persuading senior managers, educators and students themselves that health education can contribute to performance enhancement.

335,Commentary: Forgetting the best when predicting the worst: Preliminary observations on neural circuit function in adolescent social anxiety,"Comments on an article by Jarcho, J. M., Romer et al. (see record 2015-26851-004). A recent study by Jarcho and colleagues analyzed the relationship between PE and social learning, comparing socially anxious adolescents and non-anxious adolescents, as well as adults. Using a social learning task participants are led to believe they would chat online with a peer predicted, then received, social feedback from high and low-value peers. Later, participants recall the social feedback they received from each peer. Neural correlates of social evaluation were assessed by fMRI scanning, comparing engagement to expected and unexpected positive and negative feedback (PE). Results showed that for socially anxious adolescents, but not adults or controls of either age group, there was an impairment in memory for social feedback. Currently there is a strong evidence supporting the role of cognitive process, attentional shifting and safety seeking behaviors, in SA maintenance. Here we highlighted the findings of Jarcho et. al and proposed an underlying mechanism (memory reconsolidation) for SA persistence. Altered memory reconsolidation could prevent the incorporation of incongruent information (memory updating), and perpetuate the dysfunctional memory (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Comment/Reply",2018

Less is known about the affective aspects of reading in young readers, such as self-perceptions of reading, and reading anxiety. Aims: This study aimed to shed light on the direct and indirect relations between reading and related skills (working memory, emergent literacy skills, word reading accuracy and rate, and gender) as sources of reading affect (reading self-concept and anxiety). Sample: A total of 115 Hebrew speaking second graders participated in this study. Methods: A set of measures assessing reading accuracy and rate, emergent literacy skills (phonological fluency, rapid automatized naming and working memory) and reading affect questionnaires (reading self-concept and reading anxiety) were administered to the participants. Results: Path analysis was used as the primary analytic approach. Results indicated a negative moderate relation between reading self-concept and reading anxiety. The relations of working memory and emergent literacy to reading self-concept and reading anxiety were indirect via word reading accuracy and reading rate. Girls reported higher reading anxiety and lower reading self-concept, despite higher performance in reading accuracy and no difference in reading rate. Conclusion: The current results support the importance of examining reading affect and potential sources of reading affect. Results suggest that reading self-concept and reading anxiety and their related skills should be considered in designing reading intervention and instructions.

337,The modified Stroop task is susceptible to feigning: Stroop performance and symptom over-endorsement in feigned test anxiety,"Some researchers argue that the modified Stroop task (MST) can be employed to rule out feigning. According to these authors, modified Stroop interference effects are beyond conscious control and therefore indicative of genuine psychopathology. We examined this assumption using a within-subject design. In the first session, students ( N = 22) responded honestly, while in the second session they were asked to read a vignette about test anxiety and then fake this condition. During both sessions, we administered an MST consisting of neutral, anxiety-related, and test anxiety-related words. Participants also completed the Self-Report Symptom Inventory (SRSI; Merten et al., 2016) that focuses on over-reporting of pseudosymptoms. Our feigning instructions were successful in that students succeeded in generating the typical MST effect by providing longer response latencies on anxiety related ( r = 0.43) and test anxiety-related ( r = 0.31) words, compared with neutral words. Furthermore, students endorsed significantly more pseudosymptoms on the SRSI ( r = 0.62) in the feigning session than in the honest control condition. We conclude that the MST effect is not immune to feigning tendencies, while the SRSI provides promising results that require future research.

338,A Bayesian approach to sport injuries likelihood: Does player’s self-efficacy and environmental factors plays the main role?,"The psychological factors of sports injuries constitute a growing field of study, even from the point of view of the prediction of their occurrence. Most of them, however, do not take into account the likelihood of the injuries’ occurrence and the weight and role of the psychological variables on it. We conducted a study building up a Bayesian Network on a big sample of athletes, trying to assess these probabilistic links among several relevant psychological variables and the injuries’ occurrence. The sample was constituted by 297 athletes (239 males, 58 females) from a wide range of sports: track and field; judo; fencing; karate; boxing; swimming; kayaking; artistic rollerskating, and team sports as football, basketball, and handball (Mean age: 25.10 ± -3.87; range: 21–38 years). Several psychological variables, such as anxiety, social support, and self-efficacy were studied. Also, we recorded the history of injuries as well the body mass index and personal epidemiological data. The overall picture of the generated graph and Bayesian Network and its analysis—including the use of hypothetical data by means of several instantiations—includes the nuclear role of the Self-Efficacy regarding the injuries’ occurrence likelihood; the decreasing impact of the competitive anxiety previous to the injury; the probabilistic independence of the players’ risk behaviors, and the relevance of the environmental clues such the use of coping strategies and social support in order to build up a good level of Self-Efficacy after the occurrence of an injury. All these data are relevant when designing both preventive and recovery interventions from the multidisciplinary as well as from the psychological point of view.

Consequently, assessing the presence and severity of clinical anxiety in older adults an important challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. The Geriatric Anxiety Scale is a 30-item geriatric-specific measure of anxiety severity, grouped in three subscales (Somatic, Affective, and Cognitive), with solid evidence for the reliability and validity of its scores in clinical and community samples. Translated into several languages, it has been proven to have strong psychometric properties. In Italy only one recent preliminarily investigative study has appeared on its psychometric properties. However, sample data was largely collected from one specific Italian region (Lombardy) alone. Here, our aim in testing the items of the GAS in a sample of 346 healthy subjects (50% females; 52% from Southern Italy), with mean age of 71.74 years, was 2-fold. First, we aimed to determine factor structure in a wider sample of Italian participants. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the GAS fits an originally postulated three-factor structure reasonably well. Second, results support gender invariance, entirely supported at the factorial structure, and at the intercept level. Latent means can be meaningfully compared across gender groups. Whereas the means of F1 (Somatic) and F3 (Affective) for males were significantly different from those for females, the means for F2 (Cognitive) were not. More specifically, in light of the negative signs associated with these statistically significant values, the finding showed that F1 and F3 for males appeared to be less positive on average than females. Overall, the GAS displayed acceptable convergent validity with matching subscales highly correlated, and satisfactory internal discriminant validity with lower correlations between non-matching subscales.

The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.] The multidimensional PERMA-H positive education model provided evaluation and education framework for the theoretical and practice development of positive psychology in schools. Character strengths use mediates the association of strength knowledge and well-being. Using the Assessment Program for Affective and Social Outcomes (2nd Version) (APASO-II), the Subjective Happiness Scale, and the Physical Health Subscale of the PERMA-profiler, a multidimensional measure of PERMA-H was validated using confirmatory factor analysis in the context of a positive education program evaluation in senior primary school students. The association of PERMA-H measurements with school well-being as measured by general satisfaction of school life, and levels of depression and anxiety, and the mediation mechanism of character strengths use in such association were studied using path analysis. A cross-sectional sample of 726 senior primary school students (i.e., grade 4–6) aged 8–13 from the two primary schools completed a baseline evaluation questionnaire of a positive education program. Satisfactory internal reliability of the scales was obtained with Cronbach's alpha coefficients &lt; 0.70. The scales were generally positively and moderately inter-correlated, except for level of anxiety and depression symptoms which was negative. Good psychometric properties of APASO-II were evidenced from the factor structure of sub-scale scores conforming to six factors of the PERMA-H model by confirmatory factor analysis. Path analyses showed that the APASO-II factors together with measures of subject happiness and positive health as the multidimensional PERMA-H model of positive education differentially predicted general satisfaction of school life, level of anxiety and depression, and character strengths use. Character strengths use mediated the relationship of Positive Engagement with general satisfaction of school life. Positive education utilizes knowledge and research findings from positive psychology in schools to produce intended positive outcomes like enhanced well-being and reduced level of depression in students. This study provided a solid foundation for related scientific research and the understanding of the multidimensional framework of positive psychology concepts. Systematic promotion and longitudinal evaluation of positive education at the institutional level in Hong Kong can be achieved with the use of APASO-II and the positive education scales of subjective happiness and physical health.

Muggleton ( Frontiers in Psychology , 2018[May][3], Vol 9[627]). In the original article, the reference for Gaetano, 2018 was incorrectly written. The correct reference is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-22906-001). There are several ways in which cognitive and neurophysiological parameters have been consistently used to explain the variability in cognitive ability between people. However, little has been done to explore how such cognitive abilities are influenced by differences in personality traits. Dispositional mindfulness and anxiety are two inversely linked traits that have been independently attributed to a range of cognitive functions. The current study investigated these two traits in combination along with measures of the attentional network, cognitive inhibition, and visual working memory (VWM) capacity. A total of 392 prospective participants were screened to select two experimental groups each of 30 healthy young adults, with one having high mindfulness and low anxiety (HMLA) and the second having low mindfulness and high anxiety (LMHA). The groups performed an attentional network task, a color Stroop task, and a change detection test of VWM capacity. Results showed that the HMLA group was more accurate than the LMHA group on the Stroop and change detection tasks. Additionally, the HMLA group was more sensitive in detecting changes and had a higher WMC than the LMHA group. This research adds to the literature that has investigated mindfulness and anxiety independently with a comprehensive investigation of the effects of these two traits in conjunction on executive function.

343,Commentary: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing for treating Panic Disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Comments on an article by Ferdinand Horst et al. (see record 2017-36912-001). Horst et al. (2017) exploring whether or not Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) can be considered to be as effective a treatment method as Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) for patients with Panic Disorder (PD). Using the Agoraphobic Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ), the Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life short version (WHOQOL-Bref) as measures, the authors did not find EMDR inferior to CBT in the following actions: reducing anxiety related cognitions, alleviating the fear of bodily sensations, and improving most aspects of the quality of life. The authors considered their results inconclusive with regard to agoraphobic avoidance as measured through the use of the Mobility Inventory (MI). Based on these results, the authors confirmed “EMDR therapy proved to be as effective as CBT for treating PD patients.” Although the study is interesting, we think that the above-quoted conclusion is inappropriate and overstated because of two main methodological reasons.

344,Behavioral inhibition underlies the link between interoceptive sensitivity and anxiety-related temperamental traits,"Interoceptive sensitivity (IS) is a biologically determined, constitutional trait of an individual. High IS has been often associated with proneness to anxiety. This association has been explained by elevated autonomic responsiveness in anxious individuals. However, in a heartbeat discrimination task (discrimination of heartbeats’ simultaneity to an external stimulus) low cardiac responsiveness has accompanied enhanced performance. The relation between these factors seems task dependent, and cannot comprehensively explain the link between IS and anxiety. We explored for additional explanatory factors for this link. More specifically, we studied which anxiety-related temperamental traits most strongly predict IS in the discrimination task. Compatibly with earlier findings, IS was positively associated with individual trait anxiety and also other related traits such as negative affect, emotional intensity, and introversion. Interestingly, behavioral inhibition was the temperamental trait that most strongly predicted high IS, and, in fact, accounted for its significant associations with the other anxiety-related temperamental traits. Good performance on heartbeat discrimination task may reflect adaptive attentional control abilities in behaviorally inhibited individuals. These results can improve our understanding of how IS and other traits together determine the personality and wellbeing of a human individual.

345,Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) applied to caregivers of patients with dementia,"Caregivers of patients with dementia experience high levels of stress and burden, with effects comparable to those of a traumatic event. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) appear to be effective in recovering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We aimed at investigating the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) on the “caregiver syndrome”. Forty-four primary caregivers entered the study. They were randomly assigned to either the “immediate” branch, who received the treatment soon after recruitment, or to the “delayed” branch, who received it two months after recruitment. The treatment consisted of eight group sessions (one per week) spanning over two months. Emotional distress was measured before the treatment, immediately after the end of it, and two months later (follow-up), by means of several clinical scales (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R; Caregiver Needs Assessment, CNA; Caregiver Burden Inventory, CBI; Anxiety and Depression Scale-Reduced Form, AD-R). The “immediate” branch improved significantly more than the “delayed” (control) branch on The Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Anxiety, and the Depression scales; however, after treatment such an improvement was maintained only in the first scale. The “delayed” branch took less advantage of the treatment, showing significant reduction only on the Depression scale, an effect which disappeared at follow-up. These preliminary results show for the first time that EMDR-IGTP reduces stress-related symptoms, anxiety, and depression in caregivers of patients with dementia. Interestingly, caregivers who were inserted in a waiting list after recruitment showed smaller treatment effects. Larger samples are needed to better interpret such differential clinical profiles.

347,Cognitive emotion regulation strategies in anxiety and depression understood as types of personality,"The identification of distinctive and overlapping features of anxiety and depression remains an important scientific problem. Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types. This information can be used for supporting diagnosis and targeting selected strategies in therapy both in clinical and non-clinical populations.

348,Sex hormones are associated with rumination and interact with emotion regulation strategy choice to predict negative affect in women following a sad mood induction,"Women are particularly vulnerable to anxiety and depressive disorders. This greater vulnerability has been partly attributed to post-pubertal sex hormone fluctuations, estradiol and progesterone, as well as gender-specific tendencies to engage in maladaptive forms of emotion regulation, particularly rumination. To date, no research has investigated whether sex hormones are associated with emotion regulation in women. In the present study, 61 women participated in a sad mood induction task, involving the viewing of an emotive film. Negative affect was assessed immediately and following recovery, along with self-reported use of rumination, reappraisal, and suppression. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone were assessed through a blood sample taken at the end of the experiment. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between serum hormones and self-reported emotional regulation strategy use, and between serum hormones and the impact of these strategies on negative affect. Estradiol levels positively predicted rumination, but not suppression or reappraisal use. Moreover, estradiol and progesterone interacted with emotion regulation strategies to predict negative affect following the sad mood induction. Reappraisal was associated with greater negative affect only in women with high estradiol, and in women with high progesterone. Conversely, rumination was associated with greater negative affect only in women with low estradiol. Together, these results suggest that sex hormone concentration may be an endogenous contextual factor that is associated with the selection and consequences of emotion regulation strategies in women.

349,Age-related developmental and individual differences in the influence of social and non-social distractors on cognitive performance,"This study sought to examine age-related differences in the influences of social (neutral, emotional faces) and non-social/non-emotional (shapes) distractor stimuli in children, adolescents, and adults. To assess the degree to which distractor, or task-irrelevant, stimuli of varying social and emotional salience interfere with cognitive performance, children ( N = 12; 8–12 y), adolescents ( N = 17; 13–17 y), and adults ( N = 17; 18–52 y) completed the Emotional Identification and Dynamic Faces (EIDF) task. This task included three types of dynamically-changing distractors: (1) neutral-social (neutral face changing into another face); (2) emotional-social (face changing from 0% emotional to 100% emotional); and (3) non-social/non-emotional (shapes changing from small to large) to index the influence of task-irrelevant social and emotional information on cognition. Results yielded no age-related differences in accuracy but showed an age-related linear reduction in correct reaction times across distractor conditions. An age-related effect in interference was observed, such that children and adults showed slower response times on correct trials with socially-salient distractors; whereas adolescents exhibited faster responses on trials with distractors that included faces rather than shapes. A secondary study goal was to explore individual differences in cognitive interference. Results suggested that regardless of age, low trait anxiety and high effortful control were associated with interference to angry faces. Implications for developmental differences in affective processing, notably the importance of considering the contexts in which purportedly irrelevant social and emotional information might impair, vs. improve cognitive control, are discussed.

350,Maternal burnout syndrome: Contextual and psychological associated factors,"Background: Becoming a parent is one of the most significant experiences in a woman’s life. Including substantial and long-lasting mental, social, and physical charge, the parenting experience may also be a potentially stressful and overwhelming task. Since the eighties, the notion of parental burnout syndrome has gained increasing attention, but its contextual and psychological factors need to be better identified. Aims: To investigate a large array of contextual and psychological factors associated with maternal burnout syndrome in a French community-based population in order to contribute to better operationalize the notion of parental burnout and to explore its determinants. Method: A total of 304 French-speaking mothers (mean age = 34.8 years, SD = 6.72) completed a set of questionnaires including a sociodemographic form (in order to gather general information about the mothers, their spouses, and children living at home). The Perceived Stress Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory adapted to parents (MBI-parental), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Parental Stress Index-Short Form and the Ways of Coping Checklist were used in this study. Results: Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that scores on the MBI-parental version were strongly and positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as with perceived stress related to parenthood and parenting stress levels. Moreover, using the task-oriented coping style in parenthood was strongly and positively associated with personal accomplishment. Conversely, some sociodemographic characteristics were found to be negatively associated with maternal burnout: being employed, working full time and being a mother living without a coparent. Conclusion: The construct of maternal burnout syndrome seems to be linked to a conjunction of psychological and contextual factors associated with maternal exhaustion. The implication of the results for prevention and intervention strategies are discussed.

351,Balance performance in autism: A brief overview,"Children with autism not only have limited social and communicative skills but also have motor abnormalities, such as poor timing and coordination of balance. Moreover, impaired gross motor skills hamper participation with peers. Balance control is interesting from a cognitive science perspective, since it involves a complex interplay between information processing, motor planning, and timing and sequencing of muscle movements. In this paper, we discuss the background of motor problems in children with autism, focusing on how posture is informed by sensory information processing. We also discuss the neurobiological basis of balance problems, and how this is related to anxiety in this group. We then discuss possible avenues for treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, especially as regards movement-related interventions. Finally, we present a theoretical outlook and discuss whether some of the symptoms in ASD can be understood from an embodied cognition perspective.

352,Dealing with the aftermath of mass disasters: A field study on the application of EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol with child survivors of the 2016 Italy earthquakes,"This study explored the effects of the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) on child survivors of the earthquakes that struck Umbria, a region of central Italy, on August 24th and on October 26th 2016. Three hundred and thirty-two children from the town of Norcia and nearby severely disrupted villages received 3 cycles of EMDR-IGTP. The Emotion Thermometers (ET-5) and the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) were administered before (T0) and about 1 week after the conclusion of the third cycle (T3) of EMDR-IGTP. At T3, older children showed a reduction of distress and anger, whereas younger children reported an increase on these domains; moreover, older children reported a greater reduction of anxiety than younger ones. A greater reduction of distress, anxiety, and need for help was evidenced in females, whereas a greater improvement in depressive symptoms was evidenced in males. The effects of the EMDR-IGTP treatment on post-traumatic symptoms were particularly evident in older children, compared to younger ones, and marginally greater in females than in males; moreover, a greater improvement was found in children who had received a timelier intervention, than in those who received delayed treatment. These results provide further evidence for the utility of EMDR-IGTP in dealing with the extensive need for mental health services in mass disaster contexts. Also, these data highlight the importance of providing EMDR-IGTP in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, to contribute significantly in restoring adaptive psychological functioning in children, especially in older ones.

353,A pilot study of the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on positive affect and social anxiety symptoms,"Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing residual depressive symptoms and preventing future depressive episodes (Kuyken et al., 2016). One potential treatment effect of MBCT may be improvement of positive affect (PA), due to improved awareness of daily positive events (Geschwind et al., 2011). Considering social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by diminished PA (Brown et al., 1998; Kashdan, 2007), we sought to determine whether MBCT would reduce social anxiety symptoms, and whether this reduction would be associated with improvement of PA deficits. Adults ( N = 22) who met criteria for varied anxiety disorders participated in a small, open-label trial of an 8-week manualized MBCT intervention. Most participants presented with either a diagnosis (primary, secondary, or tertiary) of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) ( N = 15) and/or SAD ( N = 14) prior to treatment, with eight individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for both GAD and SAD. We hypothesized participants would demonstrate improvements in social anxiety symptoms, which would be predicted by improvements in PA, not reductions in negative affect (NA). Results of several hierarchical linear regression analyses (completed in both full and disorder-specific samples) indicated that improvements in PA but not reductions in NA predicted social anxiety improvement. This effect was not observed for symptoms of worry, which were instead predicted by decreased NA for individuals diagnosed with GAD and both decreased NA and increased PA in the entire sample. Results suggest that MBCT may be efficacious in mitigating social anxiety symptoms, and this therapeutic effect may be linked to improvements in PA. However, further work is necessary considering the small, heterogeneous sample, uncontrolled study design, and exploratory nature of the study.

354,The effect of enumeration of self-relevant words on self-focused attention and repetitive negative thoughts,"Self-focused attention refers to awareness of self-referent, internally generated information. It can be categorized into dysfunctional (i.e., self-rumination) and functional (self-reflection) aspects. According to theory on cognitive resource limitations (e.g., Moreno, 2006), there is a difference in cognitive resource allocation between these two aspects of self-focused attention. We propose a new task, self-relevant word (SRW) enumeration, that can aid in behaviorally identifying individuals’ use of self-rumination and self-reflection. The present study has two purposes: to determine the association between self-focus and SRW enumeration, and to examine the effect of dysfunctional SRW enumeration on repetitive negative thinking. One hundred forty-six undergraduate students participated in this study. They completed a measure of state anxiety twice, before and after imagining a social failure situation. They also completed the SRW enumeration task, Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire, Short Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, and Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. A correlational analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between self-reflection and the number of SRWs. Furthermore, individuals high in self-reflection had a tendency to pay more attention to problems than did those high in self-rumination. A significant positive correlation was found between self-rumination and the strength of self-relevance of negative SRWs. Through a path analysis, we found a significant positive effect of the self-relevance of negative SRWs on repetitive negative thinking. Notably, however, the model that excluded self-rumination as an explanatory variable showed a better fit to the data than did the model that included it. In summary, SRW enumeration might enable selective and independent detection of the degree of self-reflection and self-rumination, and therefore should be examined in future research in order to design new behavioral procedures.

355,Motivated shield from chronic noise environment: Moderation of the relationship between noise sensitivity and work wellbeing by need for closure,"Several studies have underlined how chronic exposure to environmental noise may have negative effects on performance, wellbeing, and social relations. The present study ( N = 90 employees of a motor factory who are chronically exposed to environmental noise) investigated whether the negative effects of chronic exposure of noise-sensitive individuals to noise in the workplace may be moderated by the need for cognitive closure (i.e., an epistemic tendency to reduce uncertainty; NFCC, Kruglanski, 2004). As NFCC has been shown to enhance protection of the focal goal by reducing interference (Kossowska, 2007; Pica et al., 2013), we hypothesized that people with high NFCC should be able to manage the interference coming from environmental noise and concentrate on their tasks more than their low-NFCC counterparts. The results confirm that the negative effects of noise sensitivity on job satisfaction, state anxiety, and turnover intent were higher among low (vs. high)-NFCC individuals.

356,"Internet gaming disorder in adolescents: Personality, psychopathology and evaluation of a psychological intervention combined with parent psychoeducation","Internet Gaming Disorder is an increasingly prevalent disorder, which can have severe consequences in affected young people and in their families. There is an urgent need to improve existing treatment programs; these are currently hampered by the lack of research in this area. It is necessary to more carefully define the symptomatic, psychosocial and personality characterization of these patients and the interaction between treatment and relevant variables. The objectives of this study were three: (1) to analyze the symptomatic and personality profiles of young patients with Internet Gaming Disorder in comparison with healthy controls; (2) to analyze the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral treatment on reducing symptomatology; and (3) to compare the results of that treatment with or without the addition of a psychoeducational group offered to the parents. The final sample consisted of 30 patients consecutively admitted to a specialized mental health unit in Spain, and 30 healthy controls. The experimental group received individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental group was divided into two subgroups ( N = 15), depending on the addition or not of a psychoeducational group for their parents (consecutively admitted). Scores on the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (MACI), the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), and other clinical and psychopathological measures were recorded. The patients were re-assessed post treatment (except for the MACI questionnaire). Compared with healthy controls, patients did not differ in symptomatology at baseline, but scored significantly higher in the personality scales: Introversive and Inhibited, and in the expressed concerns scales: Identity Confusion, Self-Devaluation, and Peer Insecurity and scored significantly lower in the Histrionic and Egotistic scale. In the experimental group, pre-post changes differed statistically on SCL-90-R scales Hostility, Psychoticism, and Global Severity Index and on the diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder, regardless of the addition of a psychoeducational group for parents. Pre-post changes did not differ between experimental subgroups. However, the subgroup without psychoeducation for parents presented statistically higher drop-out rates during treatment. The results of this study are based on a sample of patients seeking treatment related to problems with online gaming, therefore, they may be of value for similar patients.

357,A randomized controlled trial comparing the attention training technique and mindful self-compassion for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety,"The Attention Training Technique (ATT) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) are two promising psychological interventions. ATT is a 12-min auditory exercise designed to strengthen attentional control and promote external focus of attention, while MSC uses guided meditation and exercises designed to promote self-compassion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), a three-session intervention trial was conducted in which university students were randomly assigned to either an ATT-group ( n = 40) or a MSC-group ( n = 41). The students were not assessed with diagnostic interviews but had self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress. Participants listened to audiotapes of ATT or MSC before discussing in groups how to apply these principles for their everyday struggles. Participants also listened to audiotapes of ATT and MSC as homework between sessions. Participants in both groups showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression accompanied by significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and attention flexibility post-intervention. These results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvement in attention flexibility was the only significant unique predictor of treatment response. The study supports the use of both ATT and MSC for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, it suggests that symptom improvement is related to changes in attention flexibility across both theoretical frameworks. Future studies should focus on how to strengthen the ability for attention flexibility to optimize treatment for emotional disorder.

358,Obsessive–compulsive tendencies are related to a maximization strategy in making decisions,"The present studies were motivated by the hypothesis that attenuated access to internal states in obsessive-compulsive (OC) individuals, which leads to extensive reliance on external proxies, may manifest in a maximizing decision making style, i.e., to seeking the best option through an exhaustive search of all existing alternatives. Following previous research, we aimed to explore the possible relationships between OC tendencies, seeking proxies for internal states, indecisiveness and maximization. In Study 1, we measured levels of OC tendencies, seeking proxies for internal states, indecisiveness, maximization, depression and anxiety in an online Hebrew speaking sample ( N = 201). In Study 2, we administrated the same questionnaires to an online English speaking sample ( N = 240) and in addition, examined participants’ decision making strategies in a hypothetical situation. The participants in both studies were unscreened adults. Correlational and linear regressions analyses indicated that OC tendencies are related to maximization, even when levels of indecisiveness, depression and anxiety are controlled for. Moreover, the findings suggested that reliance on external proxies may partially account for the aforementioned association. Possible implications and future directions are discussed.

359,Visual attention to suffering after compassion training is associated with decreased amygdala responses,"Compassion meditation training is hypothesized to increase the motivational salience of cues of suffering, while also enhancing equanimous attention and decreasing emotional reactivity to suffering. However, it is currently unknown how compassion meditation impacts visual attention to suffering, and how this impacts neural activation in regions associated with motivational salience as well as aversive responses, such as the amygdala. Healthy adults were randomized to 2 weeks of compassion or reappraisal training. We measured BOLD fMRI responses before and after training while participants actively engaged in their assigned training to images depicting human suffering or non-suffering. Eye-tracking data were recorded concurrently, and we computed looking time for socially and emotionally evocative areas of the images, and calculated visual preference for suffering vs. non-suffering. Increases in visual preference for suffering due to compassion training were associated with decreases in the amygdala, a brain region involved in negative valence, arousal, and physiological responses typical of fear and anxiety states. This pattern was specifically in the compassion group, and was not found in the reappraisal group. In addition, compassion training-related increases in visual preference for suffering were also associated with decreases in regions sensitive to valence and empathic distress, spanning the anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex (while the reappraisal group showed the opposite effect). Examining visual attention alone demonstrated that engaging in compassion in general (across both time points) resulted in visual attention preference for suffering compared to engaging in reappraisal. Collectively, these findings suggest that compassion meditation may cultivate visual preference for suffering while attenuating neural responses in regions typically associated with aversive processing of negative stimuli, which may cultivate a more equanimous and nonreactive form of attention to stimuli of suffering.

360,A non-randomized controlled trial of EMDR on affective symptoms in patients with glioblastoma multiforme,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer and its survival after diagnosis is less than 2 years. Therefore, GBM patients are especially prone to co-occurring psychological conditions such as anxiety and depressive disorders. Furthermore, aggressive medical therapies affect patients’ lives, undermining their sense of meaning and coherence. The main aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy on anxiety, depression and sense of coherence in patients with GBM. Thirty-seven GBM-diagnosed women were included in this trial and received standard medical care. Of those, 18 patients were treated during 4 months with 10–12 individual EMDR sessions (60–90 minutes each). Nineteen GBM patients were used as a non-randomized control group as they consented to psychological evaluations but not to a psychotherapeutic intervention. The groups were homogeneous in terms of gender, age, educational level and treatment, but not in anxiety and depressive levels at baseline. All patients were evaluated at baseline, after treatment (4 months) and at follow-up (further 4 months) by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-M) and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29). Caregivers in both groups were interviewed by the Patient Caregiver Questionnaire after 4 months follow-up. Statistical analyses were conducted using ANOVA statistics, correlation and regression analysis. Results showed a statistically significant decrease in the EMDR group in anxiety, depression and anger, when compared to the experimental group. EMDR therapy also had a positive impact upon the sense of coherence level in the experimental group, whereas in the control group this declined. Finally, the caregivers reported beneficial outcomes of the EMDR therapy with less anxiety- and anger-related behaviors in patients in the experimental group compared to the control group. This study is the first to show beneficial effects of EMDR therapy in alleviating affective symptoms and improving coherence in a severe medically ill population with GBM.

361,The four faces of competition: The development of the Multidimensional Competitive Orientation Inventory,"To date, no short scale exists with established factor structure that can assess individual differences in competition. The aim of the present study was to uncover and operationalize the facets of competitive orientations with theoretical underpinning and strong psychometric properties. A total of 2676 respondents were recruited for four studies. The items were constructed based on qualitative research in different cultural contexts. A combined method of exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed. ESEM resulted in a four-factor structure of the competitive orientations and this structure was supported by a series of CFAs on different comprehensive samples. The Multidimensional Competitive Orientation Inventory (MCOI) included 12 items and four factors: hypercompetitive orientation, self-developmental competitive orientation, anxiety-driven competition avoidance, and lack of interest toward competition. Strong gender invariance was established. The four facets of competition have differentiated relationship patterns with adaptive and maladaptive personality and motivational constructs. The MCOI can assess the adaptive and maladaptive facets of competitive orientations with a short, reliable, valid and theoretically underlined multidimensional measure.

362,Emotion regulation in current and remitted depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent, recurrent, and potentially chronic disorder. Identifying risk factors and underlying mechanisms to inform preventive and therapeutic interventions is therefore imperative. Emotion regulation is a proposed factor in the development and maintenance of MDD. The aim of the present review was to summarize and synthesize research on self-reported emotion regulation strategy use and emotion regulation abilities in adults diagnosed with current and remitted MDD. Methods: Seventy-two eligible studies were retrieved from databases through a systematic literature search. Group differences between individuals with current MDD, remitted MDD, and healthy controls were calculated using meta-analytic procedures. Meta-regression analyses investigated potential moderator effects on emotion regulation difficulties. Results: Results indicated that individuals with current MDD report higher maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use for avoidance (Hedges' g = 1.3), rumination ( g = 2.1), and suppression ( g = 1.1) compared to healthy controls. Also, they reported lower adaptive emotion regulation strategy use for acceptance ( g = −1.0), problem solving ( g = −1.0), and reappraisal ( g = −0.7). Individuals with current MDD reported limited general emotion regulation abilities, indicated by higher alexithymia ( g = 1.45), lower emotional awareness ( g = −0.95), emotional clarity ( g = −1.50) and emotional tolerance ( g = −1.89). Similar results were found in individuals with remitted MDD for avoidance ( g = 1.0), rumination ( g = 1.1), suppression ( g = 0.6), and general emotion regulation abilities. However, no difference was found between individuals with remitted MDD and healthy controls for adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Meta-regression analyses suggest that age of illness onset, comorbid anxiety and duration of remission influence emotion regulation. Conclusion: The present review and meta-analysis indicates that individuals with current and remitted MDD have difficulties with emotion regulation compared to individuals who have never been depressed. Although depressive symptoms improve, emotion regulation difficulties may continue, and could be a contributing factor to relapse. Our findings inform future research on emotion regulation and psychotherapeutic interventions.

363,Outpatient psychotherapy improves symptoms and reduces health care costs in regularly and prematurely terminated therapies,"Background: In view of a shortage of health care costs, monetary aspects of psychotherapy become increasingly relevant. The present study examined the pre-post reduction of impairment and direct health care costs depending on therapy termination (regularly terminated, dropout with an unproblematic reason, and dropout with a quality-relevant reason) and the association of symptom and cost reduction. Methods: In a naturalistic longitudinal study, we examined a disorder heterogeneous sample of N = 584 outpatients who were either treated with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, or psychoanalytic therapy. Depression, anxiety, stress, and somatization were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Annual amounts of inpatient costs, outpatient costs, medication costs, days of hospitalization, work disability days, utilization of psychotherapy, and utilization of pharmacotherapy 1 year before therapy and 1 year after therapy were provided by health care insurances. Symptom and cost reduction were analyzed using t -tests. Associations between symptom and cost reduction were examined using partial correlations and hierarchical linear models. Results: Patients who terminated therapy regularly showed the largest symptom reduction ( d = 0.981–1.22). Patients who dropped out due to an unproblematic reason and patients who terminated early due to a quality-relevant reason showed significant but small effects of symptom reductions (e.g., depression: d = 0.429 vs. d = 0.366). For patients with a regular end and those dropping out due to a quality-relevant reason, we observed a significant reduction of work disability (diff in % of pre-test value = 56.3 vs. 42.9%) and hospitalization days (52.8 vs. 35.0%). Annual inpatient costs decreased in the group with a regular therapy end (31.5%). Furthermore, reduction of symptoms on the one side and reduction of work disability days and psychotherapy utilization on the other side were significant correlated ( r = 0.091–0.135). Conclusion: Health care costs and symptoms were reduced in each of the three groups. The average symptom and cost reduction of patients with a quality-relevant dropout suggested that not each dropout might be seen as therapy failure.

364,Effect of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in increasing pain tolerance and improving the mental health of injured athletes,"Literature indicates that injured athletes face both physical and psychological distress after they have been injured. In this study, a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was utilised as an intervention for use during the period of recovery with injured athletes and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using MBSR as an intervention for this purpose. Objective: The aim of this research was to investigate the role of MBSR practise in reducing the perception of pain and decreasing anxiety/stress, as well as increasing pain tolerance and mindfulness. An additional aim was to increase positive mood and decrease negative mood in injured athletes. Methods: The participants comprised of twenty athletes (male = 14; female = 6; age range = 21–36 years) who had severe injuries, preventing their participation in sport for more than 3 months. Prior to their injury, the participants had trained regularly with their University teams and participated in official university championships. Both groups followed their normal physiotherapy treatment, but in addition, the intervention group practised mindfulness meditation for 8 weeks (one 90-min session/week). A Cold Pressor Test (CPT) was used to assess pain tolerance. In contrast, the perception of pain was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale. Other measurements used were the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), and Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Our results demonstrated an increase in pain tolerance for the intervention group and an increase in mindful awareness for injured athletes. Moreover, our findings observed a promising change in positive mood for both groups. Regarding the Stress/Anxiety scores, our findings showed a notable decrease across sessions; however, no significant changes were observed in other main and interaction effects in both groups. Conclusion: Injured athletes can benefit from using mindfulness as part of the sport rehabilitation process to increase their pain tolerance and awareness. Further research is required to assess whether increasing pain tolerance could help in the therapeutic process.

365,A focused review of language use preceding death by execution,"Executions are one form of death that can be assumed to be maximally anxiety provoking. Words spoken by death row inmates moments before their execution can provide valuable insights into people's end-of-life communication needs and themes, conveying what individuals choose to express to others in the face of imminent death. In this focused review, we describe findings from quantitative and qualitative text analysis studies that have analyzed affective experiences and meaning-making attempts in transcriptions of actual statements made by Texas death row inmates. Overall, the most prevalent content themes identified in these final acts of verbal communication in the reviewed studies consisted of a strong predominance of emotional positivity, messages to relevant social others, and spiritual references. We subsequently view the reviewed findings in the light of additional research in which people's conceptions of death and dying were explored and language studies in which people's communication before other forms of death was analyzed. Finally, we describe open questions and directions for future analyses of death row inmates' final statements, and we outline practical implications.

366,"Traumatic experiences, stressful events, and alexithymia in chronic migraine with medication overuse","Background: Many factors are involved in the prognosis and outcome of Chronic Migraine and Medication Overuse Headache (CM + MOH), and their understanding is a topic of interest. It is well known that CM + MOH patients experience increased psychiatric comorbidity, such as anxiety, depression, or personality disorders. Other psychological factors still need to be explored. The present study is aimed to evaluate whether early life traumatic experiences, stressful life events, and alexithymia can be associated with CM + MOH. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-one individuals were recruited for this study. They belonged to one of the two following groups: CM + MOH ( N = 179; 79% females, Age: 45.2 ± 9.8) and episodic migraine (EM) ( N = 152; 81% females; Age: 40.7 ± 11.0). Diagnosis was operationally defined according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-IIIβ). Data on early life (physical and emotional) traumatic experiences, recent stressful events and alexithymia were collected by means of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Stressful life-events Questionnaire, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), respectively. Results: Data showed a higher prevalence of emotional (χ² = 6.99; d.f. = 1; p = 0.006) and physical (χ² = 6.18; d.f. = 1; p = 0.009) childhood trauma and of current stressful events of important impact (χ² = 4.42; d.f. = 1; p = 0.025) in CM+MOH patients than in EM ones. CM+MOH patients were characterized by higher difficulties in a specific alexithymic trait (Factor 1 subscale of TAS-20) [ F (1, 326) = 6.76, p = 0.01, ηp² = 0.02] when compared to the EM group. The role of these factors was confirmed in a multivariate analysis, which showed an association of CM + MOH with emotional (OR 2.655; 95% CI 1.153–6.115, p = 0.022) or physical trauma (OR 2.763; 95% CI 1.322–5.771, p = 0.007), and a high score at the Factor 1 (OR 1.039; 95% CI 1.002–1.078, p = 0.040). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated a clear relationship between CM + MOH and life traumas, stressful events, and alexithymia. These observations have a relevant role in multiple fields of related to chronic headache: from the management to the nosographic framing.

367,A stress reduction program adapted for the work environment: A randomized controlled trial with a follow-up,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate an in situ stress reduction program, named PROGRESS, developed to meet the specific needs of workers in a business context and to research its impact upon non-severe psychiatric symptoms, stress, anxiety, depression, processing speed/attention and mindfulness. Methods: Participants with stress complaints were randomized into two groups: the main intervention group: group 1-G1, ( n = 22); and the control group: group 2-G2, ( n = 22). The protocol was divided into three distinct phases for the purpose of the study. Both groups were evaluated at time 1 (T1), before the first 8-week intervention, which only G1 received. The second evaluation was made on both groups at time 2 (T2), immediately after this first program; in order to test the program’s replicability and investigate possible follow-up effects, an identical second 8-week program was offered to G2 during time 3 (T3), while G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further instruction between T2 and T3. A Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to investigate the construct validity of PROGRESS. Results: Repeated measures MANOVA test, comparing G1 and G2, showed the effect of the intervention from T1 to T2 ( p = 0.021) and from T2 to T3 ( p = 0.031). Univariate analysis showed that participants from G1 improved levels of non-severe psychiatric symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress, processing speed/attention and mindfulness when compared with G2, from T1 to T2 ( p &lt; 0.05). After the participants in G2 received the intervention (T2 to T3), this group also showed improvement in the same variables ( p &lt; 0.05). At the end of their follow-up period (T2-T3)—during which they received no further support or instruction – G1 maintained the improvements gained during T1-T2. The two main components were stress (stress in the last 24-h, in the last week and last month) and mental health (non-severe psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety and mindfulness). Conclusion: PROGRESS, an in situ mindfulness program adapted to fit within the reality of business time constraints, was effective at replicating in more than one group the reduction of stress, depression, anxiety, non-severe psychiatric symptoms, processing speed and also the improvement of attention skills, showing sustained improvement even after 8-weeks follow-up.

368,Long-distance runners and sprinters show different performance monitoring—An event-related potential study,"Previous findings have reported that track and field athletes may monitor and utilize internal information, including anxiety level, suggesting that the ability to inwardly monitor one’s own functioning and utilize anxiety are required to achieve superior performance. Performance monitoring has been investigated using two event-related potential components; the error (-related) negativity (Ne/ERN) and error positivity (Pe). It is unknown whether performance monitoring differs among various types of athletes. It has also been reported that Ne/ERN amplitude is increased in individuals who are more anxious and the prevalence and effect of anxiety also differs among various types of athletes. In this study, we recorded both Ne/ERN and Pe from long-distance runners ( n = 24) and sprinters ( n = 24) while they were performing a spatial Stroop task under motivation and no motivation conditions. We also collected scores on the Sport Competitive Anxiety Test (SCAT). Mean error rate on incongruent trials was lower in the motivation condition than in the no motivation condition. There was neither group effect, nor condition effect found in Ne/ERN amplitude. However, for the long-distance runners, Pe amplitude was larger in the motivation condition than in the no motivation condition. We also investigated the relationships between Ne/ERNs and individual differences in performance anxiety using the SCAT. A multiple linear regression analysis in the motivation condition revealed an interaction between type of runner and SCAT scores, indicating that long-distance runners with higher SCAT scores showed larger Ne/ERN amplitudes whereas the sprinters with high SCAT scores tended to exhibit smaller Ne/ERN amplitudes. Our findings provide further evidence that performance monitoring differs across various types of athletes.

369,Associations between motivation and mental health in sport: A test of the hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation,"Motivation has been the subject of much research in the sport psychology literature, whereas athlete mental health has received limited attention. Motivational complexities in elite sport are somewhat reflected in the mental health literature, where there is evidence for both protective and risk factors for athletes. Notably, few studies have linked motivation to mental health. Therefore, the key objective of this study was to test four mental health outcomes in the motivational sequence posited by the Hierarchical Model of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: motivational climate → basic psychological needs → motivation → mental health outcomes. Elite team-sport athletes (140 females, 75 males) completed seven psychometric inventories of motivation-related and mental health variables. Overall, the athletes reported positive motivational patterns, with autonomous motivation and task climate being more prevalent than their less adaptive counterparts. Elevated depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality affected nearly half of the cohort. Structural equation modeling supported pathways between motivational climate, basic needs, motivation, and mood, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and trait anxiety. Specifically, a task climate was positively associated with the three basic psychological needs, and an ego climate was positively associated with competence. Autonomy and relatedness had positive and negative associations with autonomous and controlled forms of motivation, respectively. Controlled motivation regulations were positively associated with the four mental health outcomes. Integrated regulation had a negative association with anxiety, and intrinsic regulation had a positive association with depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the complexities of and interrelations between motivation and mental health among athletes, and support the importance of considering mental health as an outcome of motivation.

370,Does despotic leadership harm employee family life: Exploring the effects of emotional exhaustion and anxiety,"Research has not focused on the negative effects of despotic leadership on subordinates’ life satisfaction and the interface between work and family. Drawing on the Conservation of Resources theory, this research investigates the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion through which despotic leadership transcends from the workplace to subordinates’ personal lives, resulting in work-family conflict and decreased life satisfaction. The research also examines the moderating effect of subordinates’ anxiety on the relationship of their perceptions of despotic leadership with work-family conflict and life satisfaction. Three waves of time-lagged data was collected from 224 book sellers who work in publishing houses. We used Hayes’ PROCESS to test moderation and SEM to test mediation. The results of the study suggest that despotic leadership is related to work-family conflict via emotional exhaustion, but offer no support for its relationship with life satisfaction. As expected, when subordinates’ anxiety increases, the positive relationship between a supervisor’s despotism and his or her subordinates’ work-family conflict and the negative relationship between despotic leadership and life satisfaction both strengthen. The results suggest that despotic leaders harm their subordinates’ non-work lives, and these effects intensify when subordinates have high levels of anxiety. These findings have important implications for service organizations in mitigating the negative effects of despotic leadership by minimizing subordinates’ anxiety through coping mechanisms and giving reward and incentives.

371,Better cognitive performance is associated with the combination of high trait mindfulness and low trait anxiety,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 9[1105] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record 2018-32809-001). In the original article, the reference for Gaetano, 2018 was incorrectly written. The correct reference is present in the erratum.] There are several ways in which cognitive and neurophysiological parameters have been consistently used to explain the variability in cognitive ability between people. However, little has been done to explore how such cognitive abilities are influenced by differences in personality traits. Dispositional mindfulness and anxiety are two inversely linked traits that have been independently attributed to a range of cognitive functions. The current study investigated these two traits in combination along with measures of the attentional network, cognitive inhibition, and visual working memory (VWM) capacity. A total of 392 prospective participants were screened to select two experimental groups each of 30 healthy young adults, with one having high mindfulness and low anxiety (HMLA) and the second having low mindfulness and high anxiety (LMHA). The groups performed an attentional network task, a color Stroop task, and a change detection test of VWM capacity. Results showed that the HMLA group was more accurate than the LMHA group on the Stroop and change detection tasks. Additionally, the HMLA group was more sensitive in detecting changes and had a higher WMC than the LMHA group. This research adds to the literature that has investigated mindfulness and anxiety independently with a comprehensive investigation of the effects of these two traits in conjunction on executive function.

372,The Bergen 4-day OCD treatment delivered in a group setting: 12-month follow-up,"The Bergen 4-day concentrated exposure treatment (cET) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has proven highly acceptable; with practically no drop-out and a 6 month remission rate of nearly 70%. The aim of the present study was to evaluate long term gains of the approach, and to compare the results to findings from our recent meta-analysis. Sixty-nine of 95 patients consecutively referred to an outpatient clinic in the specialist health care, were offered the Bergen 4-day treatment. Among the 65 who initiated treatment, 60.0% were classified with “severe” to “extreme” OCD. None of the patients dropped-out during treatment. Independent Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale interviews were conducted post-treatment, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Using the international consensus criteria, 83.1% responded to treatment at 12-month follow-up, and 67.7% of patients were classified as recovered. Significant changes were also seen in depression, as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and in generalized anxiety, as measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. A total of 89% of the patients rated the treatment as very good and 100% would recommend the treatment to a friend. Compared to results in a recent meta-analysis, the Bergen 4-day treatment is favorable in respect to attrition, response and 12-month recovery. In sum the Bergen 4-day treatment is a feasible way to deliver treatment for OCD, and the effects are stable at 12-month follow-up. Implications for dissemination are discussed.

373,Cognitive and personality components underlying spoken idiom comprehension in context. An exploratory study,"In this exploratory study, we investigated whether and to what extent individual differences in cognitive and personality variables are associated with spoken idiom comprehension in context. Language unimpaired participants were enrolled in a cross-modal lexical decision study in which semantically ambiguous Italian idioms (i.e., strings with both a literal and an idiomatic interpretation as, for instance, break the ice ), predictable or unpredictable before the string offset, were embedded in idiom-biasing contexts. To explore the contributions of different cognitive and personality components, participants also completed a series of tests respectively assessing general speed, inhibitory control, short-term and working memory, cognitive flexibility, crystallized and fluid intelligence, and personality. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that online idiom comprehension was associated with the participants' working memory, inhibitory control and crystallized verbal intelligence, an association modulated by idiom type. Also personality-related variables (State Anxiety and Openness to Experience) were associated with idiom comprehension, although in marginally significant ways. These results contribute to the renewed interest on how individual variability modulates language comprehension, and for the first time document contributions of individual variability on lexicalized, high frequency multi-word expressions as idioms adding new knowledge to the existing evidence on metaphor and sarcasm.

374,"Relation between mathematical performance, math anxiety, and affective priming in children with and without developmental dyscalculia","Many children show negative emotions related to mathematics and some even develop mathematics anxiety. The present study focused on the relation between negative emotions and arithmetical performance in children with and without developmental dyscalculia (DD) using an affective priming task. Previous findings suggested that arithmetic performance is influenced if an affective prime precedes the presentation of an arithmetic problem. In children with DD specifically, responses to arithmetic operations are supposed to be facilitated by both negative and mathematics-related primes (= negative math priming effect ).We investigated mathematical performance, math anxiety, and the domain-general abilities of 172 primary school children (76 with DD and 96 controls). All participants also underwent an affective priming task which consisted of the decision whether a simple arithmetic operation (addition or subtraction) that was preceded by a prime (positive/negative/neutral or mathematics-related) was true or false. Our findings did not reveal a negative math priming effect in children with DD. Furthermore, when considering accuracy levels, gender, or math anxiety, the negative math priming effect could not be replicated. However, children with DD showed more math anxiety when explicitly assessed by a specific math anxiety interview and showed lower mathematical performance compared to controls. Moreover, math anxiety was equally present in boys and girls, even in the earliest stages of schooling, and interfered negatively with performance. In conclusion, mathematics is often associated with negative emotions that can be manifested in specific math anxiety, particularly in children with DD. Importantly, present findings suggest that in the assessed age group, it is more reliable to judge math anxiety and investigate its effects on mathematical performance explicitly by adequate questionnaires than by an affective math priming task.

376,Feasibility of a humor training to promote humor and decrease stress in a subclinical sample: A single-arm pilot study,"The present study investigates the feasibility of a humor training for a subclinical sample suffering from increased stress, depressiveness, or anxiety. Based on diagnostic interviews, 35 people were invited to participate in a 7-week humor training. Evaluation measures were filled in prior training, after training, and at a 1-month follow-up including humor related outcomes (coping humor and cheerfulness) and mental health-related outcomes (perceived stress, depressiveness, anxiety, and well-being). Outcomes were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs. Within-group comparisons of intention-to-treat analysis showed main effects of time with large effect sizes on all outcomes. Post hoc tests showed medium to large effect sizes on all outcomes from pre to post and results remained stable until follow-up. Satisfaction with the training was high, attrition rate low (17.1%), and participants would highly recommend the training. Summarizing the results, the pilot study showed promising effects for people suffering from subclinical symptoms. All outcomes were positively influenced and showed stability over time. Humor trainings could be integrated more into mental health care as an innovative program to reduce stress whilst promoting also positive emotions. However, as this study was a single-arm pilot study, further research (including also randomized controlled trials) is still needed to evaluate the effects more profoundly.

377,The use of virtual reality to facilitate mindfulness skills training in dialectical behavioral therapy for spinal cord injury: A case study,"Introduction: Paralysis from a spinal cord injury (SCI) increases risk of psychological problems including suicide attempts, substance use disorder, negative emotions (e.g., anger), depression, anxiety, ASD/PTSD. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy® (DBT®) has been shown to be effective for treating similar psychological symptoms in non-SCI patient populations. The current study explored for the first time, the feasibility and clinical potential of using Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) enhanced DBT® Mindfulness skills training to help reduce psychological symptoms (negative emotions and anxiety, ASD/PTSD) of two patients with SCI. Patient 1 was a 39-year-old male patient suffering multiple spinal cord injuries, resulting in quadriplegia, after falling out of a four story building. Patient 1 had severe depression, and anxiety symptoms. Patient 2, was a 31 year old male with a C7 vertebral body fracture, leading to paresis, after suffering a blunt force trauma injury during an attempted suicide, jumping from a moving vehicle. Patient 2 had mild depression, and anxiety symptoms. Methods: Each patient looked into VR goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a river in virtual reality while listening to DBT® Mindfulness Skills training instructions. Each patient filled out brief psychological ratings before and after each VR session, four VR DBT® sessions for patient 1, and two VR DBT® sessions for patient 2. Results: As predicted, patient 1 reported reductions in negative emotions after each VR DBT® Mindfulness session. Patient 2 had mixed results on some of the measures of negative emotions. And both patients reported feeling less depressed, less anxious, and less emotionally upset, after VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning. Patient 2 reported large reductions in short term ASD/PTSD symptoms after his first VR DBT® mindfulness skills training session. Conclusion: This study explored the feasibility of using VR DBT® with quadriplegic or paresis SCI patients. Both SCI patients accepted VR, the patients liked using VR, and, with assistance from the therapist, the patients were able to use the VR equipment, despite being paralyzed. Additional research and development will be needed to determine whether VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills training leads to any long term improvements in outcome.

Conclusion: With the Awareness items excluded, the DERS showed good internal consistency and a robust bifactor latent structure. The general factor and several specific factors incrementallyObjective: The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a widely used self-report measure of subjective emotion ability, as defined by a prominent clinically derived model of emotion regulation (Gratz and Roemer, 2004). Although the DERS is often used in treatment and research settings for adults with emotional (i.e., anxiety, mood, obsessive-compulsive, or trauma-related) disorders, its psychometric properties are not well-characterized in this population. Method: We examined the psychometric properties of the DERS and three popular short forms (DERS-16; DERS-18; and DERS-SF) in a large ( N = 427) sample of treatment-seeking adults with one or more DSM-5 emotional disorders. Results: For the original DERS, internal consistency was strong for all subscales except Awareness. A bifactor structure consisting of one general emotion dysregulation factor and five uncorrelated specific factors corresponding to the original DERS subscales (excluding Awareness) provided the best fit. A series of structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated unique incremental contributions of the general factor and several specific factors to explaining concurrent clinical severity. The general factor and one specific factor (Goals) also prospectively predicted treatment outcome following a naturalistic course of outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a subset of participants ( n = 202) for whom discharge data were available. Specifically, more severe emotion dysregulation at intake predicted better CBT response, while more severe impairment in goal-directed activity when distressed predicted worse CBT response. All three short forms showed a robust bifactor structure and good internal consistency and convergent validity vis-à-vis the original measure, albeit with a slight decrement in incremental utility (1–3% less variance explained in clinical severity). Conclusion: With the Awareness items excluded, the DERS showed good internal consistency and a robust bifactor latent structure. The general factor and several specific factors incrementally and prospectively predicted clinical severity and treatment outcome, which suggests that the DERS may have clinical and predictive utility in treatment-seeking adults with emotional disorders. Additional research is needed to establish convergent and discriminant validity in this population. The use of a short form in lieu of the full DERS may be sufficient for many general clinical and research purposes, particularly when participant burden is a concern.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed to verify the BSI-18’s factor structure in a large sample of Chinese insurance professionals ( N = 2363, 62.7% women; age range = 19–70). Multigroup CFA were performed to test the measurement invariance of the model with the best fit across genders. In addition, structural equation modeling was conducted to test the correlations between the BSI-18 and two covariates – social support perception and grit trait. Results indicated that the bi-factor model best fit the data and was also equivalent across genders. The BSI-18’s general factor, and somatization and depression dimensions were significantly related to social support perception and grit trait, whereas the anxiety dimension was not. Overall, our findings suggested that the BSI-18’s can be a promising tool in assessing general psychological distress in Chinese employees.

380,Psychological intrusion—An overlooked aspect of dental fear,"Dental fear/anxiety is a widely recognised problem affecting a large proportion of the population. It can result in avoidance and/or difficulty accepting dental care. We believe that psychological intrusion may play a role in the aetiology and maintenance of dental fear for at least some individuals. In this narrative review we will take a developmental perspective in order to understand its impact across the lifespan. We will consider the nature of ‘self,’ parenting styles, the details of intrusive parenting or parental psychological control, and briefly touch upon child temperament and parental anxiety. Finally, we draw together the supporting (largely unrecognised) evidence available in the dental literature. We illustrate the paper with clinical examples and discuss possibly effective ways of addressing the problem. We conclude that psychological intrusion appears to play an important role in dental fear, for at least some individuals, and we call for detailed research into the extent and exact nature of the problem. A simple means of identifying individuals who are vulnerable to psychological intrusion would be useful for dentists.

However, factors additional to those emphasised in CBT are the primary cause of psychological disorder according to the metacognitive model. Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) aims to target a perseverative thinking style named the cognitive attentional syndrome and its underlying metacognitive beliefs (beliefs about cognition). The present study aimed to explore the effects of generic MCT for SAD. Treatment related effects were evaluated using direct replication single case (A–B) methodology across three patients with different subtypes of SAD; performance type, generalised and generalised plus avoidant personality disorder, representing increasing SAD severity/complexity. All patients responded during treatment and achieved substantial symptom reductions which were largely maintained at 6 months’ follow-up. Metacognitive therapy appears to be a suitable treatment and was associated with positive outcomes for patients with different presentations of SAD.

The purpose of this study is to develop a new measure to assess music listening functions that is psychometrically robust, and suitable for outcomes-based research on music listening and wellbeing. Scale items were developed based on a literature review and a prior qualitative enquiry. The items were reviewed by four content experts in music psychology and scale development. Scale structure was investigated by EFA and CFA in two large samples of participants ( N = 1,191, 17–66 years, M = 22.04, SD = 6.23, 326 males). Tests of dimensionality revealed a 46-item scale with 11 factors for the Adaptive Functions of Music Listening (AFML) scale. Namely, Stress Regulation, Anxiety Regulation, Anger Regulation, Loneliness Regulation, Rumination, Reminiscence, Strong Emotional Experiences, Awe and Appreciation, Cognitive Regulation, Identity, and Sleep FML. The scale and its subscales possess good internal consistency and construct validity. In line with theory and research on gender differences in FML, scores on factors representing affect regulation FML were significantly higher among female respondents. Supporting the concurrent validity of the AFML scale, factors were positively correlated with an existing measure of the FML—the Music USE questionnaire. Further evidence of construct validity derives from positive associations between affect regulation factor scores and level of reappraisal, and lack of association with suppression, as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Consistent with the view that adaptive FML are positively related to wellbeing, a number of factors, affect regulation factors in particular, were significantly positively correlated with subjective, psychological, and social wellbeing measures across two cross-sectional studies.

383,The efficacy of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing in children and adults who have experienced complex childhood trauma: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Survivors of complex childhood trauma (CT) such as sexual abuse show poorer outcomes compared to single event trauma survivors. A growing number of studies investigate Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no systematic reviews have focused on EMDR treatment for CT as an intervention for both adults and children. This study therefore systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of EMDR on PTSD symptoms in adults and children exposed to CT. Methods: Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched in October 2017. Randomized controlled trials which recruited adult and children with experience of CT, which compared EMDR to alternative treatments or control conditions, and which measured PTSD symptoms were included. Study methodology quality was evaluated with Platinum Standard scale. Results: Six eligible RCTs of 251 participants were included in this systematic review. The results indicated that EMDR was associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms, depression and/or anxiety both post-treatment and at follow-up compared with all other alternative therapies (cognitive behavior therapy, individual/group therapy and fluoxetine) and control treatment (pill placebo, active listening, EMDR delayed treatment, and treatment as usual). However, studies suffered from significant heterogeneity in study populations, length of EMDR treatment, length of follow-up, comparison groups, and outcome measures. One study had a high risk of bias. Discussion: This systematic review suggests that there is growing evidence to support the clinical efficacy of EMDR in treating CT in both children and adults. However, conclusions are limited by the small number of heterogenous trials. Further RCTs with standardized methodologies, as well as studies addressing real world challenges in treating CT are required.

384,Acute anxiety predicts components of the cold shock response on cold water immersion: Toward an integrated psychophysiological model of acute cold water survival,"Introduction: Drowning is a leading cause of accidental death. In cold-water, sudden skin cooling triggers the life-threatening cold shock response (CSR). The CSR comprises tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, hypertension, inspiratory gasp, and hyperventilation with the hyperventilatory component inducing hypocapnia and increasing risk of aspirating water to the lungs. Some CSR components can be reduced by habituation (i.e., reduced response to stimulus of same magnitude) induced by 3–5 short cold-water immersions (CWI). However, high levels of acute anxiety, a plausible emotion on CWI: magnifies the CSR in unhabituated participants, reverses habituated components of the CSR and prevents/delays habituation when high levels of anxiety are experienced concurrent to immersions suggesting anxiety is integral to the CSR. Purpose: To examine the predictive relationship that prior ratings of acute anxiety have with the CSR. Secondly, to examine whether anxiety ratings correlated with components of the CSR during immersion before and after induction of habituation. Methods: Forty-eight unhabituated participants completed one (CON1) 7-min immersion in to cold water (15°C). Of that cohort, twenty-five completed four further CWIs that would ordinarily induce CSR habituation. They then completed two counter-balanced immersions where anxiety levels were increased (CWI-ANX) or were not manipulated (CON2). Acute anxiety and the cardiorespiratory responses (cardiac frequency [ f c ], respiratory frequency [ f R ], tidal volume [ V T ], minute ventilation [ V E ]) were measured. Multiple regression was used to identify components of the CSR from the most life-threatening period of immersion (1 st minute) predicted by the anxiety rating prior to immersion. Relationships between anxiety rating and CSR components during immersion were assessed by correlation. Results: Anxiety rating predicted the f c component of the CSR in unhabituated participants (CON1; p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.536, r ² = 0.190). After habituation immersions (i.e., cohort 2), anxiety rating predicted the f R component of the CSR when anxiety levels were lowered (CON2; p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.566, r ² = 0.320) but predicted the f c component of the CSR ( p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.518, r ² = 0.197) when anxiety was increased suggesting different drivers of the CSR when anxiety levels were manipulated; correlation data supported these relationships. Discussion: Acute anxiety is integral to the CSR before and after habituation. We offer a new integrated model including neuroanatomical, perceptual and attentional components of the CSR to explain these data.

385,Intake of raw fruits and vegetables is associated with better mental health than intake of processed fruits and vegetables,"Background: Higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, rich in micronutrients, have been associated with better mental health. However, cooking or processing may reduce the availability of these important micronutrients. This study investigated the differential associations between intake of raw fruits and vegetables, compared to processed (cooked or canned) fruits and vegetables, and mental health in young adults. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey design, 422 young adults ages 18–25 (66.1% female) living in New Zealand and the United States completed an online survey that assessed typical consumption of raw vs. cooked/canned/processed fruits and vegetables, negative and positive mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative mood, positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing), and covariates (including socio-economic status, body mass index, sleep, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use). Results: Controlling for covariates, raw fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) predicted reduced depressive symptoms and higher positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing; processed FVI only predicted higher positive mood. The top 10 raw foods related to better mental health were carrots, bananas, apples, dark leafy greens like spinach, grapefruit, lettuce, citrus fruits, fresh berries, cucumber, and kiwifruit. Conclusions: Raw FVI, but not processed FVI, significantly predicted higher mental health outcomes when controlling for the covariates. Applications include recommending the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables to maximize mental health benefits.

386,Psychodrama and moviemaking in a death education course to work through a case of suicide among high school students in italy,"This study describes the psychological effects of an experience of death education (DE) used to explore a case of suicide in an Italian high school. DE activities included philosophical and religious perspectives of the relationships between death and the meaning of life, a visit to a local hospice, and psychodrama activities, which culminated in the production of short movies. The intervention involved 268 high school students (138 in the experimental group). Pre-test and post-test measures assessed ontological representations of death, death anxiety, alexithymia, and meaning in life. Results confirmed that, in the experimental group, death anxiety was significantly reduced as much as the representation of death as annihilation and alexithymia, while a sense of spirituality and the meaning of life were more enhanced, compared to the No DE group. These improvements in the positive meaning of life and the reduction of anxiety confirmed that it is possible to manage trauma and grief at school with death education interventions that include religious discussion, psychodrama and movie making activities.

387,Parenting stress and resilience in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Southeast Asia: A systematic review,"Background: This paper aimed to review the literature on the factors associated with parenting stress and resilience among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the South East Asia (SEA) region. Methods: An extensive search of articles in multiple online databases (PsycNET, ProQuest, PudMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) resulted in 28 papers that met the inclusion criteria (i.e., conducted in the SEA region, specific to ASD only, published in a peer-reviewed journal, full text in English). Studies found were conducted in the following countries: Brunei, n = 1; Indonesia, n = 2; Malaysia, n = 12; Philippines, n = 5; Singapore, n = 5, Thailand, n = 2; and Vietnam, n = 1, but none from Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, and Myanmar were identified. Results: Across the studies, six main factors were found to be associated with parenting stress: social support, severity of autism symptoms, financial difficulty, parents' perception and understanding toward ASD, parents' anxiety and worries about their child's future, and religious beliefs. These six factors could also be categorized as either a source of parenting stress or a coping strategy/resilience mechanism that may attenuate parenting stress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that greater support services in Western countries may underlie the cultural differences observed in the SEA region. Limitations in the current review were identified. The limited number of studies yielded from the search suggests a need for expanded research on ASD and parenting stress, coping, and resilience in the SEA region especially in Cambodia, East Timor, Laos, and Myanmar. The identified stress and resilience factors may serve as sociocultural markers for clinicians, psychologists, and other professionals to consider when supporting parents of children with ASD.

388,Alexithymia in gastroenterology and hepatology: A systematic review,"Background: Alexithymia is a multifaceted personality construct that represents a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotions and is currently understood to be related to a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions. The present review aims to investigate the relationship of alexithymia with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID, as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)] and liver diseases as chronic hepatitis C (CHC), cirrhosis, and liver transplantation. Methods: The articles were selected from the main electronic databases (PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect) using multiple combinations of relevant search terms (defined GI and liver diseases, articles in English, use of the Toronto scales [TAS] for alexithymia). The TAS was selected as inclusion criterion because it is the most widely used measure, thus allowing comparisons across studies. Results: Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 38 focused on GI disorders (27 on FGID and 11 on IBD) and 10 on liver diseases. Most studies ( n = 30, 62%) were cross-sectional. The prevalence of alexithymia was higher in FGID (two third or more) than IBD and liver diseases (from one third to 50% of patients, consistent with other chronic non-GI diseases) than general population (10–15%). In functional disorders, alexithymia may be viewed as a primary driver for higher visceral perception, symptom reporting, health care use, symptom persistence, and negative treatment outcomes. Also, it has been found associated with psychological distress and specific GI-related forms of anxiety in predicting symptom severity as well as post-treatment outcomes and is associated with several psychological factors increasing the burden of disease and impairing levels of quality of life. A number of critical issues (small sample sizes, patients referred to secondary and tertiary care centers, cross-sectional study design, use of one single scale for alexithymia) constitutes a limitation to the generalization of findings. Conclusions: Alexithymia showed to play different roles in gastroenterology according to the clinical characteristics and the psychological burden of the various disorders, with main relevance in increasing subjective symptom perception and affecting negatively post-treatment outcomes.

389,The complex interplay between depression/anxiety and executive functioning: Insights from the ECAS in a large ALS population,"Introduction: The observed association between depressive symptoms and cognitive performances has not been previously clarified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (pALS). In fact, the use of cognitive measures often not accommodating for motor disability has led to heterogeneous and not conclusive findings about this issue. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive and depressive/anxiety symptoms by means of the recently developed Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS), a brief assessment specifically designed for pALS. Methods: Sample included 168 pALS (114 males, 54 females); they were administered two standard cognitive screening tools (FAB; MoCA) and the ECAS, assessing different cognitive domains, including ALS-specific (executive functions, verbal fluency, and language tests) and ALS non-specific subtests (memory and visuospatial tests). Two psychological questionnaires for depression and anxiety (BDI; STAI/Y) were also administered to patients. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the degree of association between cognitive and psychological measures. Results: Depression assessment negatively correlated with the ECAS, more significantly with regard to the executive functions subdomain. In particular, Sentence Completion and Social Cognition subscores were negatively associated with depression levels measured by BDI total score and Somatic-Performance symptoms subscore. Conversely, no significant correlations were observed between depression level and cognitive functions as measured by traditional screening tools for frontal abilities (FAB) and global cognition (MoCA) assessment. Finally, no significant correlations were observed between state/trait anxiety and the ECAS. Discussion and conclusion: This represents the first study focusing on the relationship between cognitive and psychological components in pALS by means of the ECAS, the current gold standard for ALS cognitive-behavioral assessment. If confirmed by further investigations, the observed association between depression and executive functions suggests the need for a careful screening and treatment of depression, to avoid overestimation of cognitive involvement and possibly improve cognitive performances in ALS.

390,Dog-owner attachment is associated with oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms in both parties. A comparative study on Austrian and Hungarian border collies,"Variations in human infants' attachment behavior are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, suggesting a genetic component to infant-mother attachment. However, due to the genetic relatedness of infants and their mothers, it is difficult to separate the genetic effects of infants' OXTR genotype from the environmental effects of mothers' genotype possibly affecting their parental behavior. The apparent functional analogy between child-parent and dog-owner relationship, however, offers a way to disentangle the effects of these factors because pet dogs are not genetically related to their caregivers. In the present study we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of pet dogs' OXTR gene (−213AG,−94TC,−74CG) and their owners' OXTR gene (rs53576, rs1042778, rs2254298) are associated with components of dog-owner attachment. In order to investigate whether social-environmental effects modulate the potential genetic influence on attachment, dogs and their owners from two different countries (Austria and Hungary, N = 135 in total) were tested in a modified version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test (SST) and questionnaires were also used to collect information about owner personality and attachment style. We coded variables related to three components of attachment behavior in dogs: their sensitivity to the separation from and interaction with the owner (Attachment), stress caused by the unfamiliar environment (Anxiety), and their responsiveness to the stranger (Acceptance). We found that (1) dogs' behavior was significantly associated with polymorphisms in both dogs' and owners' OXTR gene, (2) SNPs in dogs' and owners' OXTR gene interactively influenced dog-human relationship, (3) dogs' attachment behavior was affected by the country of origin, and (4) it was related to their owners' personality as well as attachment style. Thus, the present study provides evidence, for the first time, that both genetic variation in the OXTR gene and various aspects of pet dogs' environmental background are associated with their attachment to their human caregivers.

391,Alexithymia and depression affect quality of life in patients with chronic pain: A study on 205 patients with fibromyalgia,"Pain in fibromyalgia (FM) is accompanied by a heterogeneous series of other symptoms, which strongly affect patients’ quality of life and interfere with social and work performance. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of alexithymia on both the physical and the psychosocial components of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of FM patients, controlling for the concomitant effects of depression, anxiety, and pain. In particular, given the strong interconnection between depression and alexithymia, the relationship between alexithymia and HRQoL as mediated by depressive symptoms was further investigated. Data were collected on a consecutive sample of 205 female patients with a main diagnosis of FM. The results showed that about 26% of the patients showed the presence of alexithymia, as assessed by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Clinically relevant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were present in 61 and 60% of the patients, respectively. The results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that pain intensity (PI) and depressive symptoms explained the 45% of the variance of the physical component of HRQoL ( p &lt; 0.001). Regarding the mental component of HRQoL, depressive and anxiety symptoms, alexithymia, and PI significantly explained 61% of the variance ( p &lt; 0.001). The mediation analyses confirmed that alexithymia had a direct effect on the mental component of HRQoL and showed a statistically significant indirect effect on both the physical and the mental components, through the mediation of depressive symptoms. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested the presence of both a direct and an indirect effect of alexithymia, in particular of the difficulty identifying feeling, on the HRQoL of patients with FM. Indeed, even though the concomitant presence of depressive symptoms is responsible of an indirect effect, alexithymia per se seems to directly contribute to worsen the impact that this chronic pain pathology has on the patients’ quality of life, especially regarding the psychosocial functioning.

392,Assessment of affect lability: Psychometric properties of the ALS-18,"Affect lability, an important aspect of emotion dysregulation, characterizes several psychiatric conditions. The short Affective Lability Scales (ALS-18) measures three aspects of changeability between euthymia and affect states (Anxiety/Depression, AD; Depression/Elation, DE; and Anger, Ang). The aim of our study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of an Italian version of the ALS-18 in a sample of adults recruited from the general population. The sample was composed of 494 adults (343 women and 151 men) aged 18 and higher (mean age = 31.73 years, SD = 12.6). All participants were administered a checklist assessing socio-demographic variables, the ALS-18 and measures of depression and difficulties in emotion regulation. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated adequate fit of the three-factor model (RMSEA = 0.061, 95% CI = 0.054/0.069; CFI = 0.99; SRMR = 0.055), and the presence of a higher-order general factor. Internal consistency was satisfactory for all the lower-order dimensions and the general factor (ordinal α &gt; 0.70). The ALS-18 was significantly associated with concurrent measures of depression and difficulties in emotion regulation. These findings indicate that the ALS-18 is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring affect lability, although discriminant validity of subdimensions scores could be problematic.

393,The topological properties of stimuli influence fear generalization and extinction in humans,"Fear generalization is an etiologically significant indicator of anxiety disorders, and understanding how to inhibit it is important in their treatment. Prior studies have found that reducing fear generalization using a generalization stimulus (GS) is ineffective in removing a conditioned fear that incorporates local features, and that topological properties appear to play a comparatively more significant role in the processes of perception and categorization. Our study utilized a conditioned-fear generalization design to examine whether the topological properties of stimuli influence the generalization and return of fear. Fear was indexed using online expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs). The study’s 52 participants were divided into three groups: Group 1, conditioned danger cue (CS+) extinction; Group 2, extinction of one GS; Group 3, extinction of three GSs. We found that the three groups acquired conditioned fear at the same level. In the generalization and extinction phase, fear was transferred to the GS with the same topological properties as CS+, and gradual decreases in both shock expectancy and SCRs over non-reinforced extinction trials were observed. In the test phase, participants’ online expectancy ratings indicated that fear did not return in Group 1, but did return in Groups 2 and 3. All three groups demonstrated successful GS fear extinction, but only Group 1 did not show a return of fear for CS+. Regarding SCRs results, none of the groups demonstrated a return of fear, suggesting that utilization of topological properties successfully reduced the return of conditioned fear. Our results indicate that, in clinical settings, using GS with topological equivalence to CS+ might offer a potential method with which to extinct conditioned fear.

394,Psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Young Schema Questionnaire L-3: Preliminary results,"Schema Therapy (ST) is a well-known approach for the treatment of personality disorders. This therapy integrates different theories and techniques into an original and systematic treatment model. The Young Schema Questionnaire L-3 (YSQ-L3) is a self-report instrument, based on the ST model, designed to assess 18 Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMSs). During the last decade, it has been translated and validated in different countries and languages. This study aims to establish the psychometric properties of the Italian Version of the YSQ-L3. We enrolled two groups: a clinical ( n = 148) and a non-clinical one ( n = 918). We investigated the factor structure, reliability and convergent validity with anxiety and depression between clinical and non-clinical groups. The results highlighted a few relevant findings. Cronbach's alpha showed significant values for all the schemas. All of the factor models do not seem highly adequate, even if the hierarchical model has proven to be the most significant one. Furthermore, the questionnaire confirms the ability to discriminate between clinical and non-clinical groups and could represent a useful tool in the clinical practice. Limitations and future directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
395,The intolerance of uncertainty inventory: Validity and comparison of scoring methods to assess individuals screening positive for anxiety and depression,"Intolerance of Uncertainty is a fundamental transdiagnostic personality construct hierarchically organized with a core general factor underlying diverse clinical manifestations. The current study evaluated the construct validity of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Inventory, a two-part scale separately assessing a unitary Intolerance of Uncertainty disposition to consider uncertainties to be unacceptable and threatening (Part A) and the consequences of such disposition, regarding experiential avoidance, chronic doubt, overestimation of threat, worrying, control of uncertain situations, and seeking reassurance (Part B). Community members ( N = 1046; Mean age = 36.69 ± 12.31 years; 61% females) completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Inventory with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Part A demonstrated a robust unidimensional structure and an excellent convergent validity with Part B. A bifactor model was the best fitting model for Part B. Based on these results, we compared the hierarchical factor scores with summated ratings clinical proxy groups reporting anxiety and depression symptoms. Summated rating scores were associated with both depression and anxiety and proportionally increased with the co-occurrence of depressive and anxious symptoms. By contrast, hierarchical scores were useful to detect which facets mostly separated between for depression and anxiety groups. In sum, Part A was a reliable and valid transdiagnostic measure of Intolerance of Uncertainty. The Part B was arguably more useful for assessing clinical manifestations of Intolerance of Uncertainty for specific disorders, provided that hierarchical scores are used. Overall, our study suggest that clinical assessments might need to shift toward hierarchical factor scores.

396,Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Short Form: Factorial invariance and optimistic and pessimistic affective profiles in Spanish children,"The distinction in recent years between positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) is becoming increasingly important due to their relationship with depression and anxiety. This work is composed of two studies. The first study aimed to validate the brief version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children-Short Form (PANAS-C-SF) in a Spanish child sample. The second study sought to check the existence of four affective profiles: self-fulfilling (high PA and low NA), low affective (low PA and NA), high affective (high PA and NA), and self-destructive (low PA and high NA) and to relate them to optimism and pessimism. Samples for both studies were composed of 647 and 1,296 Spanish students (between 8 and 11 years), respectively. Through various multigroup confirmatory factor analyses (MCA), the invariance of the PANAS-SF and the lack of significant gender differences in the latent means were verified. In addition, cluster analysis confirmed the existence of the appropriate profiles. In this case, the self-fulfilling profile correlated with high scores in optimism and low scores pessimism, whereas the self-destructive profile correlated in the opposite direction. These contributions represent an advance in the study of child affect.

397,"Cognitive impairments in fibromyalgia syndrome: Associations with positive and negative affect, alexithymia, pain catastrophizing and self-esteem","Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain accompanied by symptoms like depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and fatigue. In addition, affected patients frequently report cognitive disruption such as forgetfulness, concentration difficulties or mental slowness. Though cognitive deficits in FMS have been confirmed in various studies, not much is known about the mechanisms involved in their origin. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of affect-related variables to cognitive impairments in FMS. For this purpose, 67 female FMS patients and 32 healthy control subjects completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring processing speed, attention, visuospatial and verbal memory, cognitive flexibility and planning abilities. In addition, participants completed self-report questionnaires pertaining to positive and negative affect, alexithymia, pain catastrophizing and self-esteem. Clinical characteristics including pain severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, insomnia and fatigue were also assessed. FMS patients showed markedly poorer performance than healthy controls in all of the cognitive domains assessed, in addition to greater levels of depression, anxiety, negative affect, alexithymia and pain catastrophizing, and lower self-esteem and positive affect. In exploratory correlation analysis in the FMS sample, lower cognitive performance was associated with higher pain severity, depression, anxiety, negative affect, alexithymia and pain catastrophizing, as well as lower self-esteem and positive affect. However, in regression analyses, pain, self-esteem, alexithymia, and pain catastrophizing explained the largest portion of the variance in performance. While interference effects of clinical pain in cognition have been previously described, the present findings suggest that affective factors also substantially contribute to the genesis of cognitive impairments. They support the notion that affective disturbances form a crucial aspect of FMS pathology, whereas strategies aiming to improve emotional regulation may be a beneficial element of psychological therapy in the management of FMS.

398,Perceived stress in adults aged 65 to 90: Relations to facets of time perspective and &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism,"This study examined the relation between perceived stress and time perspective (views of past, present, future) in a population-based sample of older adults (65–90 years, N = 340). The Perceived Questionnaire (PSQ index) was used to measure stress and the Swedish version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (S-ZTPI) was used to operationalize time perspective. Unlike the original inventory, S-ZTPI separates positive and negative aspects of a future time perspective and we hypothesized that the Future Negative (FN) scale would be important to account for variations in stress. Additionally, associations with Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism were examined, motivated by prior associations of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with stress (or “anxiety”) related personality traits. In line with the hypotheses, FN was the strongest predictor of PSQ index scores in multiple regression analyses. In a related vein, the dichotomization of the unitary Future scale increased the association between PSQ scores and a measure of deviations from a balanced time perspective, i.e., the difference between a proposed optimal and observed ZTPI profile. Finally, higher levels of stress as well as higher scores on FN were observed in COMT Val/Val carriers, at least among men. This suggests a shared dopaminergic genetic influence on these variables. Collectively, the results demonstrate that perceived stress is closely linked to time perspective and highlight the need to take negative aspects of a future temporal orientation into account to understand this relation.

399,"Lucid dreaming: Intensity, but not frequency, is inversely related to psychopathology","Lucid dreaming (LD) is awareness that one is dreaming, during the dream state. However, some define and assess LD relying also on controlling dream events, although control is present only in a subset of lucid dreams. LD has been claimed to represent well-being, and has even been used as a therapeutic agent. Conversely, LD is associated with mixed sleep-wake states, which are related to bizarre cognitions, stress, and psychopathology, and have been construed as arousal permeating and disrupting sleep. We propose that previous conflicting findings regarding relations between LD and both psychopathology and well-being, stem from the non-differentiated assessment of frequency and control. The present study aimed to develop an expansive measure of several LD characteristics (the Frequency and Intensity Lucid Dream questionnaire; FILD), and explore their relations with symptomatology. Undergraduate students ( N = 187) self-reported trait LD, psychopathology (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation, and schizotypy), stress, and sleep problems; 2 months later, a subsample ( n = 78) reported psychopathology again, and also completed a dream diary each morning for 14 days. Preliminary evidence supports the reliability and validity of the FILD. Items converged into four domains: frequency, intensity (e.g., control, activity, certainty of dreaming), emotional valence, and the use of induction techniques. We report an optimal frequency cutoff score to identify those likely to experience LD within a 2-week period. Whereas LD frequency was unrelated to psychopathology, LD intensity, and positive LD emotions, were inversely associated with several psychopathological symptoms. Use of deliberate induction techniques was positively associated with psychopathology and sleep problems. Additionally, we demonstrated directionality by employing a prospective-longitudinal design, showing that deliberate LD induction predicted an increase in dissociation and schizotypy symptoms across 2 months. We conclude that lucidity should not be considered as necessarily suggestive of well-being; LD may be positive or negative, depending on lucidity characteristics.

400,Moderators influencing the effectiveness of a behavioral teacher program,"Objective: This study assessed which moderators influenced the effectiveness of a low-intensive behavioral teacher program for children with symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Methods: Primary school children ( N = 114) with ADHD symptoms in the classroom were randomly assigned to the intervention program ( n = 58; 91% male) or control group ( n = 56; 77% male). Multilevel regression analyses assessed differential treatment gains of the intervention program in terms of ADHD symptoms and social skills. Moderators included demographic characteristics (gender, age, parental educational level), severity and comorbidity of problem behavior (ADHD symptoms, conduct and internalizing problems), social functioning, and classroom variables (teaching experience, class size). Results: Results revealed larger program effects for older children and children from highly educated families and smaller beneficial effects for children with comorbid conduct or anxiety problems. Conclusion: The intervention program seems more beneficial for highly educated families and children without comorbid problem behavior, but more intensive treatments appear necessary for children facing additional challenges.

401,Psychological impact of stalking on male and female health care professional victims of stalking and domestic violence,"The aim of this work was to investigate stalking experiences in a sample of Health Care Professionals, or HCPs, who experienced domestic violence in their previous relationships with an intimate romantic or non-romantic who had become their stalkers. A comparison between males and females was made to highlight the differences among the genders. The findings showed that, for the most part, the victims experienced stalking by a stalker that was not of the same gender. Moreover, the nature of the relationship was romantic, for the most part, for both female and male subjects, suggesting that the principal motivation of stalking is the disruption of an intimate relationship. Regarding domestic violence, females described the phenomenon from a different perspective, indicating verbal, physical, and sexual abuse, while males indicated only verbal abuse. Females tended to amplify, more than the males, depression, and state and trait anxiety. Even if all symptoms were expressed in both females and males, the males exhibited a lack of confidence in their bodies, and the emotional literacy made the expression of distress more difficult. At the same time, the expression of anxiety presented in the women permitted them to become progressively less victimized over time; depression and anxiety allow the recognition of these symptoms as signs of distress and to intervene to reduce them.

402,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of the treatment of emotional disorders in primary care: PsicAP clinical trial. Description of the sub-study design,"Introduction: In the primary care (PC) setting in Spain, the prevalence of emotional disorders (EDs) such as anxiety, depression and somatoform disorder is high. In PC patients, these disorders are not always managed in accordance with the recommendations provided by clinical practice guidelines, resulting in major direct and indirect economic costs and suboptimal treatment outcomes. The aim is to analyze and compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of group-based psychological therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: Multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 300 patients recruited from PC centers in Madrid, Spain, with symptoms or possible diagnosis of anxiety, mood (mild or moderate), or somatoform disorders. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: an experimental group, which will receive group-based transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy (TD-CBT); and a control group, which will receive TAU (mainly pharmacological interventions) prescribed by their general practitioner (GP). Clinical assessment will be performed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Direct and indirect costs will be calculated and relevant socio-demographic variables will be registered. The Spanish version of the EuroQol 5D-5L will be administered. Patients will be assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment finalization, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare TD-CBT to TAU in the PC setting in Spain. This is the first comparative economic evaluation of these two treatment approaches in PC. The strength of the study is that it is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of psychotherapy and TAU for EDs in PC.

403,EEG-based analysis of the emotional effect of music therapy on palliative care cancer patients,"Music is known to have the power to induce strong emotions. The present study assessed, based on Electroencephalography (EEG) data, the emotional response of terminally ill cancer patients to a music therapy intervention in a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 40 participants from the palliative care unit in the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona was randomly assigned to two groups of 20. The first group [experimental group (EG)] participated in a session of music therapy (MT), and the second group [control group (CG)] was provided with company. Based on our previous work on EEG-based emotion detection, instantaneous emotional indicators in the form of a coordinate in the arousal-valence plane were extracted from the participants’ EEG data. The emotional indicators were analyzed in order to quantify (1) the overall emotional effect of MT on the patients compared to controls, and (2) the relative effect of the different MT techniques applied during each session. During each MT session, five conditions were considered: I (initial patient’s state before MT starts), C1 (passive listening), C2 (active listening), R (relaxation), and F (final patient’s state). EEG data analysis showed a significant increase in valence ( p = 0.0004) and arousal ( p = 0.003) between I and F in the EG. No significant changes were found in the CG. This results can be interpreted as a positive emotional effect of MT in advanced cancer patients. In addition, according to pre- and post-intervention questionnaire responses, participants in the EG also showed a significant decrease in tiredness, anxiety and breathing difficulties, as well as an increase in levels of well-being. No equivalent changes were observed in the CG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
404,Functions of autobiographical memory in younger and older adults,"Functional approach to autobiographical memory (AM) posits its three broad functions: directive, self, and social. Although these functions are probably universal, life stage and gender variations are expected. This research builds on previous studies investigating the validity of Thinking About Life Experiences Questionnaire (TALE; Bluck and Alea, 2011). A sample of 365 adults (56% female, mean age 43.3 years), divided in 2 age cohorts (young: 18–45 years, old: 46–90 years), used TALE, to rate their tendency of using AM for three different purposes, and measures of self-concept clarity, attachment in close relationships and time perspective. Confirmatory factor analysis of TALE confirmed the tripartite model of AM functions and further analysis showed partial factorial equivalence across age and gender groups. Young tend to use AM more for directing future behavior and social-bonding, while no age differences were found in the use of AM to serve self-function. As for gender variations, women tend to use AM more for directing their behavior, while no other gender differences in the use of AM were found. TALE showed good internal consistency and convergent validity of the three subscales. The theory-driven hypotheses that individuals with low self-concept clarity would use AM more often to serve a self-function, those with higher levels of attachment anxiety would use AM more often to serve a social function, and those past-oriented would use memory more often for directive purpose, were all confirmed. Also confirmed was the notion of Past Negative Orientation to be more related to the directive use of AM than Past Positive Time Orientation. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

405,Child maltreatment is associated with a reduction of the oxytocin receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"Background: Child maltreatment (CM) and attachment experiences are closely linked to alterations in the human oxytocin (OXT) system. However, human data about oxytocin receptor (OXTR) protein levels are lacking. Therefore, we investigated oxytocin receptor (OXTR) protein levels in circulating immune cells and related them to circulating levels of OXT in peripheral blood. We hypothesized reduced OXTR protein levels, associated with both, experiences of CM and an insecure attachment representation. Methods: OXTR protein expressions were analyzed by western blot analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma OXT levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 49 mothers. We used the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to assess adverse childhood experiences. Attachment representations (secure vs. insecure) were classified using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) and levels of anxiety and depression were assessed with the German version of the Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale (HADS-D). Results: CM-affected women showed significantly lower OXTR protein expression with significantly negative correlations between the OXTR protein expression and the CTQ sum score, whereas plasma OXT levels showed no significant differences in association with CM. Lower OXTR protein expression in PBMC were particularly pronounced in the group of insecurely attached mothers compared to the securely attached group. Anxiety levels were significantly higher in CM-affected women. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a significant association between CM and an alteration of OXTR protein expression in human blood cells as a sign for chronic, long-lasting alterations in this attachment-related neurobiological system.

406,Efficacy of the Aussie Optimism Program: Promoting pro-social behavior and preventing suicidality in primary school students. A randomised-controlled trial,"The efficacy of an enhanced version of the Aussie Optimism Program (AOP) was investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Grade 6 students aged 10–11 years of age ( N = 2288) from 63 government primary schools in Perth, Western Australia, participated in the pre, post, and follow-up study. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: a significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up. No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders, and total difficulties were reported. These findings suggest that the AOP with teacher training along with coaching may have the potential to positively impact on suicidality and pro-social behavior in the pre-adolescent years.

407,Effects of an inquiry-based short intervention on state test anxiety in comparison to alternative coping strategies,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 9[2734] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record 2019-04327-001). In the original article, there was a mistake in Figure 1 and Figure 2 as published. The coefficients for the effects of the experimental intervention condition on thought related test anxiety were mistakenly reported as negative even though the coefficients for these effects are positive. The corrected Figure 1 and Figure 2 appear in the erratum. Because of the error mentioned above, a correction has been made to the Results, Model 1: Combined Analyses. A correction has also been made to the Results, Model 2: Differential Analyses. These corrections are explained in the erratum, and the original article has been updated.] Background and Objectives: Test anxiety can have undesirable consequences for learning and academic achievement. The control-value theory of achievement emotions assumes that test anxiety is experienced if a student appraises an achievement situation as important (value appraisal), but feels that the situation and its outcome are not fully under his or her control (control appraisal). Accordingly, modification of cognitive appraisals is assumed to reduce test anxiety. One method aiming at the modification of appraisals is inquiry-based stress reduction. In the present study ( N = 162), we assessed the effects of an inquiry-based short intervention on test anxiety. Design: Short-term longitudinal, randomized control trial. Methods: Focusing on an individual worry thought, 53 university students received an inquiry-based short intervention. Control participants reflected on their worry thought ( n = 55) or were distracted ( n = 52). Thought related test anxiety was assessed before, immediately after, and 2 days after the experimental treatment. Results: After the intervention as well as 2 days later, individuals who had received the inquiry-based intervention demonstrated significantly lower test anxiety than participants from the pooled control groups. Further analyses showed that the inquiry-based short intervention was more effective than reflecting on a worry thought but had no advantage over distraction. Conclusions: Our findings provide first experimental evidence for the effectiveness of an inquiry-based short intervention in reducing students’ test anxiety.

408,"“The less I think about it, the better I feel”: A thematic analysis of the subjective experience of malignant mesothelioma patients and their caregivers","Aim: A cancer diagnosis—and in particular a Malignant Mesothelioma (MM) one—breaks the somatopsychic balance of the individual, compromising the quality of residual life and giving rise to many negative emotions difficult to integrate and to elaborate (such as depression, fears, anxieties, hopelessness, guilt, shame, and rage). Several national and international guidelines acknowledged the importance of evaluating psychological and socio-relational features in MM patients and their caregiver. However, only few studies have investigated the subjective experience of MM patients and even less research has focused on the caregivers' experience. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the lived experience of both MM patients and their caregivers, providing an in-depth comprehension of the psychological sequelae of the disease. Materials and Methods: Within a psychoanalytically-informed conceptual framework, open-ended interviews were conducted with 10 MM patients and 9 caregivers. Thematic analysis was employed: interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded in order to identify the main recurring themes across the narratives. Results: We detected four different themes: (1) bodily symptoms and embodied emotions; (2) living in or near a National Priority Contaminated Site (NCPS); (3) “nothing is like it was” (that is, the impact of the diagnosis on everyday life, the changes it causes in the family relationships, the things that are still possible to do, the mourning process); (4) “what will become of us?” (that is, worries about the impact of the diagnosis on the beloved ones, death and legacy). Discussion: MM patients and caregivers seem to be stuck in a concrete mental functioning focused on symptoms and they find it difficult to openly think and talk about the affective and emotional consequences of the diagnosis. Alongside this, they express the need to find new and less conflictual ways to stay together and talk to each other during the period of active treatments for the illness (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc) and the end-of-life. The results of this study have important implications for the clinical management of MM and can help develop multi-professional specialist interventions addressed to both patients and caregivers.

409,The moderating effect of self-reported state and trait anxiety on the late positive potential to emotional faces in 6–11-year-old children,"Introduction: The emergence of anxiety during childhood is accompanied by the development of attentional biases to threat. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these biases are poorly understood. In addition, previous research has not examined whether state and trait anxiety are independently associated with threat-related biases. Methods: We compared ERP waveforms during the processing of emotional faces in a population sample of 58 6–11-year-olds who completed self-reported measures of trait and state anxiety and depression. Results: The results showed that the P1 was larger to angry than neutral faces in the left hemisphere, though early components (P1, N170) were not strongly associated with child anxiety or depression. In contrast, Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes to angry (vs. neutral) faces were significantly and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression. In addition, the difference between LPPs for angry (vs. neutral) faces was independently associated with state and trait anxiety symptoms. Discussion: The results showed that neural responses to facial emotion in children with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were most evident at later processing stages characterized as evaluative and effortful. The findings support cognitive models of threat perception in anxiety and indicate that trait elements of anxiety and more transitory fluctuations in anxious affect are important in understanding individual variation in the neural response to threat in late childhood.

410,"The wellbeing of Italian peacekeeper military: Psychological resources, quality of life and internalizing symptoms","Working as a peacekeeper is associated with the exposure to acute and/or catastrophic events and chronic stressors. Hence, the meager literature about peacekeepers’ wellbeing has mainly analyzed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This study aims to deep the analysis of the wellbeing of peacekeepers military. Based on the few studies on this population, we hypothesized that Italian peacekeeper military officers and enlisted men ( n = 167; 103 males, 6 females, 58 missing) exhibit lower levels of internalizing symptoms (i.e., PTSD, depression, general anxiety, obsessions, and somatization) as compared to a control group ( n = 60; 32 males, 28 females). Moreover, we hypothesized that peacekeepers have higher levels of psychological resources (i.e., self-efficacy, self-esteem, social support) and quality of life (i.e., higher life satisfaction and lower general stress). We compared the groups by means of MANOVAs on the subscales of the Psychological Treatment Inventory (PTI; Gori et al., 2015). We found that Italian peacekeepers have lower internalizing symptoms and higher levels of self-efficacy and self-esteem than the control group; however, no statistically significant differences were observed on perceived social support. Finally, peacekeepers have a higher quality of life: scores reflect higher life satisfaction and lower distress than the control group. This study is in line with previous literature supporting the claim that Italian peacekeeper military officers have sufficient psychological resources for coping with the stressful situations implied in peacekeeping missions. Future studies should deepen the analysis of the military’s psychological characteristics by comparing war veterans and peacekeeper military.

411,Childhood adversity and the creative experience in adult professional performing artists,"Childhood adversity is identified as any exposure to abuse, neglect or family dysfunction. Greater exposure to childhood adversity has been strongly identified with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine differences in creative experiences, fantasy proneness, dispositional flow, exposure to adult traumatic events, and psychopathology (internalized shame, trait anxiety), amongst professional performing artists who experienced no childhood adversity, some adversity, or substantial adversity. This cross-section IRB approved study examined 234 professional performers (dancers, opera singers, actors, directors, musicians). Self-report measurements were included to examine the following psychological factors: adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), experience of creativity questionnaire, dispositional flow, trait anxiety, internalized shame, fantasy, and total adult and childhood traumatic events. The sample was divided into three groups based on ACE scores: 0 ACE ( n = 93), 1–3 ACEs ( n = 95), ≥ 4 ACEs ( n = 42). The MANCOVA (with age and gender as covariates) results revealed no significant ( p = 0.280) differences between all three ACE groups for the nine flow scales (optimal performance measurements). Performing artists with ≥ 4 ACEs had significantly stronger creative experiences ( p = 0.006) related to distinct creative processing, absorption, and a transformational sense of self and the world. They were also more fantasy prone, shame-based, anxious, and experienced more cumulative past traumatic events ( p &lt; 0.001). Although the high ACE group experienced greater negative effects, they also endorsed positive creative performance experiences.

412,Development and preliminary validation of the Salzburg Emotional Eating Scale,"Existing self-report questionnaires for the assessment of emotional eating do not differentiate between specific types of emotions and between increased or decreased food intake in response to these emotions. Therefore, we developed a new measure of emotional eating—the Salzburg Emotional Eating Scale (SEES)—for which higher scores indicate eating more than usual in response to emotions and lower scores indicate eating less than usual in response to emotions. In study 1, a pool of items describing 40 emotional states was used. Factor analysis yielded four factors, which represented both positive ( happiness subscale) and negative emotions ( sadness , anger , and anxiety subscales). Subsequently, the scale was reduced to 20 items (5 items for each subscale) and its four-factor structure was replicated in studies 2 and 3. In all three studies, internal consistencies of each subscale were α &gt; 0.70 and mean subscale scores significantly differed from each other such that individuals reported the strongest tendency to eat more than usual when being sad and the strongest tendency to eat less than usual when being anxious (sadness &gt; happiness &gt; anger &gt; anxiety). Higher scores on the happiness subscale related to lower scores on the negative emotions subscales, lower body mass index (BMI), and lower eating pathology. In contrast, higher scores on the negative emotions subscales related to lower scores on the happiness subscale, higher BMI, and higher eating pathology. The SEES represents a useful measure for the investigation of emotional eating by increasing both specificity (differentiation between specific emotional states) and breadth (differentiation between increase and decrease of food intake) in the assessment of the emotion–eating relationship.

413,"Effects of relaxing and arousing music during imagery training on dart-throwing performance, physiological arousal indices, and competitive state anxiety","Music that is carefully selected to match the requirements of activities and the characteristics of individuals has been shown to produce significant impacts on performance enhancement (Priest et al., 2004). There is also evidence that music can enhance imagery (Grocke and Wigram, 2007), although few studies have investigated the effects of music on imagery in the context of sport skills. In the present study, the effects of relaxing and arousing music during imagery on dart-throwing performance, physiological arousal indices, and competitive state anxiety, were investigated among 63 novice dart throwers. Participants had moderate-to-high imagery ability and were randomly assigned to unfamiliar relaxing music (URM), unfamiliar arousing music (UAM), or no music (NM) groups. Performance was assessed by 40 dart throws at a concentric circles dartboard before and after 12 imagery sessions over 4 weeks. Measures of galvanic skin response (GSR), peripheral temperature (PT), and heart rate (HR) were taken during imagery sessions 1 and 12, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 Revised (CSAI-2R) was administered prior to the pre- and post-intervention performance task. Dart-throwing gain scores were significantly higher for URM than for UAM and NM, with no significant difference between UAM and NM (URM = 37.24 ± 5.66, UAM = 17.57 ± 5.30, and NM = 13.19 ± 6.14, F 2,62 = 5.03, p = 0.01, η² = 0.14). GSR, PT, and HR reflected lower arousal for URM than for UAM or NM. Significant decreases in somatic anxiety were evident for URM and UAM but not NM. Significant decreases in cognitive anxiety were evident for URM and NM but not UAM. Significant increases in self-confidence were evident for URM but not UAM or NM. Performance improved in all three conditions but URM was associated with the largest performance gain, the lowest physiological indices of arousal, and the most positive CSAI-2R profiles. Listening to relaxing music during imagery may have benefits for performance in other fine motor skills.

414,Headache and alexithymia in children and adolescents: What is the connection?,"Background: Headache is one of the most common complaints in children and adolescents and comorbidity rates are very high and the major associated diseases are depression, anxiety, atopic disorders, sleep, and behavioral disorders. In recent years, it has been highlighted that difficulties regulating emotions such as alexithymia have also been associated with diagnosis of somatization. Methods: We carried out a mini review analyzing the relation between alexithymia and primary headache (e.g., migraine and tension type headache) in children and adolescents by synthesizing the relevant studies in the literature on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Search terms were “alexithymia” combined with the “primary headache,” “migraine,” “tension type headache,” “children,” and “adolescents.” Results: All analyzed studies found higher levels of alexithymia in children and adolescents with headache than control groups but there are different opinions about the relationship between headache and alexithymia. For example, some studies suggest that the association between headache and alexithymia in children may be due to an incomplete development of emotive competency or a general immature cognitive development, instead other studies found a correlation between headache symptoms, insecure attachment, and alexithymia. There seems to be also differences between children with migraine compared to those with tension type headache (TTH). Conclusion: There are some studies on adults suffering from headache or migraine and alexithymia, but there is only a moderate amount of research on pediatric age with different opinions and theories about this relationship. Further studies on children and adolescents are necessary to effectively understand this relationship and to help children to reduce headache and improve emotional consciousness.

The purpose of the study was the validation of the Italian version of Tinnitus Questionnaire 12 item short form (TQ 12-I) as a brief test for the assessment of patient reported tinnitus-related distress. Design: Cross-sectional multicenter questionnaire study. Setting: Tinnitus Center, European Hospital (Rome), the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, “Guglielmo da Saliceto” Hospital (Piacenza), and the Department of Audiology and Phoniatry, “Mater Domini” University Hospital (Catanzaro). Participants: One hundred and forty-three outpatients with tinnitus treated at one of the participating medical centers. Main Outcome Measures: Tinnitus Questionnaire Short Form (TQ 12-I), compared to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey. Results: Our factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution (health anxiety, cognitive distress), accounting for 53.5% of the variance. Good internal consistency for the total score (α = 0.86) and both factors (α = 0.79–0.87) was found. Moderate correlations with the THI ( r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.001) indicated good convergent validity. Tinnitus distress was further correlated to increased psychological distress ( r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001) and reduced emotional well-being ( r = -0.34, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The study clearly showed that the TQ 12-I is a reliable and valid instrument to assess tinnitus-related distress which can be used in clinical practice as well as for research.

416,Taekwondo fighting in training does not simulate the affective and cognitive demands of competition: Implications for behavior and transfer,"Enhancing practice design is critical to facilitate transfer of learning. Considerable research has focused on the role of perceptual information in practice simulation, yet has neglected how affect and cognition are shaped by practice environments and whether this influences the fidelity of behavior (Headrick et al., 2015). This study filled this gap by examining the fidelity of individual (cognition, affect, and actions) and interpersonal behavior of 10 highly skilled Australian Taekwondo athletes fighting in training compared to competition. Interpersonal behavior was assessed by tracking location coordinates to analyze distance-time coordination tendencies of the fighter–fighter system. Individual actions were assessed through notational analysis and approximate entropy calculations of coordinate data to quantify the (un)predictability of movement displacement. Affect and cognition were assessed with mixed-methods that included perceptual scales measuring anxiety, arousal, and mental effort, and post-fight video-facilitated confrontational interviews to explore how affect and cognitions might differ. Quantitative differences were assessed with mixed models and dependent t-tests. Results reveal that individual and interpersonal behavior differed between training and competition. In training, individuals attacked less ( d = 0.81, p &lt; 0.05), initiated attacks from further away ( d = -0.20, p &lt; 0.05) and displayed more predictable movement trajectories ( d = 0.84, p &lt; 0.05). In training, fighters had lower anxiety ( d = -1.26, p &lt; 0.05), arousal ( d = -1.07, p &lt; 0.05), and mental effort ( d = -0.77, p &lt; 0.05). These results were accompanied by changes in interpersonal behavior, with larger interpersonal distances generated by the fighter–fighter system in training ( d = 0.80, p &lt; 0.05). Qualitative data revealed the emergence of cognitions and affect specific to the training environment, such as reductions in pressure, arousal, and mental challenge. Findings highlight the specificity of performer–environment interactions. Fighting in training affords reduced affective and cognitive demands and a decrease in action fidelity compared to competition. In addition to sampling information, representative practice needs to consider modeling the cognitions and affect of competition to enhance transfer.

417,When did coloring books become mindful? Exploring the effectiveness of a novel method of mindfulness-guided instructions for coloring books to increase mindfulness and decrease anxiety,"Mindfulness has been associated with the use of coloring books for adults; however, the question of whether they do increase mindfulness has not been addressed. In two studies, we attempted to identify whether mindfulness is increased, and whether there is a need for ongoing guidance while coloring, similar to mindfulness meditation. In the first randomized controlled experiment, university students ( n = 88) were assigned to an unguided mandala coloring group (i.e., described in mainstream literature as a mindfulness practice) or to a free-drawing group. Measurements of state mindfulness and state anxiety were taken pre- and post- experiment. Results indicated no change in mindfulness or anxiety. In the second randomized controlled experiment, university students ( n = 72) were assigned to an unguided mandala coloring group (i.e., same as Experiment 1), or, to a mindfulness-guided coloring group (i.e., same as the unguided coloring group with a mindfulness practitioner guiding participants as in mindfulness breathing meditation, with instructions modified and applied to coloring). Results indicated that the mindfulness-guided mandala coloring group performed better in decreasing anxiety, but no change was observed in mindfulness. Exit interviews revealed that some participants did not like the voice guiding them while coloring, which suggested further differing and significant findings. While mindfulness-guided coloring appears promising, guidance or instructions on how to color mindfully may require further development and adjustment to enhance health and wellbeing.

Therefore, in order to identify these factors and their impact on mental health, the present study compares the PSS-4 results among three European countries (Great Britain, France and Spain). This study focuses on PSS-4 results within a Spanish sample to determine: (1) normative data, reliability and validity of PSS-4 in a Spanish sample and (2) how stress perception changes depending on cultural and social factors. Methods: The data were obtained from a website representing a service of a smoking cessation program, the study represented a service that was open to all individuals. The number of participants were 37,451. They reported their age, gender, nationality, marital status, education and employment status, and completed two psychological questionnaires (PPS-4 and the anxiety and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, SCL 90-R). Results: The PSS-4 scores could differentiate between relevant sociodemographic variables (such as sex, age, nationality, marital status, education, parental status, employment status, and income class). The PSS-4 scores showed a positive correlation with the SCL 90-R anxiety and depression scales. The normed values for interpreting the PSS-4 scores are presented. The PSS-4 showed adequate internal consistency and reliability. Conclusions: The PSS-4 is a useful instrument for assessing stress perception levels in the general population in different countries. Its internal consistency is sufficient for a 4-item scale.

419,“It's your problem. Deal with it.” Performers' experiences of psychological challenges in music,"Musicians need to deal with a range of challenges during their performance career and in response to these have reported a number of conditions that impact on their performance. Although social support from peers and teachers has been identified as part of the process of dealing with these challenges, little is understood about musicians' coping methods, beliefs and their attitudes toward support. Therefore, this study aimed to explore (a) performers' previous experiences of psychological challenges, (b) the types of support they used and, (c) how this might inform future support programs in learning environments. Fifteen interviews were conducted with pre-elite ( n = 5) transitioning elite ( n = 3) and established elite performers ( n = 7) in order to elicit data on psychological challenges, coping, beliefs and preferences for support. Inductive content analysis suggested that elite performers in this sample reported positive health habits, philosophical views of performance, health and life, positive anxiety reappraisal, and use of various psychological strategies, albeit without being explicitly aware of it. The need for various professional skills (e.g., communication, business, self-management, and organizational skills) was emphasized by all participants. Transition into conservatoire was marked by severe psychological challenges, disorders and trauma. Primary sources of support included friends, family and self-help literature. Professional help was predominantly sought for physical problems. The impact of teachers was paramount, yet securing good teachers was considered a matter of “luck.” The most negative aspects recounted included abusive teachers, unsupportive environments, social comparison, competition, and disillusionment after entering the profession. Participants believed that talent could be developed and also valued wellbeing in relation to performance. Positive effects of late specialization on social development and professional skills were also mentioned. Implications and suggestions are discussed.

420,The experience of couples in the process of treatment of pathological gambling: Couple vs. Individual therapy,"Context: Couple treatment for pathological gambling is an innovative strategy. There are some results supporting its potential effectiveness, but little is known about the subjective experiences of the participants. Objective: The aim of this article is to document the experiences of gamblers and their partners participating in one of two treatments, namely individual or couple. Method: In a study aiming to evaluate the efficacy of the Integrative Couple Treatment for Pathological Gambling (ICT-PG), couples who were entering specialized treatment for the addiction of one member who was a pathological gambler were randomly assigned to individual or ICT-PG. Nine months after their admission to treatment, gamblers and partners ( n = 21 couples; n = 13 ICT-PG; n = 8 individual treatment) were interviewed in semi-structured interviews. A sequenced thematization method was used to extract the major themes. Results: This study highlighted five major themes in the therapeutic process noted by the gamblers and their partners mainly after the couple treatment but also partly through the individual therapy. These were: (1) the gamblers' anxiety about having to reveal their gambling problems in couple therapy; (2) the wish to develop a mutually beneficial understanding of gambling and its effects on the partners in the two types of treatments; (3) the transformation of negative attributions through a more effective intra-couple communication fostered by the couple therapy; (4) the partners' contribution to changes in gambling behavior and prevention of relapses, which were both better supported in couple therapy; and (5) the interpersonal nature of gambling and its connections with the couples' relationship. However, gamblers who were in individual treatment were more likely to mention that their partners' involvement was not necessary. Participants likewise made a few recommendations about the conditions underlying the choice of one treatment method or the other. Discussion: Participants reported satisfaction with both treatment models, but their experience was more positive in couple treatment. Complementary benefits emerged from each form of treatment, which points to future treatments involving both types. Future research should explore both the couple processes associated with attempts to stop pathological gambling and the various ways of involving partners in the gamblers' treatment.

421,Types of anxiety and depression: Theoretical assumptions and development of the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire,"The present paper is addressed to (1) the validation of a recently proposed typology of anxiety and depression, and (2) the presentation of a new tool—the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (ADQ)—based on this typology. Empirical data collected across two stages—construction and validation—allowed us to offer the final form of the ADQ, designed to measure arousal anxiety, apprehension anxiety, valence depression, anhedonic depression, and mixed types of anxiety and depression. The results support the proposed typology of anxiety and depression and provide evidence that the ADQ is a reliable and valid self-rating measure of affective types, and accordingly its use in scientific research is recommended.

422,Association between social anxiety and visual mental imagery of neutral scenes: The moderating role of effortful control,"According to cognitive theories, verbal processing attenuates emotional processing, whereas visual imagery enhances emotional processing and contributes to the maintenance of social anxiety. Individuals with social anxiety report negative mental images in social situations. However, the general ability of visual mental imagery of neutral scenes in individuals with social anxiety is still unclear. The present study investigated the general ability of non-emotional mental imagery (vividness, preferences for imagery vs. verbal processing, and object or spatial imagery) and the moderating role of effortful control in attenuating social anxiety. The participants ( N = 231) completed five questionnaires. The results showed that social anxiety was not necessarily associated with all aspects of mental imagery. As suggested by theories, social anxiety was not associated with a preference for verbal processing. However, social anxiety was positively correlated with the visual imagery scale, especially the object imagery scale, which concerns the ability to construct pictorial images of individual objects. Further, it was negatively correlated with the spatial imagery scale, which concerns the ability to process information about spatial relations between objects. Although object imagery and spatial imagery positively and negatively predicted the degree of social anxiety, respectively, these effects were attenuated when socially anxious individuals had high effortful control. Specifically, in individuals with high effortful control, both object and spatial imagery were not associated with social anxiety. Socially anxious individuals might prefer to construct pictorial images of individual objects in natural scenes through object imagery. However, even in individuals who exhibit these features of mental imagery, effortful control could inhibit the increase in social anxiety.

423,EMDR as add-on treatment for psychiatric and traumatic symptoms in patients with substance use disorder,"Background: Substance use disorders (SUD) are patterns of substance use leading to severe impairment on social, working and economic levels. In vivo and clinical findings have enhanced the role of the brain's stress-related system in maintaining SUD behaviors. Several studies have also revealed a high prevalence of post-traumatic symptoms among SUD patients, suggesting that a trauma-informed treatment approach could lead to better treatment outcomes. However, only few studies have evaluated the use of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) in SUD without consistent results. The aim of the present pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a combined trauma-focused (TF) and addiction-focused (AF) EMDR intervention in treating post-traumatic and stress-related symptoms of patients with SUD. Methods: Forty patients with different SUD were enrolled in the study. Twenty patients underwent treatment as usual (TAU), the other 20 patients were treated with TAU plus 24 weekly sessions of EMDR. All patients were assessed before and after intervention for several psychological dimensions using specific tools (i.e., BDI-II, DES, IES-R, STAI, and SCL-90-GSI). A repeated measure MANOVA was performed to evaluate both between groups (TAU + EMDR vs. TAU) and within group (pre- vs. post-intervention) effects and interactions. A secondary outcome was the dichotomous variable yielded by the urine drug testing immunoassay (yes/no). Results: The RM-MANOVA revealed both a significant pre–post main effect ( p &lt; 0.001), and a significant group-by-time main effect ( p &lt; 0.001). Significant improvements on IES-R, DES, and SCL-90-GSI scales were shown in both groups according to time effects ( p &lt; 0.05). However, significant greater effects were found for TAU + EMDR group than TAU group. No differences were found between TAU and TAU + EMDR groups in terms of urine drug immunoassay results before and after the interventions. Conclusions: The TAU + EMDR group showed a significant improvement of post-traumatic and dissociative symptoms, accompanied by a reduction in anxiety and overall psychopathology levels, whereas TAU group showed a significant reduction only in post-traumatic symptoms. Although our results can only be considered preliminary, this study suggests that a combined TF- and AF- EMDR protocol is an effective and well-accepted add-on treatment for patients with SUD.

424,Temporal courses in EEG theta and alpha activity in the dynamic health qigong techniques Wu Qin Xi and Liu Zi Jue,"Health Qigong is a common technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine applied to strengthen mental and physical health. Several studies report increases in EEG theta and alpha activity after meditative Qigong techniques indicating a relaxed state of mind. To date, little is known on the effects of dynamic Health Qigong techniques that comprise bodily movements on brain activity. In the current study, we compared effects of two dynamic Health Qigong techniques on EEG brain activity. Subjects performed the techniques Wu Qin Xi (five animals play) and Liu Zi Jue (six healing sounds) in a within-subjects design. Eyes-open and eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded before and immediately after each 15-min practice block. Additionally, the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire was administered at pretest, and after each 15-min practice block. Results show a decrease in alpha activity after 15 min, followed by an increase after 30 min in the Health Qigong technique Liu Zi Jue . Theta activity was decreased after 15 min, followed by an increase after 30 min in the technique Wu Qin Xi. Results of the POMS indicated an increased vigor-activity level with decreased fatigue and tension-anxiety levels in both techniques after 30 min of practice. Our results demonstrate different temporal dynamics in EEG theta and alpha activity for the Health Qigong techniques Wu Qin Xi and Liu Zi Jue. We hypothesize that the found brain activation patterns result from different attentional focusing styles and breathing techniques performed during the investigated Health Qigong techniques.

439,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Precursor in the Hippocampus Regulates Both Depressive and Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Rats.,"Depression and anxiety are two affective disorders that greatly threaten the mental health of a large population worldwide. Previous studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (proBDNF) is involved in the development of depression. However, it is still elusive whether proBDNF is involved in anxiety, and if so, which brain regions of proBDNF regulate these two affective disorders. The present study aims to investigate the role of proBDNF in the hippocampus in the development of depression and anxiety. Rat models of an anxiety-like phenotype and depression-like phenotype were established by complete Freund's adjuvant intra-plantar injection and chronic restraint stress, respectively. Both rat models developed anxiety-like behaviors as determined by the open field test and elevated plus maze test. However, only rats with depression-like phenotype displayed the lower sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference test and a longer immobility time in the forced swimming test. Sholl analysis showed that the dendritic arborization of granule cells in the hippocampus was decreased in rats with depression-like phenotype but was not changed in rats with anxiety-like phenotype. In addition, synaptophysin was downregulated in the rats with depression-like phenotype but upregulated in the rats with anxiety-like phenotype. In both models, proBDNF was greatly increased in the hippocampus. Intra-hippocampal injection anti-proBDNF antibody greatly ameliorated the anxiety-like and depressive behaviors in the rats. These findings suggest that despite some behavioral and morphological differences between depression and anxiety, hippocampal proBDNF is a common mediator to regulate these two mental disorders.",2229093581.0, Journal Article,2018
440,A Review of Personality-Targeted Interventions for Prevention of Substance Misuse and Related Harm in Community Samples of Adolescents.,"Several school-based prevention programmes have been developed and used to prevent, delay, or reduce substance misuse, and related problems among community samples of adolescents. However, findings indicate that many of these interventions are associated with null, small, or mixed effects in reducing adolescent substance misuse, in particular for those mostly at risk of transitioning to substance use disorders. These findings highlight the need to shift the focus of substance use prevention efforts toward intervention strategies which directly target high-risk adolescents. The Preventure programme was designed to target four personality risk factors for substance misuse: hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. This article reviews findings from the previous trials of personality-targeted interventions (i.e., Preventure programme) with adolescents and discuss the promises and benefits of these interventions for targeting community samples of high-risk adolescents at school level for reducing substance misuse and related mental health problems. Findings indicated that this programme has been successful in reducing the rates of alcohol and illicit drug use and substance-related harms by ~50% in high-risk adolescents with the effects last for up to 3 years. These interventions were also associated with a 25% reduction in likelihood of transitioning to mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and conduct problems. The programme is particularly beneficial for youth with more significant risk profiles, such as youth reporting clinically significant levels of externalizing problems, and victimized adolescents. A key strength of the Preventure programme is that it is embedded in the community and provides substance use intervention at school level to the general samples of high-risk adolescents who might not otherwise have access to those programmes.",2229082383.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
441,Psychophysiological Arousal and Auditory Sensitivity in a Cross-Clinical Sample of Autistic and Non-autistic Anxious Adults.,"Many autistic people report overwhelming sensory experiences and also elevated levels of anxiety. Understanding how these experiences are linked to each other can contribute to improved support and intervention for reducing sensory overload and anxiety. This study included 95 young adult participants including autistic adults, non-autistic adults reporting to a psychotherapy clinic with high levels of anxiety, and neurotypical adults with no psychiatric concerns. We measured pupil size using including a baseline task with no auditory stimulus followed by two blocks of simple auditory habituation. In a subset of 80 participants we also measured self-report levels of sensory processing, anxious apprehension, and intolerance of uncertainty. The autism group showed atypical sensory processing on all four measured domains of the Adolescent and Adult Sensory Profile including sensory sensitivity, sensory seeking, sensory avoidance, and low registration subscales. Dimensional analyses across all participants showed significant positive correlations between sensory sensitivity, sensory seeking, and sensory avoidance domains with scores from the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Short Form and Penn State Worry Questionnaire. The autism group showed significantly larger pupil size than other groups at baseline, before any auditory stimulation. There were no group differences in the rate of auditory habituation, nonetheless the overall, absolute larger pupil size remained in the autism group throughout the experiment. We suggest that this and other findings could indicate chronic hyperarousal in many autistic people. Treatment for anxiety in autism should be informed by knowledge of unique aspects of anxiety in autism and consider the role of sensory experience and everyday psychophysiological arousal.",2183648711.0, Journal Article,2018
442,Resting State Functional Connectivity of Dorsal Raphe Nucleus and Ventral Tegmental Area in Medication-Free Young Adults With Major Depression.,"Background: This study has, for the first time, investigated the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) resting state whole-brain functional connectivity in medication-free young adults with major depression (MDD), at baseline and in relationship to treatment response. Method: A total of 119 subjects: 78 MDD (24 ± 4 years.) and 41 Healthy Controls (HC) (24 ± 3 years) were included in the analysis. DRN and VTA ROIs anatomical templates were used to extract resting state fluctuations and used to derive whole-brain functional connectivity. Differences between MDD and HCs were examined, as well as the correlation of baseline Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scale scores to the baseline DRN and VTA connectivity. The relationship to treatment response was examined by investigating the correlation of the percentage decrease in depression and anxiety scale scores with baseline connectivity measures. Results: There was a significant decrease (p = 0.05; cluster-wise corrected) in DRN connectivity with the prefrontal and mid-cingulate cortex in the MDD group, compared with the HC group. DRN connectivity with temporal areas, including the hippocampus and amygdala, positively correlated with baseline depression scores (p = 0.05; cluster-wise corrected). VTA connectivity with the cuneus-occipital areas correlated with a change in depression scores (p = 0.05; cluster-wise corrected). Conclusion: Our results indicate the presence of DRN-prefrontal and DRN-cingulate cortex connectivity abnormalities in young medication-free depressed subjects when compared to HCs and that the severity of depressive symptoms correlates with DRN-amygdala/hippocampus connectivity. VTA connectivity with the parietal and occipital areas is related to antidepressant treatment associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms. Future studies need to be carried out in larger and different age group populations to confirm the findings of the study.",2183648015.0, Journal Article,2018
443,An Investigation on the Clinical Features and Neurochemical Changes in Parkinson's Disease With Depression.,"Objective: To investigate the clinical features and neurochemical changes in Parkinson's disease with depression (PD-D). Methods: A total of 478 PD patients were divided into PD-D and PD patients without depression (PD-ND) groups according to the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. Demographic variables, motor and non-motor symptoms and activities of daily living were evaluated. The independent influencing factors of PD-D were investigated via binary logistic regression analysis. The levels of neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured and their correlations with HAMD score were analyzed. Results: The proportion of PD-D was 59.0%, of which 76.95, 20.92, and 2.13% had mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. Anxiety/somatization was the most prevalent sub-factor of HAMD in PD-D. The scores of UPDRS III, postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) type and the scores of 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and 14-item Chalder Fatigue Scale (FS) were independently associated with PD-D. The levels of dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were all significantly reduced in PD-D group compared with those in PD-ND group. HAMD scores were negatively correlated with the DA levels in CSF. Conclusions: PD patients have a high proportion of depression, mainly of mild and moderate levels. The profile of depression in PD population is subtly different from that of the general population. Motor symptoms, PIGD type, anxiety and fatigue are the significant influencing factors of PD-D. Compared to 5-HT, DA may play a more important role in PD-D.",2179535803.0, Journal Article,2018
444,Personality Profile and Clinical Correlates of Patients With Substance Use Disorder With and Without Comorbid Depression Under Treatment.,"Background: Among patients with substance use disorder (SUD), major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent. Even though, personality plays an important role in treatment outcomes for individuals with SUD and SUD + MDD, few studies have explored personality characteristics in these samples. This study aims to describe personality for patients with SUD taking into account the comorbid MDD, using the Alternative Five Factor Model (AFFM). We also aim to compare SUD + MDD patients with population norms and to elucidate possible personality clinical correlates. Methods: For our study, 116 male patients undergoing for SUD treatment were divided in two groups: SUD only (N = 58) and SUD + MDD (N = 58). To examine personality, we used the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire and multiple analyses of covariance were performed to identify differences. In a first analysis, age was introduced as a covariate whereas in a second analysis the continuous variables that showed to have a discriminant value for the groups were added as covariates. Variables predicting the presence of dual diagnosis and personality clinical correlates were analyzed by logistic and linear regression models, respectively. We observed that patients with SUD + MDD show distinctive personality characteristics compared with patients with SUD only and population norms. Results: According to the AFFM, SUD + MDD patients are characterized by higher Neuroticism-Anxiety (positively associated to depressive symptoms) and Impulsivity; and by lower Parties and Friends. Moreover, the probability of having a dual depressive disorder was represented by the amount of medications and substances used. The preference for hard work and the energy self-reported levels (Work Activity trait) are linked to these clinical variables rather than to the presence/absence of a dual depressive disorder. Conclusions: Even when controlling clinical variables related to a higher probability of having a dual depressive disorder, the Neuroticism-Anxiety is a personality trait that strongly differentiates between SUD only and SUD + MDD patients. Further investigation is needed to explore the role of this personality trait as endophenotype in dual depressive men. Our results underline the importance of a dimensional understanding of personality and its clinical correlates among patients with SUD + MDD; this approach could provide us information on specific treatment strategies to improve the prognosis of patients.",2179437125.0, Journal Article,2018
445,Sex Differences in Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Peptide Receptor-Mediated Pain and Anxiety Symptoms in a Preclinical Model of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.,"Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is a neuropeptide that modulates pain transmission, learning/memory, stress, anxiety, and fear responses via activation of the N/OFQ peptide (NOP or ORL1) receptor. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that may arise after exposure to a traumatic or fearful event, and often is co-morbid with chronic pain. Using an established animal model of PTSD, single-prolonged stress (SPS), we were the first to report that NOP receptor antagonist treatment reversed traumatic stress-induced allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and anxiety-like behaviors in male Sprague-Dawley rats. NOP antagonist treatment also reversed SPS-induced serum and CSF N/OFQ increase and circulating corticosterone decrease. The objective of this study was to examine the role of the NOP receptor in male and female rats subjected to traumatic stress using Wistar wild type (WT) and NOP receptor knockout (KO) rats. The severity of co-morbid allodynia was assessed as change in paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to von Frey and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to radiant heat stimuli, respectively. PWT and PWL decreased in male and female WT rats within 7 days after SPS, and remained decreased through day 28. Baseline sensitivity did not differ between genotypes. However, while male NOP receptor KO rats were protected from SPS-induced allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity, female NOP receptor KO rats exhibited tactile allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity to the same extent as WT rats. Male NOP receptor KO rats had a lower anxiety index (AI) than WT, but SPS did not increase AI in WT males. In contrast, SPS significantly increased AI in WT and NOP receptor KO female rats. SPS increased circulating N/OFQ levels in male WT, but not in male NOP receptor KO, or WT or KO female rats. These results indicate that the absence of the NOP receptor protects males from traumatic-stress-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia, consistent with our previous findings utilizing a NOP receptor antagonist. However, female NOP receptor KO rats experience allodynia, hyperalgesia and anxiety-like symptoms to the same extent as WT females following SPS. This suggests that endogenous N/OFQ-NOP receptor signaling plays an important, but distinct, role in males and females following exposure to traumatic stress.",2179423038.0, Journal Article,2018
446,The Effect of Insomnia on Cortical Excitability in Patients With Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,"The high rate of comorbidity between insomnia and anxiety disorders have been confirmed by previous studies. However, the underlying neurobiological correlates of the relationship between insomnia and anxiety disorders are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of insomnia on cortical excitability in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by examining the recovery functions of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in patients with GAD without insomnia and patients with GAD comorbid with insomnia. We studied the recovery functions of median nerve SEPs in 12 medication-naive patients with GAD without insomnia, 15 medication-naive patients with GAD comorbid with insomnia, and 15 age and sex matched healthy controls. SEPs in response to single stimulus and paired stimuli at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20, 60, 100, and 150 ms were recorded. The recovery function of the P25 component showed significantly reduced suppression in patients with GAD without insomnia as compared to patients with GAD comorbid with insomnia and healthy controls. There were no significant differences in the recovery functions of median nerve SEPs between patients with GAD comorbid with insomnia and healthy controls. The present study suggested that the cortical excitability of right parietal cortex increased in patients with GAD without insomnia, and cortical excitability in patients with GAD comorbid with insomnia was modulated by insomnia. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying neurobiological correlates of the effects of insomnia on GAD, which could ultimately be used to inform clinical intervention.",2179420234.0, Journal Article,2018
447,An Improved Model of Physical and Emotional Social Defeat: Different Effects on Social Behavior and Body Weight of Adolescent Mice by Interaction With Social Support.,"Social stress is a prevalent etiological environmental factor that can affect health, especially during adolescence. Either experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event during adolescence can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD. The present study attempted to establish an improved social stress model to better distinguish the effects of physical and emotional social stress on the behavior and physiology of adolescent mice. In addition, we investigated how social support affected these stress-induced changes in social behavior. On PND 28, male littermates were exposed to either physical stress (PS) or emotional stress (ES), afterwards, half of them were paired-housed and the others were singly housed. The PS exposed mice were directly confronted with a violent aggressor using the social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm for 15 min/trial (with the total of 10 trials randomly administered over a week), while the ES exposed mice were placed in a neighboring compartment to witness the PS procedure. Our results indicate that both stressors induced an effective stress response in adolescent mice, but PS and ES had differential influence in the context of relevant social anxiety/fear and social interaction with peers. Additionally, social support following stress exposure exerted beneficial effects on the social anxiety/fear in ES exposed mice, but not on PS exposed mice, suggesting that the type of stressor may affect the intervention efficacy of social support. These findings provide extensive evidence that physical and emotional stressors induce different effects. Moreover, ES exposed mice, rather than PS exposed mice, seemed to benefit from social support. In summary, the study suggests that this paradigm will be helpful in investigating the effects of psychological intervention for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",2165043738.0, Journal Article,2018
448,Problematic Social Networking Site Use and Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review of Recent Large-Scale Studies.,"Background and Aims: Research has shown a potential association between problematic social networking site (SNS) use and psychiatric disorders. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate studies examining the association between problematic SNS use and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Sampling and Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following databases: PsychInfo, PsycArticles, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Problematic SNS use (PSNSU) and its synonyms were included in the search. Information was extracted based on problematic SNS use and psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and stress. The inclusion criteria for papers to be reviewed were (i) being published since 2014 onwards, (ii) being published in English, (iii) having population-based studies with sample sizes &gt;500 participants, (iv) having specific criteria for problematic SNS use (typically validated psychometric scales), and (v) containing empirical primary data reporting on the correlation between PSNSU and psychiatric variables. A total of nine studies met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The findings of the systematic review demonstrated that most research has been conducted in Europe and all comprised cross-sectional survey designs. In eight (of the nine) studies, problematic SNS use was correlated with psychiatric disorder symptoms. Of the nine studies (some of which examined more than one psychiatric symptom), there was a positive association between PSNSU and depression (seven studies), anxiety (six studies), stress (two studies), ADHD (one study), and OCD (one study). Conclusions: Overall, the studies reviewed showed associations between PSNSU and psychiatric disorder symptoms, particularly in adolescents. Most associations were found between PSNSU, depression, and anxiety.",2165042112.0, Journal Article,2018
449,The Presence of Comorbid ADHD and Anxiety Symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Clinical Presentation and Predictors.,"High rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety symptoms have been documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and have been associated with social and adaptive impairments. The study examined the frequency of clinically elevated ADHD and anxiety symptoms in an ASD group in comparison to a non-clinical group, compared the clinical presentation in the ASD group with and without ADHD and anxiety, assessed which child and familial variables add to the severity of Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (HI), and anxiety symptoms, and evaluated whether having clinically elevated ADHD and/or anxiety symptoms adds to the prediction of adaptive functioning in ASD. The study included 260 participants diagnosed with ASD (mean age: 7.5 ± 1.1), using standardized tests. The rate of clinically elevated ADHD and anxiety symptoms in ASD was 62.7 and 44.6%, respectively, and symptom severity was significantly greater than the non-clinical sample. The entire population was divided into four subgroups: ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ASD+anxiety, ASD+ADHD+anxiety, based on the parental behavioral questionnaire. The ASD alone group showed less severe autism symptoms in comparison to the other groups. Having ASD+ADHD symptoms was associated with greater impairments in socialization adaptive skills. Only the group with ASD+ADHD+anxiety was associated with poorer daily living adaptive skills. Regression analyses for prediction of ADHD and anxiety symptoms revealed that being a female and having lower adaptive skills scores predicted higher Inattention severity; being older, having better cognition, and more severe Restrictive Repetitive Behavior symptoms predicted more severe HI symptoms; being older and having more severe social impairments predicted higher anxiety scores. A regression analysis for the prediction of adaptive skills revealed that in addition to cognition and autism severity, the severity of Inattention symptoms added to the prediction of overall adaptive skills. In light of these findings, clinicians should diagnose these comorbidities in ASD early on, and provide effective interventions to reduce their negative impact on functioning, thereby improving outcome.",2165041705.0, Journal Article,2018
450,A Conscious Resting State fMRI Study in SLE Patients Without Major Neuropsychiatric Manifestations.,"Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the main causes of death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Signs and symptoms of NPSLE are heterogeneous, and it is hard to diagnose, and treat NPSLE patients in the early stage. We conducted this study to explore the possible brain activity changes using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in SLE patients without major neuropsychiatric manifestations (non-NPSLE patients). We also tried to investigate the possible associations among brain activity, disease activity, depression, and anxiety. In our study, 118 non-NPSLE patients and 81 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Rs-fMRI data were used to calculate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) in all participants. We found decreased ReHo values in the fusiform gyrus and thalamus and increased ReHo values in the parahippocampal gyrus and uncus. The disease activity was positively correlated with ReHo values of the cerebellum and negatively correlated with values in the frontal gyrus. Several brain areas showed correlations with depressive and anxiety statuses. These results suggested that abnormal brain activities might occur before NPSLE and might be the foundation of anxiety and depression symptoms. Early detection and proper treatment of brain dysfunction might prevent the progression to NPSLE. More studies are needed to understand the complicated underlying mechanisms.",2160152468.0, Journal Article,2018
451,Clinical Utility of Beck Anxiety Inventory in Clinical and Nonclinical Korean Samples.,"Despite the prominent use of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in primary healthcare systems, few studies have confirmed its diagnostic utility and psychometric properties in non-Western countries. This study aims to clarify the clinical utility of the BAI as a screening tool for anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV criteria, based on blind recruitment and diagnostic interviews of both clinical and non-clinical participants in the Korean population. A total of 1,157 participants were involved in the final psychometric analysis, which included correlational analysis with other anxiety and depression self-report measures and mean score comparison with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). ROC analysis and calculation of positive and negative predictive values were conducted to examine diagnostic utility. The BAI was found to have high correlations with depression-related self-report measures (0.747-0.796) and moderate to high correlations with anxiety-related self-report measures (0.518-0.776). The ROC analysis failed to provide cutoff scores with adequate sensitivity and specificity for identifying participants with anxiety disorders (85.0% sensitivity, 88.1% specificity, and 92.8% AUC). The comparison of BAI and BDI mean scores for different diagnostic groups revealed that BAI and BDI scores were higher in the depressive or anxiety disorders group than in the non-clinical group. However, BAI mean score was not higher for the anxiety-only group than the depression-only group. Our data supports the BAI reliability and validity as a tool to measure the severity of general anxiety in clinical and non-clinical populations; however, it fails to capture the unique characteristics of anxiety disorders that distinguish them from depressive disorders. Further clinical implications of the BAI based on these results and some limitations of the study are discussed.",2158558597.0, Journal Article,2018
452,Anaerobic Exercise Training in the Therapy of Substance Use Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Background: In the past 3 decades, there has been an increase in the number of studies assessing exercise as a form of treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). While a variety of substance types and outcomes have been assessed, exercise intensities have never been systematically examined. Consequently, it remains unclear whether particular forms of exercise are better suited to the treatment of these populations. Anaerobic exercise has been shown to have positive effects in populations with psychiatric disorders, but its effectiveness in the treatment of SUDs has to date not been reviewed. Methods: The aim of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate studies which have employed either an acute or chronic anaerobic exercise component as a therapy modality for SUDs. The primary outcomes are abstinence, craving, withdrawal, consumption, quality of life, and the following psychological symptoms and disorders: depression, anxiety, stress, and mood. A secondary objective is to assess whether the type of training described in the study protocol can be reliably categorized as anaerobic training. Results: Twenty-six studies are included in this review. Twelve studies addressed nicotine dependence, one addressed alcohol dependence, and 13 addressed dependence on various illicit drugs. Thirteen studies reported the intensity at which participants actually exercised, but only one employed a test to determine whether training was carried out above the anaerobic threshold (AT). The risk of bias in the included studies was generally high. Results of the studies were mixed, with the most positive effects being found for abstinence in nicotine dependence. Conclusion: The evidence for the effects of anaerobic exercise in SUDs is weak, although a tendency toward positive effects on abstinence in nicotine dependent individuals was observable. The majority of studies do not report data on exercise intensity, making a categorization of anaerobic exercise impossible in all but one case. This means that the effects of this form of exercise cannot be determined, and therefore not evaluated or compared with other forms. In order to improve the quality of evidence for exercise in SUD treatment, clearly defined and objectively assessed evaluations of anaerobic and anaerobic exercise are necessary.",2158558499.0, Journal Article,2018
453,Subclinical Agoraphobia Symptoms and Regional Brain Volumes in Non-clinical Subjects: Between Compensation and Resilience?,"Background: Symptoms of anxiety are present not only in panic disorder or other anxiety disorders, but are highly prevalent in the general population. Despite increasing biological research on anxiety disorders, there is little research on understanding subclinical or sub-threshold symptoms relating to anxiety in non-clinical community samples, which could give clues to factors relating to resilience or compensatory changes. Aims:This study focused on brain structural correlates of subclinical anxiety/agoraphobia symptoms from a multi-center imaging study. Methods: We obtained high-resolution structural T1 MRI scans of 409 healthy young participants and used the CAT12 toolbox for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Subjects provided self-ratings of anxiety using the SCL-90-R, from which we used the phobia subscale, covering anxiety symptoms related to those of panic and agoraphobia spectrum. Results: We found significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected) correlations (mostly positive) of cortical volume with symptom severity, including the right lingual gyrus and calcarine sulcus, as well as left calcarine sulcus, superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. Uncorrected exploratory analysis also revealed positive correlations with GMV in orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula. Conclusions: Our findings show brain structural associations of subclinical symptoms of anxiety, which overlap with those seen in panic disorder or agoraphobia. This is consistent with a dimensional model of anxiety, which is reflected not only functionally but also on the structural level.",2157661437.0, Journal Article,2018
454,CB1 Agonism Alters Addiction-Related Behaviors in Mice Lacking Mu or Delta Opioid Receptors.,"Opioids are powerful analgesics but the clinical utility of these compounds is reduced by aversive outcomes, including the development of affective and substance use disorders. Opioid systems do not function in isolation so understanding how these interact with other neuropharmacological systems could lead to novel therapeutics that minimize withdrawal, tolerance, and emotional dysregulation. The cannabinoid system is an obvious candidate as anatomical, pharmacological, and behavioral studies point to opioid-cannabinoid interactions in the mediation of these processes. The aim of our study is to uncover the role of specific cannabinoid and opioid receptors in addiction-related behaviors, specifically nociception, withdrawal, anxiety, and depression. To do so, we tested the effects of a selective CB1 agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA), on mouse behavior in tail immersion, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, light-dark, and splash tests. We examined cannabinoid-opioid interactions in these tests by comparing responses of wildtype (WT) mice to mutant lines lacking either Mu or Delta opioid receptors. ACEA, both acute or repeated injections, had no effect on nociceptive thresholds in WT or Mu knockout (KO) mice suggesting that analgesic properties of CB1 agonists may be restricted to chronic pain conditions. The opioid antagonist, naloxone, induced similar levels of withdrawal in all three genotypes following ACEA treatment, confirming an opioidergic contribution to cannabinoid withdrawal. Anxiety-like responses in the light-dark test were similar across WT and KO lines; neither acute nor repeated ACEA injections modified this behavior. Similarly, administration of the Delta opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole, alone or in combination with ACEA, did not alter responses of WT mice in the light-dark test. Thus, there may be a dissociation in the effect of pharmacological blockade vs. genetic deletion of Delta opioid receptors on anxiety-like behavior in mice. Finally, our study revealed a biphasic effect of ACEA on depressive-like behavior in the splash test, with a prodepressive state induced by acute exposure, followed by a shift to an anti-depressive state with repeated injections. The initial pro-depressive effect of ACEA was absent in Mu KO mice. In sum, our findings confirm interactions between opioid and cannabinoid systems in withdrawal and reveal reduced depressive-like symptoms with repeated CB1 receptor activation.",2155915876.0, Journal Article,2018
455,Decreased Blood Levels of Oxytocin in Ketamine-Dependent Patients During Early Abstinence.,"Background: Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is a common drug of abuse worldwide. Existing evidence suggest a disruption of oxytocin system involves in the development of addiction. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of oxytocin in ketamine addiction by measuring the blood oxytocin levels in ketamine-dependent (KD) patients. Methods: Sixty-five KD patients and 65 controls were enrolled. Fasting plasma levels of oxytocin were determined at baseline and 1 and 2 weeks after ketamine withdrawal. Ketamine use variables, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Visual Analog Scale for craving, and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form were assessed in KD patients. Results: KD patients had significantly lower levels of oxytocin at baseline compared to controls (5.89 ± 2.13 vs. 9.53 ± 4.17 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.001). Oxytocin levels increased after one (6.74 ± 2.63, P &lt; 0.002) and 2 weeks (6.89 ± 2.69, P = 0.01) of withdrawal in KD patient despite the levels were still lower than controls (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). The clinical variables did not correlate with baseline oxytocin levels except BAI scores, which showed a negative correlation with the levels (r = -0.263; P = 0.039). Conclusion: We found a distinctively reduced oxytocin level in KD patients and the level did not normalize after early abstinence. Lower oxytocin might be associated with anxious phenotype of ketamine dependence. These results suggest that oxytocin system dysregulated following chronic ketamine abuse and might provide insight in evaluating the potential therapeutic use of oxytocin for treating ketamine dependence.",2155162510.0, Journal Article,2018
456,Epigenetics in Personality Disorders: Today's Insights.,"Objective: Epigenetic mechanisms have been described in several mental disorders, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. However, less is known about the influence of epigenetic mechanisms with regard to personality disorders (PD). Therefore, we conducted a literature review on existing original data with regards to epigenetic peculiarities in connection with personality disorders. Methods: Systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines. Search was performed via NCBI PubMed by keywords and their combinations. Used search terms included ""epigenetic,"" ""methylation,"" ""acetylation"" plus designations of specified personality traits and disorders according to DSM-IV. Results: Search yielded in total 345 publications, 257 thereof with psychiatric topic, 72 on personality disorder or traits, 43 of which were in humans and epigenetic, 23 thereof were original studies. Lastly, 23 original publications fulfilled the intended search criteria and were included. Those are 13 studies on gene methylation pattern with aggressive, antisocial and impulsive traits, 9 with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 2 with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The results of these studies showed significant associations of PD with methylation aberrances in system-wide genes and suggest evidence for epigenetic processes in the development of personality traits and personality disorders. Environmental factors, of which childhood trauma showed a high impact, interfered with many neurofunctional genes. Methylation alterations in ASPD and BPD repeatedly affected HTR2A, HTR3A, NR3C1, and MAOA genes. Summary: Epigenetic studies in PD seem to be a useful approach to elucidate the interaction of co-working risk factors in the pathogenesis of personality traits and disorders. However, the complexity of pathogenesis leads to divergent results and impedes an explicit interpretation. Differing methylation patterns within the selected PD could indicate subgroups which would benefit from patient-oriented therapeutic adjustments. They might play a major role in the future design and observation of early therapeutic intervention and thus could help to prevent severe dysfunctional conduct or full-blown personality disorder in risk subjects.",2149845353.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
457,Patterns of Management of Patients With Dual Disorder (Psychosis) in Italy: A Survey of Psychiatrists and Other Physicians Focusing on Clinical Practice.,"Patients with severe psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorders frequently suffer from concomitant substance use disorders (SUDs)-Dual Disorder (DD) patients. In order to better understand current practices for management of patients with psychotic episodes and concomitant SUD in Italy, we carried out a survey of psychiatrists on current routine practice among prescribers. These aspects can help to identify at-risk patients, improve current prescribing practices, and favor early intervention. An ad hoc survey of 17 questions was administered to psychiatrists via electronic polling and on-line distribution; 448 completed questionnaires were collected. Comorbid substance abuse was most frequently diagnosed within the context of anxiety disorder (46%), followed by bipolar disorder (25%), and schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (12%). The vast majority of respondents felt that patient management was becoming more complex due to substance abuse. The areas reported to be most affected in patients with SUD were functioning, interpersonal relations, and impulsivity, while sensory perception disorders, ideation, agitation, and impulsivity were the most frequently reported symptoms. In the acute setting, haloperidol was used as the first-line agent of choice followed by aripiprazole and olanzapine. In the maintenance phase, aripiprazole was the dominantly used first-line agent, followed by olanzapine. Almost half of respondents used long-acting agents, while about one-third did not. Among those prescribing long-acting agents, efficacy, control of impulsivity, and control of specific symptoms were cited as motivators, while in the maintenance phase, better adherence, and tolerability were mainly cited. From the responses to the present survey, it is clear that the respondents are aware of the problem of SUD in psychotic patients. While treatment be optimized in terms of the choice and formulation of antipsychotics, greater emphasis should be placed on efficacy, tolerability, and the negative metabolic consequences of some antipsychotics. When considering the ideal antipsychotic, long-acting agents were considered to be superior in reducing relapse, even if current treatment guidelines often give preference to oral formulations.",2138647071.0, Journal Article,2018
458,Fragile X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND).,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the full mutation (&gt;200 CGG repeats) in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. It is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID) and autism. This review focuses on neuropsychiatric disorders frequently experienced by premutation carriers with 55 to 200 CGG repeats and the pathophysiology involves elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, which is different from the absence or deficiency of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) seen in FXS. Neuropsychiatric disorders are the most common problems associated with the premutation, and they affect approximately 50% of individuals with 55 to 200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Neuropsychiatric disorders in children with the premutation include anxiety, ADHD, social deficits, or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In adults with the premutation, anxiety and depression are the most common problems, although obsessive compulsive disorder, ADHD, and substance abuse are also common. These problems are often exacerbated by chronic fatigue, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disorders and sleep problems, which are also associated with the premutation. Here we review the clinical studies, neuropathology and molecular underpinnings of RNA toxicity associated with the premutation. We also propose the name Fragile X-associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND) in an effort to promote research and the use of fragile X DNA testing to enhance recognition and treatment for these disorders.",2138646720.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
459,"A Research of Methamphetamine Induced Psychosis in 1,430 Individuals With Methamphetamine Use Disorder: Clinical Features and Possible Risk Factors.","Background and Aims: Methamphetamine (MA) abuse is commonly associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. The predictors and related risk factors of MA induced psychosis (MIP) are poorly understood. We investigated the occurrence of MIP, and analyzed the clinical features and possible risk factors among individuals with MA use disorder Method: One thousand four hundred and thirty participants with MA use disorder were recruited from compulsory rehabilitation centers in Shanghai. A structured questionnaire including demographic characteristics, drug use history, visual analog scales, Beck Depression Inventory-13 (BDI-13), and Hamilton anxiety scale-14 (HAMA-14) were used to collect clinical related information. Fifty-six participants had accomplished the test of CogState Battery. Results: Among the 1430 individuals with MA use disorder, 37.1% were diagnosed as MIP according DSM-IV. There were significant differences in age, marital status, age of drug use onset, MA use years, Average MA use dose, interval of MA use, maximum dose, concurrent use of alcohol, and other drugs, VAS score, MA dependence, BDI-13 scores, HAMA-14 scores, verbal learning memory, and visual learning memory between the MIP group and the none MIP group (P &lt; 0.05). The age of drug use onset (OR = 0.978, p = 0.011), average drug use dose (OR = 1.800, p = 0.015), craving score (OR = 1.069, p = 0.031), MA dependence (OR = 2.214, p &lt; 0.001), and HAMA scores (OR = 1.028, p &lt; 0.001) were associated to MIP. Conclusion: Individuals with MIP had more severe drug use problems, emotional symptoms and cognitive impairment. Earlier onset of drug use, higher quantity of drug use, higher craving, middle or severe drug use disorder and more anxiety symptoms may be related risk factors of MIP.",2136553217.0, Journal Article,2018
460,Minocycline Attenuates Stress-Induced Behavioral Changes via Its Anti-inflammatory Effects in an Animal Model of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.,"Accumulating evidences have suggested that anxiety-like behavior and impairment of learning and memory are key symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pharmacological treatment can ameliorate anxiety and cognitive impairments. Recent studies have shown that minocycline exhibits anxiolytic effects. The aims of the present study were to determine whether minocycline administration would alter anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficits induced by inescapable foot shock (IFS) and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Male Wistar rats were exposed to the IFS protocol for a period of 6 days to induce PTSD. The PTSD-like behavior was tested using the open field test, elevated plus maze test, and Morris water maze test. The effects of minocycline on pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of microglia, and NF-κB in the PFC and hippocampus were also examined. Treatment with minocycline significantly reversed the IFS induced behavioral and cognitive parameters (impaired learning and memory function) in stressed rats. Additionally, IFS was able to increase pro-inflammatory cytokines, activate microglia, and enhance NF-κB levels, while minocycline significantly reversed these alterations. Taken together, our results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of minocycline is related to its ability to decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit activation of microglia and NF-κB in the PFC and hippocampus.",2136552841.0, Journal Article,2018
461,Prenatal Alcohol Exposure and Child Psychosocial Behavior: A Sibling Fixed-Effects Analysis.,"Background: The association between low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and children's health remains unclear because of the difficulty in ruling out residual genetic and environmental confounding factors. In this study, using a within-family sibling fixed effects design, we sought to examine the association between low prenatal alcohol exposures (PAE) and children's overall psychosocial behavior in a Japanese cohort. Methods: We used maternal and sibling data from the Japanese Study of Stratification, Health, Income and Neighborhood 2012-2013. Households were recruited from the Tokyo metropolitan area through clustered random sampling. Children under 18 years old who have siblings (n = 1,600) and their mothers were selected. PAE status was retrospectively measured, and classified by binominal and continuous measurements. Outcome measures of children's psychosocial behavior were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist T-score. Results: Low PAE was significantly associated with the offspring's anxiety problems (β = 1.54, 95%CI = 0.26, 2.82) and internalizing problems (β = 2.73, 95%CI = 0.87, 4.60), and marginally significant with the offspring's total problem scores (β = 2.34, 95%CI = -0.24, 4.92). There was no significant difference in PAE between boys and girls when it comes to behavioral problems. Conclusions: Low PAE was associated with children's anxiety, internalizing problems and overall problems, taking into account possible unobserved genetic and environmental confounding influences.",2136552839.0, Journal Article,2018
462,A Review of the Potential Mechanisms of Action of Baclofen in Alcohol Use Disorder.,"Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, is a promising treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Its mechanism of action in this condition is unknown. GABA-B receptors interact with many biological systems potentially involved in AUD, including transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems. Preclinical studies have shown that GABA-B receptors are involved in memory storage and retrieval, reward, motivation, mood and anxiety; neuroimaging studies in humans show that baclofen produces region-specific alterations in cerebral activity; GABA-B receptor activation may have neuroprotective effects; baclofen also has anti-inflammatory properties that may be of interest in the context of addiction. However, none of these biological effects fully explain the mechanism of action of baclofen in AUD. Data from clinical studies have provided a certain number of elements which may be useful for the comprehension of its mechanism of action: baclofen typically induces a state of indifference toward alcohol; the effective dose of baclofen in AUD is extremely variable from one patient to another; higher treatment doses correlate with the severity of the addiction; many of the side effects of baclofen resemble those of alcohol, raising the possibility that baclofen acts as a substitution drug; usually, however, there is no tolerance to the effects of baclofen during long-term AUD treatment. In the present article, the biological effects of baclofen are reviewed in the light of its clinical effects in AUD, assuming that, in many instances, clinical effects can be reliable indicators of underlying biological processes. In conclusion, it is proposed that baclofen may suppress the Pavlovian association between cues and rewards through an action in a critical part of the dopaminergic network (the amygdala), thereby normalizing the functional connectivity in the reward network. It is also proposed that this action of baclofen is made possible by the fact that baclofen and alcohol act on similar brain systems in certain regions of the brain.",2136551855.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
463,Eating Disorders Impact on Vigilance and Decision Making of a Community Sample of Treatment Naive Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Young Adults.,"Although impulsivity is suggested as a possible link to explain the association of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with an Eating Disorder (ED), there is little research on how clinical and cognitive/neuropsychological functioning might change when this comorbidity occurs. ADHD individuals are at a higher of developing ED and also obesity. Some research has described the impact of ADHD in clinical treatment-seeking samples of ED patients. Consequently, we investigated how ED impacted on clinical and cognitive variables of a community sample of treatment-naive ADHD individuals. Ninety college students arranged in three groups (ADHD+ED, ADHD only and Controls) were analyzed using semi-structured interviews for ADHD (K-SADS), the Iowa Gambling Task, the Conner's Continuous Performance Test, Digit and Visual span, as well as rating scales for anxiety (STAI), depression (BDI) and impulsivity (BIS-11), and binge eating (BES). We found that ADHD+ED individuals significantly differed from both groups, presenting with a higher body mass index; more hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; higher binge eating scores; more omission errors on the Continuous Performance Test; disadvantageous choices on the Iowa Gambling Task. Also, we demonstrated through a moderation/mediation analysis that a greater level of binge eating mediated the increases in body mass index on our sample. There were no significant paths to explain binge-eating severity through changes on any of the neuropsychological tests used. The presence of an ED in normal weight in a community sample of ADHD individuals is associated with higher body mass index and a worse cognitive functioning.",2136550334.0, Journal Article,2018
464,Psychotherapeutic Group Intervention for Traumatized Male Refugees Using Imaginative Stabilization Techniques-A Pilot Study in a German Reception Center.,"Background: Due to persecution, human rights violations and armed conflicts, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high in refugee populations. Previous studies indicate that trauma-focused treatments are highly effective in treating PTSD in refugees. However, these approaches rely on the stability of the therapeutic setting, treatment continuity, and safe housing. Although early treatment of PTSD is recommended, these requirements are not met in reception centers. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to examine the effect of imaginative stabilization techniques derived from psychodynamic psychotraumatology therapy for the early stabilization of traumatized refugees in a reception center. Methods: From May 2017 to April 2018, 86 imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions have taken place. A sample of 43 out of 46 traumatized refugees completed self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms prior to attending open imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions. Furthermore, participants filled in self-report questionnaires on distress and emotional state (valence/arousal/dominance) before and after each session. After having participated in four consecutive sessions, a sub-group of 17 participants completed a follow-up assessment of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 25 participants 2 weeks after their last session attendance to explore self-practice habits post intervention. Results: The pre-post-intervention comparison of scores indicated a significant reduction of distress (z = -3.35, p &lt; 0.001, r = -0.51) and an improvement of affective reports for valence (z = -4.79, p &lt; 0.001, r = -0.82) and dominance (z = -3.89, p &lt; 0.001, r = -0.59), whereas arousal scores were not affected. We found a significant reduction of anxiety symptoms (z = -2.04, p &lt; 0.05, r = -0.49), whereas PTSD and depression scores remained unchanged. Follow-up interviews revealed that 80% of the participants continued to practice the imaginative stabilization techniques after redistribution to other accommodation. Conclusion: The results indicate that imaginative stabilization techniques are a promising and feasible approach to treat refugees in unstable reception center settings. In regular imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions, we were able to reduce the participants' distress and anxiety symptoms while strengthening their internal resources and increasing their emotional stability.",2132726667.0, Journal Article,2018
465,Yield and Efficiency of Mental Disorder Screening at Intake to Prison: A Comparison of DIA-X Short- and Long-Screening-Protocols in Compensation Prisoners.,"Background: Inmates are several times more likely to suffer from mental disorders than the general population.In order to take appropriate curative or preventive measures, a precise psychiatric diagnosis at detention start would therefore be imperative, but is frequently not carried out for reasons of time. The computer-aided expert system DIA-X enables a rapid and reliable diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. DIA-X is available as a short screening questionnaire with a processing time of a few minutes and as a standardized interview, which takes ~1 h to complete. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the DIA-X short screening questionnaire. Methods: One hundred detainees were recruited randomly from compensation prisoners, who were imprisoned because they were unwilling or unable to pay a fine for committing a criminal offence, from the penal institution Berlin-Plötzensee in 2017. Both the short screening questionnaire and the standardized interview from the DIA-X expert system were used for diagnosing mental disorders. Based on the results of the standardized interview from four study populations of compensation prisoners from 1999, 2004, 2010, and 2017, the sensitivity, specificity and the predictive values of the screening form were inferred. Results: More than half of the compensation prisoners suffered from mental and behavioral disorders caused by the abuse of alcohol or psychoactive substances. Phobic anxiety disorders were detected in one out of ten compensation prisoners and two out of ten compensation prisoners suffered from major depressive disorders. The DIA-X screening questionnaire was able to detect all mental illnesses with a sensitivity of 100%. However, specificities were low for nicotine dependency, drug and alcohol abuse. High specificities and high predictive values were obtained for psychoses and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: As the main test quality criteria of the DIA-X screening forms were so low, we cannot recommend the application of the DIA-X screening form for obtaining a valid diagnosis. Therefore, we explicitly recommend using the long form DIA-X for the detection of the most serious cases of mental illness. Then, these prisoners could receive either therapy or special social training.",2132292976.0, Journal Article,2018
466,The Factorial Structure of Trait Anxiety and Its Mediating Effect Between Mindfulness and Depression.,"Background: Increasing studies have found that high trait anxiety is a key susceptibility phenotype that causes depression. Mindfulness-based interventions can target on dealing with depressogenic vulnerability effectively. Evidence indicates that trait anxiety could affect the trajectory of anti-depressive psychotherapy, and play an important role in the relationship between mindfulness and depression. Furthermore, related studies have found that trait anxiety could involve factors beyond anxiety and be a two-factor construct instead of one-dimensional concept. This viewpoint provides a new prospective for exploring the pathways of the two factors of trait anxiety in the complex relationship and further understand the potential mechanism of vulnerable personality mediated the link of mindfulness and depression. Methods: A cross-sectional survey and a preliminary intervention study were conducted. Thousand two hundred and sixty-two subjects completed a set of self-reported questionnaires that evaluated trait anxiety, mindfulness, and depressive symptoms. Twenty-Three eligible participants with depression were recruited to attend mindfulness-based cognitive training for eight weeks. The same questionnaires were completed 1 week before the training and 6 months after the training. Factor analysis was performed on the 1262-subject sample to explore and confirm the factorial structure of trait anxiety. In addition, mediating effect analysis was conducted in the two studies to test whether two factors of trait anxiety were mediators of the relationship between mindfulness and depression. Results: The exploratory factor analysis extracted two dimensions of trait anxiety, namely, trait anxiety-present factor (TA-P) and trait anxiety-absent factor (TA-A). And confirmatory factor analysis showed that the fit of the two-factor model was acceptable. Both TA-P and TA-A were significantly negatively correlated with mindfulness and positively correlated with depression, and they played a mediating role between mindfulness and depression. The two factors of trait anxiety had multiple mediating effects on the relationship between mindfulness and depression, and the mediating effect of the TA-P factor was stronger than that of the TA-A factor. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated a two-factor model of trait anxiety in the Chinese population. TA-P and TA-A played a multiple mediating role in the relationship between mindfulness and depression. The findings provide new perspectives for psychological interventions to treat depression for people with susceptible personalities. Aiming to reduce negative emotional tendencies (TA-P factor) and enhance positive cognition (TA-A factor) may achieve the early prevention and efficient treatment of depression.",2132291613.0, Journal Article,2018
467,Co-design of eHealth Interventions With Children and Young People.,"Co-design, defined as collective creativity across the entire design process, can lead to the development of interventions that are more engaging, satisfying, and useful to potential users. However, using this methodology within the research arena requires a shift from traditional practice. Co-design of eHealth interventions with children and young people has additional challenges. This review summarizes the applied core principles of co-design and recommends techniques for undertaking co-design with children and young people. Three examples of co-design during the development of eHealth interventions (Starship Rescue, a computer game for treating anxiety in children with long-term physical conditions, a self-monitoring app for use during treatment of depression in young people, and HABITS, the development of an emotional health and substance use app, and eHealth platform for young people) are provided to illustrate the value and challenges of this contemporary process.",2131235523.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
468,Epidemiological Characteristics and Risk Factors of Methamphetamine-Associated Psychotic Symptoms.,"Objective: To explore the epidemiological characteristics and the risk factors for methamphetamine (MA)-associated psychotic symptoms among MA users in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April, 2012 and October, 2015 among individuals for whom MA was the principal drug of use in a Compulsory Drug Detoxification Center in Beijing, Guangdong Province. Demographic, drug use and psychological characteristics were examined using a specifically-designed questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Barratt Impulsive Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression was performed to explore the risk factors for MA-associated psychotic symptoms. Results: A total of 1685 participants were included. Participants were predominantly aged 30 or above, unemployed, and were unmarried Han Chinese men, with limited education. The duration of MA use was more than 3 months in 72.3%. 47.8% reported that the dose of MA use was ≥ 0.2 g per occasion of use. 11.5% had used two or more synthetic drugs. The prevalence of MA-associated psychotic symptoms was 17.0% among MA users during periods of abstinence. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that a higher dose (≥0.2 g per time), a longer duration of MA use (&gt;3 months) a history of heroin use and a history of tobacco use were associated with MA-associated psychotic symptoms, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.76), 1.98 (95% CI: 1.33-2.96) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.67-3.60), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.27-2.49) respectively. MA-associated psychotic symptoms were less common among married/cohabitating than unmarried (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39-0.81), and unemployed than employed (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.92) individuals. MA users with anxiety and depression symptoms had significantly greater risk for MA-associated psychotic symptoms by 9.70 (6.92-13.59) and 1.90 (1.36-2.65) times respectively. Individuals with higher impulsivity were more likely to have MA-associated psychotic symptoms than those with lower (OR = 2.19; CI:1.50-3.20). Conclusion: MA-associated psychotic symptoms occurred frequently among MA users in China. The efforts that facilitate drug users' attempts to reduce MA use, abstain from poly-drug use, and control associated psychiatric symptoms and impulsivity should be supported because of their potential contribution to MA-associated psychotic symptoms in this population.",2126913962.0, Journal Article,2018
469,Prenatal Maternal Anxiety in South Asia: A Rapid Best-Fit Framework Synthesis.,"Background: Most research efforts toward prenatal maternal anxiety has been situated in high-income countries. In contrast, research from low- and middle-income countries has focused on maternal depression and prenatal maternal anxiety in low- and middle-income countries remains poorly understood. Objectives: To examine whether dimensions and attributes of current maternal anxiety assessment tools appropriately capture South Asia women's experiences of perinatal distress during pregnancy. Design: We conducted a rapid review with best fit framework synthesis, as we wished to map study findings to an a priori framework of dimensions measured by prenatal maternal anxiety tools. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL and gray literature in November 2016. Studies were included if published in English, used any study design, and focused on women's experiences of prenatal/antenatal anxiety in South Asia. Review Methods: Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Study findings were extracted to an a priori framework derived from pregnancy-related anxiety tools. Results: From 4,177 citations, 9 studies with 19,251 women were included. Study findings mapped to the a priori framework apart from body image. A new theme, gender inequality, emerged from the studies and was overtly examined through gender disparity, gender preference of fetus, or domestic violence. Conclusions: Gender inequality and societal acceptability of domestic violence in South Asian women contextualizes the experience of prenatal maternal anxiety. Pregnancy-related anxiety tools should include domains related to gender inequality to better understand their influence on pregnancy outcomes.",2126909990.0, Journal Article,2018
470,Changes in Post-migration Living Difficulties Predict Treatment Outcome in Traumatized Refugees.,"Background: Refugee mental health is affected by traumatic stressors as well as post-migration living difficulties (PMLD). However, their interaction and causal pathways are unclear, and so far, no distinct treatment recommendations regarding exile-related stressors exist. Methods: In a 3-year follow-up study, PMLD and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression and anxiety were examined in a clinical sample of severely traumatized refugees and asylum seekers (N = 71). Results: In regression analysis, reduction in PMLD predicted changes over time in depression/anxiety, but not in PTS. The opposite models with PMLD changes as outcome variable proved not significant for PTS, and significant, though less predictive, for depression/anxiety. Conclusions: In addition to well-established trauma-focused interventions for the treatment of PTS, psychosocial interventions focusing on PMLD might contribute to a favorable treatment response in traumatized refugees, particularly with regard to depression and anxiety.",2125293620.0, Journal Article,2018
471,Baclofen in the Treatment of Patients With Alcohol Use Disorder and Other Mental Health Disorders.,"A limited number of medications are approved to treat Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Furthermore, the magnitude of their therapeutic effect is relatively modest, suggesting the potential for subtypes of patients who respond to a specific medication. The use of these medications is also limited in clinical practice by a series of contraindications such as medical comorbidities and/or concurrent use of other medications. In recent years, animal and human studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist approved for clinical use as a muscle relaxant, in the treatment of AUD. However, these studies have yielded contrasting results. Despite this discrepancy, baclofen is often used off-label to treat AUD, especially in some European countries and Australia. Recently, several factors have been considered to try to shed light on the potential reasons and mechanisms underlying the inconsistent results obtained until now. The presence of a psychiatric comorbidity may be amongst the abovementioned factors playing a role in explaining different responses to baclofen treatment in terms of alcohol drinking outcomes. Therefore, the aim here was to conduct a narrative review of the scientific literature related to the use of baclofen in AUD, both in patients with and without concomitant psychiatric disorders. All clinical studies (randomized and controlled, open-label, retrospective, human laboratory studies, and case reports) were analyzed and discussed, bearing in mind other potential factors that may have influenced baclofen response, including dose administered, severity of AUD, use of other psychosocial therapies, and the presence of physical disorders. This review indicates that the most frequent psychiatric comorbidities in patients affected by AUD undergoing baclofen treatment are anxiety and mood disorders. Unfortunately, no definitive conclusions can be drawn due to the lack of specific analyses on whether baclofen efficacy is different in AUD patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders vs. those without. Therefore, it will be critical that psychiatric comorbidities are considered in the planning of future studies and in the analysis of the data, with the ultimate goal of understanding whether subtypes of AUD patients may respond best to baclofen.",2120743255.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
472,Hidden Drug Abuse in Hong Kong: From Social Acquaintance to Social Isolation.,"The present paper examines the issue of hidden drug abuse in Hong Kong. Although official statistics show that the reported number of drug-abuse cases has been in decline in recent years, it has been reported that drug abusers tend to hide themselves at home to take drugs; thus, they are not discovered easily by the law enforcement and social control agents who report drug abuse cases to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse, resulting in the decrease in the reported number of drug-abuse cases. This ""dark figure"" phenomenon is a reflection of the official figure and reporting behavior, not the actual situation of drug abuse in Hong Kong. Through in-depth interviews of 30 ex-drug addicts, the majority of them started drug taking in early youth, the present paper identifies five stages of drug taking from social acquaintance to social isolation. It argues that although drug taking among abusers is a kind of social activity in their initial stage of drug use, they become socially isolated when their drug use is prolonged. Several reasons are identified, including users' easy accessibility to drugs and changes in the popularity of drugs and use of drug equipment. Most importantly, the hidden process is triggered and aggravated by numerous negative drug effects, such as decline in physical health, weak physical appearance leading to self-perceived discrimination, co-occurrence of psychiatric symptoms of increased anxiety and suspicion, and decline of trust among peers due to prolonged drug abuse. Possible solutions associated with clinical interventions, legislative policies, and law-enforcement operations are proposed.",2120200831.0, Journal Article,2018
473,Interoceptive Anxiety and Body Representation in Anorexia Nervosa.,"Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) typically display anxious traits prior to the onset of food avoidance and weight loss that characterize the disorder. Meal associated anxiety is an especially common clinical feature in these patients, and heightened sensitivity to sympathetically mediated interoceptive sensations has also been observed. However, it remains unclear how heightened interoceptive sensitivity relates to experiences of anxiety before and after meals. To investigate this relationship, we experimentally induced anxiety and panic symptoms with isoproterenol, a peripheral sympathetic agonist similar to adrenaline, across several different conditions: during panic provocation, during anticipation of a 1,000 Calorie meal, and after meal consumption. Fifteen AN and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy comparisons received bolus infusions of isoproterenol and saline in a double-blinded, randomized design. Participants rated anxiety symptoms after each infusion, completed panic rating scales, and traced the location of perceived palpitations on a manikin to index interoceptive ""body map"" representation. The AN group reported significantly elevated anxiety relative to healthy comparisons during infusions before and after the meal, but surprisingly, not during panic provocation. These symptoms were accompanied by geographical differences in patterns of perceived heartbeat sensations across each condition. In particular, the AN group localized heartbeat sensations disproportionately to the chest during meal related saline infusions, when no cardiorespiratory modulation actually occurred. The AN group also showed a trend toward higher panic attack rates during the meal anticipation period. Correcting for anxiety levels reported during saline infusions abolished group differences in anxiety change across all conditions, suggesting a significant contribution of anxious traits in AN. The observation of meal related ""visceral illusions"" provides further evidence that AN is associated with abnormal interoceptive representation of the heartbeat and suggests that meal consumption, particularly when anticipated, preferentially alters the processing of interoception related signals in AN.",2117389359.0, Journal Article,2018
474,Clinical Perspective on Passive Audio Vocal Measurement in the Evaluation of Selective Mutism.,"Selective Mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder often diagnosed in early childhood and characterized by persistent failure to speak in certain social situations but not others. Diagnosing SM and monitoring treatment response can be quite complex, due in part to changing definitions of and scarcity of research about the disorder. Subjective self-reports and parent/teacher interviews can complicate SM diagnosis and therapy, given that similar speech problems of etiologically heterogeneous origin can be attributed to SM. The present perspective discusses the potential for passive audio capture to help overcome psychiatry's current lack of objective and quantifiable assessments in the context of SM. We present supportive evidence from two pilot studies indicating the feasibility of using a digital wearable device to quantify child vocalization features affected by SM. We also highlight comparative analyses of passive audio capture and its potential to enhance diagnostic characterizations for SM, as well as possible limitations of such technologies.",2117386047.0, Journal Article,2018
475,Gray Matter Structural Alterations in Social Anxiety Disorder: A Voxel-Based Meta-Analysis.,"The current insight into the neurobiological pathogenesis underlying social anxiety disorder (SAD) is still rather limited. We implemented a meta-analysis to explore the neuroanatomical basis of SAD. We undertook a systematic search of studies comparing gray matter volume (GMV) differences between SAD patients and healthy controls (HC) using a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach. The anisotropic effect size version of seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) meta-analysis was conducted to explore the GMV differences of SAD patients compared with HC. We included eleven studies with 470 SAD patients and 522 HC in the current meta-analysis. In the main meta-analysis, relative to HC, SAD patients showed larger GMVs in the left precuneus, right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as smaller GMV in the left putamen. In the subgroup analyses, compared with controls, adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with SAD exhibited larger GMVs in the left precuneus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), MOG and SMA, as well as a smaller GMV in the left thalamus; SAD patients without comorbid depressive disorder exhibited larger GMVs in the left superior parietal gyrus and precuneus, right inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, MTG and superior temporal gyrus (STG), as well as a smaller GMV in the bilateral thalami; and currently drug-free patients with SAD exhibited a smaller GMV in the left thalamus compared with HC while no larger GMVs were found. For SAD patients with different clinical features, our study revealed directionally consistent larger cortical GMVs and smaller subcortical GMVs, including locationally consistent larger precuneus and thalamic deficits in the left brain. Age, comorbid depressive disorder and concomitant medication use of the patients might be potential confounders of SAD at the neuroanatomical level.",2117383628.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
476,Psychiatric Disorders in Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons After Forced Displacement: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Protracted armed conflicts not only shape political, legal, and socio-economic structures, but also have a lasting impact on people's human migration. In 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported an unprecedented number of 65.6 million individuals who were displaced worldwide as a result of armed conflicts. To date, however, little is known about these people's mental health status. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among forcibly displaced populations in settings of armed conflicts. Methods: We undertook a database search using Medline, PsycINFO, PILOTS, and the Cochrane Library, using the following keywords and their appropriate synonyms to identify relevant articles for possible inclusion: ""mental health,"" ""refugees,"" ""internally displaced people,"" ""survey,"" and ""war."" This search was limited to original articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published after 1980. We reviewed studies with prevalence rates of common psychiatric disorders-mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse, and suicidality-among adult internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees afflicted by armed conflicts. Results: The search initially yielded 915 articles. Of these references 38 studies were eligible and provided data for a total of 39,518 adult IDPs and refugees from 21 countries. The highest prevalence were for reported for post-traumatic stress disorder (3-88%), depression (5-80%), and anxiety disorders (1-81%) with large variation. Only 12 original articles reported about other mental disorders. Conclusions: These results show a substantial lack of data concerning the wider extent of psychiatric disability among people living in protracted displacement situations. Ambitious assessment programs are needed to support the implementation of sustainable global mental health policies in war-torn countries. Finally, there is an urgent need for large-scale interventions that address psychiatric disorders in refugees and internally displaced persons after displacement.",2117383117.0, Journal Article,2018
477,Primary and Secondary Diagnoses of Gambling Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidity in the Swedish Health Care System-A Nationwide Register Study.,"Background: Psychiatric comorbidity is common in gambling disorder, a condition with low rates of treatment seeking. There is a paucity of documented nationwide data on gambling disorder and its co-occurring psychiatric comorbidities in the health care system. Methods: This is a nationwide register-based study of all patients aged above 18 years who were diagnosed with gambling disorder (corresponding to pathological gambling, code F63.0, in the ICD-10) in Swedish specialized out-patient health care or in-patient care, from 2005 through 2016. All psychiatric disorders co-occurring with the diagnoses were recorded, along with age, gender and the type of medical specialty. Results: A total of 2,099 patients were included (1,784 in out-patient care and 629 patients in in-patient care), among whom 77 percent were men. Treatment uptake during the study period increased significantly in out-patient care, with an increasing uptake of younger individuals, whereas in-patient treatment uptake remained stable. A co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis was registered in 73 percent of patients, more commonly in females (77 vs. 71 percent, p &lt; 0.01). Several diagnostic subgroups were more common in women, with anxiety and affective disorders being the most common subgroups. Prevalence of substance use disorders did not differ with respect to gender. Conclusions: Despite a large gap between probable population prevalence of gambling disorder and the number of treated patients, the number of patients treated in out-patient health care with a gambling disorder diagnosis increased over time, with an increasing treatment uptake in younger individuals. Psychiatric comorbidity is common in gambling disorder patients in the health care system, with a higher prevalence in women.",2113277821.0, Journal Article,2018
478,Criterion Validity of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Second Edition for Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Adults.,"Background: While the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Second Edition (Y-BOCS-II) is the gold-standard for measurement of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom severity, its factor structure is still a matter of debate and, most importantly, criterion validity for diagnosis of OC disorder (OCD) has not been tested. This study aimed to clarify factor structure and criterion validity of the Y-BOCS-II. Methods: We first validated and quantified the psychometric properties of a culturally adapted Portuguese translation of the Y-BOCS-II (PY-BOCS-II). The PY-BOCS-II and other psychometric instruments, including the OCD subscale of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV, used to define OCD diagnosis, were administered to 187 participants (52 patients with OCD, 18 with other mood and anxiety disorders and 117 healthy subjects). In a subsample of 20 OCD patients and the 18 patients with other diagnoses, PY-BOCS-II was applied by clinicians blinded to diagnosis. Results: PY-BOCS-II had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.96) and very good test-retest reliability (Pearson's r = 0.94). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure with loadings consistent with the Obsessions and Compulsions subscales, and there was good to acceptable convergent and divergent validity. Importantly, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggested elevated accuracy in discriminating between patients with OCD and control subjects (AUC = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.99), that was retained in comparisons with age, gender and education matched controls (AUC = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91-0.99), as well as with patients with other mood and anxiety disorders (AUC = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.84-1). Additionally, a cut-off score of 13 had optimal discriminatory ability for the diagnosis of OCD, with sensitivity ranging between 85 and 90%, and specificity between 94 and 97%, respectively when all samples or only the clinical samples were considered. Conclusion: The PY-BOCS-II has excellent psychometric properties to assess the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, reflecting obsessive, and compulsive dimensions, compatible with currently defined subscales. Furthermore, we found that a cut-off of 13 for the Y-BOCS-II total score has good to excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of OCD.",2112612363.0, Journal Article,2018
479,Frontal Alpha EEG Asymmetry Before and After Positive Psychological Interventions for Medical Students.,"Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to traits concerned with happiness, fulfillment and enrichment and is a substantial predictor of a flourishing life. Interest in the promotion of well-being has blossomed in recent years, and it is widely reported that positive psychological interventions (PPIs) can effectively improve SWB. However, to date, the neural correlates of PPIs remain elusive. Since previous research has suggested that emotion regulation might be the theoretical foundation for potential working mechanisms, here we used electroencephalography (EEG) techniques to identify whether the intentional increase of subjective well-being through PPIs was associated with greater tonic left frontal activation. Fifty-five students met the inclusion criteria and were allocated to a randomized controlled trial that was single blinded. The intervention group received PPIs once a week for 10 weeks (n = 28). Meanwhile, students in a placebo control group (CG, n = 27) were asked to write down early memories every day for 10 weeks and were invited to share voluntarily at the weekly meeting. Measures of subjective well-being, depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-test and post-test. Forty-eight students completed the post-test, and the collected data were analyzed across time (PPIs, n = 25; CG, n = 23). It was found that students undergoing the 10-week PPIs reported larger improvement in SWB, and greater relief in self-rated depression and anxiety from pre-intervention to post-intervention than did those in the control group. As expected, in conjunction with the promotion of subjective well-being and the amelioration of emotional distress from pre- to post-treatment in the intervention group, a significantly increased coefficient of frontal alpha EEG asymmetry was found. In summary, these findings suggest that adaptive emotion regulation, which is characteristic of greater tonic left frontal activation, reflects the efficiency of PPIs and highlights the frontal alpha EEG asymmetry as a neural substrate linking PPIs and mental health.

480,"Burnout, Psychological Symptoms, and Secondary Traumatic Stress Among Midwives Working on Perinatal Wards: A Cross-Cultural Study Between Japan and Switzerland.","The aim of this study was to explore cross-cultural differences in symptoms of burnout, anxiety, depression, general psychological distress, and secondary traumatic stress between Asian (Japan) and European (Switzerland) midwives. One hundred seventy midwives participated in the study. There were significant differences in age group [χ2(3) = 24.2, p &lt; 0.01], marital or relationship status [χ2(2) = 28.4, p &lt; 0.01], and years of experience [χ2(2) = 17.8, p &lt; 0.01] between the two countries. The Japanese staff were younger, more often unmarried, and had less experience than the Swiss staff. The mean score of depersonalization was significantly higher in Switzerland (4.8 ± 3.8) than in Japan (3.2 ± 3.7; |z| = 2.71, p &lt; 0.01). The mean score of general psychological distress in the Swiss sample (12.8 ± 6.5) was significantly higher than that in the Japanese sample (10.3 ± 6.2; |z| = 2.04, p = 0.04). In addition, the mean score of secondary traumatic stress was higher in the Swiss sample (31.8 ± 9.7) than in the Japanese sample (24.1 ± 8.6; |z| = 4.56, p &lt; 0.01). These results may reflect cultural differences such as working conditions or family environment between Japan and Switzerland.",2111149554.0, Journal Article,2018
481,"Association Between Trust and Mental, Social, and Physical Health Outcomes in Veterans and Active Duty Service Members With Combat-Related PTSD Symptomatology.","Background: Trust represents a complex emotion and interpersonal concept which assumes abandoning control over a given situation or set of circumstances, in turn yielding such control to another party. Advances in our knowledge of post-traumatic stress disorder and moral injury have underscored the need to more closely examine how trust stands to impact health outcomes in these disorders. The aim of the present study is to examine and identify relationships linking general trust with select health outcomes in a mixed sample of Veterans and Service members with a self-reported history of deployment to a combat theater and PTSD symptomatology. Methods: This study applied a cross-sectional methodology, surveying n = 427 participants recruited across six sites. This included 373 Veterans and 54 active duty Service members in the United States. Measures included demographic characteristics, combat exposure, general trust, post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology, depressive/anxiety symptomatology, alcohol use, social involvement, religiosity, and physical health. Data were analyzed descriptively as well as using Pearson correlations, Student's t-test, and multivariate regression. Results: Several significant relationships were identified, indicating an inverse relationship between trust and PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology. Greater levels of trust were also significantly associated with increased social interaction and religiosity. Lastly, no significant associations were identified with either physical functioning or pain level. Conclusion: The findings suggest that trust is correlated with a variety of health outcomes in Veterans and Service members affected by combat-related PTSD. Additional, hypothesis-driven research, informed by longitudinal data, is needed to better understand how trust stands to impact health outcomes, including the development of strategies and intervention options for repairing trust.",2111147390.0, Journal Article,2018
482,Caffeine Modulates Food Intake Depending on the Context That Gives Access to Food: Comparison With Dopamine Depletion.,"Caffeine is a methylxanthine consumed in different contexts to potentiate alertness and reduce fatigue. However, caffeine can induce anxiety at high doses. Caffeine is also a minor psychostimulant that seems to act as an appetite suppressant, but there are also reports indicating that it could stimulate appetite. Dopamine also is involved in food motivation and in behavioral activation. In the present series of experiments, we evaluated the effects of acute administration of caffeine on food consumption under different access conditions. CD1 male adult mice had access to highly palatable food (50% sucrose) in a restricted but habitual context, under continuous or intermittent access as well as under anxiogenic, or effortful conditions. Caffeine (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) increased intake at the highest dose under familiar continuous and intermittent access. However, this high dose reduced food intake in the dark-light paradigm. In contrast, a dopamine-depleting agent, tetrabenazine (TBZ; 1.0-8.0 mg/kg) did not affect food intake in any of those experimental conditions. In the T-maze-barrier task that evaluates seeking and taking of food under effortful conditions, caffeine (10.0 mg/kg) decreased latency to reach the food, but did not affect selection of the high-food density arm that required more effort, or the total amount of food consumed. In contrast, TBZ (4.0 mg/kg) reduced selection of the high food density arm with the barrier, thus affecting amount of food consumed. Interestingly, a small dose of caffeine (5.0 mg/kg) was able to reverse the anergia-inducing effects produced by TBZ in the T-maze. These results suggest that caffeine can potentiate or suppress food consumption depending on the context. Moreover, caffeine did not change appetite, and did not impair orientation toward food under effortful conditions, but it rather helped to achieve the goal by improving speed and by reversing performance to normal levels when fatigue was induced by dopamine depletion.",2111144994.0, Journal Article,2018
483,"Stressful Life Memories Relate to Ruminative Thoughts in Women With Sexual Violence History, Irrespective of PTSD.","More than one in every four women in the world experience sexual violence (SV) in their lifetime, most often as teenagers and young adults. These traumatic experiences leave memories in the brain, which are difficult if not impossible to forget. We asked whether women with SV history experience stronger memories of their most stressful life event than women without SV history and if so, whether strength relates to ruminative and trauma-related thoughts. Using the Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire (AMQ), women with SV history (n = 64) reported this memory as especially strong (p &lt; 0.001), remembering more sensory and contextual details, compared to women without SV history (n = 119). They further considered the event a significant part of their personal life story. The strength of the memory was highly correlated with posttraumatic cognitions and ruminative thoughts, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety (p's &lt; 0.001, n = 183). A third (33%) of the women with SV history were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but PTSD alone did not account for the increase in memory strength (p's &lt; 0.001). These data suggest that the experience of SV increases the strength of stressful autobiographical memories, which are then reexperienced in everyday life during posttraumatic and ruminative thoughts. We propose that the repeated rehearsal of vivid stressful life memories generates more trauma memories in the brain, making the experience of SV even more difficult to forget.",2111143877.0, Journal Article,2018
484,Prevalence of Mental Distress Among Syrian Refugees With Residence Permission in Germany: A Registry-Based Study.,"Background: High rates of prevalence of mental distress among the Syrian refugee population have been repeatedly confirmed. However, little is known about the influence of length of stay, living conditions, and residence permission in the host country or about the duration of the escape journey and travel conditions on mental health in this refugee population. This study examines the mental health of Syrian refugees, taking into account the circumstances in their country of origin and host country, as well as their escape conditions. Methods: This investigation formed part of a registry-based study. A sample of 518 adult Syrian refugees in Erlangen, Germany, who have residence permission was identified. The response rate was 38.6%; a total of 200 Syrian refugees thus participated in the study. The respondents were investigated for post-traumatic stress disorder (ETI), depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and post-migration variables. Results: The prevalence of participants who had personally experienced and/or witnessed traumatic events was 75.3%. Symptoms of PTSD were found in 11.4% of the participants. Moderate to severe depression was confirmed in 14.5% and moderate to severe generalized anxiety in 13.5% of the sample. The criteria for at least one diagnosis were met by 30.5% of the participants. More severe PTSD symptoms were associated with older age, shorter validity of the residence permit, larger number of traumatic events (TEs) and higher generalized anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms were associated with younger age, shorter duration of escape journey, larger number of TEs and higher generalized anxiety symptoms. Generalized anxiety symptoms correlated with female gender, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Syrian refugees in Germany are a vulnerable population, especially if they have experienced and/or witnessed multiple traumatic events. However, post-migration conditions and positive future prospects in the host country can be protective factors for this population.",2103678294.0, Journal Article,2018
485,A Pro-Inflammatory Diet Is Associated With an Increased Odds of Depression Symptoms Among Iranian Female Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Background: The relation between dietary inflammation and risk of depression has not been widely explored. We examined the association between the inflammatory effect of the diet and the odds of depression among Iranian female adolescents. Methods: Using a stratified cluster sampling technique, 300 female adolescents aged 15-18 years were recruited from schools in Tehran between years 2014-2015. Depression was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)- a 21-point scale. The dietary inflammatory index (DII®) was used to evaluate the inflammatory potential of the diet. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. In addition to descriptive statistics, multivariable linear and logistic regression were used to calculate confounder-adjusted beta estimates and odds ratios. Results: In total, 88 females (30%) had at least a moderate level of depressive symptoms (DASS &gt; 6). Females with the most pro-inflammatory diet had higher DASS depression score (β = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.03, 3.31) and were at 3.96 (95% CI = 1.12, 13.97) times higher odds of having at least moderate depressive symptoms, compared to females with the least anti-inflammatory diets. Conclusion: These data suggest that Iranian adolescent females eating a pro-inflammatory diet, as indicated by higher DII scores, had greater odds of having at least moderate depressive symptoms.",2103678256.0, Journal Article,2018
486,The Double Burdens of Mental Health Among AIDS Patients With Fully Successful Immune Restoration: A Cross-Sectional Study of Anxiety and Depression in China.,"Background: Anxiety and depression continue to be significant comorbidities for people with HIV infection. We investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with anxiety and depression among adult HIV-infected patients across China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we described clinical and psychosocial variables related to depression and anxiety in 4103 HIV-infected persons. Doctors assessed anxiety and depression by asking patients whether they had experienced anxiety or depression in the prior month. Patients also self-administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale; those with score ≥8 on HAD-A/D were considered to be at high risk of anxiety or depression. Results: Associations between socio-demographic, psychosocial, and ART-related clinical factors and risk of depression or anxiety were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Among patients assessed between 9/2014 and 11/2015, 27.4% had symptoms of anxiety, 32.9% had symptoms of depression, and 19.0% had both. Recentness of HIV diagnoses (P = 0.046) was associated with elevated odds of anxiety. Older age (P = 0.004), higher educational attainment (P &lt; 0.001), employment (P = 0.001), support from family / friends (P &lt; 0.001), and sleep disturbance (P &lt; 0.001), and number of ART regimen switches (P = 0.046) were associated with risk of depression, while neither sex nor transmission route showed any associations. There were no significant associations with HIV-specific clinical factors including current CD4+ T cell count and current viral load. Conclusions: Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression is high in this cohort of treatment-experienced HIV patients. Psychological and social-demographic factors, rather than HIV disease status, were associated with risk of depression and anxiety. This finding highlights the need to deliver interventions to address the mental health issues affecting HIV-infected persons with fully successful immune restoration across China.",2101921264.0, Journal Article,2018
487,Mental Health Symptoms and Work-Related Stressors in Hospital Midwives and NICU Nurses: A Mixed Methods Study.,"Hospital midwives and neonatal intensive care (NICU) nurses frequently encounter work-related stressors and are therefore vulnerable to developing mental health problems, such as secondary traumatic stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. However, so far, the exact nature of these work-related stressors (traumatic vs. non-traumatic stressors) has not been investigated. This concurrent triangulation mixed methods cross-sectional study aimed to compare mental health symptoms in hospital midwives and NICU nurses, and to identify and compare work-related traumatic and non-traumatic stressors for both professional groups. 122 midwives and 91 NICU nurses of two Swiss university hospitals completed quantitative measures (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, STSS; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI) and one qualitative question in an online survey. When controlling for socio-demographic variables, NICU nurses had a higher STSS total score and higher STSS subscales scores and less HADS anxiety subscale scores than hospital midwives. Work-related stressors were classified into five themes: ""Working environment,"" ""Nursing/midwifery care,"" ""Dealing with death and dying,"" ""Case management"" and ""Others."" Forty-six (46.3%) percent of these were classified as traumatic work-related stressors. NICU nurses reported more traumatic stressors in their working environment but no other differences between professional groups regarding the total number of work-related traumatic vs. non-traumatic stressors were found. Measures, such as teaching strategies to amend the subjective appraisal of the traumatic stressors or providing time to recover in-between frequently occurring work-related traumatic stressors might not only improve the mental health of professionals but also decrease sick leave and improve the quality of patient care.",2099436430.0, Journal Article,2018
488,From Default Mode Network to the Basal Configuration: Sex Differences in the Resting-State Brain Connectivity as a Function of Age and Their Clinical Correlates.,"Connectomics is a framework that models brain structure and function interconnectivity as a network, rather than narrowly focusing on select regions-of-interest. MRI-derived connectomes can be structural, usually based on diffusion-weighted MR imaging, or functional, usually formed by examining fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlations. Recently, we developed a novel method for assessing the hierarchical modularity of functional brain networks-the probability associated community estimation (PACE). PACE uniquely permits a dual formulation, thus yielding equivalent connectome modular structure regardless of whether positive or negative edges are considered. This method was rigorously validated using the 1,000 functional connectomes project data set (F1000, RRID:SCR_005361) (1) and the Human Connectome Project (HCP, RRID:SCR_006942) (2, 3) and we reported novel sex differences in resting-state connectivity not previously reported. (4) This study further examines sex differences in regard to hierarchical modularity as a function of age and clinical correlates, with findings supporting a basal configuration framework as a more nuanced and dynamic way of conceptualizing the resting-state connectome that is modulated by both age and sex. Our results showed that differences in connectivity between men and women in the 22-25 age range were not significantly different. However, these same non-significant differences attained significance in both the 26-30 age group (p = 0.003) and the 31-35 age group (p &lt; 0.001). At the most global level, areas of diverging sex difference include parts of the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. Further, we identified statistically different self-reported summary scores of inattention, hyperactivity, and anxiety problems between men and women. These self-reports additionally divergently interact with age and the basal configuration between sexes.",2095530433.0, Journal Article,2018
489,Cognitive Impairment and Affective Disorders in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.,"Sleep-related breathing disorders could be accompanied by or caused by a variety of medical conditions. They are considered to be a significant medical and social problem. Together with excessive daytime sleepiness, patients with obstructive sleep apnea experience neuropsychological symptoms such as anxiety, attention deficits, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms and other psychological disturbances leading to social adjustment difficulties. Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea demonstrate a decline in a wide spectrum of cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, psychomotor speed, executive, verbal and visual-spatial skills. The aim of this study is to investigate the cognitive functioning and affective disorders among patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and to examine the frequency and severity of cases in comparison with a control group consisting of healthy volunteers. Our research has shown that there is a relation between sleep apnea and cognitive impairments and affective changes. This relation can be explained by the direct effect of the syndrome on the patient, where the main connecting factor is the severity and the distribution of excessive daytime sleepiness. Along with treatment of the somatic medical condition, it is extremely important that the patient's mental state is treated as well.

490,Alexithymia and Psychopathology in Patients Suffering From Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Arising Differences and Correlations to Tailoring Therapeutic Strategies.,"Comorbidity with anxiety or depression is common in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) as Crohn Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Data suggest that the cognitive construct of alexithymia has high prevalence in people suffering from anxiety and mood disorders and even in people with IBD. Most studies have investigated mainly anxiety and depression, considering IBD population as a homogeneous group of patients. Little evidence shows the impact of alexithymia on the course of IBD. We evaluated a broad spectrum of psychopathological symptoms and alexithymia levels in a group of outpatients affected by IBD in clinical remission, comparing CD and UC and investigating the relationship with clinical and socio-demographic variables. One hundred and seventy IBD outpatients were screened by using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), the Self-report Symptom Inventory-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). A high prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms (42.35 and 25.8% respectively) together with alexithymia (31.76%) was confirmed. CD patients experienced high levels of depression (HADS Depression 35.2% p = 0.034; SCL-90-R mean 1.39 p &lt; 0.001), somatisation (SCL-90-R mean 1.04 p &lt; 0.001), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (SCL-90-R mean 1.2 p &lt; 0.001), and global severity (SCL-90-R mean 1.15 p &lt; 0.001). There is no statistical difference in the prevalence of alexithymia in both subpopulations. The levels of alexithymia are correlated to the levels of anxiety (HADS Anxiety rs = 0.516 p &lt; 0.001), depression (HADS Depression rs = 0.556 p &lt; 0.001; SCL-90-R rs = 0.274 p = 0.001), somatisation (SCL-90-R rs = 0.229 p = 0.005), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (SCL-90-R rs = 0.362 p &lt; 0.001), and global severity (SCL-90-R rs = 0.265 p = 0.001). Furthermore, alexithymia is associated with a delay of diagnosis of IBD, poly-therapies and greater IBD extension. Older age, female gender, greater IBD extension, surgery, and delay of diagnosis seem to be related to a high prevalence of psychopathological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, somatisation, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Psychopathological symptoms and high levels of alexithymia are frequent in IBD patients and seem to be related to a high risk of poor clinical outcome. CD patients could be considered at higher risk of mental comorbidity. A more comprehensive psychiatric assessment, including alexithymia, and an integrated treatment of underlying conditions, must be taken into account in order to improve the global prognosis of the disease.",2091232685.0, Journal Article,2018
491,Prevalence Rates and Predictors of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms in Residents of Fort McMurray Six Months After a Wildfire.,"The Fort McMurray wildfire was the costliest disaster in Canadian history, with far-reaching impacts. The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence and risk factors of elevated generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptomatology in residents of Fort McMurray 6 months after the wildfire. Data were collected via random selection procedures from 486 participants. Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms were measured via the GAD-7. The 1-month prevalence rate for GAD symptomatology 6 months after the disaster was 19.8% overall, regression analyses revealed six variables with significant unique contributions to prediction of GAD symptomatology. Significant predictors were: pre-existing anxiety disorder, witnessing of homes being destroyed by the wildfire, living in a different home after the wildfire, receiving limited governmental support or limited family support, and receiving counseling after the wildfire. Participants with these risk factors were between two to nearly seven times more likely to present with GAD symptomatology. In addition, participants who presented with elevated symptomatology were more likely to increase use or problematically use substances post-disaster. This study extends the literature on mental health conditions and risk factors following disasters, specifically in the area of generalized anxiety. Findings and implications are discussed.",2088747894.0, Journal Article,2018
492,Alexithymia Has No Clinically Relevant Association With Outcome of Multimodal Treatment Tailored to Needs of Patients Suffering From Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders. A Clinical Prospective Study.,"Introduction: Alexithymia may moderate the effectiveness of treatment and may predict impaired general functioning of patients suffering from somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD). Aim: We compared alexithymia levels in a clinical prospective study with 234 consecutive patients suffering from SSRD from the Centre of Excellence for Body, Mind, and Health, Tilburg using the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire, with general population norm scores. Second, we explored treatment outcomes of a multimodal treatment tailored to patient needs by Shared Decision Making (SDM) and Patient Related Outcome Monitoring (PROM) in patients with SSRD. Third, we explored whether alexithymia is associated with treatment outcome. Fourth, we explored if the presence of a chronic medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases) affects the association of alexithymia with treatment outcomes. Results: Compared to norm scores, SSRD patients showed elevated scores on the subscales identifying, verbalizing, and fantasizing, and on the cognitive dimension. All patients benefited from treatment in terms of anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms. The association of alexithymia with treatment outcome was significant, but the effect size was negligible (range odds ratios 1.02-1.25). The association between alexithymia and treatment outcome was stronger in patients suffering from chronic medical conditions compared to patients without chronic medical conditions. However, the effect size of this association was negligible (range odds ratio 0.94-1.12). Discussion: Alexithymia scores are elevated in patients with SSRD compared to general population scores, but the level of alexithymia has no clinically relevant association with treatment outcome both in SSRD patients with and without comorbid chronic medical conditions.",2085671928.0, Journal Article,2018
493,A Survey of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients With and Without Tracheobronchial Tuberculosis.,"Background and Objective: Anxiety/depression and tuberculosis are global public health problems. The incidence of psychiatric morbidities is high among tuberculosis patients. However, little is known about the prevalence of anxiety and depression among Chinese pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, especially those with tracheobronchial tuberculosis (TBTB). The goal of the present study was to explore the prevalence of and associated factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among PTB patients with and without TBTB. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of PTB patients from three hospitals in Liaoning, China, was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Depression and anxiety were evaluated by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: According to HADS and PHQ-9, 17.73 and 18.13% of 1252 PTB patients, respectively, had significant depressive symptoms and based on HADS scale, 18.37% had significant anxiety symptoms. Approximately 70% of patients with probable depression also had significant anxiety symptoms, and vice versa, and 69.6% patients with anxiety symptoms were also diagnosed with probable depression in our study population. Dyspnea and TBTB were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Other depressive symptoms-related factors included age, divorce, abnormal body mass index (BMI), and low income. Patients with lower incomes, symptoms of dyspnea, or a combination of ≥3 clinical symptoms had an increased risk of anxiety symptoms, while patients with occasional or frequent alcohol consumption had a reduced risk of anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common among PTB patients, especially those with TBTB. Screening for depression and anxiety is essential for identifying patients who require further psychosocial assessment and support.",2083715257.0, Journal Article,2018
494,Outcome Evaluation of a Short-Term Hospitalization and Community Support Program for People Who Abuse Ketamine.,"Ketamine is a popular recreational drug among young people in Hong Kong. Long-term abuse of ketamine can lead to acute urological and medical issues, which often require immediate care at emergency rooms. Many patients require short-term hospitalization for medical management. This opens a brief time window, within which mental health professionals could engage young people who abuses ketamine in psychosocial, functional, and lifestyle interventions. The Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) is a short-term hospitalization and community support program that addresses the health care needs of young people who abuse ketamine. During short-term hospitalization, the patient participates in a range of cognitive and psychosocial assessments, motivational interviewing, emotions management, and lifestyle re-design interventions. Upon discharge, social work professionals of non-government agencies continue to work with the patients on their action plans in the community. This evaluation study uses a quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design, in which the outcomes of the treatment group (n = 84) are compared with a comparison group (n = 34) who have a history of ketamine abuse but who have not joined the treatment program. The results confirm that the treatment group showed significant increases in motivation for treatment, reduction in drug use, improvement in cognitive screening tests, healthy lifestyle scores, and self-efficacy in avoidance of drugs over 13 weeks. When compared with the comparison group, the treatment group had significant decreases in anxiety and treatment needs and had moved from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage. However, there were no significant changes in outcome measures covering lifestyle or self-efficacy in drug avoidance. Overall, the CAP is effective in reducing drug use, anxiety, and helping patients to move from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage of change. The study results suggest that health care professionals can successfully engage young people who abuse ketamine to participate in a package of psychosocial interventions, motivational interviewing, and lifestyle re-design during their hospital stay for management of urological problems. The CAP also highlights the importance of collaboration between hospitals and community social services in the management of addiction.",2081542295.0, Journal Article,2018
495,Severe Sleep Deprivation Causes Hallucinations and a Gradual Progression Toward Psychosis With Increasing Time Awake.,"Background: Going without sleep for long periods of time can produce a range of experiences, including perceptual distortions and hallucinations. Many questions, however, remain unanswered regarding the types of symptoms which are most reliably elicited, the time of symptom onset, and whether symptoms worsen over time toward psychotic decompensation. Since sleep deprivation exceeding 48 h is considered unethical today, an examination of historical studies with extreme sleep-loss duration is needed to obtain information about what happens during prolonged sleep loss. Methods: A systematic-review approach was used to identify experimental and observational studies of sleep deprivation in healthy people which describe the effects of prolonged sleep loss on psychopathological symptoms, without any date restriction. Results: A total of 476 articles were identified. Of these, 21 were eligible for inclusion. Duration of sleep loss ranged between 24 h and 11 nights (total 760 participants; average 72-92 h without sleep). All studies except one reported perceptual changes, including visual distortions (i.e., metamorphopsias), illusions, somatosensory changes and, in some cases, frank hallucinations. The visual modality was the most consistently affected (in 90% of the studies), followed by the somatosensory (52%) and auditory (33%) modalities. Symptoms rapidly developed after one night without sleep, progressing in an almost fixed time-dependent way. Perceptual distortions, anxiety, irritability, depersonalization, and temporal disorientation started within 24-48 h of sleep loss, followed by complex hallucinations and disordered thinking after 48-90 h, and delusions after 72 h, after which time the clinical picture resembled that of acute psychosis or toxic delirium. By the third day without sleep, hallucinations in all three sensory modalities were reported. A period of normal sleep served to resolve psychotic symptoms in many-although not all-cases. Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms develop with increasing time awake, from simple visual/somatosensory misperceptions to hallucinations and delusions, ending in a condition resembling acute psychosis. These experiences are likely to resolve after a period of sleep, although more information is required to identify factors which can contribute to the prevention of persistent symptoms.",2076235829.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
496,Impaired Antisaccades in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Evidence From Meta-Analysis and a Large Empirical Study.,"Increasing evidence indicates that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit alterations in fronto-striatal circuitry. Performance deficits in the antisaccade task would support this model, but results from previous small-scale studies have been inconclusive as either increased error rates, prolonged antisaccade latencies, both or neither have been reported in OCD patients. In order to address this issue, we investigated antisaccade performance in a large sample of OCD patients (n = 169) and matched control subjects (n = 183). As impaired antisaccade performance constitutes a potential endophenotype of OCD, unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients (n = 100) were assessed, as well. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis to integrate our data with previous findings. In the empirical study, OCD patients exhibited significantly increased antisaccade latencies, intra-subject variability (ISV) of antisaccade latencies, and antisaccade error rates. The latter effect was driven by errors with express latency (80-130 ms), as patients did not differ significantly from controls with regards to regular errors (&gt;130 ms). Notably, unaffected relatives of OCD patients showed elevated antisaccade express error rates and increased ISV of antisaccade latencies, as well. Antisaccade performance was not associated with state anxiety within groups. Among relatives, however, we observed a significant correlation between antisaccade error rate and harm avoidance. Medication status of OCD patients, symptom severity, depressive comorbidity, comorbid anxiety disorders and OCD symptom dimensions did not significantly affect antisaccade performance. Meta-analysis of 10 previous and the present empirical study yielded a medium-sized effect (SMD = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001) for higher error rates in OCD patients, while the effect for latencies did not reach significance owing to strong heterogeneity (SMD = 0.51, p = 0.069). Our results support the assumption of impaired antisaccade performance in OCD, although effects sizes were only moderately large. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that increased antisaccade express error rates and ISV of antisaccade latencies may constitute endophenotypes of OCD. Findings regarding these more detailed antisaccade parameters point to potentially underlying mechanisms, such as early pre-stimulus inhibition of the superior colliculus.",2070806576.0, Journal Article,2018
497,"Comparison of the Factor Structure of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Somatic Symptoms (PHQ-15) in Germany, the Netherlands, and China. A Transcultural Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Study.","Background: Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with psychological distress, impaired function, and medical help-seeking behavior. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-15 is used as a screening instrument for somatization and as a monitoring instrument for somatic symptom severity. A bifactorial model has been described, with one general factor and four orthogonal specific symptom factors. The objective of the present study was to assess and to clarify the factor structure of the PHQ-15 within and between different countries in Western Europe and China. Method: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis performed in three patient data samples from two Western European countries (Germany N = 2,517, the Netherlands N = 456) and from China (N = 1,329). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis were performed. Results: The general factor is found in every sample. However, although the outcomes of the PHQ-15 estimate severity of somatic symptoms in different facets, these subscales may have different meanings in the European and Chinese setting. Replication of the factorial structure was possible in the German and Dutch datasets but not in the dataset from China. For the Chinese dataset, a bifactorial model with a different structure for the cardiopulmonary factor is suggested. The PHQ-15 could discern somatization from anxiety and depression within the three samples. Conclusion: The PHQ-15 is a valid questionnaire that can discern somatization from anxiety and depression within different cultures like Europe or China. It can be fitted to a bifactorial model for categorical data, however, the model can only be recommended for use of the general factor. Application of the orthogonal subscales in non-European samples is not corroborated by the results. The differences cannot be ascribed to differences in health care settings or by differences in concomitant depression or anxiety but instead, a cultural factor involving concepts of disease may play a role in this as they may play a role in the translation of the questionnaire. Further research is needed to explore this, and replication studies are needed regarding the factorial structure of the PHQ-15 in China.",2068924690.0, Journal Article,2018
498,Aberrant Dynamic Connectivity for Fear Processing in Anorexia Nervosa and Body Dysmorphic Disorder.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) share distorted perceptions of appearance with extreme negative emotion, yet the neural phenotypes of emotion processing remain underexplored in them, and they have never been directly compared. We sought to determine if shared and disorder-specific fronto-limbic connectivity patterns characterize these disorders. FMRI data was obtained from three unmedicated groups: BDD (n = 32), weight-restored AN (n = 25), and healthy controls (HC; n = 37), while they viewed fearful faces and rated their own degree of fearfulness in response. We performed dynamic effective connectivity modeling with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and amygdala as regions-of-interest (ROI), and assessed associations between connectivity and clinical variables. HCs exhibited significant within-group bidirectional mPFC-amygdala connectivity, which increased across the blocks, whereas BDD participants exhibited only significant mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity (P &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected). In contrast, participants with AN lacked significant prefrontal-amygdala connectivity in either direction. AN showed significantly weaker mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity compared to HCs (P = 0.0015) and BDD (P = 0.0050). The mPFC-to-amygdala connectivity was associated with greater subjective fear ratings (R2 = 0.11, P = 0.0016), eating disorder symptoms (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.0029), and anxiety (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.0055) intensity scores. Our findings, which suggest a complex nosological relationship, have implications for understanding emotion regulation circuitry in these related psychiatric disorders, and may have relevance for current and novel therapeutic approaches.",2068924587.0, Journal Article,2018
499,Association of Depression and Anxiety With the 10-Year Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality in a Primary Care Population of Latvia Using the SCORE System.,"Background: Depression and anxiety have been recognized as independent risk factors for both the development and prognosis of cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD). The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) function measures the 10-year risk of a fatal CVD and is a crucial tool for guiding CV patient management. This study is the first in Latvia to investigate the association of depression and anxiety with the 10-year CV mortality risk in a primary care population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at 24 primary care facilities. During a 1-week period in 2015, all consecutive adult patients were invited to complete a nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) followed by sociodemographic questionnaire and physical measurements. The diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was administered by telephone in the period of 2 weeks after the first contact at the primary care facility. A hierarchical multivariate analysis was performed. Results: The study population consisted of 1,569 subjects. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥10) were associated with a 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.33) times higher odds of a very high CV mortality risk (SCORE ≥10%), but current anxiety disorder (M.I.N.I.) reduced the CV mortality risk with an odds ratio of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.38-0.90). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individuals with SCORE ≥10% should be screened and treated for depression to potentially delay the development and improve the prognosis of CVD. Anxiety could possibly have a protective influence on CV prognosis.",2068924526.0, Journal Article,2018
500,Prevalence and Associated Features of Anxiety Disorder Comorbidity in Bipolar Disorder: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression Study.,"Objective: Bipolar disorder is highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, however current and lifetime comorbidity patterns of each anxiety disorder and their associated features are not well studied. Here, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis and meta-regression study of current evidence. Method: We searched PubMed to access relevant articles published until September 2015, using the keywords ""Bipolar disorder"" or ""Affective Psychosis"" or ""manic depressive"" separately with ""generalized anxiety,"" ""panic disorder,"" ""social phobia,"" ""obsessive compulsive,"" and ""anxiety."" Variables for associated features and prevalence of anxiety disorders were carefully extracted. Results: Lifetime any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BD was 40.5%; panic disorder (PD) 18.1%, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 13.3%, social anxiety disorder (SAD) 13.5% and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 9.7%. Current any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BD is 38.2%; GAD is 15.2%, PD 13.3%, SAD 11.7%, and OCD 9.9%. When studies reporting data about comorbidities in BDI or BDII were analyzed separately, lifetime any anxiety disorder comorbidity in BDI and BDII were 38% and 34%, PD was 15% and 15%, GAD was 14% and 16.6%, SAD was 8% and 13%, OCD was 8% and 10%, respectively. Current any DSM anxiety disorder comorbidity in BDI or BDII were 31% and 37%, PD was 9% and 13%, GAD was 8% and 12%, SAD was 7% and 11%, and OCD was 8% and 7%, respectively. The percentage of manic patients and age of onset of BD tended to have a significant impact on anxiety disorders. Percentage of BD I patients significantly decreased the prevalence of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. A higher rate of substance use disorder was associated with greater BD-SAD comorbidity. History of psychotic features significantly affected current PD and GAD. Conclusions: Anxiety disorder comorbidity is high in BD with somewhat lower rates in BDI vs BDII. Age of onset, substance use disorders, and percentage of patients in a manic episode or with psychotic features influences anxiety disorder comorbidity.",2068924096.0, Journal Article,2018
501,Anxiety and Extraversion in Lupus-Related Atherosclerosis.,"Objectives: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are characterized by increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as well as heightened rates of psychological distress. Since a link between psychological issues and CV morbidity has been previously suggested, the influence of psychological burden on subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE patients was investigated. Methods: 71 SLE patients were assessed for the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis-defined either as carotid and/or femoral plaque formation or arterial wall thickening [Intima Media Thickness (IMT) levels &gt; 0.90 mm by Doppler ultrasound]; personality traits, anxiety and depression, sleeping habits and fatigue levels were also evaluated by specific questionnaires including Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Zung Depression Scale, Athens Insomnia Scale and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F). Disease related clinical and laboratory features and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were documented. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: SLE patients with arterial wall thickening displayed higher STAI anxiety scores (either as a current state or as a personality trait) compared to those without (49.8 ± 5.6 vs. 46.9 ± 5.4, p-value: 0.03 and 49.2 ± 4.4 vs. 45.7 ± 6.8, p-value: 0.009, respectively). In a multivariate model, trait anxiety and extraversion personality scores were found to be independently associated with arterial wall thickening and plaque formation, respectively [OR95%(CI):1.2(1.0-1.5) and 0.7(0.6-1.0), respectively], following adjustment for potential confounders. No other associations were detected. Conclusions: Anxiety and extraversion personality traits have been independently associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in lupus patients, implying psychoneuroimmunological interactions as contributors in SLE related atherosclerosis.",2064240176.0, Journal Article,2018
502,Increased Default Mode Network Connectivity in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder During Reward Processing.,"Objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by anxiety-provoking, obsessive thoughts (i.e., obsessions) which patients react to with compulsive behaviors (i.e., compulsions). Due to the transient feeling of relief following the reduction of obsession-induced anxiety, compulsions are often described as relieving or even rewarding. Several studies investigated functional activation during reward processing in OCD, but findings are heterogeneous up to now and little is known about potential alterations in functional connectivity. Method: Against this background we studied OCD patients (n = 44) and healthy controls (n = 37) during the receipt of monetary reward by assessing both activation and functional connectivity. Results: Patients showed a decreased activation in several frontal regions and the posterior cingulate (PCC, BA31) together with a stronger connectivity between the PCC and the vmPFC (BA10). Conclusion: Present findings demonstrate an increased connectivity in patients within major nodes of the default mode network (DMN)-a network known to be involved in the evaluation of internal mental states. These results may indicate an increased activity of internal, self-related processing at the expense of a normal responsiveness toward external rewards and incentives. This, in turn, may explain the constant urge for additional reinforcement and patients' inability to inhibit their compulsive behaviors.",2061402309.0, Journal Article,2018
503,Do Parent Mental Illness and Family Living Arrangement Moderate the Effects of the Aussie Optimism Program on Depression and Anxiety in Children?,"Parent mental illness and family living arrangement are associated with depression and anxiety in children, and may influence the effects of programs that aim to prevent these disorders. This study investigated whether these family context factors moderated the intervention effects of the enhanced Aussie Optimism Positive Thinking Skills program on depression and anxiety in primary school children. The intervention was a universal, cognitive-behavioral program, with a one hour session each week for 10 weeks, delivered by trained teachers. The participants were 502 children from 13 private schools, aged 9-11, with 347 in the intervention group and 155 in the control group. There were 267 females and 235 males. Data from 502 parents was also included. A cluster randomized controlled trial design was used, including eight intervention schools and five control schools. Depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and 6-months follow-up. Information on parent mental illness and family living arrangement was collected through a parent questionnaire. The data was analyzed using covariance analysis with Generalized Linear Mixed Methods. At baseline, depressive and anxiety symptoms did not differ significantly based on parent mental illness. Symptoms of depression at baseline were significantly higher for children from a higher-risk family living arrangement, but anxiety symptoms were not. Parent mental illness and family living arrangement did not moderate the effects of the program on depression and anxiety at post-test or 6-months follow-up. Parent mental illness moderated the intervention effects on negative self-esteem, an aspect of depression, at post-test, with improvements seen only for children who did not have a parent with a mental illness. The findings indicate an association between family living arrangement and depressive symptoms in children. The findings suggest that the program is effective for children regardless of parent mental illness or family living arrangement, although parent mental illness has the capacity to influence the program's outcomes.",2060868751.0, Journal Article,2018

SCD individuals with normal cognition may already have significant medial temporal lobe atrophy. However, few studies have been devoted to exploring the alteration of left-right asymmetry with hippocampus and amygdala in SCD. The aim of this study was to compare SCD individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and the normal population for volume and asymmetry of hippocampus, amygdala and temporal horn, and to assess their relationship with cognitive function in elderly population living in China. Methods: 111 SCD, 30 MCI, and 67 healthy controls (HC) underwent a standard T1-weighted MRI, from which the volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala were calculated and compared. Then we evaluated the pattern and extent of asymmetry in hippocampus and amygdala of these samples. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationship between the altered brain regions and cognitive function. Results: Among the three groups, SCD showed more depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001) and higher percentage of heart disease (16.4% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.007) than controls. In terms of brain data, significant differences were found in the volume and asymmetry of both hippocampus and amygdala among the three groups (P &lt; 0.05). In logistic analysis controlled by age, gender, education level, depression symptoms, anxiety symptom, somatic disease and lifestyle in terms of smoking, both SCD and MCI individuals showed significant decreased right hippocampal and amygdala volume than controls. For asymmetry pattern, a ladder-shaped difference of left-larger-than-right asymmetry was found in amygdala with MCI&gt;SCD&gt;HC, and an opposite asymmetry of left-less-than-right pattern was found with HC&gt;SCD&gt;MCI in hippocampus. Furthermore, correlation was shown between the volume of right hippocampus and right amygdala with MMSE and MoCA in SCD group. Conclusion: Our results supported that SCD individuals are biologically distinguishable from HC, and this may relate to cognitive impairment, although more longitudinal studies are need to investigate this further.Moreover, different levels of asymmetry in hippocampus and amygdala might be a potential dividing factor to differentiate clinical diagnosis.",2059579855.0, Journal Article,2018
505,Synaptic Ultrastructure Might Be Involved in HCN1-Related BDNF mRNA in Withdrawal-Anxiety After Ethanol Dependence.,"Withdrawal from ethanol dependence has been associated with heightened anxiety and reduced expression of Brain-derived neurotropic factor which promotes the synaptic transmission and plasticity of synapses. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 regulates expression; however, whether Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1-related Brain-derived neurotropic factor is involved in the synaptic ultrastructure that generates withdrawal-anxiety has been poorly perceived. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ethanol 3-9% (v/v) for a period of 21 days. Conditioned place preference and body weight were investigated during ethanol administration. Rats were subjected to behavioral testing and biochemical assessments after ethanol withdrawal, which was induced by abrupt discontinuation of the treatment. The results showed that the ethanol administration induced severe ethanol dependence behaviors, with higher body weight and more time in the ethanol-paired compartment. After withdrawal, rats had a higher total ethanol withdrawal score and explored less. Additionally, increased Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 protein and gene expression and decreased Brain-derived neurotropic factor protein and gene expression were detected in the Ethanol group. Eventually, there was a negative correlation between the level of Brain-derived neurotropic factor mRNA and Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 protein. Importantly, the synaptic ultrastructure changed in the Ethanol group, including increased synaptic cleft width and reduction in postsynaptic density thickness or synaptic curvature. The synthesis of the Brain-derived neurotropic factor mRNA could be down-regulated by higher Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 protein expression. Changes in synaptic ultrastructure may be induced by lower Brain-derived neurotropic factor protein, which could be associated with the withdrawal-anxiety that is experiences after ethanol dependence.",2054964913.0, Journal Article,2018
506,Self-Reported Sleep Quality Modulates Amygdala Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Anxiety and Depression.,"Sufficient sleep plays an important role in neurocognitive function, yet, problematic sleep is ubiquitous in the general population. It is also frequently predictive of, and concurrent with, internalizing psychopathologies (IPs) such as anxiety and depression suggesting sleep quality is dimensional and transdiagnostic. Along with problematic sleep, IPs are characterized by negative affectivity, therefore, prominent neurobiological models of internalizing conditions involve the amygdala, a region central to emotion. In resting-state studies (independent of sleep considerations), abnormalities in amygdala-frontal functional connectivity are commonly observed suggesting emotion dysregulation may contribute to clinically-relevant phenotypes. In a separate line of research, studies of sleep deprivation, and insomnia disorder suggest sleep loss may alter amygdala-frontal connectivity. Taken together, findings point to shared neurobiology between sleep and emotion systems, however, the impact of sleep quality on the amygdala circuit in anxiety or depression is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated variance in naturalistic sleep quality on amygdala-based circuity in individuals with and without psychiatric illness. Resting-state fMRI data was collected in 87 un-medicated, treatment-seeking adults diagnosed with a primary anxiety disorder (n = 68) or primary depressive disorder (n = 19) in addition to healthy individuals (n = 40). Regression analysis was conducted with bilateral anatomical amygdala as seed regions and self-reported sleep quality was indexed with a validated self-report measure, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate whether diagnostic status (primary anxiety, primary depression, healthy) significantly explained functional connectivity results. Whole-brain regression analysis, controlling for anxiety and depression symptoms, revealed worse sleep quality (i.e., higher PSQI total scores) predicted increased left amygdala-subgenual anterior cingulate functional connectivity and reduced connectivity with posterior cerebellar lobe and superior temporal gyrus. For right amygdala, increased coupling with postcentral gyrus corresponded with worse sleep. Post-hoc analysis did not detect a significant relationship between diagnostic status and whole-brain findings. Results expand on previous studies and indicate variance in sleep quality tracks brain pathways involved in cognitive-emotion functions implicated in the neurobiology of IPs that may extend to individuals at risk for clinical anxiety or depression. Altogether, the clinical relevance of identifying phenotypes to improve our understanding of psychopathology may be improved by incorporating sleep quality.",2054961484.0, Journal Article,2018
507,Exploring Mental Health Status and Syndrome Patterns Among Young Refugee Children in Germany.,"Refugee children share a large number of pre-, peri-, and post-migration risk factors, which make them vulnerable for developing mental health concerns. Within the last few years, a large number of families with young children have sought refuge in Germany. However, children's mental health status in Germany is mostly unclear. A central aim of developmental psychopathology is to understand how risk factors lead to the emergence of mental health concerns. One approach to investigating this association is the study of specificity, which describes the idea that specific risk factors are related to specific psychological outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the mental health status of young refugee children in Germany, and to explore a potential refugee-specific mental health pattern. In two studies, we assessed mental health outcomes of 93 children from Syria or Iraq, aged 1.5-5 years, who recently arrived in Germany. The results were compared to U.S. norm data of typically developing children, and to norm data of a clinical sample in order to explore mental health patterns. In the first study (n = 35), we used standardized screening tools for parents (CBCL 1.5-5). In the second study (n = 58), mental health states of refugee children were assessed by caretakers (CTRF 1.5-5). In comparison to U.S. norm data of normally developing children, refugee parents reported more mental health concerns for their children, especially on syndrome scales of internalizing difficulties. A comparison to U.S. clinical reference data showed a specific mental health pattern, characterized by increased levels of anxiety/depression, attention problems, and withdrawal behavior. Caretakers, too, reported more mental health problems compared to typically developing children, albeit to a smaller extent. However, a comparison to clinically-referred children only led to partial confirmation of a specific mental health pattern. Our studies offer important insights into the mental health status and pattern of young refugee children, which is essential for preventing the onset of psychopathology and for offering tailored interventions.",2053280462.0, Journal Article,2018
508,All Unhappy Childhoods Are Unhappy in Their Own Way-Differential Impact of Dimensions of Adverse Childhood Experiences on Adult Mental Health and Health Behavior.,"Adverse childhood experiences have consistently been linked with poor mental and somatic health in adulthood. However, due to methodological restraints of the main lines of research using cumulative or selective models, little is known about the differential impact of different dimensions of adverse childhood experiences. Therefore, we gathered data from 396 psychiatric in-patients on the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) questionnaire, extracted dimensions using factor analysis and compared this dimensional model of adverse childhood experiences to cumulative and selective models. Household Dysfunction (violence against the mother, parental divorce, substance abuse or incarceration of a household member) was associated with poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol dependency and obesity as proxy marker for an imbalance between energy intake and physical activity) and with poorer socio-economic achievement (lower education and income) in adulthood. The previously reported associations of maltreatment and sexual abuse with these outcome criteria could not be corroborated. Both Maltreatment (emotional and physical neglect and abuse) and Sexual Abuse predicted BPD, PTSD and suicidal behavior. However, the two ACE dimensions showed sufficiently divergent validity to warrant separate consideration in future studies: Maltreatment was associated with affective and anxiety disorders such as social phobia, panic disorder and major depressive disorder, whereas Sexual Abuse was associated with dysregulation of bodily sensations such as pain intensity and hunger/satiation. Also, we found both quantitative and qualitative evidence for the superiority of the dimensional approach to exploring the consequences of adverse childhood experiences in comparison to the cumulative and selective approaches.",2051661978.0, Journal Article,2018
509,Trapped in a Daydream: Daily Elevations in Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With Daily Psychopathological Symptoms.,"Background: Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) characterizes individuals who engage in vivid, fanciful daydreaming for hours on end, neglecting real-life relationships and responsibilities, resulting in clinical distress and functional impairment. Sufferers have embraced the term MD in cyber-communities devoted to this problem because it seemed to uniquely fit their experience and since existing diagnostic labels and their therapies seemed inadequate. However, scientific research in the field has been scarce, relying on cross-sectional or case study designs. Existing knowledge on MD suggests the involvement of dissociative and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as positive reinforcement comparable to processes in addiction disorders. The present study aimed to rigorously explore factors that accompany MD employing a longitudinal daily-diary design, hypothesizing that temporal increases in MD will associate concurrently with, and will temporally precede, other symptoms and emotional changes. In addition, we aimed to explore which symptoms may act as precursors to increases in MD, in order to identify possible mechanisms bringing about daydreaming in these individuals. Methods: In a sample of 77 self-diagnosed individuals with MD we assessed relevant daily symptoms for 14 days, including MD, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociation, as well as positive and negative emotion. Results: Increases in MD were strongly related to concurrent increases in all other symptoms and negative emotion, and to decreased positive emotion. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation, and negative emotion also temporally followed MD. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were the only consistent temporal antecedent of MD. Conclusions: MD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms coincided in what seems to be a vicious cycle; understanding possible shared mechanisms between these symptoms may inform our understanding of the etiology of MD. For example, Serotonin levels may possibly be involved in the development or maintenance of this condition. The findings may also provide clues as to potentially beneficial interventions for treating MD. For example, perhaps utilizing response prevention techniques may be useful for curbing or intercepting unwanted daydreaming. Future studies on MD should address its compulsory nature.",2050486074.0, Journal Article,2018
510,Single-Prolonged Stress: A Review of Two Decades of Progress in a Rodent Model of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common, costly, and often debilitating psychiatric condition. However, the biological mechanisms underlying this disease are still largely unknown or poorly understood. Considerable evidence indicates that PTSD results from dysfunction in highly-conserved brain systems involved in stress, anxiety, fear, and reward. Pre-clinical models of traumatic stress exposure are critical in defining the neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD, which will ultimately aid in the development of new treatments for PTSD. Single prolonged stress (SPS) is a pre-clinical model that displays behavioral, molecular, and physiological alterations that recapitulate many of the same alterations observed in PTSD, illustrating its validity and giving it utility as a model for investigating post-traumatic adaptations and pre-trauma risk and protective factors. In this manuscript, we review the present state of research using the SPS model, with the goals of (1) describing the utility of the SPS model as a tool for investigating post-trauma adaptations, (2) relating findings using the SPS model to findings in patients with PTSD, and (3) indicating research gaps and strategies to address them in order to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD.",2050485775.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
511,Study on the Therapeutic Effects of Drug and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy on Non-Erosive Reflux Disease Patients With Emotional Disorders.,"Objective To assess the correlation between the incidence of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and mental and psychological factors, deepen the understanding of the pathogenesis of NERD and explore effective treatments.
 Methods NERD patients with mood disorders who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into a drug treatment group, a psychotherapy group, and a psychotherapy combined with drug treatment group. Before and after treatment, the patients were retrospectively analyzed using the gastroesophageal reflux disease Questionnaire, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale.
 Results All three treatments were found to relieve patients' symptoms and improve their quality of life to some extent. The psychotherapy combined with drug treatment group showed the best overall curative effect. The Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scale scores were significantly lower in the psychotherapy-alone group and psychotherapy combined with drug treatment group than in the drug treatment alone group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (P &lt; 0.05).
 Conclusion Medication, psychotherapy, and psychotherapy combined with medication can relieve clinical symptoms and improve quality of life to varying degrees in patients with NERD.",2050485631.0, Journal Article,2018
512,Intimate Partner Violence May Be One Mechanism by Which Male Partner Socioeconomic Status and Substance Use Affect Female Partner Health.,"Background: Although male partners' socioeconomic status (SES) and substance use is associated with worse health of female partners, the mechanism behind this link is still unknown. Objectives: To investigate whether intimate partner violence (IPV) is a mechanism by which male partners' SES and substance use influence female partners' self-rated health (SRH) as victims and survivors of IPV. Materials and Methods: Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) is an ongoing population-based cohort. Male and female partners' SES, anxiety, depression, and substance use, and their relationship status were measured at baseline. IPV victimization was also asked among female partners' at baseline. Female partners' subjective health was measured 3 times (baseline-1998, 3 years later-2001, and 5 years later-2003). Using AMOS, we fitted two structural equation models (SEM) for data analysis. In Model 1 we tested direct paths from male partners' SES and mental health to female partners' SRH, in the absence of IPV. In the Model 2 we conceptualized female partners' IPV victimization between male partners' SES and mental health and female partners' SRH. In both models we controlled for the effect of female partners' SES and mental health. Results: In Model 1, male partners' poor SES and substance use were associated with worse trajectory of SRH of female partner. In Model 2, male to female IPV was the mechanism by which male partners' SES and substance use were associated with female partners' SRH. Conclusions: IPV is one of the mechanisms by which male partners' SES and substance use can influence female partners' health. That is, IPV may operate as a vehicle by which male partners' social and psychological risk factors impact female partners' health. Thus, this study demonstrates how male partners' socio-ecological risk factors such as low SES and substance use impact female partners' health. Therefore, there is a need for broader socio-ecological approach to IPV prevention and intervention that recognizes the relationship between male partners' risk factors and their female partners' health outcomes. Such approach can inform prevention and treatment of IPV and enhance partner wellbeing.",2050485250.0, Journal Article,2018
513,First and Subsequent Lifetime Alcoholism and Mental Disorders in Suicide Victims With Reference to a Community Sample-the Lundby Study 1947-1997.,"Background: Suicide victims have been found to frequently suffer from mental disorders, often more than one, and comorbidity has also been found to be a risk factor for suicide. The aim of the present study was to determine the first disorder and possible subsequent disorders in suicide victims during their lifetimes and to compare their development with the development of mental and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in a community sample. Methods: The Lundby Study is a prospective longitudinal study of mental health in a general population comprising 3,563 subjects, including 68 suicide victims, followed by four field investigations from 1947 to 1997; mortality was monitored up to 2011. Results: AUD was most common as a first diagnosis (26/68, 38.2%) among suicide victims, followed by ""depression"" (20/68, 29.4%) and ""anxiety"" (7/68, 10.3%). A predominance of AUD as a first diagnosis was found in the male group, whereas ""depression"" was the most common first diagnosis in the female group. However, there were very few females with AUD in the Lundby Study. In the whole population, it was more common for someone who started with an AUD to develop a subsequent mental disorder than the other way around. The same was true for AUD in relation to depression. Conclusions: AUD was the most common first mental disorder among male suicide victims and could thus be considered a starting point in the suicidal process. We propose that in addition to detecting and treating depression, it is important to detect and treat AUD vigorously and to be alert for subsequent symptoms of depressive and other mental disorders in suicide prevention efforts.",2041630327.0, Journal Article,2018
514,Altered Amygdala Resting-State Functional Connectivity and Hemispheric Asymmetry in Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder.,"Background: The amygdala plays a key role in emotional hyperreactivity in response to social threat in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FCN) of the left and right amygdala with various brain regions and functional lateralization in patients with SAD. Methods: A total of 36 patients with SAD and 42 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest. Using the left and right amygdala as seed regions, we compared the strength of the rs-FCN in the patient and control groups. Furthermore, we investigated group differences in the hemispheric asymmetry of the functional connectivity maps of the left and right amygdala. Results: Compared with healthy controls, the rs-FCN between the left amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was reduced in patients with SAD, whereas left amygdala connectivity with the fusiform gyrus, anterior insula, supramarginal gyrus, and precuneus was increased or positively deflected in the patient group. Additionally, the strength rs-FCN between the left amygdala and anterior insula was positively associated with the severity of the fear of negative evaluation in patients with SAD (r = 0.338, p = 0.044). The rs-FCN between the right amygdala and medial frontal gyrus was decreased in patients with SAD compared with healthy controls, whereas connectivity with the parahippocampal gyrus was greater in the patient group than in the control group. The hemispheric asymmetry patterns in the anterior insula, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and inferior frontal gyrus of the patient group were opposite those of the control group, and functional lateralization of the connectivity between the amygdala and the IPS was associated with the severity of social anxiety symptoms (r = 0.365, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in addition to impaired fronto-amygdala communication, the functional lateralization of amygdala function plays a central role in the pathophysiology of SAD.",2038703942.0, Journal Article,2018
515,Pre-conceptional and Peri-Gestational Maternal Binge Alcohol Drinking Produces Inheritance of Mood Disturbances and Alcohol Vulnerability in the Adolescent Offspring.,"Although binge drinking is on the rise in women of reproductive age and during pregnancy, the consequences in the offspring, in particular the inheritance of alcohol-related mood disturbances and alcohol abuse vulnerability, are still poorly investigated. In this study, we modeled both Habitual- and Binge Alcohol Drinking (HAD and BAD) in female rats by employing a two-bottle choice paradigm, with 20% alcohol and water. The exposure started 12 weeks before pregnancy and continued during gestation and lactation. The consequences induced by the two alcohol drinking patterns in female rats were assessed before conception in terms of behavioral reactivity, anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Afterwards, from adolescence to young-adulthood, male offspring was assessed for behavioral phenotype and alcohol abuse vulnerability. At pre-conceptional time BAD female rats showed higher mean alcohol intake and preference than HAD group; differences in drinking trajectories were attenuated during pregnancy and lactation. Pre-conceptional BAD induced a prevalent depressive/anhedonic-like behavior in female rats, rather than an increase in anxiety-like behavior, as observed in HAD rats. In the adolescent offspring, peri-gestational BAD did not affect behavioral reactivity in the open field and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Rather, BAD dams offspring displayed higher despair-behavior and lower social interaction with respect to control- and HAD dams progeny. Notably, only binge drinking exposure increased offspring vulnerability to alcohol abuse and relapse following forced abstinence. This is the first report showing that binge-like alcohol consumption from pre-conceptional until weaning induces relevant consequences in the affective phenotype of both the mothers and the offspring, and that such effects include heightened alcohol abuse vulnerability in the offspring. These findings highlight the need for more incisive public education campaigns about detrimental consequences of peri-gestational alcohol exposure.",2037057938.0, Journal Article,2018
516,"Increased Risk of Psychiatric Disorders in Allergic Diseases: A Nationwide, Population-Based, Cohort Study.","Background/objective Allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and psychiatric disorders, are major health issues. There have been reports that allergic diseases were associated with depression or anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate the association between these allergic diseases and the risk of developing overall psychiatric disorders in patients from Taiwan.
 Methods This cohort study used the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. A total of 186,588 enrolled patients, with 46,647 study subjects who had suffered from allergic diseases, and 139,941 controls matched for sex and age, from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Dataset of 2000-2015, were selected from a sub-dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database. Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval, for the risk of allergic diseases being associated with the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 15 years of follow-up.
 Results Of the study subjects, 5,038 (10.8%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 9,376 (6.7%) in the control group, with significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). Fine and Gray's competing risk model analysis revealed that the adjusted HR was 1.659 (95% CI = 1.602-1.717, p &lt; 0.001). In this study, we found that the groups of atopic dermatitis alone and the allergic rhinitis + atopic dermatitis were associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders, but all the other four groups, such as bronchial asthma alone, allergic rhinitis alone, bronchial asthma + allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma + atopic dermatitis, and the combination of all these three allergic diseases, were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders.
 Conclusion Allergic diseases are therefore associated with a 1.66-fold increased hazard of psychiatric disorders in Taiwan.",2036789720.0, Journal Article,2018
517,Impulsive Internet Game Play Is Associated With Increased Functional Connectivity Between the Default Mode and Salience Networks in Depressed Patients With Short Allele of Serotonin Transporter Gene.,"Problematic Internet game play is often accompanied by major depressive disorder (MDD). Depression seems to be closely related to altered functional connectivity (FC) within (and between) the default mode network (DMN) and salience network. In addition, serotonergic neurotransmission may regulate the symptoms of depression, including impulsivity, potentially by modulating the DMN. We hypothesized that altered connectivity between the DMN and salience network could mediate an association between the 5HTTLPR genotype and impulsivity in patients with depression. A total of 54 participants with problematic Internet game play and MDD completed the research protocol. We genotyped for 5HTTLPR and assessed the DMN FC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The severity of Internet game play, depressive symptoms, anxiety, attention and impulsivity, and behavioral inhibition and activation were assessed using the Young Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS), Beck Depressive Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Korean Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder scale, and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Scales (BIS-BAS), respectively. The SS allele was associated with increased FC within the DMN, including the middle prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to the posterior cingulate cortex, and within the salience network, including the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) to the right rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC), right anterior insular (AInsular) to right SMG, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to left RPFC, and left AInsular to right RPFC, and between the DMN and salience network, including the MPFC to the ACC. In addition, the FC from the MPFC to ACC positively correlated with the BIS and YIAS scores in the SS allele group. The SS allele of 5HTTLPR might modulate the FC within and between the DMN and salience network, which may ultimately be a risk factor for impulsive Internet game play in patients with MDD.",2030939110.0, Journal Article,2018
518,Impaired Cognitive Control of Emotional Conflict in Trait Anxiety: A Preliminary Study Based on Clinical and Non-Clinical Individuals.,"Background It has been observed that trait anxiety easily leads to conflict maladaptation under conflict circumstances. However, it remains unclear whether the precise neural mechanisms underlying the effects of high trait anxiety (HTA) on cognitive control are consistent in high trait anxious individuals, with and without anxiety disorders.
 Methods The present study recruited 29 healthy volunteers with low trait anxiety (LTA), 37 healthy volunteers with HTA, and 23 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). All participants completed demographic information and self-report measures of trait anxiety and depression. Then, they performed the emotional flanker task with event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded.
 Results Behavioral data manifested that, relative to LTA individuals, GAD patients displayed prolonged response times and increased error rates, while HTA individuals showed intact response times and accuracies. Event-related potential (ERP) data revealed that HTA individuals exhibited a trend toward more negative N2 amplitudes for conflict detection. By contrast, both HTA and GAD individuals displayed decreased P3 amplitudes for conflict resolution. ERP results indicated that both HTA and GAD individuals exhibited conflict maladaptation on the N2 amplitude. Correlation analyses also showed that the increased anxiety symptoms were associated with longer reaction times, more error rates, lower P3 amplitudes, and more perturbations in conflict adaptation on reaction times and N2 amplitudes.
 Conclusion Our results demonstrated a severely impaired cognitive control in GAD patients while a moderately impaired cognitive control in HTA individuals. Trait anxiety can indeed serve as a predominant factor at the onset and in the maintenance of GAD. Therefore, the trait anxiety reducing strategies may provide significant therapeutic gains.",2029633646.0, Journal Article,2018
519,Decision-Making in Suicidal Behavior: The Protective Role of Loss Aversion.,"Background Loss aversion is a central and well operationalized trait behavior that describes the tendency for humans to strongly prefer avoiding losses to making equivalent gains. Human decision-making is thus biased toward safer choices.
 Aim The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between loss aversion and suicidal behavior in a large cohort of adolescents recruited in 30 schools of seven European countries for a longitudinal study (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN65120704). We hypothesized that individuals with higher loss aversion would be less likely to attempt suicide.
 Methods A mixed monetary gamble task was used to generate loss aversion scores for each participant. Logistic regression was used to estimate the cross-sectional association between loss aversion and life-time suicide attempts in the baseline sample (N = 2,158; 156 attempters), and incident attempts were predicted in a 4-month prospective model (N = 1,763; 75 attempters). Multiple regression was used to estimate the association between loss aversion and suicidal ideation.
 Results Loss aversion was a significant predictor of attempted suicide in both the cross-sectional (OR = 0.79; P = 0.005) and prospective analysis (OR = 0.81; P = 0.040), adjusting for depression, anxiety, stress, and sex. The correlation between pre and post measures of loss aversion was r = 0.52 (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, although depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with suicidal ideation, loss aversion was not (cross-sectional model: P = 0.092; Prospective model: P = 0.390). This suggests that the concept of loss aversion may be useful in understanding the transition from suicidal thoughts to attempts.
 Conclusion This and previous studies suggest that altered decision-making is involved in suicide attempts. In our study, we show the involvement of loss aversion in particular, and propose that individuals high in loss aversion are discouraged from carrying out the suicide attempt because of a greater focus on the negative consequences of the decision.",2028953145.0, Journal Article,2018
520,"Emotional Responses to Suicidal Patients: Factor Structure, Construct, and Predictive Validity of the Therapist Response Questionnaire-Suicide Form.","Background Mental health professionals have a pivotal role in suicide prevention. However, they also often have intense emotional responses, or countertransference, during encounters with suicidal patients. Previous studies of the Therapist Response Questionnaire-Suicide Form (TRQ-SF), a brief novel measure aimed at probing a distinct set of suicide-related emotional responses to patients found it to be predictive of near-term suicidal behavior among high suicide-risk inpatients. The purpose of this study was to validate the TRQ-SF in a general outpatient clinic setting.
 Methods Adult psychiatric outpatients (N = 346) and their treating mental health professionals (N = 48) completed self-report assessments following their first clinic meeting. Clinician measures included the TRQ-SF, general emotional states and traits, therapeutic alliance, and assessment of patient suicide risk. Patient suicidal outcomes and symptom severity were assessed at intake and one-month follow-up. Following confirmatory factor analysis of the TRQ-SF, factor scores were examined for relationships with clinician and patient measures and suicidal outcomes.
 Results Factor analysis of the TRQ-SF confirmed three dimensions: (1) affiliation, (2) distress, and (3) hope. The three factors also loaded onto a single general factor of negative emotional response toward the patient that demonstrated good internal reliability. The TRQ-SF scores were associated with measures of clinician state anger and anxiety and therapeutic alliance, independently of clinician personality traits after controlling for the state- and patient-specific measures. The total score and three subscales were associated in both concurrent and predictive ways with patient suicidal outcomes, depression severity, and clinicians' judgment of patient suicide risk, but not with global symptom severity, thus indicating specifically suicide-related responses.
 Conclusion The TRQ-SF is a brief and reliable measure with a 3-factor structure. It demonstrates construct validity for assessing distinct suicide-related countertransference to psychiatric outpatients. Mental health professionals' emotional responses to their patients are concurrently indicative and prospectively predictive of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Thus, the TRQ-SF is a useful tool for the study of countertransference in the treatment of suicidal patients and may help clinicians make diagnostic and therapeutic use of their own responses to improve assessment and intervention for individual suicidal patients.",2028952798.0, Journal Article,2018
521,Recognizing Psychiatric Comorbidity With Reading Disorders.,"Reading disorder (RD), a specific learning disorder (SLD) of reading that includes impairment in word reading, reading fluency, and/or reading comprehension, is common in the general population but often is not comprehensively understood or assessed in mental health settings. In education settings, comorbid mental and associated disorders may be inadequately integrated into intervention plans. Assessment and intervention for RD may be delayed or absent in children with frequently co-occurring mental disorders not fully responding to treatment in both school and mental health settings. To address this oversight, this review summarizes current knowledge regarding RDs and common comorbid or co-occurring disorders that are important for mental health and school settings. We chose to highlight RD because it is the most common SLD, and connections to other often comorbid disorders have been more thoroughly described in the literature. Much of the literature we describe is on decoding-based RD (or developmental dyslexia) as it is the most common form of RD. In addition to risk for academic struggle and social, emotional, and behavioral problems, those with RD often show early evidence of combined or intertwined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition childhood disorders. These include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and other SLDs. The present review highlights issues and areas of controversy within these comorbidities, as well as directions for future research. An interdisciplinary, integrated approach between mental health professionals and educators can lead to comprehensive and targeted treatments encompassing both academic and mental health interventions. Such targeted treatments may contribute to improved educational and health-related outcomes in vulnerable youth. While there is a growing research literature on this association, more studies are needed of when to intervene and of the early and long-term benefits of comprehensive intervention.",2024018433.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
522,Non-Dependent and Dependent Daily Cannabis Users Differ in Mental Health but Not Prospective Memory Ability.,"Research suggests that daily cannabis users have impaired memory for past events, but it is not clear whether they are also impaired in prospective memory (PM) for future events. The present study examined PM in daily cannabis users who were either dependent (n = 18) or non-dependent (n = 18), and compared them with non-using controls (n = 18). The effect of future event simulation (FES) on PM performance was also examined. Participants were matched across groups on age, gender, and highest level of education. The virtual week (VW) was used to objectively assess PM abilities, both at baseline and following FES. Other measures used were: cannabis use variables, immediate and delayed prose recall, phonemic and category fluency, spot-the-word test (premorbid intelligence), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a measure of schizotypy (Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences: unusual experiences subscale). No group differences were found in PM performance on the VW, and FES did not improve PM performance in any group. Dependent cannabis users scored higher on depression, anxiety, and schizotypy than both other groups with non-dependent cannabis users scoring at a similar level to controls. There were no group differences in alcohol use. Findings suggest that when carefully matched on baseline variables, and not differing in premorbid IQ or alcohol use, young, near-daily cannabis users do not differ from non-using controls in PM performance.",2024015949.0, Journal Article,2018
523,Increased Salience Network Activity in Patients With Insomnia Complaints in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Background Insomnia is one of the main symptom correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the neural mechanisms underlying the multifaceted interplay between insomnia and depression are not fully understood.
 Materials and methods Patients with MDD and high insomnia (MDD-HI, n = 24), patients with MDD and low insomnia (MDD-LI, n = 37), and healthy controls (HCs, n = 51) were recruited to participate in the present study. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) during the resting state were compared among the three groups.
 Results We observed ALFF differences between the three groups in the right inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/AI), right middle temporal gyrus, left calcarine, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Further region of interest (ROI) comparisons showed that the increases in the right IFG/AI reflected an abnormality specific to insomnia in MDD, while increases in the bilateral dlPFC reflected an abnormality specific to MDD generally. Increased ALFF in the right IFG/AI was also found to be correlated with sleep disturbance scores when regressing out the influence of the severity of anxiety and depression.
 Conclusion Our findings suggest that increased resting state ALLF in IFG/AI may be specifically related to hyperarousal state of insomnia in patients with MDD, independently of the effects of anxiety and depression.",2021733706.0, Journal Article,2018
524,"Utilization of Mental Health Care, Treatment Patterns, and Course of Psychosocial Functioning in Northern German Coronary Artery Disease Patients with Depressive and/or Anxiety Disorders.","Background Comorbid mental disorders in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are common and associated with adverse somatic outcomes. However, data on utilization rates of mental health care and treatment efficiency are scarce and inconsistent, which we tried to remedy with the present preliminary study on Northern German CAD patients.
 Method A total of 514 German CAD patients, as diagnosed by cardiac catheterization, were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale.
 Results Global utilization of mental health care since onset of CAD was 21.0%. Depressive disorders, younger age, and lower GAF at onset of CAD were associated with higher utilization rates, while anxiety disorders and gender were not. Lower GAF at onset of CAD, female gender, and psychotherapy was positively associated with higher gains in GAF, while younger age and anxiety disorders were negatively associated.
 Conclusion The majority of CAD patients with comorbid depression reported to have received mental health treatment and seemed to have benefited from it. However, we found preliminary evidence of insufficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders in CAD patients. Further studies, preferably prospective and with representative samples, are needed to corroborate or falsify these findings and explore possible further mediators of health-care utilization by CAD patients such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.",2019812356.0, Journal Article,2018
525,Vagus Nerve as Modulator of the Brain-Gut Axis in Psychiatric and Inflammatory Disorders.,"The vagus nerve represents the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system, which oversees a vast array of crucial bodily functions, including control of mood, immune response, digestion, and heart rate. It establishes one of the connections between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract and sends information about the state of the inner organs to the brain via afferent fibers. In this review article, we discuss various functions of the vagus nerve which make it an attractive target in treating psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. There is preliminary evidence that vagus nerve stimulation is a promising add-on treatment for treatment-refractory depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatments that target the vagus nerve increase the vagal tone and inhibit cytokine production. Both are important mechanism of resiliency. The stimulation of vagal afferent fibers in the gut influences monoaminergic brain systems in the brain stem that play crucial roles in major psychiatric conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders. In line, there is preliminary evidence for gut bacteria to have beneficial effect on mood and anxiety, partly by affecting the activity of the vagus nerve. Since, the vagal tone is correlated with capacity to regulate stress responses and can be influenced by breathing, its increase through meditation and yoga likely contribute to resilience and the mitigation of mood and anxiety symptoms.",2019812127.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
526,Enhanced Amygdala-Striatal Functional Connectivity during the Processing of Cocaine Cues in Male Cocaine Users with a History of Childhood Trauma.,"Background and aims Childhood trauma is associated with increased levels of anxiety later in life, an increased risk for the development of substance use disorders, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the amygdala and frontostriatal circuitry. The aim of this study was to investigate the (neurobiological) link among childhood trauma, state anxiety, and amygdala-frontostriatal activity in response to cocaine cues in regular cocaine users.
 Methods In this study, we included 59 non-treatment seeking regular cocaine users and 58 non-drug using controls. Blood oxygenation level-dependent responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a cue reactivity paradigm with cocaine and neutral cues. Psychophysiological interaction analyses were applied to assess functional connectivity between the amygdala and other regions in the brain. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure childhood trauma, state anxiety, drug use, drug use severity, and craving.
 Results Neural activation was increased during the presentation of cocaine cues, in a widespread network including the frontostriatal circuit and amygdala in cocaine users but not in controls. Functional coupling between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex was reduced in response to cocaine cues, in both cocaine users and controls, which was further diminished with increasing state anxiety. Importantly, amygdala-striatal connectivity was positively associated with childhood trauma in regular cocaine users, while there was a negative association in controls. At the behavioral level, state anxiety was positively associated with cocaine use severity and craving related to negative reinforcement.
 Conclusion Childhood trauma is associated with enhanced amygdala-striatal connectivity during cocaine cue reactivity in regular cocaine users, which may contribute to increased habit behavior and poorer cognitive control. While we cannot draw conclusions on causality, this study provides novel information on how childhood trauma may contribute to the development and persistence of cocaine use disorder.",2019812076.0, Journal Article,2018
527,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Anxiety in a Clinical Dutch Sample of Children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Anxiety is highly prevalent in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is inconsistency in studies investigating the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety in children with ASD. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to give an overview of the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in a clinical Dutch sample of children with ASD. The second aim was to investigate age, gender, ASD subtype, and IQ as potential risk factors for anxiety in this sample. In total, 172 children with ASD (age, 8-15 years) and their parents participated in this study. Specialized services in which children with ASD were recruited were two mental health institutes and one secondary special education school. The findings showed that more than 60% of the participating children with ASD had at least subclinical anxiety symptoms according to children. More than 80% of the children with ASD had at least subclinical anxiety symptoms according to parents. It was found that younger children and girls with ASD had more anxiety symptoms than older children and boys with ASD. Moreover, it was found that children with a higher performance (non-verbal) IQ and lower verbal IQ had more specific phobia symptoms. The findings suggest that in a clinical context, children with ASD have a high risk to have co-occurring anxiety symptoms, especially girls and younger children with ASD. Therefore, early prevention and treatment of anxiety in children with ASD who are most at risk is important.",2015414911.0, Journal Article,2018
528,Somatic Experiencing® Informed Therapeutic Group for the Care and Treatment of Biopsychosocial Effects upon a Gender Diverse Identity.,"Background Somatic Experiencing® (SE™) is a resiliency-based treatment for autonomic nervous systems dysregulation syndromes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and physical syndromes like chronic pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia. ""Transgender/gender non-conforming/gender variant"" describes people whose gender identity/expression is different, at least part of the time, from the sex assigned at birth. Research indicates transgender individuals have a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, victimization, and discrimination. SE™ tools may support transgender/gender non-conforming individuals to increase resilience in the face of discrimination and social injustice.
 Methods This study is a pretest posttest within group (N = 7) pilot study assessing the impact of a 10 session SE™ based group treatment on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), quality of life (QoL) (WHOQoL-BREF), and coping with discrimination (CDS) for a cohort of seven individuals identifying as transgender/gender non-conforming. Materials were created in collaboration with members of the LGBTQIA community. Care was taken to be inclusive of gender non-conforming identities and culturally responsive in design.
 Results Participants described their gender identities as: non-binary, female to male, male to female, and gender fluid. Participants had significant increase in psychological QoL (psychological well-being) (WHOQoL-BREF) p = 0.004, SD = 2.31, with a modest effect size of d = 0.71. Some likely impacts of historical effect discussed. No other clinical or QoL outcomes were statistically significant. However, one outlier was identified in the dataset. When this outlier was excluded there was a trend toward significant reduction in depression symptoms (PhQ-9) p = 0.097, SD = 3.31 and a modest effect size of d = 0.68; somatic symptoms (PhQ-15) p = 0.093, SD = 3.52 and a modest effect size of d = 0.72.
 Conclusion These data indicate that a brief 10 session intervention of SE™ could have a meaningful impact on symptoms of depression, somatization, and QoL for gender non-conforming individuals. Further research is warranted.
 Limitations First, this study has a small sample size limiting statistical power and generalizability. Second is a history effect. Less than 1 week prior to final data collection, there was a significant hate-motivated act in Florida targeting the LGBTQIA community.",2013786503.0, Journal Article,2018
529,Threat Response System: Parallel Brain Processes in Pain vis-à-vis Fear and Anxiety.,"Pain is essential for avoidance of tissue damage and for promotion of healing. Notwithstanding the survival value, pain brings about emotional suffering reflected in fear and anxiety, which in turn augment pain thus giving rise to a self-sustaining feedforward loop. Given such reciprocal relationships, the present article uses neuroscientific conceptualizations of fear and anxiety as a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain and nociception plus amygdala, anxiety, cognitive, fear, sensory, and unconscious. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) parallelism between acute pain and fear and between chronic pain and anxiety; (2) all are related to the evasion of sensory-perceived threats and are subserved by subcortical circuits mediating automatic threat-induced physiologic responses and defensive actions in conjunction with higher order corticolimbic networks (e.g., thalamocortical, thalamo-striato-cortical and amygdalo-cortical) generating conscious representations and valuation-based adaptive behaviors; (3) some instances of chronic pain and anxiety conditions are driven by the failure to diminish or block respective nociceptive information or unconscious treats from reaching conscious awareness; and (4) the neural correlates of pain-related conscious states and cognitions may become autonomous (i.e., dissociated) from the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity. Identifying relative contributions of the diverse neuroanatomical sources, thus, offers prospects for the development of novel preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies in chronic pain patients.",2012116523.0," Journal Article , Review",2018
530,Psychosocial Variables Associated with Immunosuppressive Medication Non-Adherence after Renal Transplantation.,"Introduction Non-adherence to immunosuppressive medication is regarded as an important factor for graft rejection and loss after successful renal transplantation. Yet, results on prevalence and relationship with psychosocial parameters are heterogeneous. The main aim of this study was to investigate the association of immunosuppressive medication non-adherence and psychosocial factors.
 Methods In 330 adult renal transplant recipients (≥12 months posttransplantation), health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, social support, and subjective medication experiences were assessed, and their associations with patient-reported non-adherence was evaluated.
 Results 33.6% of the patients admitted to be partially non-adherent. Non-adherence was associated with younger age, poorer social support, lower mental, but higher physical health-related quality of life. There was no association with depression and anxiety. However, high proportions of clinically relevant depression and anxiety symptoms were apparent in both adherent and non-adherent patients.
 Conclusion In the posttransplant follow-up, kidney recipients with lower perceived social support, lower mental and higher physical health-related quality of life, and younger age can be regarded as a risk group for immunosuppressive medication non-adherence. In follow-up contacts with kidney transplant patients, physicians may pay attention to these factors. Furthermore, psychosocial interventions to optimize immunosuppressive medication adherence can be designed on the basis of this information, especially including subjectively perceived physical health-related quality of life and fostering social support seems to be of importance.",2010368797.0, Journal Article,2018
531,The Associations between Self-Reported Exposure to the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster Zone and Mental Health Disorders in Ukraine.,"Background In 1986, Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near Pripyat, Ukraine exploded, releasing highly-radioactive materials into the surrounding environment. Although the physical effects of the disaster have been well-documented, a limited amount of research has been conducted on association of the disaster with long-term, clinically-diagnosable mental health disorders. According to the diathesis-stress model, the stress of potential and unknown exposure to radioactive materials and the ensuing changes to ones life or environment due to the disaster might lead those with previous vulnerabilities to fall into a poor state of mental health. Previous studies of this disaster have found elevated symptoms of stress, substance abuse, anxiety, and depression in exposed populations, though often at a subclinical level.
 Materials and methods With data from The World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, a cross-sectional large mental health survey conducted in Ukraine by the World Health Organization, the mental health of Ukrainians was modeled with multivariable logistic regression techniques to determine if any long-term mental health disorders were association with reporting having lived in the zone affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Common classes of psychiatric disorders were examined as well as self-report ratings of physical and mental health.
 Results Reporting that one lived in the Chernobyl-affected disaster zone was associated with a higher rate of alcohol disorders among men and higher rates of intermittent explosive disorders among women in a prevalence model. Subjects who lived in the disaster zone also had lower ratings of personal physical and mental health when compared to controls.
 Discussion Stress resulting from disaster exposure, whether or not such exposure actually occurred or was merely feared, and ensuing changes in life circumstances is associated with increased rates of mental health disorders. Professionals assisting populations that are coping with the consequences of disaster should be aware of possible increases in psychiatric disorders as well as poorer perceptions regarding personal physical and mental health.",2010368793.0, Journal Article,2018
532,Higher Impulsivity As a Distinctive Trait of Severe Cocaine Addiction among Individuals Treated for Cocaine or Alcohol Use Disorders.,"Aims Despite alcohol being the most often used addictive substance among addicted patients, use of other substances such as cocaine has increased over recent years, and the combination of both drugs aggravates health impairment and complicates clinical assessment. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize heterogeneous subgroups of cocaine- and alcohol-addicted patients with common characteristics based on substance use disorders, psychiatric comorbidity and impulsivity.
 Methods A total of 214 subjects with cocaine and/or alcohol use disorders were recruited from outpatient treatment programs and clinically assessed. A latent class analysis was used to establish phenotypic categories according to diagnosis of cocaine and alcohol use disorders, mental disorders, and impulsivity scores. Relevant variables were examined in the latent classes (LCs) using correlation and analyses of variance and covariance.
 Results Four LCs of addicted patients were identified: Class 1 (45.3%) formed by alcohol-dependent patients exhibiting lifetime mood disorder diagnosis and mild impulsivity; Class 2 (14%) formed mainly by lifetime cocaine use disorder patients with low probability of comorbid mental disorders and mild impulsivity; Class 3 (10.7%) formed by cocaine use disorder patients with elevated probability to course with lifetime anxiety, early and personality disorders, and greater impulsivity scores; and Class 4 (29.9%) formed mainly by patients with alcohol and cocaine use disorders, with elevated probability in early and personality disorders and elevated impulsivity. Furthermore, there were significant differences among classes in terms of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition-Text Revision criteria for abuse and dependence: Class 3 showed more criteria for cocaine use disorders than other classes, while Class 1 and Class 4 showed more criteria for alcohol use disorders.
 Conclusion Cocaine- and alcohol-addicted patients who were grouped according to diagnosis of substance use disorders, psychiatric comorbidity, and impulsivity show different clinical and sociodemographic variables. Whereas mood and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in alcohol-addicted patients, personality disorders are associated with cocaine use disorders and diagnosis of comorbid substance use disorders. Notably, increased impulsivity is a distinctive characteristic of patients with severe cocaine use disorder and comorbid personality disorders. Psychiatric disorders and impulsivity should be considered for improving the stratification of addicted patients with shared clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to select more appropriate treatments.",2009566696.0, Journal Article,2018
533,Association between School Membership and Substance Use among Adolescents.,"Background Substance use among adolescents is a major problem worldwide, producing many health and economic consequences. Even though there are well-known personal, familial, and social factors associated with drug use, less is known about the effect of school-related factors. School membership is a recognized variable affecting academic performance among students; however, its effect on substance use is less understood.
 Aims The primary aim of this study was to explore the association between school membership and cigarette, alcohol, and cannabis use among a representative sample of secondary students from municipal state-funded schools in Santiago of Chile, and secondly, to test the hypothesis that depressive or anxiety symptoms mediate this association.
 Methods A total of 2,508 students from 22 state-funded schools in Santiago, Chile, answered a questionnaire. This instrument included an abbreviated version of the psychological sense of school membership (PSSM), questions regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis and scales of psychological functioning (depression, anxiety, self-concept, and problem-solving). The association analyses were performed using adjusted regression models for each outcome using all independent variables while controlling for gender and age. For the mediation effect, a combination of ordinary least square and logistic regression analyses was conducted.
 Results There was an association between a strong PSSM and low risk for smoking (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.46-0.72), drinking (0.65; 95% CI: 0.51-0.83), and cannabis use (0.52; 95% CI 0.37-0.74). We also found that depressive and anxiety symptoms do not fully mediate the association between school membership and any substance use, and 73% of this effect in the case of smoking, 80% in the case of drinking, and 78.5% in the case of cannabis use, was direct.
 Conclusion This is the first study in Latin America exploring the association between school membership and substance use among secondary students. School membership seems to be an important and independent factor to be included in preventive interventions. Therefore, these results support future research aiming to test interventions at increasing the sense of school membership to prevent substance use among adolescents.

534,Facial Recognition of Happiness Is Impaired in Musicians with High Music Performance Anxiety.,"Introduction Music performance anxiety (MPA) can be defined as a lasting and intense apprehension connected with musical performance in public. Studies suggest that MPA can be regarded as a subtype of social anxiety. Since individuals with social anxiety have deficits in the recognition of facial emotion, we hypothesized that musicians with high levels of MPA would share similar impairments.
 Objective The aim of this study was to compare parameters of facial emotion recognition (FER) between musicians with high and low MPA.
 Methods 150 amateur and professional musicians with different musical backgrounds were assessed in respect to their level of MPA and completed a dynamic FER task. The outcomes investigated were accuracy, response time, emotional intensity, and response bias.
 Results Musicians with high MPA were less accurate in the recognition of happiness (p = 0.04; d = 0.34), had increased response bias toward fear (p = 0.03), and increased response time to facial emotions as a whole (p = 0.02; d = 0.39).
 Conclusion Musicians with high MPA displayed FER deficits that were independent of general anxiety levels and possibly of general cognitive capacity. These deficits may favor the maintenance and exacerbation of experiences of anxiety during public performance, since cues of approval, satisfaction, and encouragement are not adequately recognized.",2007985674.0, Journal Article,2018
535,Anxiety and Depression in Drug-Dependent Patients with Cluster C Personality Disorders.,"Objective Comorbidity between personality disorders (PD) and substance-use disorders (SUD) is one of the most common findings in the psychiatric field. The patients with Cluster C disorders present maladjustment traits often characterized by high levels of anxiety. The main aim of this study was to find evidences about higher anxiety and depression prevalence on Cluster C than others Clusters, analyzing similarities and differences within, with other Cluster A and B PD patients and patients without PD.
 Method A total of 822 substance dependent patients (ages18-78; Mean = 38.35, SD = 10.14) completed the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II disorders, Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.
 Results Results supported poly-consumption in Cluster C patients, being greater alcohol consumption as well as abuse of both stimulants and depressants. Anxiety and depression did not show just one pattern for all patients with SUD-Cluster C PD. There was a relation between anxiety and depression for all the groups except for the Dependent-PD.
 Conclusion Interventions should focus on aspects like depression and anxiety more than on the substance consumed.",2007985024.0, Journal Article,2018
536,Treating Depression with Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation: State of the Art and Future Perspectives.,"Depression is a highly prevalent disorder, and its treatment is far from satisfactory. There is an urgent need to develop a new treatment for depression. Although still at its early stage, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promising potential for treating depression. In this article, we first summarize the results of clinical studies on the treatment effect of taVNS on depression. Then, we re-analyze a previous study to identify the specific symptoms taVNS can relieve as indicated by subscores of the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale in patients with depression. We found that taVNS can significantly reduce multiple symptoms of depression patients, including anxiety, psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbance, and hopelessness. Next, we pose several hypotheses on the mechanism of taVNS treatment of depression, including directly and indirectly modulating the activity and connectivity of key brain regions involved in depression and mood regulation; inhibiting neuro-inflammatory sensitization; modulating hippocampal neurogenesis; and regulating the microbiome-brain-gut axis. Finally, we outline current challenges and lay out the future directions of taVNS treatment of depression, which include (1) intensively comparing stimulation parameters and ""dose effect"" (treatment frequency and duration) to maximize the treatment effect of taVNS; (2) exploring the effect of taVNS on disorders comorbid with depression (such as chronic pain disorders, cardiovascular disorder, and autism) to provide new ""two-for-one"" treatment approaches for patients with these disorders; and (3) applying multiple scale methods to explore the underlying mechanism of taVNS.",2007114809.0, Journal Article,2018
537,"Correlations among Psychological Resilience, Self-Efficacy, and Negative Emotion in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.","Objective We investigated the influencing factors of the psychological resilience and self-efficacy of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the relationships of psychological resilience and self-efficacy with negative emotion.
 Methods Eighty-eight participants were enrolled. Psychological resilience, self-efficacy, and negative emotion were assessed with the Psychological Resilience Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. Furthermore, the relationships of psychological resilience and self-efficacy with negative emotion were investigated.
 Results The average scores of psychological resilience, self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression were 70.08 ± 13.26, 21.56 ± 9.66, 53.68 ± 13.10, and 56.12 ± 12.37, respectively. The incidences of anxiety and depression were 23.90% (21/88) and 28.40% (25/88), respectively. The psychological resilience and self-efficacy scores of AMI patients after PCI varied significantly with age and economic status. SAS scores and SDS scores were significantly negatively correlated with psychological resilience and self-efficacy.
 Conclusion Negative emotions in AMI patients after PCI are closely related to psychological resilience and self-efficacy. Therefore, anxiety and depression could be alleviated by improving the psychological resilience and self-efficacy of patients undergoing PCI, thus improving patients' quality of life.",1999192876.0, Journal Article,2018
52,"Navigating the social world: The role of social competence, peer victimisation and friendship quality in the development of social anxiety in childhood","Social and communication (SC) difficulties predict increased social anxiety (SA) symptoms in childhood. Peer victimisation and friendship quality are commonly associated with both SC difficulties and SA. Based on this, we tested for a cascade effect of early SC difficulties, peer victimisation and friendship quality on SA in late childhood, using a population-based sample of 8028 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Parent-reported data were collected on SC difficulties at age 7 and SA at age 7, 10 and 13. Child-reported data on peer victimisation and friendship quality were collected at age 8. Our results revealed that SC difficulties predict increased negative friendship qualities and peer victimisation. Relational victimisation predicted increased SA symptoms at 13 years old. Neither overt nor relational victimisation mediated the developmental relationship between SC difficulties and SA. Furthermore, friendship quality did not moderate the developmental relationship between SC difficulties and SA. In addition, no sex differences were observed. The evidence demonstrates that peer victimisation and friendship quality do not explain why some children with SC difficulties go on to develop SA. Future research clarifying the complex etiological pathways contributing towards the development of SA in childhood and adolescence is warranted.

53,"Moving toward a metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria: Examining the contribution of metacognitive beliefs, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals","Cyberchondria refers to the repeated use of the Internet to search for health information that leads to negative consequences. The present set of studies examined the tenability of a proposed metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria that includes metacognitive beliefs about health-related thoughts, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals. The contribution of those variables to cyberchondria was examined among 330 undergraduate students from a U.S. university in Study 1 and 331 U.S. community respondents in Study 2. All participants reported using the Internet to search for health information. Across both studies, metacognitive beliefs, beliefs about rituals, and stop signals shared positive bivariate associations with cyberchondria and accounted for unique variance in cyberchondria scores in multivariate analyses. Beliefs about rituals and stop signals emerged as relatively specific to cyberchondria versus health anxiety in multivariate analyses. Results provide preliminary support for a metacognitive conceptualization of cyberchondria, with extensions of the present findings discussed.

54,The efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for the treatment of perinatal anxiety symptoms: A preliminary meta-analysis,"Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is considered the psychological treatment of choice for anxiety disorders in the general population. However the efficacy of CBT for anxiety that occurs during the perinatal period, defined as the period from conception to 12 months post birth, is less understood. Perinatal anxiety is a complex and multifaceted problem that can affect both the pregnant women and the unborn child, as well as the wider family unit. The aim of this study was to synthesize the current empirical status of CBT for perinatal anxiety using a meta-analytic approach. Relevant articles were identified through a search of electronic databases through to June 2018. The search terms used include ‘anxiety’ or ‘phobia’ AND ‘perinatal’ or ‘pregnan* or ‘postnatal’ or ‘postpartum’ AND ‘CBT’ or ‘cognitive behav* therapy’. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included within the meta-analysis. A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled between-group mean effect size was small at post treatment ( k = 7; d = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.08–0.91) favoring the CBT treatments ( Q ₁ = 30.13, p &lt;.001). Heterogeneity was high ( I ² = 80.09). The pooled within-group mean effect size was large across the treatment groups from pre-treatment to post-treatment when combining all of the studies (i.e., controlled and uncontrolled studies; k = 14; d = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63–1.17). Heterogeneity was high ( I ² = 88.55). Some preliminary and exploratory moderator analyses were also conducted to inform potential future research in this field.

55,Cognitive-behavior therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders: A meta-analysis of secondary outcomes,"Anxiety-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces anxiety in children and adolescents. An important remaining question is to what extent anxiety-focused CBT also affects broader outcome domains. Additionally, it remains unclear whether parental involvement in treatment may have impact on domains other than anxiety. A meta-analysis (n studies = 42, n participants = 3239) of the effects of CBT and the moderating role of parental involvement was conducted on the following major secondary outcomes: depressive symptoms, externalizing behaviors, general functioning, and social competence. Randomized controlled trials were included when having a waitlist or active control condition, a youth sample (aged &lt; 19) with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis receiving anxiety-focused CBT and reported secondary outcomes. Controlled effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) were calculated employing random effect models. CBT had a large effect on general functioning (-1.25[-1.59;0.90], n studies = 17), a small to moderate effect on depressive symptoms (-0.31[-0.41;-0.22], n studies = 31) and a small effect on externalizing behaviors (-0.23[-0.38;-0.09], n studies = 12) from pre-to post-treatment. Effects remained or even further improved at follow-up. Social competence only improved at follow-up (n studies = 6). Concluding, anxiety-focused CBT has a positive effect on broader outcome domains than just anxiety. Higher parental involvement seemed to have beneficial effects at follow-up, with improvements in general functioning and comorbid symptoms.

LPA was conducted with a sample of 2158 participants aged 12–20 years from 3 urban schools in Beijing, China. Results suggested a best-fitting model with three profiles: Low Group with Diffuse Types of Anxiety, Moderate Group with Predominant Generalized and Social Anxiety and High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety. Additional analyses using Regression Mixture Modeling suggested that older adolescents and girls were significantly more likely to be classified into the High Group with Predominant Somatization Anxiety. Finally, in support of the construct validity of the anxiety profiles, differential negative cognitions, especially the subscales measuring cognitions about social threat and physical threat, predicted the anxiety profiles. The current study supports an intuitive model of adolescent anxiety in a large, non-Western population with clinical implications for anxious adolescents in China.

57,Exploring behavioral pattern separation and risk for emotional disorders,"Pattern separation is a facet of memory encoding that facilitates the adaptive integration of old and new experiences. At the computational level, this process reduces overlap between how two entities are represented. Behaviorally, this allows for greater memory resolution while avoiding memory interference; similar entities are perceived as distinct. Poor pattern separation could contribute to psychopathology, especially anxiety, as individuals with high anxiety tend to overgeneralize their perception of threat, or have difficulty distinguishing between currently safe contexts and previously threatening ones. However, there is little empirical work examining this as a contributory mechanism of anxiety in humans. This study examines the relationship between behavioral pattern separation, anxiety, and related symptoms. Participants (N = 111) completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, stress, trait worry, and state affect. They then completed the Mnemonic Similarity Task, a computerized test that serves as a putative behavioral proxy to tax and thus measure hippocampal pattern separation. Behavioral pattern separation performance alone was not predictive of high anxiety, depression, or stress. However, two significant interactions emerged. The interactions between performance and state affect, and between performance and trait worry predicted anxious and depressive symptoms. Only at higher levels of negative affect was performance predictive of symptom severity. Similarly, poor pattern separation and high trait worry together predicted the most severe symptoms. This project provides support for behavioral pattern separation as a plausible factor in anxiety and related psychopathology, particularly in combination with sensitivity to acute distress and known risk factors, such as trait worry.

58,Predictors of long-term outcome of CBT for youth with anxiety disorders treated in community clinics,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven long-term effects in youth with anxiety disorders. However, only a few studies have examined predictors of long-term outcomes of CBT treatment. The present study investigated possible predictors of long-term treatment outcomes in youth with mixed anxiety disorders treated in community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at assessment 15.5 years, range 11–21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder were evaluated a mean of 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2–5.9 years). Outcomes were loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the principal inclusion anxiety diagnosis, and changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety symptoms. Predictors encompassed youth, parent and demographic factors, and post-treatment recovery. The most consistent finding was that low family social class predicted poorer outcomes. Higher treatment motivation was associated with better outcome whereas a diagnosis of social anxiety was associated with poorer outcome. Identified predictors extend on previous findings from efficacy trials, and the results indicate a need for more specific treatment protocols.

59,A pilot randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy versus attentional bias modification for social anxiety disorder: An examination of outcomes and theory-based mechanisms,"No studies have compared face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and attention bias modification (ABM) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and their purported mechanisms. We asked: 1) Is CBT more effective than ABM? and 2) Are changes in attentional biases and cognitions temporally related to symptom change? Forty-three patients were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of ABM or up to 20 sessions of individual CBT. Intent-to-treat results revealed that CBT was superior to ABM in response rates and on symptom measures at endpoint, but not on other measures. No differences were found on measures in rates of change between CBT and ABM. Frequency of negative cognitions changed in both groups and negative beliefs changed only in CBT. Attentional bias did not change in either group. Cognitive changes bidirectionally correlated with symptom change in cross-lagged analyses in CBT, but not in ABM, suggesting a reciprocal relationship. Trial-level bias away from negative faces was simultaneously related to symptom change in ABM only. Results suggest that CBT is superior to ABM when administered at their typical doses, but raise questions given the similar rates of change. In addition, results support theories of cognitive change and raise questions about changes in attentional biases in CBT.

60,Corrigendum to “A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder and functional impairment in UK treatment-seeking veterans”,"Reports an error in ""A network analysis of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder and functional impairment in UK treatment-seeking veterans"" by Jana Ross, Dominic Murphy and Cherie Armour ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2018[Jun], Vol 57, 7-15). The authors regret that Fig. 2 (page 10) is incorrect. The correct Fig. 2 is included in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-30164-003). Network analysis is a relatively new methodology for studying psychological disorders. It focuses on the associations between individual symptoms which are hypothesized to mutually interact with each other. The current study represents the first network analysis conducted with treatment-seeking military veterans in UK. The study aimed to examine the network structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and four domains of functional impairment by identifying the most central (i.e., important) symptoms of PTSD and by identifying those symptoms of PTSD that are related to functional impairment. Participants were 331 military veterans with probable PTSD. In the first step, a network of PTSD symptoms based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was estimated. In the second step, functional impairment items were added to the network. The most central symptoms of PTSD were recurrent thoughts, nightmares, negative emotional state, detachment and exaggerated startle response. Functional impairment was related to a number of different PTSD symptoms. Impairments in close relationships were associated primarily with the negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptoms and impairments in home management were associated primarily with the reexperiencing symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to previous PTSD network studies and include implications for clinical practice.

61,The effects of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomised controlled trials,"Death anxiety has been proposed as a transdiagnostic construct, underlying numerous mental disorders. Although it has been argued that treatments, which reduce death anxiety, are needed, research investigating the impact of interventions on death fears has produced mixed results. As such, the current meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety. Overall, results from 15 randomised controlled trials suggested that psychosocial treatments produced significant reductions in death anxiety, with a small to medium effect size ( g = .45). Intervention type (death education vs. therapy) did not significantly moderate the effect of intervention on death anxiety ( g = −.47). However, therapy type was a significant moderator of treatment efficacy ( g = −1.39). Cognitive Behaviour Therapy was found to be particularly efficacious, producing significant reductions in death anxiety relative to control ( g = 1.7), whereas other therapies did not ( g = .20). The number of treatment sessions and baseline death anxiety significantly moderated intervention efficacy, whereas the duration of the intervention, training of the interventionist, and clinical nature of the sample did not. Given the small number and generally low quality of the included studies, future research using more rigorous methodology, as well as clinical samples, is needed.

62,Does CBT for anxiety-related disorders alter suicidal ideation? Findings from a naturalistic sample,"Background: Anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with suicidal ideation (SI). To our knowledge, no studies have reported on the baseline prevalence of SI and the reduction in SI in a naturalistic sample receiving cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety-related disorders. Methods: Participants ( n = 355) recruited from an anxiety specialty clinic reported SI at pre-, mid-, and post-CBT. Multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models compared differences in SI endorsement over Time. Results: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) were associated with significantly elevated baseline SI relative to specific phobia. PTSD and unspecified anxiety-related disorders were associated with significant reductions in SI, whereas reductions in SAD, GAD, OCD, and panic disorder did not reach significance. Rates of new onset and exacerbation of SI were low. Discussion: CBT for anxiety disorders was associated with significant reductions in SI over time, with no evidence for exacerbation of suicide risk. Clinical implications are discussed, as well as future research directions to further understand the effect of anxiety disorder treatments on SI.

63,Brief treatment for nighttime fears and co-sleeping problems: A randomized clinical trial,"Sixty-eight 4–6 year old children who co-slept with their parents and who avoided sleeping alone due to intense nighttime fears were randomized to a brief combined parent-based intervention (CBT-based bibliotherapy plus doll) or a wait list control group. After the waiting period, the wait list participants were offered treatment. Co-sleeping patterns, sleep records, anxiety, general fears, and behavior problems were assessed with parent-report measures. Nighttime fears were assessed with parent-report measures and a single item visual analogue scale for the young children. Assessments were completed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 months following treatment. Results showed that the combined intervention was superior to the wait list control condition and that treatment effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. This study provides initial support for use of CBT-based bibliotherapy plus doll in the treatment of nighttime fears. Such a treatment might be used to supplement standard CBT approaches in routine clinical practice or in a stepped care approach to treatment.

64,Mental imagery in dentistry: Phenomenology and role in dental anxiety,"Dental anxiety is a prevalent problem with marked psychological, physical and public health implications. Based on cognitive theory and evidence, we hypothesized that vivid, sensory image-based cognitions play a role in dental anxiety. A quantitative online survey (N = 306) and qualitative semi-structured interviews (N = 18) found that vivid sensory images were common irrespective of dental anxiety levels, but that their content, associated distress and responses varied. Participants reporting higher anxiety experienced intense and intrusive fear-provoking dental imagery focusing on unpleasant sensations, which were associated with the intrusive recollection of negative past experiences and avoidance of dentistry. Participants with lower anxiety ratings, reported images that were less distressing and centered around reassuring aspects and positive appointment outcomes, potentially acting as protective factors against dental anxiety and facilitating appointment attendance. The inclusion of components aimed at reducing intrusive memories and dental imagery rescripting may help improve interventions for dental anxiety.

65,Children with social anxiety disorder show blunted pupillary reactivity and altered eye contact processing in response to emotional faces: Insights from pupillometry and eye movements,"Cognitive models and adult research associate social anxiety disorder (SAD) with hypervigilant-avoidant processing of social information, such as eye contact. However, processing biases in childhood SAD remain mostly unexplored. We examined 10- to 13-year-old children’s eye contact processing and pupil dilation in response to happy, neutral, and angry faces in three groups: SAD ( n = 31), mixed anxiety disorders (MAD; n = 30), and healthy controls (HC; n = 32). Compared to HC, SAD children showed faster first fixations on the eye region of neutral faces and shorter first fixation durations on the eye region of all faces. No differences between the two clinical groups emerged in eye movement results. SAD girls showed reduced pupil dilation in response to happy and angry faces compared to MAD and to happy faces compared to HC. SAD boys showed reduced pupil dilation in response to neutral faces compared to HC. Dimensionally, reduced pupil dilation was linked to social anxiety severity while eye movements were correlated with mixed anxiety and depressive severity. Results suggest that hypervigilant-avoidant eye contact processing and a blunted pupillary reactivity characterize children with SAD. Both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific processing biases are relevant for the understanding of childhood SAD.

66,Exposure therapy for youth with anxiety: Utilization rates and predictors of implementation in a sample of practicing clinicians from across the United States,"Exposure therapy is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment technique for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Regardless, therapists in the community are reported to use exposure relatively rarely compared with other approaches. The goal of the present study was to identify how practicing clinicians treat youth with anxiety disorders across the United States and what factors contribute to their use of exposure therapy. Recruited from public directories, 257 private practice therapists who treat anxious youth were surveyed. Non-exposure cognitive-behavioral techniques like cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques were used significantly more frequently than exposure. Providers with more training in exposure therapy and fewer negative beliefs about this approach reported using exposure significantly more in the treatment of youth with social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and panic disorders. Self-identification as an anxiety disorder specialist significantly predicted exposure use for youth with posttraumatic stress disorder. Most therapists in private practice have minimal training in exposure therapy, perceive a lack of training options, and believe there would be a benefit to acquiring more training. The implications of these findings are discussed, including how to optimally design training opportunities in exposure therapy.

67,Variation in out of pocket health care costs for individuals with anxiety disorders by type of insurance coverage,"Purpose: Given that out-of-pocket (OOP) costs impact adherence to treatment and recent and proposed changes to the health insurance system that impact OOP costs, it is imperative to understand the OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety disorders depending upon type of insurance coverage. The objective of this study was to determine the annual OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety disorders and the variation of these costs by type of insurance coverage. Methods: Using weighted nationally representative data from the 2011–2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, total OOP health care costs were assessed for all respondents who indicated that they had an anxiety disorder (N = 9985). Total OOP health care costs were also calculated separately by type of insurance. Results: Average annual OOP costs among individuals with anxiety was $1152. The highest OOP cost were incurred by individuals with private fee-for-service (FFS) insurance ($1356/year, 4.1% of annual income), while individuals enrolled in HMOs with dual Medicare/Medicaid had the lowest OOP cost ($129/year, 6.8% of annual income). Individuals without insurance had high OOP cost burden ($1309/year, 12.5% of annual income). Conclusion: Individuals with anxiety disorders have a wide range of OOP cost depending upon their insurance coverage. Those with anxiety should carefully consider their choice of insurance coverage if interested in minimizing OOP costs.

68,"Shame-proneness, guilt-proneness and anxiety symptoms: A meta-analysis","There is a growing body of investigations showing that shame and guilt are important features of various psychological problems including anxiety disorders. This study quantitatively summarized the magnitude of the associations of shame and guilt with anxiety symptoms. We looked both at the associations with broader categories of anxiety symptoms (i.e., undifferentiated anxiety symptoms, trait and state anxiety), but also with symptoms specific to individual anxiety disorders. In most cases, shame was more strongly associated with anxiety symptoms (in general medium effect sizes) than guilt (in general small effect sizes). When controlling for the shared variance of shame and guilt, in most cases only shame remained significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Moderation analyses testing for the effect of subtype of shame/guilt, type of measurement, clinical status, age and gender were conducted. Two types of guilt seem to be equally maladaptive as shame, generalized guilt (involving a free-floating guilt separated from specific contexts) and contextual-maladaptive guilt (involving an inappropriate or exaggerated feeling of responsibility). External shame (perceived negative evaluations of others) seems to be more strongly associated with social anxiety symptoms than internal shame (negative self-evaluations). Results for other moderators and implications are discussed in light of the existing theoretical and empirical data.

69,Predictors of treatment outcome for the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders in children (UP-C),"Various efficacious treatment packages exist for youth anxiety, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is now considered to be a well-established treatment for child anxiety disorders (Higa-McMillan, Francis, Rith-Najarian, &amp; Chorpita, 2016). Improving outcomes for the significant proportion of anxious youth who demonstrate inadequate response to CBT is imperative, but our understanding of who does and does not benefit is incomplete. Further, there are no known empirical studies of predictors of treatment response for youth who receive a transdiagnostic intervention for anxiety or depression, and it is therefore unclear whether predictors of response to a transdiagnostic treatment for children are similar to those found in previous studies of anxiety-specific treatments. This study investigated potential predictors of outcome following administration of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C; Ehrenreich-May et al., 2018). Participants were 60 children ages 6–13 ( M = 9.47, SD = 1.68) with a primary anxiety diagnosis (with or without comorbid depression) who received a 15-week UP-C group treatment. Consistent with prior literature on CBT for anxiety, social anxiety emerged as a consistent predictor of poorer response to the UP-C. Inconsistent with prior literature, depression, symptom severity, parent psychopathology, and child age were not significant predictors of poor outcome. Results indicate some differences between predictors for transdiagnostic versus anxiety-focused treatments, but point to a need for both types of interventions to better target social anxiety in children.

71,Out of my league: Appraisals of anxiety and confidence in others by individuals with and without social anxiety disorder,"Forty participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 42 healthy controls (HCs) were randomized to watch a confederate deliver a speech in either a visibly anxious or confident manner. Participants rated their perception of the presenter’s desirability across five attributes and compared themselves to the presenter along these same dimensions. Participants then delivered their own speeches, and were rated in a similar manner by trained research assistants who were naïve to participants’ group status and study objectives. Results demonstrated that all participants, irrespective of group status, judged the visibly anxious presenter as being less desirable and the confident presenter as more desirable. Socially anxious participants tended to view themselves as inferior to confident others. Coders also rated participants with SAD, based on their speeches, as being less interpersonally desirable than HCs. These results suggest that individuals who appear visibly anxious may be objectively disadvantaged in their ability to make a positive first impression on others. We discuss these findings in relation to theoretical models of social anxiety and explore how to address such interpersonal factors in psychological interventions for SAD.

72,Social interaction anxiety and personality traits predicting engagement in health risk sexual behaviors,"Individuals with social interaction anxiety, a facet of social anxiety disorder, withdraw from or avoid social encounters and generally avoid risks. However, a subset engages in health risk sexual behavior (HRSB). Because sensation seeking, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity predict engagement in HRSB among adolescents and young adults, the present study hypothesized that latent classes of social interaction anxiety and these personality traits would differentially predict likelihood of engagement in HRSB. Finite mixture modeling was used to discern four classes: two low social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by facets of emotion dysregulation, positive urgency, and negative urgency (Low SIAS High Urgency and Low SIAS Low Urgency) and two high social interaction anxiety classes distinguished by positive urgency, negative urgency, risk seeking, and facets of emotion dysregulation (High SIAS High Urgency and High SIAS Low Urgency). HRSB were entered into the model as auxiliary distal outcomes. Of importance to this study were findings that the High SIAS High Urgency class was more likely to engage in most identified HRSB than the High SIAS Low Urgency class. This study extends previous findings on the heterogeneity of social interaction anxiety by identifying the effects of social interaction anxiety and personality on engagement in HRSB.

73,Disentangling intolerance of uncertainty and threat appraisal in everyday situations,"Intolerance of Uncertainty is a transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factor in a range of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. However, the mechanism of action in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders is poorly understood, with the relationship between the constructs of uncertainty and threat appraisal remaining unclear. Most research to date has investigated IU in situations that are explicitly or implicitly threatening (i.e. where they have a negative outcome), which makes it difficult to establish whether it is the uncertainty or the prospect of a negative outcome (or threat) that people find aversive. If the construct of IU is about uncertainty (and not threat), it should also be operating in situations where there are no negative outcomes possible. Participants (N = 224) completed a battery of online measures in tasks designed to evaluate level of situational uncertainty and perception of threat level. These tasks required responses to scenarios which displayed or implied varying levels of estimated threat. Regression analyses indicated that IU was related to perceiving threat and uncertainty in negative situations and positive situations, with the greatest contribution from uncertainty within the situations, supporting the conceptualisation of IU as a response to uncertainty that is largely independent of threat although may contribute to perceptions of threat.

74,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder research: Growing in scope, advances unclear","There has been impressive growth in scholarly research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). As a general rule, this can be construed as a sign of health in the subspecialty within anxiety disorder research. One factor that likely contributed to the growth in research on OCD was the observation that obsessional experiences can be placed on a dimension from normal to abnormal (or non-clinical to clinical) (Rachman and de Silva, 1978). While the dramatic growth in OCD research has led to increased sophistication in clinical conceptualization of various presentations of this heterogeneous condition, it has not led to a commensurate increase in the availability of efficacious treatment. This gap, between awareness of the disorder and delivery of evidence-based treatment, serves as a limiting factor in enthusiasm regarding the growth in research productivity on OCD as a sign of health in the subspecialty.

In fact, the uptick in publication rate of SAD research was unexpectedly high given previous predictions by Boschen (2008), who reviewed publication trends from 1980 to 2005. In this commentary, we consider potential factors involved in the continued increase in publication of research on SAD. We examine the roles that empathy and evolutionary factors may play in our ability to relate to those with SAD and in our motivation to research it. Further, we consider whether the relatively high prevalence of SAD, the visibility of experiences of social anxiety in the general population, and the availability of viable theoretical models of SAD and its treatment have played a significant role in the high publication rate. Other factors affecting research on SAD such as changes in the definition of SAD in various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), comorbidity which other psychiatric disorders, and the role of pharmaceutical company research are also discussed.

A look at Boschen’s (2008) predictions and beyond,"The relative health of a field of research can be approximated by assessing peer-reviewed journal publication trends for articles pertinent to that field. The most recent comprehensive assessment of publication trends in the anxiety disorders indicated that the field was on a continuing trajectory of growth (Boschen, 2008). We conducted an updated search of Medline for publications on each of the anxiety disorders from 2006 to 2016. Results indicated that there was continuing growth in anxiety disorders research overall and, particularly, for posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Publication trends observed in Medline were also reflected in the focus of papers published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders over the past 3 years; yet, a substantive number of papers in the journal also dealt with multiple anxiety disorders, anxiety-related constructs, transdiagnostic issues, and conditions with significant overlap with the anxiety disorders. Observed publication trends, shifts in the focus of research attention, and probable future research directions are discussed briefly.

77,The increase in interest in GAD: Commentary on Asmundson &amp;amp; Asmundson,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. It is associated with functional impairment and is unlikely to spontaneously remit. As identified by Asmundson and Asmundson (2018), published research studies on GAD have increased in number over the last decade. We propose that this is due to the high prevalence of the diagnosis and symptoms, interest in transdiagnostic processes, such as worry, increased interest in emotion dysregulation as a principle underlying diagnoses, and new methods of treating and disseminating treatment that may be particularly well suited to GAD. Despite the increase in research articles on GAD, GAD still remains one of the least studied anxiety disorders. We propose that this is due to the misconception that GAD does not lead to severe impairment, despite data showing otherwise. Future research should continue to examine the phenomenology, mechanisms, and treatment of GAD in order to better understand this common anxiety disorder.

79,Insula activation is modulated by attention shifting in social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by exaggerated reactivity to social threat, often documented by biased attention to threatening information, and increased activation in brain regions involved in salience/threat processing. Attention training has been developed to ameliorate the attention bias documented in individuals with SAD, with mixed results. We investigated patterns of brain activation underlying acute attention modulation in 41 participants (29 with SAD and 12 health controls). We then investigated how brain activation changed over time in both groups in response to a 4-session attention training protocol (toward threat, away from threat, no-training control). Results revealed diminished pre-training deactivation in the insula in SAD participants during attention modulation. SAD participants also demonstrated an increase in insula deactivation over time, suggestive of an improvement in attention modulation of emotion, and this was associated with a decrease in symptom severity. Attention training did not, itself, lead to clinical improvement, though there was a trend level effect of training toward threat on increased insula deactivation over time. While deficits in attentional control and emotion modulation are documented in individuals with SAD, current attention training protocols are not robustly effective in ameliorating aberrant functioning. Pursuit of training protocols that have more robust impacts on the relevant neural circuitry may have some value.

Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health (CCHS-MH; N = 25,113). Chi-square analyses assessed whether significant differences existed in pain severity in those with comorbid chronic pain and GAD versus pain conditions alone. Multivariable regressions examined the association between comorbid chronic pain and GAD with functional outcomes. Results: The weighted prevalence of GAD among those with chronic migraines, arthritis and back pain was 6.9%, 4.4%, and 6.1% respectively, compared to 2.6% among the entire sample. Severity of pain was increased among those with comorbid chronic pain and GAD compared with chronic pain conditions alone. Migraine was the only pain condition that was significantly associated with disability in our most stringent adjustment model. After controlling for other psychiatric disorders, comorbid GAD and chronic pain was not associated with work absenteeism. Conclusion: Chronic pain is common among the Canadian population and is associated with substantial disability. Results demonstrated that GAD is prevalent among chronic pain conditions, and comorbidity is associated with greater pain severity. GAD in the context of migraines, in particular, may represent an important treatment target to reduce disability.

81,Politically-focused intrusive thoughts and associated ritualistic behaviors in a community sample,"A significant proportion of the U.S. population report increased stress attributed to the political climate following the controversial 2016 United States (U.S.) Presidential election. The political stressors paired with the growth in news consumption and social media-use could be a potential trigger for obsessive-compulsive-like symptoms specific to politics in some individuals. This study aimed to elucidate the rate of Politically-focused Intrusive Thoughts and associated Ritualistic Behaviors (PITRB), their demographic and clinical correlates, and the degree of association with political ideology. Survey data were collected using the crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk. A total of N = 484 individuals completed the survey. Measures of politically-focused intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors, general obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, anxiety control, worry, and disability were administered, as well as a measure of social and economic conservative affiliation. Results showed that a quarter of the sample (25.2%) had at least one PITRB more than once a day. PITRB was associated with all measures of psychopathology and disability. Finally, anxiety control moderated the relationship between PITRB and both anxiety and depression. No differences in psychopathology were found between major party affiliations. The findings suggest that politically-focused intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors are associated with psychopathology domains in a manner comparable to general obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

82,Internet-based treatment for panic disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing guided (via real-time video sessions) with unguided self-help treatment and a waitlist control. PAXPD study results,"A growing body of evidence suggests that Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (ICBT) are effective to treat anxiety disorders. However, the effect of therapist guidance in ICBT is still under debate and guided ICBT offered in a real-time audio-video communication format has not yet been systematically investigated. This three-arm RCT compared the efficacy of guided with unguided ICBT (12 weeks intervention) and a waitlist (WL). A total of 111 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder (PD) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Primary outcomes were the severity of self-report panic symptoms and diagnostic status. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression, functional impairment, catastrophic cognitions, fear of sensations and body vigilance. At post-treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcomes regarding PD and associated symptoms (guided ICBT vs. WL: d = 1.04–1.36; unguided ICBT vs. WL: d = 0.70–1.06). At post-treatment, the two active conditions did not differ significantly in self-reported symptom reduction ( d = 0.21–0.54, all p s &gt; 0.05), but the guided treatment was superior to the unguided treatment in terms of diagnostic status (χ² (1) = 13.15, p &lt; 0.01). Treatment gains were maintained at successive follow-ups and the guided treatment became superior to the unguided treatment at 6 months follow-up ( d = 0.72–1.05, all ps &lt; 0.05).

83,Changes in neural activation underlying attention processing of emotional stimuli following treatment with positive search training in anxious children,"Prior research indicates that positive search training (PST) may be a promising home-based computerised treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. It explicitly trains anxious individuals in adaptive, goal-directed attention-search strategies to search for positive and calm information and ignore goal-irrelevant negative cues. Although PST reduces anxiety symptoms, its neural effects are unknown. The main aim of this study was to examine changes in neural activation associated with changes in attention processing of positive and negative stimuli from pre- to post-treatment with PST in children with anxiety disorders. Children’s neural activation was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f MRI) during a visual-probe task indexing attention allocation to threat-neutral and positive-neutral pairs. Results showed pre- to post-treatment reductions in anxiety symptoms and neural reactivity to emotional faces (angry and happy faces, relative to neutral faces) within a broad neural network linking frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions. Changes in neural reactivity were highly inter-correlated across regions. Neural reactivity to the threat-bias contrast reduced from pre- to post-treatment in the mid/posterior cingulate cortex. Results are considered in relation to prior research linking anxiety disorders and treatment effects with functioning of a broad limbic-cortical network involved in emotion reactivity and regulation, and integrative functions linking emotion, memory, sensory and motor processes and attention control.

84,Emotional clarity and attention to emotions in cognitive behavioral group therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction for social anxiety disorder,"We examined (1) differences between controls and patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in emotional clarity and attention to emotions; (2) changes in emotional clarity and attention to emotions associated with cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), or a waitlist (WL) condition; and (3) whether emotional clarity and attention to emotions moderated changes in social anxiety across treatment. Participants were healthy controls ( n = 37) and patients with SAD ( n = 108) who were assigned to CBGT, MBSR, or WL in a randomized controlled trial. At pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up, patients with SAD completed measures of social anxiety, emotional clarity, and attention to emotions. Controls completed measures at baseline only. At pretreatment, patients with SAD had lower levels of emotional clarity than controls. Emotional clarity increased significantly among patients receiving CBGT, and changes were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Emotional clarity at posttreatment did not differ between CBGT and MBSR or between MBSR and WL. Changes in emotional clarity predicted changes in social anxiety, but emotional clarity did not moderate treatment outcome. Analyses of attention to emotions were not significant. Implications for the role of emotional clarity in the treatment of SAD are discussed.

85,Rethinking avoidance: Toward a balanced approach to avoidance in treating anxiety disorders,"Avoidance is typically considered a maladaptive behavioral response to excessive fear and anxiety, leading to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. Exposure is a core element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. One important aspect of this treatment is repeated and prolonged exposure to a threat while discouraging patients from using avoidance strategies, such as escape or safety behaviors. We will first revisit the role of avoidance learning in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, including important insights from the neuroscience literature. Next, we will consider both the negative and positive aspects of avoidance for therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will explore the application of adaptive avoidance in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. We will argue that there are occasions when avoidance behaviors can serve as effective coping strategies to enhance the person’s perception of control over the environment and the potential threat. We conclude that avoidance behaviors can be a valuable therapeutic element, depending on the function of these behaviors.

86,Cultural influences on mental health symptoms in a primary care sample of Latinx patients,"The present study examines how both between group (i.e., ethnic group membership) and within group cultural factors (i.e., nativity status, age of immigration, and perceived discrimination) may contribute to anxiety and related symptoms in Latinx with anxiety disorders. Baseline data were examined from patients who participated in one of the largest intervention studies for adults with anxiety disorders in primary care settings; 196 Latinx and 568 NLW (non-Latinx White) patients participated. Proportions of anxiety disorders were similar between Latinx and NLWs; however, Latinx, on average, had a greater number of anxiety disorders than NLWs. Levels of anxiety and depression symptom severity, anxiety sensitivity, and mental functional impairment were similar between the ethnic groups. Latinx expressed greater somatization and physical functional impairment than NLWs. Among Latinx, perceived discrimination, but not other cultural variables, was predictive of mental health symptoms while controlling for age, gender, education, and poverty. Overall, these findings suggest more similarities than differences in types and levels of anxiety and anxiety-related impairment, with some important exceptions, including greater levels of somatization and physical functional impairment among Latinx patients. Further, perceived discrimination may be an important factor to consider when examining risk for greater symptom burden among Latinx with anxiety.

87,Anxiety-related psychopathology and chronic pain comorbidity among public safety personnel,"Canadian Public Safety Personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional service officers, dispatchers, firefighters, paramedics, police officers) regularly experience potentially traumatic, painful, and injurious events. Such exposures increase risk for developing mental disorders and chronic pain, which both involve substantial personal and social costs. The interrelationship between mental disorders and chronic pain is well-established, and both can be mutually maintaining; accordingly, understanding the relationship between mental health and chronic pain among PSP is important for improving health care. Unfortunately, the available research on such comorbidity for PSP is sparse. The current study was designed to provide initial estimates of comorbidities between mental disorders and chronic pain across diverse PSP. Participants included 5093 PSP (32% women) in six categories (i.e., Call Center Operators/Dispatchers, Correctional Workers, Firefighters, Municipal/Provincial Police, Paramedics, Royal Canadian Mounted Police) who participated in a large PSP mental health survey. The survey included established self-report measures for mental disorders and chronic pain. In the total sample, 23.1% of respondents self-reported clinically significant comorbid concerns with both mental disorders and chronic pain. The results indicated PSP who reported chronic pain were significantly more likely to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. There were differences between PSP categories; but, the most consistent indications of comorbidity were for chronic pain, PTSD, and major depressive disorder. Comorbidity between chronic pain and mental disorders among PSP is prevalent. Health care providers should regularly assess PSP for both symptom domains.

88,"Computer therapy for the anxiety and depression disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care: An updated meta-analysis","Background: A 2010 meta-analysis of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) RCTs argued ‘computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders was effective, acceptable and practical health care’ without data on effectiveness or practicality in routine practice. Methods: Databases, reviews and meta-analyses were searched for randomised controlled trials of cCBT or iCBT versus a control group (care as usual, waitlist, information control, psychological placebo, pill placebo, etc.) in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges’g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was conducted. Results: 64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials. Limitations: Studies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field. Conclusions: The conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care.

89,Psychological interventions for anxiety in adult primary care patients: A review and recommendations for future research,"Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in primary care, yet treatment rates are low. The integration of behavioral health providers into primary care via the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model offers a promising way to improve treatment options by adding a team member with the necessary skillset to deliver evidence-based psychological interventions for anxiety. We conducted a narrative review of psychological interventions for anxiety applied within adult primary care settings ( k = 44) to update the literature and evaluate the fit of existing interventions with the PCBH model. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 70.5%). Most interventions utilized cognitive-behavioral therapy (68.2%) and were delivered individually, face-to-face (52.3%). Overall, 65.9% of interventions (58.6% of RCTs, 91.7% of pre-post) were effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, and 83.3% maintained the gains at follow-up. Although it is encouraging that most interventions significantly reduced anxiety, their longer formats (i.e., number and duration of sessions) and narrow symptom targets make translation into practice difficult. Methodological limitations of the research included homogenous samples, failure to report key procedural details, pre-post designs, and restrictive eligibility criteria. We offer recommendations to guide future research to improve the likelihood of successful translation of anxiety interventions into clinical practice.

90,Who benefits most from therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy in clinical practice? Predictors of symptom change and dropout,"Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression, but not for all patients. Predictors of dropout and outcomes from ICBT remain unclear and the literature could benefit from study of response to ICBT among larger community samples using advanced statistical techniques. In this study, we sought to identify predictors of dropout and symptom change in a large community sample ( n = 1201) who received therapist-assisted transdiagnostic ICBT targeting anxiety and/or depression. Logistic regression was used to assess dropout, and showed that those who fully completed ICBT lessons ( n = 880) were older and endorsed lower psychological distress at intake than those who only partially completed ICBT lessons ( n = 321). During the course of therapy, patients responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 at six time points. Autoregressive latent trajectory models were fitted to this data to assess the ability of demographic variables, program engagement, psychological and medical service usage, and psychological distress to explain individual variance in initial symptom levels and symptom change over time. Higher symptom scores at pre-treatment were predictive of greater symptom improvement. Symptom improvement was greater in those who were off work on disability and those without higher post-secondary education. Clinical implications are discussed.

91,ICD-11 complex PTSD among Israeli male perpetrators of intimate partner violence: Construct validity and risk factors,"The International Classification of Diseases 11th Version (ICD-11) will include Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) as a unique diagnostic entity comprising core PTSD and DSO (disturbances in self-organization) symptoms. The current study had three aims: (1) assessing the validity of CPTSD in a unique population of male perpetrators of intimate partner violence; (2) examining whether exposure to different types of traumatic events would be associated with the two proposed CPTSD factors, namely PTSD or DSO; and (3) assessing the differential association of various sociodemographic and symptom characteristics with each factor. Participants were 234 males drawn randomly from a sample of 2600 men receiving treatment at 66 domestic violence centers in Israel. Data were collected using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ)—Hebrew version. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of ICD-11 CPTSD. Cumulative lifetime trauma and physical childhood neglect were associated with PTSD and DSO, while cumulative childhood violence exposure was associated only with DSO. Anxiety was associated only with DSO; depression more strongly with DSO than PTSD. Religious level contributed only to PTSD; compulsory military service only to DSO. The study supports the distinction between PTSD and DSO in the CPTSD construct and introduces the role of cultural variables.

92,"High risk, high reward: Daily perceptions of social challenge and performance in social anxiety disorder","Individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) have difficulty engaging in social situations because their actions are predicated on minimizing the subjectively biased high potential for rejection. That is, individuals with SAD frequently perceive social situations as challenging, and their performance as subpar. Yet when individuals perceive themselves as succeeding in challenging situations, they typically report these situations as enjoyable and rewarding. This subjective experience of succeeding in a challenging situation has been studied as flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; 2000). Thirty-three adults with SAD and 34 matched healthy controls completed a baseline assessment, along with daily and experience sampling entries for 14 days. Results were analyzed using three-level generalized linear mixed effects models, with observations nested within days, nested within participants. Although individuals with and without SAD experienced the same frequency of flow in daily life, social situations led to proportionally more flow in participants with SAD than healthy controls. Both results were unexpected, and reasons for them are explored at length. Several experiential variables (positive emotions during and importance ascribed to the event) predicted the probability of flow during each situation. These results offer intervention-relevant suggestions for how individuals may benefit from seeking out challenging situations that offer maximal rewards.

93,The effect of panic disorder versus anxiety sensitivity on event-related potentials during anticipation of threat,"Attention-related abnormalities are key components of the abnormal defensive responding observed in panic disorder (PD). Although behavioral studies have found aberrant attentional biases towards threat in PD, psychophysiological studies have been mixed. Predictability of threat, an important feature of threat processing, may have contributed to these mixed findings. Additionally, anxiety sensitivity , a dimensional trait associated with PD, may yield stronger associations with cognitive processes than categorical diagnoses of PD. In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs [N100, P300]) were recorded. In all participants, relative to the control condition, probe N100 was enhanced to both predictable and unpredictable threat, whereas P300 suppression was unique to predictable threat. Probe N100, but not P300, was associated with startle eyeblink during both threatening conditions, and was strongest for unpredictable threat. PD was not associated with ERPs, but anxiety sensitivity (physical concerns) was positively associated with probe N100 (indicating reduced responding) in the unpredictable condition independent of PD diagnosis. Vulnerability to panic-related psychopathology may be characterized by aberrant early processing of threat, which may be especially evident during anticipation of unpredictable threats.

94,Emotional lability and affective synchrony in posttraumatic stress disorder pathology,"This study examined the relations of PTSD pathology to both the lability of three specific emotions (anxiety, anger, self-conscious emotions [SCE]) and the extent to which changes in one emotional state co-occur with changes in another emotional state (i.e. affective synchrony). Moreover, given evidence that emotional responding in PTSD may be heightened in response to trauma-related cues, these relations were explored in the context of a trauma cue versus neutral cue. Trauma-exposed patients in residential substance use disorder treatment ( N = 157) completed a diagnostic interview and two laboratory sessions involving presentation of neutral and individualized trauma scripts. State anxiety, anger, and SCE were assessed at five points throughout each laboratory session. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that participants (regardless of PTSD status) exhibited greater lability of all emotions following the trauma script versus neutral script. Only anger lability was elevated among those with (versus without) a current PTSD diagnosis following the neutral script. Results also revealed synchrony (i.e., positive covariation) between each possible pair of emotions, regardless of PTSD status. Findings suggest that concurrent changes in anxiety and anger may be especially relevant to PTSD symptom severity.

95,Long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes in youth with anxiety disorders in efficacy trials. However, long-term outcomes of CBT delivered in a community setting are uncertain. This study examined the long-term outcomes of individual (ICBT) and group CBT (GCBT) in youth with anxiety disorders treated in community mental health clinics. A total of 139 youth (mean age at assessment 15.5 years, range 11–21 years) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (SOP), and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were evaluated, on average, 3.9 years post-treatment (range 2.2–5.9 years). Outcomes included loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses, loss of the principal anxiety diagnosis and changes in youth- and parent-rated youth anxiety symptoms. At long-term follow-up, there was loss of all inclusion anxiety diagnoses in 53%, loss of the principal anxiety diagnosis in 63% of participants as well as significant reductions in all anxiety symptom measures. No statistical significant differences in outcome were obtained between ICBT and GCBT. Participants with a principal diagnosis of SOP had lower odds for recovery, compared to those with a principal diagnosis of SAD or GAD. In conclusion, outcomes of CBT for youth anxiety disorders delivered in community mental health clinics were improved at nearly 4 years post-treatment, and recovery rates at long-term follow-up were similar to efficacy trials.

96,Difficulty concentrating in generalized anxiety disorder: An evaluation of incremental utility and relationship to worry,"Difficulty concentrating is one of the most common diagnostic criteria across DSM-5 categories, especially within the emotional (mood- and anxiety-related) disorders. A substantial literature has characterized cognitive functioning in emotional disorders using objective (behavioral) computerized cognitive tasks. However, diagnoses are typically formed on the basis of subjective (self-reported; clinician-rated) assessments of symptoms, and little is known about difficulty concentrating as a symptom. These questions are particularly important for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which has long been the subject of nosological debates, and for which several theoretical models that suggest a central role for cognitive impairments (including difficulty concentrating) in the maintenance of psychopathology have been proposed. The present study evaluated the incremental utility of difficulty concentrating and its relationship to worry and other symptoms in 175 GAD-diagnosed adults. Clinician-assessed difficulty concentrating incrementally predicted clinician-rated GAD, anxiety, and depression severity even after other GAD symptoms were controlled. Consistent with theoretical models of GAD that propose a direct relationship between worry and cognitive impairment, difficulty concentrating mediated the relationship between trait worry and clinical severity. These findings suggest that difficulty concentrating has value as a diagnostic criterion and is a potential mechanism by which worry increases distress and impairment.

97,Lower-order anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty dimensions operate as specific vulnerabilities for social anxiety and depression within a hierarchical model,"Within a hierarchical framework for depressive and anxiety disorders, negative affect (NA) is posited to be indirectly related to social anxiety and depression through cognitive vulnerabilities, including intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety sensitivity (AS). However, few prior studies have considered whether the lower-order dimensions of IU (i.e., prospective and inhibitory IU) and AS (i.e., physical, cognitive, and social concerns) better explain the indirect relation between NA and social anxiety and depression. The indirect relations between NA and social anxiety and depression through these cognitive vulnerabilities were examined using structural equation modeling in a clinical sample ( N = 298). NA and social anxiety symptoms were indirectly related through AS social concerns and inhibitory IU, although a direct effect of NA was also found. Only AS social concerns explained the relation between NA and a social anxiety disorder diagnosis. AS cognitive concerns was the only cognitive vulnerability factor to indirectly explain the relation between NA and depressive symptoms, although a direct effect of NA was also found. These findings suggest that the lower-order dimensions of AS and IU demonstrate more specific and less transdiagnostic associations with social anxiety and depression.

98,Anxiety sensitivity and sleep disturbance: Investigating associations among patients with co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorders,"Sleep disturbance is a common problem among individuals with anxiety and substance use disorders (SUD). Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is elevated in patients with anxiety disorders and SUD and has been linked to sleep-related problems, including insomnia and somnolence (i.e., daytime sleepiness). We examined the unique roles of AS cognitive, physical, and social concerns in sleep disturbance among a sample of 99 residential SUD patients with anxiety disorders. Clinical levels of insomnia or somnolence were evidenced by 53.5% of the sample. Consistent with predictions, AS physical concerns was significantly associated with insomnia, and AS cognitive concerns was significantly related to insomnia and somnolence. Hierarchical linear regression models were conducted to test the association of AS cognitive and physical concerns with insomnia and somnolence symptoms while controlling for relevant factors. AS cognitive concerns accounted for unique variance, above and beyond withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, in the model examining insomnia symptoms ( B = 0.30, SE = 0.13, p = 0.023). Results suggest that AS cognitive concerns may represent an important transdiagnostic mechanism underlying sleep disturbance among individuals with dual diagnosis.

99,The efficacy of group metacognitive therapy for children (MCT-c) with generalized anxiety disorder: An open trial,"Metacognitive therapy is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders in adults. Studies have demonstrated that the underlying theoretical model is also supported in children. It has therefore been suggested that metacognitive therapy for children may be effective. Our study is an open trial of metacognitive therapy for children with generalized anxiety as their primary disorder. Therapy was provided in groups. Families were interviewed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule—child/parent versions. They reported on the child’s anxiety levels using the Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale—child/parent versions. Children reported on metacognitive beliefs using the Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children—30 item version. Fourty-four children aged 7–13 years (50% girls) were enrolled, and one family dropped out during treatment. Fifty percent of the children had received counseling or psychological treatment for their anxiety disorder previously. Following treatment, 86.4% of the children were free of their primary disorder and 72.7% were free of all anxiety disorders, the corresponding figures were 75% and 65.9% at 6-months follow-up. The effect sizes were large for all measures and clinically significant improvements were obtained for 70% of the children at posttest and 77% at follow-up. Our study suggests that metacognitive therapy for children with generalized anxiety disorder may be a highly promising treatment approach.

100,Factor structure of the intolerance of uncertainty scale for children,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), a dispositional negative orientation toward uncertainty and its consequences, has been studied in adults, but research has only recently examined IU in youth. Despite some advances, little is known about the factor structure of measures of IU in youth. The present study used confirmatory factor analysis to examine the structure of IU as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUSC; Comer et al., 2009) in a sample of youth (N = 368) 9–18 years of age (M age = 12.47) with and without anxiety disorders and their mothers. Findings demonstrated multiple acceptable factor structures: a correlated factors 2-factor structure and a bifactor model where a general factor underlies all items. While the bifactor model provides better fit and reliability to the data, multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-factor structure distinguishes apprehensive anxiety regarding future events (prospective IU) from present-focused inhibition of behavior due to uncertainty and negative reactions to the presence of uncertainty (inhibitory IU); a total IU score predicted all anxiety domains for self- and parent-reports except for parent-report harm avoidance. Findings are discussed in terms of consistency of IU across adult and youth samples, and how results can inform treatment efforts and etiologic models of IU and anxiety.

101,Does D-cycloserine facilitate the effects of homework compliance on social anxiety symptom reduction?,"Background: Prior studies examining the effect of D-cycloserine (DCS) on homework compliance and outcome in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have yielded mixed results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCS facilitates the effects of homework compliance on symptom reduction in a large-scale study for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: 169 participants with generalized SAD received DCS or pill placebo during 12-session exposure-based group CBT. Improvements in social anxiety were assessed by independent raters at each session using the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS). Results: Controlling for LSAS at the previous session, and irrespective of treatment condition, greater homework compliance in the week prior related to lower LSAS at the next session. However, DCS did not moderate the effect of homework compliance and LSAS, LSAS on homework compliance, or the overall augmenting effect of DCS on homework compliance. Furthermore, LSAS levels were not predictive of homework compliance in the following week. Conclusion: The findings support the general benefits of homework compliance on outcome, but not a DCS-augmenting effect. The comparably small number of DCS-enhanced sessions in this study could be one reason for the failure to find a facilitating effect of DCS.

102,Do worry and its associated cognitive variables alter following CBT treatment in a youth population with Social Anxiety Disorder? Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Presents a study which aims to examine whether worry and its associated cognitive variables alter following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment in a youth population with social anxiety disorder. There were three main findings from this study. First, by 6-month follow-up of an online treatment program for youth SAD, worry, IU, NBW, PBW, NPO and CA had significantly reduced despite not being directly targeted in treatment. Second, compared to youth who retained their SAD diagnosis, those who had lost their diagnosis by 6-month follow-up showed greater reductions in worry and CA from pre-assessment to 6-month follow-up. Third, compared to youth who retained their SAD diagnosis, those who lost their diagnosis by 6-month follow-up demonstrated lower baseline levels of NPO. The current study advances one's understanding of the cognitive constructs associated with youth SAD, a relatively common and debilitating disorder.

103,Parental reactions to children’s negative affect: The moderating role of parental GAD,"The impact of parental anxiety disorders has been explored in broad categories of parenting behaviors; however, less is known about the impact of parental anxiety on emotion socialization behaviors. The current study tested the conditional effect of parental Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) on one aspect of emotion socialization, parents’ reactions to their child’s negative affect. Participants were 89 children between ages 3 and 12 and their parents, from a community sample. Parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV), an interaction task with their child, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory-II (BAI-II). Overall, the data supported study hypotheses. Parental GAD moderated the relationship between child’s negative affect and parental over control and emotional discouragement. Specifically, children’s negative affect was positively related to parental emotional discouragement for parents with GAD, but not for parents without a diagnosis. Conversely, children’s negative affect was not predictive of parental overcontrol for parents with GAD, but increases in children’s negative affect did predict increases in parental overcontrol for parents without a diagnosis. The present findings suggest parents diagnosed with GAD are discouraging of their children’s emotional experiences and fail to adjust their level of guidance throughout situations which induce negative affect, leaving children to cope with negative emotions on their own.

40,Interpretation training to target repetitive negative thinking in generalized anxiety disorder and depression,"Objective: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) for example, worry in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination in depression, is often targeted during psychological treatments. To test the hypothesis that negative interpretation bias contributes to worry and rumination, we assessed the effects of inducing more positive interpretations in reducing RNT. Method: Volunteers diagnosed with GAD (66) or depression (65) were randomly allocated to one of two versions of cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I), either with or without RNT priming prior to training, or a control condition, each involving 10 Internet-delivered sessions. Outcome measures of interpretation bias, a behavioral RNT task and self-reported worry, rumination, anxiety and depression were obtained at baseline, after home-based training and at 1-month follow-up (self-report questionnaires only). Results: CBM-I training, across diagnostic groups, promoted a more positive interpretation bias and led to reductions in worry, rumination, and depressive symptoms, which were maintained at follow-up. Anxiety symptoms were reduced only in the GAD group at follow-up. There were no differences between CBM-I versions; brief priming of RNT did not influence CBM-I effectiveness. Level of interpretation bias post training partially mediated the effects of CBM-I on follow-up questionnaire scores. Conclusions: In contrast to some recent failures to demonstrate improvements following Internet-delivered CBM, we found that self-reported RNT and negative mood were reduced by CBM-I. This is consistent with a causal role for negative interpretation bias in both worry and rumination, suggesting a useful role for CBM-I within treatments for anxiety and depression.",2153617574.0, Journal Article,2018
41,Sustaining attendance at a mental health service: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: A substantial proportion of psychotherapeutic treatments are prematurely terminated because the client discontinues attendance. Interventions have been developed to reduce premature termination, but these are only moderately effective and often place considerable burden on clients and services. This research evaluated a brief, low-cost self-regulation intervention (i.e., implementation intentions) designed to sustain attendance at a group psychoeducation program. Method: Clients (N = 82) who had been referred for a psychological intervention due to anxiety or depression were sent a questionnaire concerning their views of attendance. Participants were randomly assigned to form an implementation intention as part of the questionnaire or not (controls). Attendance was then monitored over the 5 scheduled sessions of an evidence-based psychoeducational intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that forming implementation intentions led to attendance at a greater number of sessions (M = 2.84 vs. 1.62), p &lt; .01, and higher rates of completing the full course of treatment compared to controls (35% vs. 11%), p &lt; .02. Conclusions: An intervention rooted in basic research on the psychology of action increased and sustained attendance at a mental health service.",2153616205.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
42,"Towards personalized, brain-based behavioral intervention for transdiagnostic anxiety: Transient neural responses to negative images predict outcomes following a targeted computer-based intervention.","Objective: Clinical anxiety is prevalent, highly comorbid with other conditions, and associated with significant medical morbidity, disability, and public health burden. Excessive attentional deployment toward threat is a transdiagnostic dimension of anxiety seen at both initial and sustained stages of threat processing. However, group-level observations of these phenomena mask considerable within-group heterogeneity that has been linked to treatment outcomes, suggesting that a transdiagnostic, individual differences approach may capture critical, clinically relevant information. Method: Seventy clinically anxious individuals were randomized to receive 8 sessions of attention bias modification (ABM; n = 41 included in analysis), a computer-based mechanistic intervention that specifically targets initial stages of threat processing, or a sham control (n = 21). Participants completed a mixed block/event-related functional MRI task optimized to discriminate transient from sustained neural responses to threat. Results: Larger transient responses across a wide range of cognitive-affective regions (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) predicted better clinical outcomes following ABM, in both a priori anatomical regions and whole-brain analyses; sustained responses did not. A spatial pattern recognition algorithm using transient threat responses successfully discriminated the top quartile of ABM responders with 68% accuracy. Conclusions: Neural alterations occurring on the relatively transient timescale that is specifically targeted by ABM predict favorable clinical outcomes. Results inform how to expand on the initial promise of neurocognitive treatments like ABM by fine-tuning their clinical indications (e.g., through personalized mechanistic intervention relevant across diagnoses) and by increasing the range of mechanisms that can be targeted (e.g., through synergistic treatment combinations and/or novel neurocognitive training protocols designed to tackle identified predictors of nonresponse).",2153615986.0, Journal Article,2018
43,Anxiety Sensitivity and Suicidal Ideation/Suicide Risk: A Meta-Analysis,"Objective: Suicide is a global public health concern. To inform the prevention and treatment of suicidality, it is crucial to identify transdiagnostic vulnerability factors for suicide and suicide-related conditions. One candidate factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS)-the fear of anxiety-related sensations-which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a host of mental health outcomes, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Importantly, AS is distinct from trait anxiety and negative affectivity, highlighting its potential incremental utility in the understanding of psychopathology. Despite a burgeoning body of literature demonstrating that AS is linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, this research has yet to be synthesized. Method: This meta-analysis includes 33 articles representing 34 nonredundant samples (N = 14,002) that examined at least one relationship between AS global or subfactor (i.e., cognitive, physical, social) scores and suicidal ideation and/or suicide risk. Results: Findings revealed small-to-moderate and moderate associations between global AS and suicidal ideation (r = .24, 95% confidence interval (CI): [.21, .26], p &lt; .001) and suicide risk (r = .35, 95% CI [.31, .38], p &lt; .001), respectively. All AS subfactors evinced significant associations with suicidal ideation (rs = .13–.24) and suicide risk (rs = .22–.32). Conclusions: AS is related to suicidal ideation and global suicide risk. Research is needed to disentangle AS from other indices of distress in the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",2125723941.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
44,Does Centrality in a Cross-Sectional Network Suggest Intervention Targets for Social Anxiety Disorder?,"Objective: Network analysis allows us to identify the most interconnected (i.e., central) symptoms, and multiple authors have suggested that these symptoms might be important treatment targets. This is because change in central symptoms (relative to others) should have greater impact on change in all other symptoms. It has been argued that networks derived from cross-sectional data may help identify such important symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in social anxiety disorder. Method: We first estimated a state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation network based on participants with social anxiety disorder (n = 910) to determine which symptoms were more central. Next, we tested whether change in these central symptoms were indeed more related to overall symptom change in a separate dataset of participants with social anxiety disorder who underwent a variety of treatments (n = 244). We also tested whether relatively superficial item properties (infrequency of endorsement and variance of items) might account for any effects shown for central symptoms. Results: Centrality indices successfully predicted how strongly changes in items correlated with change in the remainder of the items. Findings were limited to the measure used in the network and did not generalize to three other measures related to social anxiety severity. In contrast, infrequency of endorsement showed associations across all measures. Conclusions: The transfer of recently published results from cross-sectional network analyses to treatment data is unlikely to be straightforward.",2125760105.0, Journal Article,2018
45,Cognitive–behavioral therapy for youth anxiety: An effectiveness evaluation in community practice,"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of individual cognitive–behavioral therapy (ICBT) and group CBT (GCBT) for referred children with anxiety disorders within community mental health clinics. Method: Children (N = 165; ages 7–13 years) referred to 5 clinics in Norway because of primary separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (SOC), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria participated in a randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to ICBT, GCBT, or wait list (WL). WL participants were randomized to 1 of the 2 active treatment conditions following the wait period. Primary outcome was loss of principal anxiety disorder over 12 weeks and 2-year follow-up. Results: Both ICBT and GCBT were superior to WL on all outcomes. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 52% in ICBT, 65% in GCBT, and 14% in WL were treatment responders. Planned pairwise comparisons found no significant differences between ICBT and GCBT. GCBT was superior to ICBT for children diagnosed with SOC. Improvement continued during 2-year follow-up with no significant between-groups differences. Conclusions: Among anxiety disordered children, both individual and group CBT can be effectively delivered in community clinics. Response rates were similar to those reported in efficacy trials. Although GCBT was more effective than ICBT for children with SOC following treatment, both treatments were comparable at 2-year follow-up. Dropout rates were lower in GCBT than in ICBT, suggesting that GCBT may be better tolerated. Response rates continued to improve over the follow-up period, with low rates of relapse.",2112643118.0, Journal Article,2018
46,Results from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Longitudinal Study (CAMELS): Functional outcomes,"Objective: To report functional outcomes from the multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (CAMELS), which examined the impact of youth anxiety treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], coping cat; Sertraline, SRT; COMB [CBT + SRT]; pill placebo) on (a) global and (b) domain-specific functioning assessed an average of 3.1 times, 3- to 12-years postrandomization (first assessment = mean 6.5 years postrandomization). Method: Three-hundred and 19 of 488 families from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS; Walkup et al., 2008) participated. Growth curve modeling examined the impact of treatment condition and acute treatment outcomes (i.e., response, remission) on global functioning, global and domain-specific impairment, and life satisfaction across follow-up visits. Logistic regressions explored the impact of treatment remission and condition on low frequency events (arrests/convictions) and education. Results: Treatment responders and remitters demonstrated better global functioning, decreased overall impairment, and increased life satisfaction at follow-up. Treatment remission, but not response, predicted decreased domain-specific impairment (social relationships, self-care/independence, academic functioning), and maintenance of increased life satisfaction across follow-ups. Participants in the CBT condition, compared with pill placebo, demonstrated improved trajectories pertaining to life satisfaction, overall impairment, and impairment in academic functioning. Randomization to CBT or COMB treatment was associated with increasing employment rates. Trajectories for participants randomized to SRT was not significantly different from placebo. Treatment outcome and condition did not predict legal outcomes, school/work variables, or family life. Conclusion: Positive early intervention outcomes are associated with improved overall functioning, life satisfaction, and functioning within specific domains 6.5 years posttreatment. Treatment type differentially predicted trajectories of functioning. Findings support the positive impact of pediatric anxiety treatment into adolescence and early adulthood.",2112642297.0, Journal Article,2018
47,"When the torch is passed, does the flame still burn? Testing a “train the supervisor” model for the Child STEPs treatment program","Objective: We assessed sustainability of an empirically supported, transdiagnostic youth psychotherapy program when therapist supervision was shifted from external experts to internal clinic staff. Method: One hundred sixty-eight youths, aged 6–15 years, 59.5% male, 85.1% Caucasian, were treated for anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, or conduct problems by clinicians employed in community mental health clinics. In Phase 1 (2.7 years), 1 group of clinicians, the Sustain group, received training in Child STEPs (a modular transdiagnostic treatment + weekly feedback on youth response) and treated clinic-referred youths, guided by weekly supervision from external STEPs experts. In Phase 2 (2.9 years), Sustain clinicians treated additional youths but with supervision by clinic staff who had been trained to supervise STEPs. Also in Phase 2, a new group, External Supervision clinicians, received training and supervision from external STEPs experts and treated referred youths. Phase 2 youths were randomized to Sustain or External Supervision clinicians. Groups were compared on 3 therapist fidelity measures and 14 clinical outcome measures. Results: Sustain clinicians maintained their previous levels of fidelity and youth outcomes after switching from external to internal supervision; and in Phase 2, the Sustain and External Supervision groups also did not differ on fidelity or youth outcomes. Whereas all 34 group comparisons were nonsignificant, trends with the largest effect sizes showed better clinical outcomes for internal than external supervision. Conclusions: Implementation of empirically supported transdiagnostic treatment may be sustained when supervision is transferred from external experts to trained clinic staff, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness and staying power in clinical practice.",2112642291.0, Journal Article,2018
48,More than my RA: A randomized trial investigating body image improvement among women with rheumatoid arthritis using a functionality-focused intervention program,"Objective: Negative body image is prevalent in women with rheumatoid arthritis and can affect other areas of well-being. Patients have expressed desire for body image to be addressed in treatment. Yet, it is not routinely addressed and no experimental intervention research has been conducted, until now. This randomized trial evaluated a brief online body image intervention for women with rheumatoid arthritis, with a focus on body functionality (everything the body is capable of doing) as the primary technique. Method: Women with rheumatoid arthritis and who wanted to feel better about their body (N = 84; Mage = 44.82) were randomized to the Expand Your Horizon intervention (comprising 3 writing exercises focusing on body functionality) or a waitlist control group. Primary outcomes concerned body image and secondary outcomes related to rheumatoid arthritis; these outcomes were assessed at pretest, posttest, and at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses showed that, relative to control, participants in the intervention experienced improvements in various aspects of body image (functionality appreciation, body appreciation, body satisfaction, body–self alienation) and decreases in depression, with effects persisting at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. No intervention effects were found for body–self harmony, rheumatoid arthritis-specific disability, pain-related disability, and anxiety. Conclusions: Focusing on body functionality can improve body image and reduce depression in women with rheumatoid arthritis. The intervention technique is easy and affordable to deliver and could be a fruitful addition to extant treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.",2103705589.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
49,Brief Mindfulness Training for Negative Affectivity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objective: Over the last 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of brief mindfulness training (from single-session inductions to multisession interventions lasting up to 2 weeks), with some preliminary indications that these training programs may improve mental health outcomes, such as negative affectivity. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether brief mindfulness training reliably reduces negative affectivity. Method: PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Mindfulness Research Monthly Newsletter were systematically searched for brief mindfulness intervention RCTs assessing negative affectivity outcomes (e.g., depression, rumination, anxiety, stress). Sixty-five RCTs, including 5,489 participants predominantly without experience in meditation (64.64% female, mean age = 24.62), qualified for the meta-analytic review. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a small but significant effect of brief mindfulness training on reducing negative affectivity compared to control programs (g = .21, p &lt; .001). The overall effect size was significantly moderated by participant characteristics: community samples (g = .41, p &lt; .001) produced larger training effects compared to student samples (g = .14, p = .001; Q between p = .03). No significant effect size differences were found between clinical and nonclinical samples. However, when accounting for publication bias, the overall effect size of brief mindfulness training programs on negative affectivity was significantly reduced (g = .04). Conclusions: Brief mindfulness training programs are increasingly popular approaches for reducing negative affectivity. This meta-analysis indicates that brief mindfulness training modestly reduces negative affectivity. Quantitative analyses indicated the presence of publication bias (i.e., unpublished null effect studies), highlighting the need to continue rigorous evaluation of brief mindfulness interventions.",2103699198.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
50,Exposure and CBT for chronic back pain: An RCT on differential efficacy and optimal length of treatment,"Objective: Our aim was to establish whether Exposure, a specialized tailored treatment for chronic low back pain, has any advantages over cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) among individuals with high fear-avoidance levels. Second, we planned to compare short and long versions of Exposure. Third, we aimed to investigate whether Exposure can be delivered in an outpatient psychological setting. Method: A total of 88 Caucasian participants (55% women) were randomized to three different psychological treatment conditions, Exposure-long, Exposure-short, and CBT. All participants were suffering from chronic pain and elevated levels of pain-related anxiety and disability. The primary outcomes were disability (assessed using two different questionnaires, QBPDS and PDI) and average pain intensity; secondary outcomes included pain-related anxiety, psychological flexibility, coping strategies, and depression. Assessments took place at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Results: Exposure was more effective than CBT at reducing movement-related disability assessed with the QBPDS. Exposure and CBT did not differ in reduction of pain intensity or disability assessed using the PDI. Exposure-short outperformed Exposure-long after 10 sessions, meaning that individuals improved faster when they were offered fewer sessions. Exposure could be safely delivered in the psychological setting. Concerning secondary outcomes, Exposure led to greater improvements in psychological flexibility relative to CBT. CBT was more effective than Exposure at enhancing coping strategies. In Exposure, significantly more participants dropped out. Conclusions: Although being more challenging to patients, Exposure is an effective treatment, which can be delivered in a psychological treatment setting and should be offered as a short-term treatment.",2103707803.0, Journal Article,2018
51,Treatment of social approach processes in adults with social anxiety disorder,"Objective: Despite the social impairment associated with social anxiety disorder (SAD), little research has examined the impact of treatment on positive relational functioning. Accordingly, the authors conducted a treatment outcome study to evaluate a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) regimen augmented by a relational focus (CBT-R) relative to a graduated exposure-applied relaxation (GEAR) regimen and wait list (WL) control. To examine the mechanism(s) that underlies treatment effects, they used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate two potential mediators, change in judgment biases and in safety behaviors. Method: Treatment-seeking adults who met SAD diagnostic criteria (n = 100; 50% women; mean age = 32.9 years.; 36% ethnic minority) were randomly assigned to CBT-R, GEAR, or WL. CBT-R and GEAR participants received 14 group treatment sessions. Social initiation, relationship satisfaction, and a SAD symptom composite were assessed at pre- and postassessment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Intent-to-treat multilevel modeling analyses indicated that the CBT-R regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement relative to GEAR on relationship satisfaction and SAD symptoms. SEM results revealed that change in safety behaviors partially mediated the superior performance of CBT-R on both variables with confidence intervals set at .90. Conclusions: These findings indicate that CBT-based regimens can improve social approach processes in individuals with SAD and that safety behavior reduction contributes to positive outcomes.",2103706613.0, Journal Article,2018
52,A mobile app for social anxiety disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing mobile and PC-based guided self-help interventions,"Objective: Internet-based cognitive–behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users’ everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen’s d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. Conclusions: ICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones.",2103704756.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
53,Effects of anxiety sensitivity reduction on smoking abstinence: An analysis from a panic prevention program,"Objective: Scientific evidence implicates anxiety sensitivity (AS) as a risk factor for poor smoking cessation outcomes. Integrated smoking cessation programs that target AS may lead to improved smoking cessation outcomes, potentially through AS reduction. Yet, little work has evaluated the efficacy of integrated smoking cessation treatment on smoking abstinence. The present study prospectively examined treatment effects of a novel AS reduction-smoking cessation intervention relative to a standard smoking cessation intervention on smoking abstinence. Method: Participants (N = 529; 45.9% male; Mage = 38.23, SD = 13.56) included treatment-seeking smokers who received either a 4-session integrated anxiety-reduction and smoking cessation intervention (Smoking Treatment and Anxiety Management Program; [STAMP]) or a 4-session standard smoking cessation program (SCP). The primary aims focused on examining the effects of STAMP on (a) AS reduction during treatment, (b) early and late smoking point prevalence abstinence, and (c) the mechanistic function of AS reduction on treatment effects across early and late smoking abstinence. Results: Results indicated a significantly greater decline in AS in STAMP relative to SCP (B = −.72, p &lt; .001). Treatment condition did not significantly directly predict early or late abstinence. However, the effect of STAMP on early abstinence was significantly mediated by reductions in AS (indirect = .16, 95% CI [.02, .40]). Conclusions: Findings provide evidence for the efficacy of a novel, integrated anxiety and smoking cessation treatment to reduce AS. Moreover, the meditation pathway from STAMP to early abstinence through reductions in AS suggest that AS is a clinically important mechanism of change for smoking cessation treatment and research.",2103705331.0, Journal Article,2018
54,Congruence of Therapeutic Bond Perceptions and Its Relation to Treatment Outcome: Within- and Between-Dyad Effects,"Objective: The present study investigates the association between congruence of patients’ and therapists’ perceptions of the therapeutic bond and symptom improvement. Method: Bond congruence-outcome associations were examined on the within- and between-dyad level for 580 patients (mainly depression and anxiety) receiving cognitive–behavioral therapy. Symptom change was assessed on a session-to-session level as well as from pre- to posttreatment. For the between-dyad analyses, the truth and bias model was applied. For the within-dyad analyses, polynomial regression and response surface analysis were conducted. Results: On the between-dyad level, higher temporal congruence between patients’ and therapists’ bond ratings (i.e., their correlation) was associated with better treatment outcomes. Additionally, the average discrepancy between therapists’ and patients’ bond ratings showed a significant quadratic association with treatment outcome. A tendency for therapists to moderately rate the bond lower than their patients’ showed lowest posttreatment symptom scores. On the within-dyad level, we found that when patients’ and therapists’ ratings were in “agreement,” higher bond scores were associated with fewer next-session symptoms. For “disagreement,” the results showed that if therapists rated the bond as weak, whereas their patients rated it as strong, higher subsequent symptom distress was observed than if patients rated the bond as weak and their therapists rated it as strong. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of therapists being vigilant to session-to-session changes in the therapeutic bond to adjust their interventions accordingly.",2104952393.0, Journal Article,2018
55,A randomized controlled trial of emotion regulation therapy for generalized anxiety disorder with and without co-occurring depression,"Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression (MDD), especially when they co-occur, are associated with suboptimal treatment response. One common feature of these disorders is negative self-referential processing (NSRP; i.e., worry, rumination), which worsens treatment outcome. Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) integrates principles from affect science with traditional and contemporary cognitive-behavioral treatments to identify and modify the functional nature of NSRP by targeting motivational and regulatory mechanisms, as well as behavioral consequences. Method: Building on encouraging open trial findings, 53 patients with a primary diagnosis of GAD (43% with comorbid MDD) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment with ERT (n = 28) or a modified attention control condition (MAC, n = 25). Results: ERT patients, as compared with MAC patients, evidenced statistically and clinically meaningful improvement on clinical indicators of GAD and MDD, worry, rumination, comorbid disorder severity, functional impairment, quality of life, as well as hypothesized mechanisms reflecting mindful attentional, metacognitive, and overall emotion regulation, which all demonstrated mediation of primary outcomes. This superiority of ERT exceeded medium effect sizes with most outcomes surpassing conventions for a large effect. Treatment effects were maintained for nine months following the end of acute treatment. Overall, ERT resulted in high rates of high endstate functioning for both GAD and MDD that were maintained into the follow-up period. Conclusions: Findings provide encouraging support for the efficacy and hypothesized mechanisms underlying ERT and point to fruitful directions for improving our understanding and treatment of complex clinical conditions such as GAD with co-occurring MDD.",2023709294.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
56,How does exposure therapy work? A comparison between generic and gastrointestinal anxiety–specific mediators in a dismantling study of exposure therapy for irritable bowel syndrome,"Objective: Systematic exposure is potentially an effective treatment procedure for treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little is known about the processes by which it achieves its effect on outcome. The aim of this study was to identify mediators in a previously published randomized dismantling trial in which participants with IBS were randomized to Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral treatment (ICBT) that incorporated systematic exposure or to the same treatment protocol without exposure (ICBT-WE). Method: Weekly measurements of gastrointestinal anxiety--specific process variables (behavioral avoidance, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety) based on the gastrointestinal symptom--specific anxiety model, generic process variables (self-efficacy and mindful nonreactivity), and treatment outcome (IBS symptoms) were obtained from 309 participants with IBS. Growth models and cross-lagged panel models, estimated within structural equation modeling, were employed to evaluate mediators of outcome. Results: Parallel process growth modeling showed that behavioral avoidance, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, self-efficacy mediated the incremental effect of ICBT compared to ICBT-WE. The mediated effect of avoidance was stronger for individuals scoring high on the avoidance variable at 1st measurement point. Cross-lagged regression analyses with random effects revealed that behavioral avoidance and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety had a stronger effect on subsequent symptom change rather than vice versa, whereas mindful nonreactivity and self-efficacy displayed the opposite pattern. Conclusions: The evidence collectively provided support for the hypothesis that exposure for IBS achieves its positive results by virtue of changing gastrointestinal anxiety-specific processes rather than generic processes. IBS-specific behavioral avoidance emerged as the most clear-cut mediator of the specific effect of exposure on outcome.",2023708572.0, Journal Article,2018
57,Training clinicians to deliver group CBT to manage anxiety in youth with ASD: Results of a multisite trial,"Objective: Few guidelines are available regarding optimal training models for practitioners delivering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study systematically compared 3 instructional conditions for delivering the Facing Your Fears program (FYF) to children with ASD and anxiety. Method: Thirty-four clinicians (Mage = 34 years; 94% women, 88% Caucasian) and an intent-to-treat sample of 91 children with ASD and anxiety (Mage = 11; 84% male 53% Caucasian) met eligibility criteria across 4 sites. A 3-group parallel design via a Latin square procedure was used to randomize 9 teams of clinicians to 1 of 3 training conditions: Manual, Workshop, Workshop-Plus. The effectiveness of instructional condition was assessed via implementation (CBT knowledge, treatment fidelity) and treatment outcomes (reductions in anxiety as measured by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Parent (ADIS-P). Results: Clinicians in both Workshop conditions significantly increased CBT knowledge postworkshop, F(1, 18) = 19.8, p &lt; .001. Excellent treatment fidelity was obtained across conditions (above 89%), although clinicians in the Workshop conditions obtained significantly higher fidelity ratings and delivered FYF with greater quality than the Manual condition. Children with ASD demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms for three of the four anxiety diagnoses, with no differences noted across instructional condition. Rates of improvement were lower than those obtained in a previous controlled trial. Conclusions: Results suggest that although there may be some advantage to participating in a Workshop, clinicians in all conditions could deliver FYF with excellent fidelity and yield positive treatment outcomes. Lack of a no-treatment comparison group limits interpretation of findings.",2023707491.0, Journal Article,2018
58,Compassion-focused therapy as guided self-help for enhancing public mental health: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Despite promising results for compassion-focused therapy (CFT) as self-help, larger-scale trials including long-term follow-up data are needed to establish its effectiveness in the context of public mental health. Empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving well-being is lacking. In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of CFT as guided self-help on well-being were evaluated. Method: Adults (mean age = 52.87, SD = 9.99, 74.8% female) with low to moderate levels of well-being were recruited in the Dutch population and randomized to CFT (n = 120) or a waitlist control group (n = 122). Participants completed the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (well-being), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression and anxiety), Perceived Stress Scale (stress), Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (self-compassion), Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Reassurance Scale (self-criticism and self-reassurance), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (positive/negative affect), and Gratitude questionnaire (gratitude) at baseline, postintervention (3 months), 3- and 9-month follow-up. Results: Compared with the waitlist control group, the CFT group showed superior improvement on well-being at postintervention, d = .51, 95% CI [.25, .77], p &lt; .001, and 3-month follow-up, d = .39, 95% CI [.13, .65], p &lt; .001. No significant moderators were found. On all secondary outcome measures but positive affect, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements up to 3-month follow-up. At 9-month follow-up, improvements on all measures were retained or amplified among CFT participants. Conclusions: CFT as guided self-help shows promise as a public mental health strategy for enhancing well-being and reducing psychological distress.",2007670724.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
59,Follow-up of monotherapy remitters in the PReDICT study: Maintenance treatment outcomes and clinical predictors of recurrence,"Objective: This study followed remitted patients from a randomized controlled trial of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The aims were to describe rates of recurrence and to evaluate 3 clinical predictor domains. Method: Ninety-four treatment-naive patients (50% female; Mage = 38.1 years; 48.9% White; 30.9% Hispanic) with MDD who had remitted to 12-week monotherapy (escitalopram, duloxetine, or cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) participated in a 21-month maintenance phase (i.e., continued medication or 3 possible CBT booster sessions per year). Recurrence was assessed quarterly, and the clinical predictors were the following: 2 measures of residual depressive symptoms, 1 measure of lifetime depressive episodes, and 2 measures of baseline anxiety. Survival analysis models evaluated recurrence rates, and regression models evaluated the predictors. Results: Among all patients, 15.5% experienced a recurrence, and the survival distributions did not statistically differ among treatments. Residual depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the end of monotherapy were associated with increased risk for recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.02, 1.67], Wald X2 = 4.41, p = .036), and not having a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at study baseline reduced the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = .31, 95% CI [.10, .94], Wald X2 = 4.28, p = .039). Conclusions: The study supported the benefits of maintenance treatment for treatment-naive patients who remitted to initial monotherapy; nevertheless, remitted patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at the beginning of treatment or residual depressive symptoms after initial treatment were at risk for poorer long-term outcomes.",2007670589.0, Journal Article,2018
60,Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating the Preliminary Effectiveness of an Integrated Anxiety Disorder Treatment in Substance Use Disorder Specialty Clinics,"Objective: Anxiety and substance use disorders are highly comorbid and mutually maintain each other. Treatments for anxiety disorders that are well integrated into substance use disorder treatment have the potential to improve both anxiety and substance use outcomes. Method: Ninety-seven individuals seeking treatment at a community-based, evidence-based intensive outpatient program for substance use disorders who also had anxiety disorders were randomized to either (a) usual care (UC) at the intensive outpatient program; or (b) UC + coordinated anxiety learning and management for addiction recovery centers (CALM ARC), a 7-session, group-based, computer-assisted but therapist-directed treatment for anxiety disorders adapted for individuals with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder comorbidity. Results: CALM ARC + UC outperformed UC on measures of anxiety and substance use at posttreatment and at a 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Adding CALM ARC to UC for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and substance use disorders is superior to UC alone. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.",1992643718.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
61,Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Versus Psychoeducation Control for Illness Anxiety Disorder and Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: To examine the efficacy of an Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for health anxiety compared to an active psychoeducation control group. Method: Individuals (N = 86, mean age: 30 years, 87% female) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder with health anxiety were randomized to either a 6-lesson clinician-guided iCBT program for health anxiety (n = 45) or an active control group who received anxiety psychoeducation, clinical support, and monitoring (control, n = 41) over a 12-week period. Results: Both groups experienced significant improvements between baseline and posttreatment on self-report measures of health anxiety, depression, general anxiety, and functional impairment. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that the iCBT group experienced greater improvements in health anxiety on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) compared to controls (between-groups effect size = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [0.87, 1.93]), and a greater proportion of the iCBT group showed clinically reliable change on the SHAI (84% vs. 34% in the control group). Similarly, the iCBT group outperformed the control group on secondary measures of depression, generalized anxiety, functional impairment, maladaptive cognitions, body hypervigilance, safety behaviors and avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty. Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up in the iCBT group. Conclusion: iCBT for health anxiety is more effective than psychoeducation, clinical support, and monitoring, and presents an efficacious and accessible treatment option for people with health anxiety.",1992640474.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
62,The Mediating Effect of Family Cohesion in Reducing Patient Symptoms and Family Distress in a Culturally Informed Family Therapy for Schizophrenia: A Parallel-Process Latent-Growth Model,"Objective: Although both patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers report elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS), affective symptoms in patients and family members seldom constitute a primary treatment focus. The present study tested whether a culturally informed family therapy for schizophrenia (CIT-S) outperformed standard family psychoeducation (PSY-ED) not only in decreasing patient schizophrenia symptoms, but also in decreasing individual DASS. Because CIT-S fostered family cohesion throughout treatment, we predicted that increases in family cohesion would mediate treatment effects. Method: Participants included 266 patients and family members nested within 115 families, randomized to the CIT-S or PSY-ED conditions. We specified a series of multilevel latent growth and latent change models to examine direct effects of CIT-S on patient schizophrenia symptoms, individual DASS, and family cohesion over time. Next, we used parallel-process growth models to test the indirect effect of CIT-S on decreasing patient and caregiver psychopathology over time via changes in family cohesion. Results: The CIT-S treatment significantly reduced patient schizophrenia symptoms from baseline to follow-up (γ = -1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-2.83, -0.60]), as well as individual DASS (γ = -4.39, 95% CI [-6.44, -2.34]) from baseline to termination. In line with treatment goals, CIT-S increased family cohesion from baseline to midpoint (γ = 0.93, 95% CI [0.06, 1.80]). The CIT-S-related change in cohesion mediated changes in DASS (γ = -0.87, 95% CI [-1.47, -0.27]), but not patient symptoms. Conclusion: By integrating the family's cultural context into treatment, clinicians may foster family dynamics that enhance treatment outcomes and promote broad improvements in mental health.",1992639863.0, Journal Article,2018
63,A Prospective Investigation of the Synergistic Effect of Change in Anxiety Sensitivity and Dysphoria on Tobacco Withdrawal,"Objective: Prevailing theory and research suggests the psychological and physiological discomfort associated with tobacco withdrawal may play a formative role in the risk of cessation failure. Yet, research elucidating cognitive-affective vulnerability characteristics that contribute to increased tobacco withdrawal severity during periods of planned abstinence is highly limited. In the current study, we explored whether smokers with greater reductions of Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and dysphoria during a smoking cessation intervention would experience less severe postquit tobacco withdrawal. Method: Specifically, the interactive effect of change (from preintervention baseline to quit day) in AS and dysphoria in relation to postquit withdrawal severity (quit day through 12 weeks postquit) was examined among treatment-seeking adult smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation trial (N = 198; 55.3% female; 86.8% Caucasian; Mage = 38.8, SD = 14.0). Results: Results indicated that the interactive effect of change in AS and dysphoria was related to linear change in postquit withdrawal symptoms. Specifically, larger reductions in AS were associated with a faster decline in the severity of withdrawal symptoms across the 12-week postquit period only for individuals with lower (but not higher) reductions in dysphoria. Additionally, the findings indicated that reducing levels of AS and dysphoria prequit is broadly related to the degree of change in postquit withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: Collectively, these data suggest there is apt to be clinical merit to employing strategies to address AS and/or dysphoria to more effectively manage emergent withdrawal symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.",1992639807.0, Journal Article,2018
403,Prenatal maternal anxiety and children's brain structure and function: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 253 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-36780-058). The authors regret not fully describing Mennes et al. (2009)’s use of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory as a key prenatal predictor and how it was employed differently as a potential confounder. This has been corrected in three places, as given in the erratum.] Background: Maternal anxiety disorders are common during pregnancy and postpartum, and are associated with increased behaviour problems and risk of mental health difficulties in children. Understanding alterations in brain structure and function associated with maternal anxiety may help elucidate potential mechanisms via which high maternal anxiety could affect children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of extant research studying the associations between prenatal anxiety and children's brain structure and function, as assessed through neuroimaging. Data were gathered in accordance with the PRISMA review guidelines. Results: Ten articles were identified, and all found a significant association between antenatal maternal anxiety and child neurodevelopment. Studies vary considerably in their methods with five studies employing electroencephalography (EEG), one using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the rest employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Limitations: The heterogeneity of neuroimaging techniques undertaken by the reviewed studies precluded a meta-analysis from being performed. The applicability of this systematic review to clinical practice is also limited given that the studies examined children across a wide age range (neonates to 17 years). Conclusions: From early infancy to late adolescence, findings suggest alterations of brain structure and function in frontal, temporal, and limbic areas in children born to mothers who experienced prenatal anxiety. These brain abnormalities may underlie associations between prenatal anxiety and children's behaviour, though more research incorporating neuroimaging and behavioural data is necessary to determine this.

404,Repetitive negative thinking as a predictor of depression and anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is assumed to be a transdiagnostic proximal risk factor in depression and anxiety. We examined the prospective relations of disorder-dependent as well as disorder-independent measures of RNT with depression and anxiety outcomes. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 1972 adults completed a 3-year follow-up period (attrition = 12.6%). DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with the CIDI, symptom severity with the IDS and BAI, and RNT with measures for perseverative thinking (PTQ), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PWQ). Results: The common dimension of our RNT measurements (according to Confirmatory Factor Analysis) was significantly associated with comorbidity among depressive and among anxiety disorders, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as persistence and relapse of depressive and anxiety disorders. Additionally, a specific factor for rumination predicted comorbidity of depressive disorders, comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of depressive disorder, while a specific factor for worry predicted comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of anxiety disorders, although to a lesser extent than general RNT. Limitations: The present study relied solely on self-report measures of RNT and controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables greatly attenuated the predictive value of RNT. Discussion: Disorder-independent RNT may be a similar underlying process present across depressive and anxiety disorders. It seems more important than the representation of this process in disorder-specific cognitive content such as rumination in depression and worry in anxiety. RNT as a pathological trait deserves more attention in clinical diagnosis and the transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety in particular.

405,"Cognitive biases predict symptoms of depression, anxiety and wellbeing above and beyond neuroticism in adolescence","Background: Adolescence represents a period of vulnerability to affective disorders. Neuroticism is considered a heritable risk factor for depression, but is not directly amenable to intervention. Therefore, it is important to identify the contributions of modifiable risk factors. Negative cognitive biases are implicated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders in adults, and may represent modifiable risk factors in adolescence. Aim(s): This study sought to assess to what extent cognitive biases are able to predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing beyond that of neuroticism in adolescents. Methods: Adolescents (N = 99), recruited from Scottish secondary schools (54.5% female; mean age = 14.7), ensured a sample representing the breadth of the mental health spectrum. In line with prevalence estimates, 18% of this sample demonstrated clinical levels of depression symptoms. Cognitive biases of autobiographical memory, self-referential memory, ambiguous scenarios interpretation, facial expression recognition, rumination and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed. Depression, anxiety, and wellbeing were indexed using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the BBC Subjective Wellbeing Scale. Results: Regression analyses demonstrated neuroticism to significantly predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing. The addition of cognitive biases resulted in a significant increase of explained variance with final models explaining just over 50% of variances of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that cognitive biases explain mental health symptoms over and above that of neuroticism. Depressive symptomology was particularly related to self-referential memory bias, while anxiety was predicted by interpretive bias. The key clinical implication is that targeting specific biases based on diagnostic features may be of particular benefit in alleviating distress and promoting wellbeing.

406,Effects of maternal anxiety and depression on fetal neuro-development,"Background: Fetal development is affected by maternal mental health with research indicating that maternal anxiety and depression are co-morbid; nevertheless differential effects on the fetus have been found. This study examines, prenatally, effects of maternal stress, anxiety and depression on fetal eye-blink reactions to experimental sound and light stimulation. Methods: Two groups of singleton fetuses (mean 32-weeks gestation) were examined using 4D ultrasound: a control group ( N = 14, 7 female) with no stimulation and an experimental group ( N = 21, 13 female) exposed to experimental sound, light and cross-modal stimulation. For both groups ultrasound scans were performed and fetal eye-blink was assessed. Mothers completed the Hospital-Anxiety-and-Depression Scale and the Perceived-Stress Scale. Analysis was carried out using Poisson mixed effects modelling. Results: Fetal eye-blink rate during experimental stimulation was significantly and differentially associated with maternal mental health with a 20% increase of fetal eye-blink rate for each unit increase in anxiety score ( p = 0.02) and a decrease of 21% of eye blink rate for each unit of increase in depression score (p = 0.02). Sound stimulation but not light stimulation significantly affected blink-rate with fetuses habituating to the stimuli ( p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: Limitations are the relatively small number of fetuses and that a follow up after birth is essential to establish potential long-term effects. Conclusions: Of clinical importance is the finding that although fetuses are affected by maternal mental health in general here we demonstrate, using eye-blink-rate during stimulation as measure of neuro-development, that fetuses are differentially affected by maternal anxiety and depression with anxiety increasing and depression decreasing fetal reactivity significantly.

407,Differential engagement of cognitive control regions and subgenual cingulate based upon presence or absence of comorbid anxiety with depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid, sharing many similar symptoms, including impairments in cognitive control. Deficits in cognitive control could be a potential mechanism underlying impaired emotion regulation in mood disorders. Methods: Participants were 44 individuals with no history of mental illness (healthy controls, HC), 31 individuals in the remitted state of MDD (rMDD), and 18 individuals who met lifetime DSM-IV-TR criteria for rMDD and an anxiety disorder in remission (Comorbid). Participants completed a Parametric Go/No-Go (PGNG) test during fMRI. Event-related analyses modeled activity for cognitive control successes (Hits for Targets, Rejections for Lures) and failures (Commissions on Lures) on the PGNG task. Results: The rMDD group showed significantly reduced activity within the cognitive control network (CCN) during Commission errors, including the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The Comorbid group showed significantly reduced activity in several clusters within the CCN during correct Rejections, including the left IPL and right inferior frontal gyrus and greater subgenual cingulate. Notably, during correct Rejections, 60% of activation for the Comorbid group was within the Salience and Emotion Network (SEN), with 0% within the CCN. Limitations: The size of the Comorbid subgroup was modest, preventing subanalysis of the different AD subtypes. Conclusions: There is evidence that CCN activity declines in rMDD and that there may be compensatory SEN activity in individuals with Comorbid rMDD and anxiety. Our findings support the identification of comorbid anxiety as a meaningful subtype of MDD that may obscure group differences between rMDD and HCs.

408,Six-year healthcare trajectories of adults with anxiety and depressive disorders: Determinants of transition to specialised mental healthcare,"Background: To investigate potential facilitators and barriers for patients receiving specialised mental healthcare using a longitudinal design. Methods: Longitudinal data on 701 adult participants with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Demographic, clinical and treatment determinants at baseline were assessed with self-report questionnaires and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). Transition to specialised mental healthcare was assessed at one, two, four, and six-year follow-up with a self-report resource use questionnaire (TiC-P). Results: 28.3% of patients with a depressive and/or anxiety disorder transitioned from receiving no care or primary mental healthcare to specialised mental health services during six-year follow-up. The multivariate Cox regression model identified suicidal ideation, younger age, higher education level, openness to experience, pharmacological treatment, prior treatment in primary mental healthcare and perceived unmet need for help as determinants of transition, explaining 8–18% of variance. Limitations: This study focused on baseline determinants of future transition to specialised mental healthcare. Recovery and remittance of depression and anxiety in relation to transition were not studied. Conclusions: Not all key clinical guideline characteristics such as severity of symptoms and comorbidity were predictive of a transition to specialised mental healthcare, while non-clinical factors, such as age and perceived unmet need for help, did influence the process.

409,Changes in the levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety in Ansan city after the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster,"Background: In April 2014, a ferry carrying 476 passengers sunk on the coast of Korea, resulting in 304 deaths. Of these, 250 were local high school students, and the disaster significantly affected their community. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among Ansan city residents to understand their recovery process after the accident. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys (survey 1, after 4–6 months and survey 2, after 16–18 months of disaster) were used to compare prevalence among residents of Ansan city and adjacent cities. Symptoms were determined by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale. Results: A total of 1,773 and 1,748 participants were included in Survey 1 and Survey 2, respectively. Survey 1 showed a significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (19.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9–21.1) and anxiety (6.1%; 95% CI, 5.0–7.5) among Ansan city, compared to participants from adjacent cities (depressive symptoms: 14.3%; 95% CI, 12.7–16.1; anxiety: 3.6%; 95% CI, 2.9–4.5). Survey 2 showed a decreased prevalence of depression (15.8%; 95% CI, 14.0–17.9) and anxiety (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.0–6.4) among Ansan city residents. Depressive symptoms and anxiety adjusted odds ratio in survey 2 compared with survey 1 were 0.74 (95% CI 0.62–0.89) and 0.81 (0.60–1.08) among Ansan city, respectively. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design and lack of pre-disaster baseline data for comparison are limitations of this study. Conclusions: Psychological distress occurred at a population level, not only among survivors and their families, but also among Ansan city residents indirectly impacted by the traumatic event. Although populations indirectly affected by a disaster show a natural recovery process, timely population-based interventions may be helpful.

410,Estimated prevalence and associated risk factors of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among medical college students in a Chinese population,"Background: To investigate the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among medical college students in a Chinese population. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to collect demographic data on participants and their symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Data were collected through questionnaires filled out on a computer or through WeChat, a widely used social media app. Results: The prevalence of ADHD among 5693 college students was 3.5% (3.02∼3.98%). Individuals with ADHD showed higher scores on scales of anxiety and depression symptoms (both p &lt; 0.05) than the general population. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of ADHD grouped by smoking, drinking, suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal attempt, anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0.05). The odds ratio (OR) of ADHD was high for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, anxiety and depression, with ORs of 5.901, 5.46, 6.011, 8.037 and 7.88, respectively. The ORs of suicidal behaviors for ADHD were decreased after adjusting for covariates such as drinking, smoking and depression. Limitations: The sample was exclusively selected from three medical-related colleges, which might not be best representation of college students in China. Furthermore, majority of the participants were females. Conclusions: ADHD remains a common disorder among Chinese medical college students and is significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, anxiety and depression. It is important to increase awareness and promote effective interventions to this particular population.

411,Salivary cortisol reveals overt and hidden anxiety in survivors of childhood cancer attending clinic,"Background: Symptoms of anxiety may arise from fear of cancer recurrence and memories of traumatic experiences during treatment. This study aimed to identify changes in mental health and cortisol, a biological marker of stress, associated with oncology surveillance clinic attendance. Methods: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer (aged 12–30 years, N = 46) attending a survivorship clinic were recruited. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, an anxiety self-rating and open answer question, and salivary cortisol collections were completed two weeks before and one day before clinic, on clinic day and two weeks after. Results: Trait anxiety scores were consistent with the normal population. State anxiety scores two weeks after clinic were significantly lower than baseline ( p = 0.02). Cortisol diurnal slopes were flatter than baseline after clinic ( p = 0.02). Evening cortisol levels were significantly higher than baseline two weeks post clinic ( p = 0.02). Limitations: Combined results from biological and psychometric assessments can be difficult to interpret. Larger cohorts will further delineate cortisol pathway activity and distress in AYA cancer survivors. Conclusions: Psychometric evidence indicates that AYA survivors of childhood cancer perceive themselves to be less anxious after a survivorship clinic visit. Biological evidence, however, indicates a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which may be linked to clinic attendance. Weak correlations suggest that cortisol may not be a reliable indicator of self-perceived anxiety. This may be due to confounding lifestyle factors influencing the stress response or potential ‘coping strategies’ developed during past treatment experience which may, hypothetically, have masked self-perceived anxiety.

412,Gender-related patterns of psychiatric disorder clustering among bariatric surgery candidates: A latent class analysis,"Background: Psychiatric disorders tend to distribute unevenly in women and men with severe obesity. The current research aimed to identify homogeneous clusters of concurrent psychiatric disorders among patients seeking bariatric surgery, by gender. Methods: We recruited a consecutive sample of 393 candidates with obesity (311 women and 82 men) in a university-based bariatric center. Trained clinicians assessed psychiatric disorders through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Latent class analysis categorized pre-surgical patients into uniform clusters of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Results: For both genders, the 3-class psychopathological clustering was the best-fitting solution. Among women, the latent classes were: (1) “oligosymptomatic”, wherein 42% of patients showed low probability of psychiatric disorders; (2) “bipolar with comorbidities”, in 33%; and (3) “anxiety/depression”, in 25%. Among men, (1) “bipolar with comorbidities” was found in 47% of patients; (2) “oligosymptomatic”, in 40%; and (3) “anxiety/depression”, in 13%. For both genders, the probability of presenting eating disorders was higher in both “bipolar” and “anxiety/depression” classes. Substance use disorders was prominent among “bipolar” men. In comparison with “oligosymptomatic” class, the likelihood of higher BMI was observed among “bipolar” men and poorer work attainment among men with “anxiety/depression”. Limitation: Participants was cross-sectionally drawn from a single bariatric center. Conclusions: Pre-surgical men and women with severe obesity were distributed in three comorbidity profiles and revealed analogous psychopathological patterns. The class of “bipolar disorders” most likely presented comorbidity with eating and substance use disorder. This natural clustering of psychiatric disorders among bariatric patients suggests gender-related therapeutic approaches and surgical outcomes.

413,The adolescent grief inventory: Development of a novel grief measurement,"Background: To develop an empirically derived, reliable and valid measure of grief in adolescents, aged 12–18 years old. Methods: An online survey comprising 59 items derived from a qualitative study of 39 bereaved adolescents, the Hogan Inventory of Bereavement Children and Adolescents (HIB), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and a series of death- and mental health-related questions, targeted adolescents bereaved when aged 12–18 years, with 176 adolescents (80.6% girls) completing the survey. Results: Factor Analysis of the 59-items resulted in a final solution, the Adolescent Grief Inventory (AGI) comprised of 40 items and 6 factors: Sadness, Self-blame, Anxiety and Self-harm, Shock, Anger and Betrayal, and Sense of Peace, with indices of good fit (RMSEA = 0.057, CFI = 0.952, TLI = 0.948). There was strong evidence of convergent (HIB) and divergent (MSPSS) validity. Adolescents bereaved by suicide scored higher on Self-blame, Anger and Betrayal while those with a history of suicidal behaviour or having a mental health diagnosis scored higher overall than those who had not. Limitations: Study limitations include the self-selected, mostly female, sample, a high proportion of participants with a mental health and self-harm history, and reliance on self-reported data. Conclusions: The AGI is a novel, comprehensive and valid measure of grief in adolescents. It can be used broadly, including with bereaved adolescents at-risk of mental health ramifications.

415,Anxiety in Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced structural covariance of the striatum,"Background: Anxiety is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has great negative impact on quality of life. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have contributed to our understanding of the symptomatology of PD but still little is known about the pathophysiology of PD-related anxiety. Methods: We used seed-based structural covariance analysis to study the anatomical network correlates of anxiety in PD. Structural covariance analysis is based on the statistical correlation between regional brain volumes measured on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We investigated the association between anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and seed-to-whole-brain structural covariance networks in 115 patients with idiopathic PD using five bilateral seeds: basolateral amygdala, centromedial-superficial amygdala, dorsal caudate nucleus, dorsal-caudal putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Results: Severity of anxiety correlated negatively with structural covariance between the left striatal sub-regions and the contralateral caudate nucleus. Moreover, severity of anxiety was associated with reduced structural covariance between the right dorsal caudate nucleus and ipsilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and between the left nucleus accumbens and ipsilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Structural covariance of the amygdalar seeds did not correlate with anxiety. Conclusions: We interpret these findings as a reduced interhemispheric cooperation between the left and right striatum and reduced prefrontal-striatal connectivity, possibly related to impaired ‘top-down’ regulation of emotions. These findings shed more light on the pathophysiology of PD-related anxiety Limitations: This study did not include PD patients with an anxiety disorder.

416,Screening for childhood anxiety: A meta-analysis of the screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders,"Background: The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) is a commonly used instrument that evaluates anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents. Methods: This meta-analysis examined the psychometric properties of the SCARED instrument, including total instrument and subscale internal reliabilities for the parent and child versions, test-retest reliabilities, and the extent to which responses from the parent version correspond with responses from the child version. Databases reviewed included ERIC, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and Google Scholar Results: Responses to the SCARED instrument for children and parents using a mixture of the 38-, 41-, 66-, 69-, and 71-item versions of the SCARED were analyzed for 65 studies conducted between 1997 and 2017. The results from the random-effects models suggested homogeneity of variance for all the effects examined. The weighted averages of the psychometric properties indicated the parent and child versions of the SCARED have exhibited excellent internal consistencies on the total score, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and animal phobia subscales. Furthermore, the SCARED demonstrated moderate to large test-retest reliabilities and moderate to large parent-child agreement rates. The school avoidance, obsessive-compulsive disorder, blood phobia, and situational phobia subscales did not demonstrate reliabilities considered appropriate for a screening instrument. Limitations: Publications that could not be translated to English or could not be retrieved due to not being published or archived were not included in the analysis. Conclusions: Overall the child and parent versions of the SCARED have robust psychometric properties and perform consistently well in community and clinical settings across various countries. The SCARED is clinically relevant as mental health providers and researchers can use it during diagnostic procedures and to monitor intervention effectiveness.

417,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder: A systematic review,"Background: Persisting high levels of relapse, morbidity and mortality in bipolar disorder (BD) in spite of first-line, evidence-based psychopharmacology has spurred development and research on adjunctive psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychotherapy that has shown benefit in related and comorbid conditions such as major depressive, anxiety, and substance disorders. Furthermore, neurocognitive studies of MBCT suggest that it may have effects on some of the theorized pathophysiological processes in BD. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PsycINFO and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting clinical and/or neurocognitive findings for MBCT for BD. Results: This search revealed 13 articles. There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control. Limitations: As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated. Conclusions: MBCT for BD holds promise, but more high-quality studies are needed in order to ascertain its clinical efficacy. Recommendations to address the limitations of the current research are made.

418,Experimentally investigating the joint effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior on depression and anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: To experimentally examine whether increasing sedentary behavior, among a young adult active population, for one week is still associated with increased depression and anxiety symptomology even when allowing for a moderate engagement in physical activity (PA). Methods: Participants were confirmed as active via self-report and accelerometry during baseline and randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups. The No Exercise Group ( n = 19) was instructed to reduce steps to less than 5000/day and were not allowed to exercise for one-week; the Reduced MVPA (moderate-to-vigorous PA) Group ( n = 18) was instructed to reduce steps to less than 5000/day but exercised for 50% of their previously reported vigorous PA for one-week; and the Control Group ( n = 20) maintained normal activity for one-week. PA, depression, and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and after one week of resumed normal activity for the intervention groups. Results: The experiment was successful in altering physical activity levels among the intervention groups and maintaining activity habits in the control group (F Interaction = 16.053, P &lt; 0.001, η² p = 0.391). Anxiety and depression symptomology remained constant across the two time periods in the control group. For both intervention groups (No Exercise Group and Reduced MVPA Group), depression statistically significantly increased during the inactive week and then resumed back to baseline levels after a week of resumed activity. However, there were no differential trends in anxiety (F Interaction = 0.073, P = 0.897, η² p = 0.002) or depression (F Interaction = 0.276, P = 0.760, η² p = 0.008) among these two intervention groups. Conclusion: We provide experimental evidence that reducing habitual physical activity causes an increase in depression symptomology among young active adults. We did not, however, observe a joint effect of sedentary behavior and exercise on changes in anxiety and depression. At this point, it is still uncertain as to whether reduced MVPA or increased sedentary behavior were driving the observed changes in psychological function. Future research may help determine if these negative effects are from increased sedentary behavior or a reduction in MVPA.

419,Efficacy of narrative reformulation during cognitive analytic therapy for depression: Randomized dismantling trial,"Background: Narrative reformulation (NR) is a component of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) that is assumed to increase client engagement and improve clinical outcomes. This study set out to test these claims. Methods: A single-blind randomized and controlled dismantling trial investigated treatment outcomes for moderate to severely depressed patients receiving CAT in Primary Care. Ninety-five participants were randomized to either full-CAT ( n = 52) or CAT minus narrative reformulation (CAT-NR, n = 43). Treatment duration in both arms was 8-sessions and was matched apart from the omission of the NR in the CAT-NR arm. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with secondary outcome measures of anxiety, functioning, helpfulness and the therapeutic alliance. Outcomes were assessed at screening, every treatment session and at 8-weeks follow-up. Results: Growth curve modelling found that NR did not enhance the efficacy of CAT for depression. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of attendance, adverse events, anxiety, functioning, helpfulness or therapeutic alliance. There were large within-group effect sizes ( d + &gt; 1.5), as CAT with or without NR produced significant reductions in depression ( p &lt; .01). Limitations: The primary outcome were assessed via self-report and the follow-up period was brief. Conclusions: These results suggest that NR may be redundant when treating depression with CAT. Whilst a brief 8-session version of the CAT model appears suitable for treating depression in Primary Care, further research regarding the need for NR is indicated.

420,&lt;i&gt;CHRNA7&lt;/i&gt; copy number gains are enriched in adolescents with major depressive and anxiety disorders,"Objective: Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the α7 nAChR encoded by the gene CHRNA7 , have been implicated in behavior regulation in animal models. In humans, copy number variants (CNVs) of CHRNA7 are found in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence of CHRNA7 CNVs among adolescents and young adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. Methods: Twelve to 21 year-old participants with MDD and/or anxiety disorders (34% males, mean ± std age: 18.9 ± 1.8 years) were assessed for CHRNA7 copy number state using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR). Demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data, including the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) were collected and compared across individuals with and without a CHRNA7 CNV. Results: Of 205 individuals, five (2.4%) were found to carry a CHRNA7 gain, significantly higher than the general population. No CHRNA7 deletions were identified. Clinically, the individuals carrying CHRNA7 duplications did not differ significantly from copy neutral individuals with MDD and/or anxiety disorders. Conclusions: CHRNA7 gains are relatively prevalent among young individuals with MDD and anxiety disorders (odds ratio = 4.032) without apparent distinguishing clinical features. Future studies should examine the therapeutic potential of α7 nAChR targeting drugs to ameliorate depressive and anxiety disorders.

421,The association between maternal-fetal bonding and prenatal anxiety: An explanatory analysis and systematic review,"Background: The prenatal period can be associated with an increase in distress and anxiety. Research indicates that impaired mental well-being influences the development of prenatal maternal-fetal bonding, which manifests in representations, emotions and behaviors. However, the impact of prenatal anxieties on maternal-fetal bonding is still not fully understood, partly due to heterogeneity in the conceptualization and the measurement of both constructs. The aims of this review were to identify studies assessing the relation between both constructs and to investigate direction and size of effects for different types of prenatal anxiety and conceptualizations of maternal-fetal bonding. Methods: A systematic search was carried out on January 7, 2017, and updated on October 23, 2017, based on four electronic databases and a targeted reference search. Of the 3845 identified publications, K = 31 studies fit the eligibility criteria. Results: While components of maternal-fetal bonding centering around pregnancy or maternal role were not affected, the quality of perceived emotional proximity to the child, as assessed by the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale, was impaired by anxieties across studies. Associations were overall negative and of low to moderate size. Limitations: Studies focusing on high-risk subpopulations were excluded. Included studies mostly assessed samples from Western societies, which limits the generalizability of results to non-Western cultures. Conclusion: The quality of perceived emotional proximity to the fetus was consistently impaired by anxiety. Nevertheless, varying effect sizes indicate a more complex association that is influenced by underlying confounders. Multivariate analyses are needed to improve the understanding of the interacting factors that influence maternal-fetal bonding.

422,Orbitofrontal connectivity is associated with depression and anxiety in marijuana-using adolescents,"Background: Prevalence of marijuana (MJ) use among adolescents has been on the rise. MJ use has been reported to impact several brain regions, including frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC is involved in emotion regulation and processing and has been associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, we hypothesized that adolescent MJ users would show disruptions in OFC connectivity compared with healthy adolescents (HC) which would be associated with symptoms of mood and anxiety. Methods: 43 MJ-using and 31 HC adolescents completed clinical measures including the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was also acquired for all participants. Results: In MJ users, increased depressive symptoms were associated with increased connectivity between the left OFC and left parietal regions. In contrast, lower ratings of anxiety were associated with increased connectivity between right and left OFC and right occipital and temporal regions. These findings indicate significant differences in OFC connectivity in MJ-using adolescents, which correlated with mood/anxiety. Limitations: Future studies with an increased number of female participants is required to address potential sex differences in connectivity patterns related to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: This study highlights the association between OFC connectivity, MJ use, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. These findings provide further insight into understanding the neural correlates that modulate the relationship between comorbid MJ use and mood disorders and could potentially help us better develop preventive and treatment measures.

423,The association of affective disorders and facial scarring: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Facial scarring can have a dramatic effect on a patient's psychological health and wellbeing and present unique management challenges. This patient population remains poorly characterised in the contemporary literature. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with affective disorders in adult patients with facial scars. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using a protocol registered with PROSPERO and in line with the PRISMA statement. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCHInfo and The Cochrane Library. Results: Twenty one studies were included, with a total of 2,394 participants. Using a random effects model, the weighted pooled prevalence of anxiety was 26.1% (95% CI 17.9%-36.3%) and the weighted pooled prevalence of depression was 21.4% (95% CI 15.4%-29.0%). Studies identified female gender, past psychiatric history and violent causation as factors associated with anxiety and depression. Limitations: Included studies were limited to those published in peer reviewed journals. Longitudinal trends in both anxiety and depression were limited by a short duration of follow up. Conclusions: There is a high and persistent burden of affective disorders in patients with facial scars. Additional research is required to further characterise this population and develop effective management strategies.

424,The role of emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between attachment representations and depressive and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period,"Background: Insecure attachment representations have been established as a vulnerability factor for postpartum depressive symptoms. However, there is a lack of studies on the effects of attachment (in)security on postpartum anxiety symptoms, and on the mechanisms through which attachment representations may affect women's postpartum adjustment, namely, emotion regulation difficulties. Methods: The sample included 450 women in the postpartum period (up to 12 months postpartum), who were recruited both online (advertisements on social media) and in person (study was presented by the researchers during the women's postpartum hospitalization). Results: Approximately one third of the women with clinically significant symptoms (33.3%) presented comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression, and these women presented more insecure attachment representations and more emotion regulation difficulties ( p &lt; .001) than did women without comorbid symptoms ( p &lt; .001). The relationship between more insecure attachment representations and depressive and anxiety symptoms occurred both directly and indirectly through emotional regulation difficulties. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study, the use of self-report questionnaires that do not allow the establishment of clinical diagnosis and the self-selected bias in recruitment were study limitations. Conclusions: The results underline the need for attention to anxiety symptomatology, which is a condition that co-occurs frequently in this period. Interventions that focus on promoting adaptive strategies of emotional regulation are relevant rather than more intensive interventions to change attachment representations.

425,Involvement of prolactin in newborn infant irritability following maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms,"Background: Newborn irritability could be an unique and special status and/or adverse neurobehavioral outcomes which was independent of serious disease. To determine whether maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms was associated with newborn irritability, and whether the alteration of serum prolactin in newborns were involved in newborn irritability. Methods: 205 pregnant women were recruited: normal group (n = 100), and anxiety group (n = 105), which was randomly divided to Newborn Behavioral Observations (NBO) + anxiety group( n = 65) and control + anxiety group( n = 40). Newborn Irritability was assessed by Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale(NBAS). Serum prolactin, cortisol and 5-HT in mothers and infants were measured. Results: 1. The scores of irritability items in the newborns of anxiety group were higher than that of the normal group ( p &lt; 0.05). 2. Lower serum PRL, 5-HT and higher serum cortisol were found in the newborns of anxiety group compared with that of the control group both postpartum 2d and 15 ( p &lt; 0.05). 3. The level of serum PRL in newborn infants were significantly and negatively correlated to the scores of irritability items ( p &lt; 0.05). 4. After 7 rounds of NBO interventions, the anxiety scores of mothers and the scores of irritability items of newborns in the NBO intervention group were all lower than those of the control group ( p &lt; 0.05) . Limitations: In future experiments, we should explore the effect of PRL in the breast milk on newborn infant serum PRL. Conclusions: Prolactin could be a potential mediator in newborn irritability following maternal perinatal anxiety symptoms.

426,Social anxiety questionnaire (SAQ): Development and preliminary validation,"Background: The Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ) was designed to assess five dimensions of social anxiety as posited by the Clark and Wells' (1995; Clark, 2001) cognitive model. Methods: The development of the SAQ involved generation of an item pool, followed by a verification of content validity and the theorized factor structure (Study 1). The final version of the SAQ was then assessed for reliability, temporal stability (test re-test reliability), and construct, criterion-related, and contrasted-group validity (Study 2, 3, and 4). Results: Following a systematic process, the results provide support for the SAQ as reliable, and both theoretically and empirically valid measure. A five-factor structure of the SAQ verified and replicated through confirmatory factor analyses reflect five dimensions of social anxiety: negative self-processing; self-focused attention and self-monitoring; safety behaviours; somatic and cognitive symptoms; and anticipatory and post-event rumination. Limitations: Results suggest that the SAQ possesses good psychometric properties, while recognizing that additional validation is a required future research direction. It is important to replicate these findings in diverse populations, including a large clinical sample. Conclusions: The SAQ is a promising measure that supports social anxiety as a multidimensional construct, and the foundational role of self-focused cognitive processes in generation and maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. The findings make a significant contribution to the literature, moreover, the SAQ is a first instrument that offers to assess all, proposed by the Clark–Wells model, specific cognitive-affective, physiological, attitudinal, and attention processes related to social anxiety.

427,Adverse drug events related to mood and emotion in paediatric patients treated for ADHD: A meta-analysis,"Background: ADHD is frequently comorbid with anxiety and mood disorders, which may increase the severity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. Emotional symptoms (anxiety, irritability, mood lability) also affect patients without comorbidity or emerge as adverse drug events. The influence of ADHD drugs on emotional symptoms demands investigation to improve therapies. Methods: Systematic review of trials reporting adverse events in patients pharmacologically treated for ADHD. Meta-analysis of the occurrence of irritability, anxiety, apathy, reduced talk, sadness, crying, emotional lability, biting nails, staring, perseveration, euphoria. Meta-regression analysis. Results: Forty-five trials were meta-analysed. The most frequently reported outcomes were irritability, anxiety, sadness, and apathy. Methylphenidates, especially immediate-release formulations, were most studied; amphetamines were half as studied and were predominantly mixed amphetamine salts. Reports on atomoxetine were scant. Meta-analysis showed that methylphenidates reduced the risk of irritability, anxiety, euphoria, whereas they worsened the risk of apathy and reduced talk; amphetamines worsened the risk of emotional lability. Factors influencing risks were study year and design, patients’ sex and age, drug dose and release formulation. Limitations: Possible discrepancy between adverse events as indicated in clinical trials and as summarised herein. Confounding due to the aggregation of drugs into groups; uninvestigated sources of bias; incomplete lists of adverse events; lack of observations on self-injury. Conclusions: Methylphenidates appeared safer than amphetamines, although younger patients and females may incur higher risks, especially with high-dose, immediate-release methylphenidates. Only atomoxetine holds a black-box warning, but amphetamines and methylphenidates also did not show a safe profile regarding mood and emotional symptoms.

428,Comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms and the risk of type 2 diabetes: Findings from the Lifelines Cohort Study,"Background: Prior studies indicate that depression is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), though there is considerable heterogeneity in reported estimates. Identifying homogeneous subgroups of depression strongly associated with T2D may be beneficial. This study examined associations between depression and anxiety comorbidity with the risk of T2D. Methods: 78,025 participants from the Lifelines Cohort Study (age range = 30–75 years) without diabetes at baseline were included in this study. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline. Incident T2D was assessed by self-report or hemoglobin A1c levels during an approximately 3.8-year follow-up period. Risk of T2D was compared across four groups (no depressive or anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms alone, anxiety symptoms alone, comorbid depressive/anxiety symptoms) using mixed effects logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic characteristics. Results: 1,096 participants developed diabetes. Compared to those without depressive or anxiety symptoms ( n = 74,467), those with comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms ( n = 743) were more likely to develop T2D ( n = 28, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.22–3.68). Depressive symptoms alone ( n = 650) and anxiety symptoms alone ( n = 2,165) were not significantly associated with T2D ( n = 23 and n = 24, respectively, developed diabetes). Those with comorbid symptoms were also more likely to develop T2D compared to those with depressive symptoms alone (OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.25–6.54). Limitations: Depressive and anxiety symptom assessments were based on a screening tool. Hemoglobin A1c data were only available for a subset of participants. Conclusions: Depression with comorbid anxiety may be a subgroup of depression that is strongly associated with the risk of T2D.

429,Attentional bias modification alters intrinsic functional network of attentional control: A randomized controlled trial,"Introduction: Attentional bias modification (ABM) alleviates anxiety by moderating biased attentional processing toward threat; however, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. We examined how ABM changes functional connectivity (FC) and functional network measures, leading to anxiety reduction. Methods: Fifty-four healthy anxious individuals received either ABM or sham training for 1 month in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Anxious traits, attentional control, and attentional bias were assessed. Thirty-five participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and after training. Results: ABM significantly mitigated an anxious traits regarding physical stress vulnerability (η² = 0.12, p = 0.009). As compared to sham training, ABM significantly strengthened FC between the pulvinar and transverse temporal gyrus along the temporoparietal junction ( T = 3.90, FDR-corrected p = 0.010), whereas it decreased FC between the postCG and ventral fronto-parietal network (vFPN) regions such as the anterior insula and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (all T ≤ −3.19, FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.034). Although ABM diminished network measures of the postcentral gyrus (postCG) (all T ≤ −4.30, FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.006), only the pulvinar-related FC increase was specifically correlated with anxiety reduction ( r = − 0.46, p = 0.007). Limitations: Per-protocol analysis and reduced sample size in MRI analysis. Conclusions: ABM might augment the pulvinar's control over vFPN to maintain endogenous attention to a behavioral goal, while diminishing the information exchanges of the postCG with vFPN to inhibit the capture of exogenous attention by potential threats. The pulvinar might play a critical role in ABM anxiolytic efficacy.

430,Risk factors of new onset anxiety and anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors. Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

431,Affective styles in mood and anxiety disorders—Clinical validation of the “Affective Style Questionnaire” (ASQ),"Background: Emotion regulation plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders. Less is known about the association of affective styles and psychopathology. The 20-item “Affective Style Questionnaire” (ASQ) has been validated in nonclinical samples. The American and German validation studies resulted in a three-factor structure (concealing, adjusting, and tolerating). The present study aimed to investigate three aspects: (1) the validation of the ASQ within a clinical sample, (2) the examination of possible differences in affective styles between patients suffering from affective versus anxiety disorders, and (3) the association of affective styles and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Methods: Overall 917 patients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy at an outpatient clinic participated in this study, 550 participants were female. All data were collected before the beginning of treatment. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed the same three-factor structure found in the previous Western samples (CFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.06): Concealing (α = 0.81), adjusting (α = 0.71), and tolerating (α = 0.70). Significantly lower scores in the ASQ subscale adjusting were found in patients suffering from affective disorders than patients suffering from anxiety disorders. The results of the regression analyses showed that the ASQ adjusting and concealing behavior seem to play a more important role than the ERQ reappraisal and suppression for depression, anxiety, and stress among clinical populations. Limitations: A number of limitations must be taken into consideration while evaluating the present study. First and foremost, the clinical data were based on primary diagnoses. We did not ascertain comorbid diagnoses. This distinction may be important, since affective and anxiety disorders are often linked to each other. In addition, we only used data collected before the beginning of psychotherapeutic treatment and were therefore not able to analyze changes in affective styles during and after intervention. Furthermore, all data were based on self-reported information of patients. We did not implement either a therapeutic rating of affective styles or physiological measures, for instance arousal, which could have shown whether the used strategies successfully reduce negative emotions. Future research should address this question. Another limitation is the fact that we concentrated on the main categories of mental disorders and, therefore, did not subdivide patients with affective and anxiety disorders in terms of their concrete diagnoses. This is of special importance, because there might also be differences in affective styles within the main categories.

432,Looking forward to the future: Impoverished vividness for positive prospective events characterises low mood in adolescence,"Background: Enhancing positive future imagery offers promise for treatment innovation in adult depression but has been neglected in adolescence. While negative life events are linked with depression-onset in adolescence, mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. We investigate whether difficulties in generating vivid positive future imagery characterise depression, compared to anxiety, and examine potential moderation of the relationship between negative life events and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Method: Three hundred and seventy-five young people (11–16 years) completed the Prospective Imagery Task, and self-reported on symptoms of anxiety and depression. They were also asked to describe a past negative life event they had been thinking about or imagining over the last seven days, which was subsequently coded by a clinician over whether it was no, low, moderate or high impact. Results: Symptoms of depression were associated with less vivid positive imagery and more vivid negative imagery whether past or future, whilst symptoms of anxiety were associated with increased vividness for past negative events only. The relationship between life event severity and depression was increased for those with poorer vividness for positive future events. Limitations: These data were collected at a single time-point only, limiting conclusions on temporal relationships. All measures were also self-reported, increasing shared method variance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the relationship between negative life events and prospective positive imagery are specific to depressive symptoms in adolescence and provide foundations for novel approaches to strengthen psychological interventions.

433,Cognitive impairment as measured by the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it): The association with self-reported anxiety in Major Depressive Disorder,"Background and objectives: This study evaluated the association between self-reported anxiety and objective/subjective measures of cognitive performance in adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Acutely depressed subjects with recurrent MDD ( n = 100) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 100) between the ages of 18 and 65 completed the cross-sectional validation study of the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02508493). Objective cognitive performance was assessed using the THINC-it, and subjective cognitive impairment with the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression–5-item. Subjects also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item (GAD-7) questionnaire. Results: Subjects with MDD reported significantly more anxiety symptoms, as assessed by the GAD-7, compared to HC ( p &lt; 0.001). Linear regression analysis determined that anxiety symptoms significantly accounted for 70.4% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Moreover, subjects’ ratings of the difficulties caused by their anxiety were reported as significantly more severe among subjects with MDD when compared to HC ( p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, greater self-reported difficulties with anxiety significantly predicted 57.8% of the variability in subjective cognitive impairment, adjusting for depression severity. Neither anxiety symptoms nor impairment due to anxiety symptoms predicted objective cognitive performance. Limitations: Subjects were not prospectively verified to have a clinical diagnosis of GAD. Rather, this study examined the relationships between symptoms of generalized anxiety, assessed using a brief screening tool, and subjective and objective cognitive function. Conclusions: Results from the current study indicate that adults with MDD and high levels of self-reported anxiety are significantly more likely to report experiencing subjective cognitive dysfunction.

434,Intrinsic functional neurocircuitry associated with treatment response to transdiagnostic CBT in bipolar disorder with anxiety,"Background: Anxiety in bipolar disorder (BD) exacerbates emotion dysregulation and reduces treatment response. We recently conducted a pilot trial of transdiagnostic CBT to target anxiety and emotion dysregulation in BD adjunctive to pharmacotherapy. Reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by baseline levels of neuroticism and perceived affective control, as well as changes over time in emotion regulation skills. The present study investigates mechanism of treatment response by examining the relationship between baseline emotion regulation-related neural circuitry and trial outcomes. Methods: Nineteen patients completed baseline resting state fMRI scans prior to treatment randomization. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula (AI) and regions in the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and executive control network (ECN) were examined as predictors of baseline and treatment-related changes in emotion regulation. Results: Greater improvements in emotion regulation were predicted by weaker right dorsal AI—right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; SN) and stronger bilateral dorsal AI—bilateral amygdala functional connectivity. Baseline neuroticism was negatively correlated with right dorsal AI- inferior parietal lobule (ECN) functional connectivity, and baseline deficits in perceived affective control were positively associated with ventral AI—bilateral dACC (SN) connectivity. Limitations: Small sample limits interpretability of treatment-specific effects. Conclusion: Baseline functional connectivity of emotion-regulation related neural circuitry significantly predicted change in emotion regulation-related dimensions associated with anxiety and depression symptom reduction. Future studies are needed to determine if employing methods such as neuromodulation to rehabilitate relevant neural circuitry may improve ultimate treatment outcomes of transdiagnostic CBT for BD and anxiety.

435,Different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults in Ireland: A prospective community-based study,"Background: The associations of different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in older age remain unclear. Methods: Data on 6095 adults aged ≥ 50 years old from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) was analyzed. Participants completed the CAGE instrument to screen for problematic alcohol use at baseline between October 2009 and February 2011. Outcomes were incident (assessed by the CES-D scale) and anxiety (assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale) symptoms after a two-year follow-up as well as persistence of probable depression and anxiety among those with a positive screen for those disorders at baseline. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders through multivariable models. Results: In the overall sample, problem drinking did not predict incident and persistent depression and anxiety in this sample. Among females, problem drinking increased the risk for incident depression (OR = 2.11; 95%CI = 1.12–4.00) and anxiety (OR = 2.22; 95%CI = 1.01–4.86). In addition, problem drinking increased the risk of persistent depressive symptoms (OR = 2.43; 95%CI = 1.05–5.06) among females. Conclusion: Problem drinking may increase the risk of incident probable depression and anxiety among older females. Furthermore, problem drinking led to a higher likelihood of persistent depressive symptoms in older female participants. Interventions targeting problem drinking among older females may prevent the onset and persistence of depression in this population, while also decreasing the incidence of anxiety symptoms.

436,Couples’ relationship affects mothers’ and fathers’ anxiety and depression trajectories over the transition to parenthood,"Background: The association between the couple relationship and the mothers’ and fathers’ psychological adjustment to the transition to parenthood has been examined in the literature. However, the direction of effects between these variables has not been extensively explored. This study aimed to assess the direction of effects between mothers’ and fathers’ positive and negative interactions and anxiety and depression symptoms trajectories over the transition to parenthood. Methods: A sample of 129 couples ( N = 258) completed self-report measures of positive and negative interactions, anxiety and depression symptoms at each trimester of pregnancy, at childbirth, and at 3- and 30-months postpartum. Dyadic growth curve models were performed using multilevel modeling. Results: Whereas anxiety and depression showed no moderation effect on positive and negative interactions over time, negative interaction moderated depression from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Mothers and fathers with high negative interaction scores experienced a steeper increase in depression from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Additionally, gender moderated the effect of positive interaction on anxiety from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Fathers with low positive interaction scores experienced an increase in anxiety, whereas fathers with high positive interaction scores and mothers with high or low positive interaction scores did not experience changes in anxiety from 3- to 30-months postpartum. Limitations: Despite the longitudinal aspect of the models, a possible causal relationship need to be taken with caution. Conclusions: Our results suggest that mothers’ and fathers’ positive and negative interactions affect their anxiety and depression symptoms trajectories: negative interaction raises mothers’ and fathers’ depression symptoms and positive interaction prevents the increase of fathers’ anxiety symptoms over the postpartum period.

437,Depression and anxiety symptoms are associated with prooxidant-antioxidant balance: A population-based study,"Background: Depression and anxiety are significantly associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, oxidative stress resulting from a disturbance in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance is linked to inflammation-related conditions. Therefore, depression/anxiety symptoms may also be associated with oxidative stress. Objective: To examine the association between depression/anxiety symptoms and serum prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) in adults who participated in a large population-based, cross-sectional study. Methods: Serum PAB values were measured in 7516 participants (62% females and 38% males) aged 35–65 years, enrolled in a population-based cohort study. beck depression and anxiety inventories were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the effect of confounders on the status of serum PAB change. Results: Among men, serum PAB values were increased incrementally from 1.55 ± 0.47 to 1.59 ± 0.47, 1.69 ± 0.38, and 1.68 ± 0.38 in the no or minimal, mild, moderate and severe depression groups, respectively ( P trend &lt; 0.001). Serum PAB values also increased significantly across these four corresponding groups among women [1.70 ± 0.45, 1.73 ± 0.44, 1.75 ± 0.44, and 1.76 ± 0.40, ( P trend = 0.005)]. About anxiety, serum PAB values increased significantly across the four groups in men ( P trend = 0.02) but not in women ( P trend = 0.2). The adjusted odds ratios for serum PAB values among men with severe depression and anxiety symptoms were 1.75 and 1.27, respectively. Moreover, the adjusted odds ratios for serum PAB values among women with severe depression and anxiety symptoms were 1.40 and 1.17, respectively. Conclusion: Symptoms of depression and anxiety appear to be associated with higher degrees of oxidative stress, expressed by higher serum PAB values.

438,Heart rate variability as candidate endophenotype of social anxiety: A two-generation family study,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the extreme fear and avoidance of one or more social situations. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether heart rate variability (HRV) during resting state and a social performance task (SPT) is a candidate endophenotype of SAD. Methods: In this two-generation family study, patients with SAD with their partner and children, and their siblings with partner and children took part in a SPT (total n = 121, 9 families, 3–30 persons per family, age range: 8–61 years, 17 patients with SAD). In this task, participants had to watch and evaluate the speech of a female peer, and had to give a similar speech. HRV was measured during two resting state phases, and during anticipation, speech and recovery phases of the SPT. We tested two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation with SAD within families and heritability. Results: HRV did not co-segregate with SAD within families. Root mean square of successive differences during the first resting phase and recovery, and high frequency power during all phases of the task were heritable. Limitations: It should be noted that few participants were diagnosed with SAD. Results during the speech should be interpreted with caution, because the duration was short and there was a lot of movement. Conclusions: HRV during resting state and the SPT is a possible endophenotype, but not of SAD. As other studies have shown that HRV is related to different internalizing disorders, HRV might reflect a transdiagnostic genetic vulnerability for internalizing disorders. Future research should investigate which factors influence the development of psychopathology in persons with decreased HRV.

439,The relationship between schizotypal traits and hoarding symptoms: An examination of symptom specificity and the role of perceived cognitive failures,"Background: Hoarding disorder presents significant individual and interpersonal consequences. Because hoarding has only recently been added to the DSM, relatively little is known about associated comorbidity patterns. Several researchers have postulated a relationship between hoarding and schizotypy. To date, however, no investigations have considered which specific types of schizotypal traits relate to hoarding symptoms. Methods: We examined the association between hoarding and schizotypal symptoms using multivariate analyses in two samples—a sample of 120 young adults and a community sample of 291 individuals recruited from Mechanical Turk's online crowdsourcing system. Results: Individuals who fell within the clinical range on the Saving Inventory Revised endorsed significantly greater levels of schizotypal symptoms compared to those with normative saving behaviors. Odd speech, magical thinking, and social anxiety were the most consistent schizotypal correlates of hoarding symptoms. Perceived cognitive dysfunction mediated the effects between odd speech and social anxiety and hoarding symptoms, suggesting that shared abnormalities in cognitive functioning may help explain the relationship between hoarding and schizotypy. Limitations: This study examined the spectrum of schizotypy and hoarding symptoms via self-report in two nonclinical populations. Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of assessing schizotypal traits in patients with hoarding, and suggest future avenues of research to better understand the underlying causes explaining the overlap, as well as potential treatment implications.

440,Strong correlation between the self-model/other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system assessing basic attachment dimensions,"The article presents a study on the Strong Correlation Between the Self-Model/Other-Model System and the Anxiety/Avoidance System Assessing Basic Attachment Dimensions . The authors decided to test if the two systems correlated to each other. The subjects were 400 Japanese volunteers free from mental and physical disorders. Their mental and physical conditions were checked by the methods described previously. Two hundred forty-five were males and 155 were females. The mean ± SD of age was 26.7 ± 7.7 years. The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yamagata University School of Medicine, and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Statistical analyses were conducted by linear regression analysis using SPSS Version 22. A P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Table 1 shows the correlation between the self-model/ other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system. There were strong negative correlations between self-model scores and anxiety scores and between other-model scores and avoidance scores. The effect sizes of these correlations were large, while those of other correlations were all small. The results suggest that the self-model/other-model system and the anxiety/avoidance system strongly correlate to each other, and that they can be used interchangeably in attachment research.

441,Comparison of comorbid depression between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: A meta-analysis of comparative studies,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 253 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2019-36780-059). In the original article, there were errors in the affiliation of the seventh author and in the first affiliation. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: The prevalence of comorbid depression is high in chronic gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For these two disorders in particular, the findings have not been consistent. This meta-analysis systematically compares the rates and severity of comorbid depression between IBS and IBD patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure from their inception date to September 12, 2017 for comparative studies on IBS and IBD patients. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) of comorbid depression were calculated using random effect models. Data on comorbid anxiety in the included studies were also extracted and analyzed. Results: Altogether, 22 studies with 1,244 IBS and 1,048 IBD patients were included. While there was no significant group difference in the prevalence of depression (10 studies, OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.87–1.60, P = 0.29), the IBS group had more severe depression (pooled SMD = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.04–0.33, P = 0.01) and anxiety than the IBD group (pooled SMD = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.14–0.49, P = 0.0006). Sixteen (72.7%) studies were assessed as ‘high quality’ using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of comorbid depression was similar between groups, IBS patients had more severe comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to IBD patients. Appropriate assessment and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these patient groups should be implemented.

442,Threatened miscarriage and depressive and anxiety symptoms among women and partners in early pregnancy,"Background: Antenatal depression has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and threatened miscarriage is often seen clinically to impact adversely on maternal wellbeing, notwithstanding the limited research evidence. Our study aims to examine the link between threatened miscarriage and antenatal depression and anxiety in an Asian obstetric population. Methods: We recruited 121 women and 68 partners facing threatened miscarriage, and 241 women and 180 partners experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies from a tertiary maternity hospital in Singapore. All participants completed a Patient Information Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The proportion of women with major depressive and anxiety symptomatology was significantly higher among women facing threatened miscarriage compared to those with stable pregnancies (depressive: 33.1% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.008; anxiety: 48.8% vs. 23.7%, p &lt; 0.0001). Amongst their partners, there was a non-significant trend towards a similar finding (depressive: 10.3% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.439; anxiety: 23.5% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.478). Threatened miscarriage remained significantly associated with major depressive symptomatology after adjusting for potential confounders among women (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.55, 4.71; p &lt; 0.0001) but not among their partners (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.56, 3.87; p = 0.430). Limitations: This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size for male partners. Conclusion: Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptomatology affects one in four women in their first trimester, with even higher prevalence among women facing threatened miscarriage. Targeted depression and anxiety screening that includes women facing threatened miscarriages may facilitate early and efficient detection and management of mental health problems among pregnant women.

443,"A genetically informative analysis of the association between dyadic adjustment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms","Background: Prior research has found a reliable and robust association between poor dyadic (e.g., marital) adjustment and depression and anxiety. However, it is possible that this association may be due, at least in part, to confounding variables (i.e., variables that are causally associated both with marital adjustment and psychopathology and could account for their covariation). The present study was conducted using a genetically informative sample of twins to examine the association between dyadic adjustment and symptoms of depression and anxiety, accounting for unmeasured genetic and shared environmental confounds. Methods: A Swedish sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins (218 female twin pairs and 321 male twin pairs) and their spouse or long-term partner completed self-report measures of dyadic adjustment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Results suggest that dyadic adjustment was significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in twins, and nonshared environmental influences largely accounted for this association. Furthermore, results obtained from partners’ reports of dyadic adjustment were largely consistent with those obtained from twins’ reports, suggesting that results were not a function of shared method variance. Limitations: Longitudinal research in genetically informative samples would provide a stronger test of the causal association between dyadic adjustment and psychopathology. Conclusions: The pattern of findings suggest that common nonshared environmental influences, such as partners’ characteristics, may lead to poorer dyadic adjustment and depression and anxiety. Therefore, couple-based interventions that improve dyadic adjustment may be effective in preventing and treating psychopathology in relationship partners.

444,"Are individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder successful in regulating their emotions? A mixed-method investigation using self-report, subjective, and event-related potentials measures","Background: Models of social anxiety emphasize the role of emotion dysregulation, but the nature of these impairments needs clarification. Methods: We utilized a mixed-method approach to examine impairments in cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in social anxiety disorder. Forty nine treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and 35 healthy controls completed self-reports and a lab-based task of suppression and reappraisal. Unpleasantness ratings and event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected while participants regulated their emotions in response to shame-arousing pictures. ERP analyses focused on the late positive potential, a measure of increased attention to emotional stimuli that is reduced during emotion regulation. Results: Participants with social anxiety reported less frequent and effective use of reappraisal and more frequent and effective use of suppression than controls. Counter to most models and our hypotheses, participants with social anxiety were more successful than controls in lab-based reappraisal as measured by unpleasantness ratings, but no differences emerged for ERPs. No differences were found in measures of lab-based suppression. Limitations: Use of standardized, and not participant-generated, materials in the lab-based task of emotion regulation may limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Subjective appraisals of self-efficacy and frequency suggest strong impairments in emotion-regulation in social anxiety that are not revealed in the laboratory. Models and treatment protocols should specify the exact nature of emotion dyregulation in social anxiety, highlighting difficulties in implementation of potentially intact emotion regulation abilities.

445,Key Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) items associated with DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorder 12-months post traumatic brain injury,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common problems following traumatic brain injury (TBI), warranting routine screening. Self-report rating scales including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are associated with depression and anxiety diagnoses in individuals with TBI. The relationship between individual HADS symptoms and structured clinical interview methods (SCID) requires further investigation, particularly in regard to identifying a small number of key items that can potentially be recognised by clinicians and carers of individuals with TBI. Methods: 138 individuals sustaining a complicated-mild to severe TBI completed the HADS, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Research Version (SCID) at 12-months post-injury. The associations between individual HADS items, separately and in combination, as well as overall depression and anxiety subscale scores, and SCID-diagnosed depressive and anxiety disorders were analysed. Results: CART (Classification and Regression Tree) analysis found HADS depression item 2 “I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy” and a combination of two anxiety items, 3 “I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen” and 5 “worrying thoughts go through my mind”, performed similarly to total depression and anxiety subscales in terms of their association with depressive and anxiety disorders respectively, at 12-months post-injury. Limitations: Patients were predominantly injured in motor vehicle accidents and received comprehensive care within a no-fault accident compensation system and so may not be representative of the wider TBI population. Conclusions: Although validation is required, a small number of self-report items are highly associated with 12-month post-injury diagnoses.

446,Negative affect and intolerance of uncertainty as potential mediators of change in comorbid depression in transdiagnostic CBT for anxiety,"Background: Transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety (TGCBT) has demonstrated effectiveness in improving comorbid conditions, including depression. Mediators of change in reductions in comorbid depression have yet to be established following this anxiety-focused treatment. Negative affect (NA) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) have demonstrated contributions to anxiety reduction in TGCBT, as has positive affect (PA) on depression reductions in other cognitive behavioral treatments. IU is also associated with depression and anxiety as a transdiagnostic vulnerability. This study evaluated the mediational effect of NA, IU, and PA on reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms in TGCBT. We hypothesized the indirect effect of the treatment through IU would be significant even when controlling for indirect effects through NA, PA, anxiety symptoms, and diagnostic severity. Method: Data collected as a part of previous clinical trials at a clinic at a large university in the southwestern United States were used. Participants included 61 individuals from a mixed anxiety-disordered sample for whom pre- and post-treatment data were available. Mediation analyses were conducted using ordinary least squares regression in path-analytic form. Results: The total effect of the model was significant ( F (10, 50) = 8.40, p &lt; .001). When controlling for potential mediators, the direct effect of treatment was not significant (B = -1.01, t = -0.40, p = .688). Analysis of indirect effects revealed significant effects of NA ( B = 0.50, SE = 0.17, p = .005, 95%CI [0.02, 0.83]) and IU (B = 0.13, SE = 0.05, p = .010, 95%CI [0.03, 0.23]), but not diagnostic severity (B = 1.39, SE = 0.86, p = .114, 95%CI [-0.35, 3.12]), anxiety symptoms (B = 0.19, SE = 0.12, p = .136, 95%CI [-0.06, 0.44]), or PA (B = -0.25, SE = 0.13, p = .051, 95%CI [-0.51, 0.01] on depression symptoms when modeled with TGCBT). Conclusion: These results suggest IU contributes uniquely to the improvement of comorbid depression in TGCBT above negative affect, an established change process. Implications for treatment and theory are discussed.

447,Emotional rigidity negatively impacts remission from anxiety and recovery of well-being,"Objectives: Emotional rigidity is described in clinical literature as a significant barrier to recovery; however, few there are few empirical measures of the construct. The current study had two aims: Study 1 aimed to identify latent factors that may bear on the construct of emotional rigidity while Study 2 assessed the potential impact of the latent factor(s) on anxiety remission rates and well-being. Method: This study utilized data from 2472 adult inpatients (1176 females and 1296 males) with severe psychopathology. Study 1 utilized exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify latent factors of emotional rigidity. Study 2 utilized hierarchical logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships among emotional rigidity factors and anxiety remission and well-being recovery at discharge. Results: Study 1 yielded a two-factor solution identified in EFA was confirmed with CFA. Factor 1 consisted of neuroticism, experiential avoidance, non-acceptance of emotions, impaired goal-directed behavior, impulse control difficulties and limited access to emotion regulation strategies when experiencing negative emotions. Factor 2 consisted of lack of emotional awareness and lack of emotional clarity when experiencing negative emotions. Results of Study 2 indicated higher scores on Factor 1 was associated with lower remission rates from anxiety and poorer well-being upon discharge. Factor 2 was not predictive of outcome. Conclusions: Emotional rigidity appears to be a latent construct that negatively impacts remission rates from anxiety. Limitations of the present study include its retrospective design, and inefficient methods of assessing emotional rigidity.

448,The impact of pre- and perinatal factors on psychopathology in adulthood,"Background: : There is considerable evidence that pre- and post-natal factors are associated with a wide range of psychopathology in offspring during childhood and adolescence. Objective: The main aims of the present study were to examine the associations between pre- and perinatal factors and psychopathology in offspring during adulthood, and to explore whether family factors (i.e., family cohesion, mother's social support, and father's social support) mediate these relationships. Method: : Information on pre- and perinatal events was collected from biological mothers of the participants ( N = 315) when they were between 14 and 18 years who were then followed up until they reached age 30. Results: : Maternal obstetric history and illness during first year were significant predictors of offspring anxiety disorder. Maternal emotional health predicted offspring affective disorder. Difficult delivery and breast feeding predicted disruptive disorder. The relationship between maternal obstetric history/emotional health and anxiety/affective disorder was no longer significant after controlling for family cohesion. Limitations: : The information was based on maternal recall when their offspring were between 14 and 18 years which may be subjected to recall bias. Conclusion: : The association between pre- and postnatal factors and psychopathology of offspring during adulthood is mediated by familial factors.

449,Prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among youth with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The purpose of this meta-analytic study was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of anxiety and depressive disorders among children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) and to assess the extent to which these pooled prevalence rates differed according to studies’ characteristics. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases and 21 studies, published between 1975 and 2015, met the inclusion criteria. Results: The resulting pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety and depressive disorders were respectively (a) 5.4% and 2.8% across samples; (b) 1.2% and 0.03% among children; and (c) 7.9% and 1.4% among adolescents. Pooled prevalence estimates for specific subtypes of anxiety disorders ranged from (a) 0.2% to 11.5% across samples; (b) 0.7% to 17.6% among children; and (c) 0.6% to 19.8% among adolescents. Pooled prevalence estimates of dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder were respectively (a) 3.4% and 2.5% across samples; (b) 2.1% and 3.2% among children; and (c) 6.9% and 5.7% among adolescents. Finally, subgroup analyses showed significant variations in the pooled prevalence estimates of combined subtypes of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder; and combined subtypes of depressive disorders. Limitations: The present findings of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution given several limitations related to the characteristics of the populations, diagnostic method and sampling method. Conclusion: Findings provide recommendations for future studies investigating psychological disorders among youth with ID, as well as how clinicians and policy makers can improve diagnostic practices and support for youth with ID.

450,The influence of dietary patterns and stressful life events on psychological problems in a large sample of Iranian industrial employees: Structural equations modeling approach,"Background: Psychological problems affect many employees and their job performance. Although, the association of diet and stress, as modifiable risk factors, with psychological problems have been investigated separately, however their simultaneous impacts have not been studied. The present study aimed at reinvestigating the association of major dietary patterns and stressful life events with intensity of psychological problems in a large sample of Iranian industrial employees. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 3063 employees in an industrial unit in Isfahan, Iran were investigated. Psychological problems profile as a latent construct was extracted from three common psychological problems; depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Depression and anxiety were measured by Persian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and psychological distress by the 12 items General Health Questionnaires (GHQ). Major dietary patterns were derived from a validated short form of semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) using explanatory factor analysis. Stressful life events dimensions were extracted based on factor analysis, from self-perceived frequency and intensity of Stressful Life Events (SLE) questionnaire. Associations of the obtained factors were investigated in a latent structural modeling framework. Results: Three dietary patterns i.e. western, traditional and healthy and two stressors dimensions including personal life and socioeconomics were extracted. Greater adherence to healthy diet was protectively associated with psychological problems profile scores (β = -0.54; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.34). Adherence to western (β = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.45) and Iranian traditional (β = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.68) dietary patterns were positively associated with higher psychological problems scores in employees. But after adjustment for life stressors only adherence to a healthy diet remained significantly associated with psychological problems profile (β = -0.43; 95% CI: -0.59, -0.27). Also, personal life stressors (β = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.99) and socioeconomics stressors (β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.16) had significantly direct association with psychological problems profile scores. Limitations: Variables assessment by self-reported questionnaires, not affording causality because of cross sectional design, not adjusting the nutrients intake in association analyses, relatively small sample size of women. Conclusions: Life stressors particularly personal stressors have negative direct association with psychological health of employees. Adherence to a healthy diet can be related to improvement of psychological health in employees. The results can be useful in occupational health planning in order to improve mental health and job productivity.

451,"Changing patterns in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder over 24 months following a road traffic crash: Results from the UQ SuPPORT study","Objective: To examine the prevalence and changing patterns of PTSD, major depressive episode (MDE), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adult claimants who sustained a non-catastrophic injury in a road traffic crash (RTC) in Queensland, Australia. Method: Participants ( N = 284) were assessed at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months post-RTC using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) modules for PTSD, and CIDI-short form for MDE, and GAD. Results: The prevalence of at least one of these disorders was 48.2%, 52.5%, and 49.3%, at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Comorbidity was common (20.8% at 6 months, 27.1% at 12 months, and 21.1% at 24 months) and only 33.1% of participants never met PTSD, GAD, or MDE criteria. A substantial proportion of participants (42.3%) had an unstable diagnostic pattern over time. Participants with multiple diagnoses at 6 months were more likely to continue to meet diagnostic criteria for any disorder at 12 and 24 months than participants with a single diagnosis. Participants with PTSD (with or without MDE/GAD) were more likely to meet criteria for any disorder at 24 months than participants with another diagnosis. Preinjury psychiatric history increased the likelihood of any disorder at 24 months post-injury, but did not significantly increase the likelihood of PTSD. Conclusions: People injured in a RTC are at risk of having complex psychological presentations over time. Interventions to prevent mental disorders, especially PTSD, in the early post-injury period are needed to prevent chronic psychological injury, including consideration of comorbidity and dynamic course.

452,Temperament clusters associate with anxiety disorder comorbidity in depression,"Background: Individual temperament is associated with psychiatric morbidity and could explain differences in psychiatric comorbidities. We investigated the association of temperament profile clusters with anxiety disorder comorbidity in patients with depression. Methods: We assessed the temperament of 204 specialized care-treated depressed patients with the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) and their diagnoses with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Two-step cluster analysis was used for defining patients’ temperament profiles and logistic regression analysis was used for predicting different anxiety disorders for various temperament profiles. Results: Four temperament clusters were found: 1) Novelty seekers with highest Novelty Seeking scores ( n = 56),2) Persistent with highest Persistence scores ( n = 36), 3) Reserved with lowest Novelty Seeking scores ( n = 66) and 4) Wearied with highest Harm avoidance, lowest Reward Dependence and lowest Persistence scores ( n = 58). After adjusting for clinical variables, panic disorder and/or agoraphobia were predicted by Novelty seekers’ temperament profile with odds ratio [OR] = 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 − 6.9, p &lt; 0.001), social anxiety disorder was predicted by Wearied temperament profile with OR = 3.4 (95% CI = 1.6 − 7.5, p = 0.002), and generalized anxiety disorder was predicted by Reserved temperament profile with OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 1.2 − 5.3, p = 0.01). Limitations: The patients’ temperament profiles were assessed while displaying depressive symptoms, which may have affected results. Conclusions: Temperament clusters with unique dimensional profiles were specifically associated with different anxiety disorders in this study. These results suggest that TCI-R could offer a valuable dimensional method for predicting the risk of anxiety disorders in diverse depressed patients.

453,The Pregnancy-related Anxiety Scale: A validity examination using Rasch analysis,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety is increasingly recognised as a common condition that is associated with many deleterious outcomes for both the mother and infant (e.g., preterm birth, postnatal depression). Limitations in the psychometric properties and/or breadth of existing scales for pregnancy-related anxiety highlight the need for a psychometrically sound measure to facilitate effective screening and possible early interventions. The recently developed Pregnancy-related Anxiety Scale (PrAS) was evaluated using Rasch analysis to explore how the scale's psychometric properties could be fine-tuned. Method: A sample of 497 pregnant women completed the PrAS. Data were subjected to Rasch analysis, and the resulting scale structure examined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results: After minor modifications, the Rasch model with 33-items and 8-factors demonstrated good fit, unidimensionality and excellent targeting and internal consistency. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the final structure, and Cronbach's alpha demonstrated excellent reliability. Limitations: The use of the same sample for all analyses was a potential limitation due to the possibility of sample-specific influences. Conclusions: The Rasch analysis further supports the internal construct validity of the PrAS. Ordinal to interval score conversions provide added precision to the analysis of the PrAS scores. The Rasch results, together with previous validation evidence, point to the PrAS as a comprehensive and psychometrically sound screening scale for pregnancy-related anxiety. The PrAS offers clinicians the ability to screen for pregnancy-related anxiety. The subscales provide additional insights into a woman's pregnancy-related anxiety and her specific areas of concern, enabling more targeted interventions.

454,Prediction of preterm birth should be done before the preterm birth occurs,"Comments on an article by C. Doktorchik et al. (see record 2018-05068-011). Doktorchik et al. reported on the association between changes in anxiety and depression levels during pregnancy and the prediction of preterm birth. We have however a concern about the validity of the research. The authors collected data using two questionnaires, the Spielberg State Anxiety Scale, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to determine anxiety and depression scores respectively. Anxiety and depression were measured at a specific point in time between 17 and 24 weeks and again between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation. While we do not have an issue with the validity of these assessment tools, it is unclear how an increase in scores in the third trimester of pregnancy can be predictive of preterm birth (PTB), which by definition occurs before 37 weeks.

455,"Generalized anxiety disorder and associated factors in adults in the Amazon, Brazil: A population-based study","Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults using the seven-item GAD scale (GAD-7) and to evaluate the properties of the two-item (GAD-2) as a population screening tool. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional population-based study in the Manaus Metropolitan Region in 2015, Brazil. Adults aged 18 years or more were eligible to participate. We performed probabilistic three-phase sampling and collected sociodemographic and clinical variables. Descriptive statistics and a Poisson regression with robust variance with corrections for complex sampling were used. The accuracy of GAD-2 was assessed using GAD-7 as the gold standard. Results: We included 4001 participants. The prevalence of GAD was 8.4% (95% confidence interval 7.6–9.4%) and was significantly associated with self-reported poor health status and presenting depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.01). GAD-2 sensitivity was 63.9%, and its specificity was 97.4%. Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional design of the study, the results are prone to reverse causality and recall bias. The surveyed people were not questioned about their medical diagnosis of anxiety, access to mental health services, or alcohol, tobacco or other drug use. The screening tools were not validated in the Brazilian or Amazon population. Conclusion: About eight in 100 adults living in Manaus presented GAD, and it is more prevalent among people with a poorer health status and depression. Because of its low sensitivity, GAD-2 is not useful as a screening tool.

456,Prevalence of anxiety in patients with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Prevalence rates of anxiety in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) varied widely across studies and may confer a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety in MCI and identify reasons for heterogeneity in the reported results. Methods: A computerized search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Psyc INFO for studies on anxiety in MCI was performed up to March 2017. The overall prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI was pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored using stratification (recruitment resource; method of anxiety diagnosis; method of MCI diagnosis; and region) and random-effects meta-regression. Results: Of 2494 unique abstracts, 290 were selected for full-text review, and 39 studies, representing 10,587 patients, met all inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of depression in patients with MCI was 21.0% (95% CI, 16.2–26.7) with significant heterogeneity present (I² = 97.2%, p &lt; 0.001). When stratified by source, the prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI in community-based samples was 14.3% (95% CI, 9.7–20.5) and was 31.2% (95% CI, 23.6–40.0) in clinic-based samples, which was significantly different ( p &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of anxiety estimates also differed significantly, when stratification by the method of anxiety diagnosis ( p &lt; 0.01). However, the criteria used for MCI diagnosis and geographical region did not significantly influence the prevalence estimate. Limitations: We did not consider the usage of anti-anxiety drugs and language bias. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety in patients with MCI was common and variability in prevalence of anxiety across studies can be attributed partly to the source of the sample and method of anxiety diagnosis. Further research is needed to identify sources of heterogeneity.

457,Do mothers who are anxious during pregnancy have inattentive children?,"Background: Maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy may affect neural foetal development via corticoid pathways. Using a large epidemiological cohort, this study explores the relationship between maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy and child scores on the Test of Everyday Attention in Children (TEA-Ch). Methods: Linear regression was used to analyse the association of maternal somatic anxiety during pregnancy and performance of children on three subtests of the TEA-Ch at age 8.5 years that assess selective attention (Sky Search), sustained attention (Sky Search Dual Test) and attentional control (Opposite Worlds). Results: Children with complete data on each subtest were included in the analysis, comprising 4,198 children for the Sky Search subtest, 3,845 for the Sky Search Dual Test and 4,202 for the Opposite Worlds subtest. No association was found between exposure to maternal somatic anxiety and child's performance in any of the TEA-Ch subtests either before or after adjusting for confounders. The results did not change when stratifying by gender. Limitations: Selective attrition, lack of sensitivity of tests and lack of adjustment for the postnatal environment are possible limitations to this study. Conclusions: We found no evidence of an association between exposure to maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy and TEA-Ch scores. These results suggest that anxiety during pregnancy does not affect the development of children's attentional skills measured by TEA-Ch.

458,Development and external validation of a prediction rule for an unfavorable course of late-life depression: A multicenter cohort study,"Background: Given the poor prognosis of late-life depression, it is crucial to identify those at risk. Our objective was to construct and validate a prediction rule for an unfavourable course of late-life depression. Methods: For development and internal validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO) data. We included participants with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline ( n = 270; 60–90 years), assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). For external validation of the model, we used The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data ( n = 197; 50–66 years). The outcome was MDD after 2 years of follow-up, assessed with the CIDI. Candidate predictors concerned sociodemographics, psychopathology, physical symptoms, medication, psychological determinants, and healthcare setting. Model performance was assessed by calculating calibration and discrimination. Results: 111 subjects (41.1%) had MDD after 2 years of follow-up. Independent predictors of MDD after 2 years were (older) age, (early) onset of depression, severity of depression, anxiety symptoms, comorbid anxiety disorder, fatigue, and loneliness. The final model showed good calibration and reasonable discrimination (AUC of 0.75; 0.70 after external validation). The strongest individual predictor was severity of depression (AUC of 0.69; 0.68 after external validation). Limitations: The model was developed and validated in The Netherlands, which could affect the cross-country generalizability. Conclusions: Based on rather simple clinical indicators, it is possible to predict the 2-year course of MDD. The prediction rule can be used for monitoring MDD patients and identifying those at risk of an unfavourable outcome.

459,Feasibility of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group intervention as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression and anxiety,"Background: Many women experience moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety in the postpartum period for which pharmacotherapy is often the first-line treatment. Many breastfeeding mothers are reticent to increase their dose or consider additional medication, despite incomplete response, due to potential adverse effects on their newborn. These mothers are amenable to non-pharmacological intervention for complete symptom remission. The current study evaluated the feasibility of an eight-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression and anxiety. Methods: Women were recruited at an outpatient reproductive mental health clinic based at a maternity hospital. Participants had a diagnosis of postpartum depression/anxiety within the first year following childbirth. They were enrolled in either the MBCT intervention group (n = 14) or the treatment-as-usual control group (n = 16), and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months following baseline. Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels decreased, and mindfulness levels increased, in the MBCT group, but not in the control group. Many of the between-group and over time comparisons displayed trends towards significance, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Additionally, the effect sizes for anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were frequently large, indicating that the MBCT intervention may have had a clinically significant effect on participants. Limitations: Limitations include small sample size and the non-equivalent control group design. Conclusions: We demonstrated that MBCT has potential as an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment for postpartum depression/anxiety that does not wholly remit with pharmacotherapy.

460,"The effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on psychiatric symptoms among patients with irritable bowel syndrome, functional diarrhea and functional constipation: An open-label observational study","Backgrounds: The intestinal microbiota is considered as a potential common underpinning pathophysiology of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been reported to have therapeutic effects on diseases related to dysbiosis, but few studies have evaluated its effect on psychiatric symptoms. Methods: We followed 17 patients with either Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Functional Diarrhea (FDr) or Functional Constipation (FC) who underwent FMT for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms and observation of psychiatric symptoms. Changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and subscale of sleep-related items, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) between baseline and 4 weeks after FMT, and relationship with the intestinal microbiota were measured. Results: At baseline, 12 out of 17 patients were rated with HAM-D ≥ 8. Significant improvement in HAM-D total and sleep subscale score, HAM-A and QIDS were observed ( p = 0.007, p = 0.007, p = 0.01, p = 0.007, respectively). Baseline Shannon index indicated that microbiota showed lower diversity in patients with HAM-D ≥ 8 compared to those of healthy donors and patients with HAM-D &lt; 8. There was a significant correlation between baseline Shannon index and HAM-D score, and a correlation between Shannon index change and HAM-D improvement after FMT. Limitations: The small sample size with no control group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that depression and anxiety symptoms may be improved by FMT regardless of gastrointestinal symptom change in patients with IBS, FDr and FC, and the increase of microbiota diversity may help to improve patient's mood.

461,The course of anxiety in persons with dementia in Norwegian nursing homes: A 12-month follow-up study,"Background: Knowledge is scarce about the course of anxiety in persons with dementia (PWD) in nursing homes. This study aimed to describe the course of anxiety, anxiety symptoms, and the correlates of change in the Norwegian version of the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale (RAID-N) score in PWD in nursing homes. Methods: Using the RAID-N, anxiety was assessed in 298 PWD aged 65 years and above from 17 Norwegian nursing homes. The assessments were made at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 350 days (SD 12.3). Associations between the change in RAID-N score and demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed with multilevel regression models. Results: At 12 months, 93 participants (31.2%) had died. There was no significant change in the proportion of participants with anxiety, defined as RAID-N score ≥ 12, from baseline (33.7%) to follow-up (31.2%) (McNemar, p = 0.597). “Motor tension”, “frightened and anxious”, and “irritability” were the most frequent anxiety symptoms among those with dementia and anxiety. A higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) sub-syndrome affective baseline score and more use of anxiolytics were associated with reduction in RAID-N score, whereas a higher NPI-Q sub-syndrome aroused baseline score and more use of antipsychotics were associated with an increase in RAID-N score at follow-up. Limitations: The study did not control for ongoing treatment or changes of comorbidities. Conclusions: Anxiety and anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among PWD in nursing homes over a12-month period. The symptoms “motor tension”, “frightened and anxious”, and “irritability” require attention in screening for anxiety.

462,Psychometric properties of the social anxiety subscale of the Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM-5 (YAM-5-I-SAD) in a clinical sample of Spanish-speaking adolescents,"Background: The Youth Anxiety Measure-I for DSM-5 has recently been developed to assess youth's anxiety symptomatology. As social anxiety is one of the most common disorders in adolescence, this scale includes a subscale measuring social anxiety. However, psychometric properties of the YAM-5-I social anxiety subscale (YAM-5-I-SAD) in clinical samples are lacking. This paper aims to bridge the gap. Methods: The sample comprised 24 clinically diagnosed and 24 healthy control Spanish-speaking adolescents aged 14–17 years. Results: Data revealed that the YAM-5- I-SAD yielded excellent sensitivity, which makes it particularly useful as a screening tool to early detect socially anxious adolescents. In addition, the YAM-5-I-SAD evidenced good internal consistency and construct validity. Limitations: Data are limited to the social anxiety subscale. Conclusions: The YAM-5-I-SAD is a sensitive and specific measure to screen for adolescents with social anxiety.

463,PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB signaling pathway regulates anxiety-like behavior in rats following alcohol withdrawal,"Background: Alcohol abuse and anxiety disorders often occur concurrently, but their underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Neuroadaptation within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol drinking behavior and withdrawal. Methods: A chronic alcohol exposure rat model (35 consecutive days of 10% alcohol intake and 48 h of withdrawal) was established, then, wortmannin (0.5 µg/side) was injected bilaterally into the mPFC. The elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were used to assess anxiety-like behavior. Western blot assays were used to assess protein levels. Results: We found that anxiety-like behavior peaked approximately 6 h after alcohol withdrawal. However, wortmannin greatly decreased alcohol intake and attenuated anxiety-like behavior in the alcohol exposure rats. Moreover, the PI3K-AKT-GSK3β signaling pathway was activated after alcohol withdrawal, and phosphorylation of the downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was increased. Wortmannin uniformly reversed PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB pathway phosphorylation. Limitations: The downstream GSK3β activity was not intervened and a single dose level of wortmannin was used. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating the PI3K-AKT-GSK3β-CREB pathway in the mPFC is an important contributor to the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol withdrawal. PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors are thus potential candidates for treating alcohol abuse.

464,The mediation roles of discrepancy stress and self-esteem between masculine role discrepancy and mental health problems,"Introduction: Masculine role discrepancy and discrepancy stress occur when men perceive that they fail to live up to the ideal manhood derived from societal prescriptions. The present study examined the associations between masculine role discrepancy and two emotional and mental health problems (social anxiety and depressive symptoms), and potential mediation effects through discrepancy stress and self-esteem in a male general population. Methods: Based on random population-based sampling, 2000 male residents in Hong Kong were interviewed. Levels of masculine role discrepancy, discrepancy stress, self-esteem, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed by using validated scales. Results: Results of structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the proposed model fit the sample well. (χ²(118) = 832.34, p &lt; .05, CFI = 0.94, NNFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.06). Those who were young, single and less educated were vulnerable to masculine role discrepancy, discrepancy stress, and emotional/mental health problems. We found that discrepancy stress significantly mediated the association between masculine role discrepancy and social anxiety, while self-esteem significantly mediated the associations between masculine role discrepancy and both social anxiety and depression. Limitations: Study limitations mainly included the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported questionnaires. Conclusions: The associations between masculine discrepancy and social anxiety/depressive symptoms among men may be explained by the increase in discrepancy stress and decrease in self-esteem. The findings suggest needs and directions for future research for the relationship between masculine role discrepancy and men's mental health, mechanisms involved, and interventions for improvement.

465,Gender-specific associations of depression and anxiety symptoms with mental rotation,"Background: Men score higher on mental rotation tasks compared to women and suffer from depression and anxiety at half the rate of women. The objective of this study was to confirm the gender-specific effects of depression and anxiety on mental rotation performance. Methods: We collected data in non-experimental conditions from 325 university students at three universities. Participants completed rating scales of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and then simultaneously performed a mental rotation task using tablet devices. Results: We observed no significant difference between men and women in the depressive and anxiety symptoms and task response time. Men had a significantly higher correct answer rate compared with women. The scores of depression and anxiety of all participants were positively correlated. Task response time correlated positively with intensity of depressive symptoms and anxiety in women, but not in men. Women with high depressive symptoms had significantly longer response times than did women with low depressive symptoms, while men had no differences due to depressive symptoms. Limitations: We did not directly examine brain functions; therefore, the underlying neurobiological results are only based on previous knowledge and action data. Conclusions: The pathology of depression and anxiety was reflected in the correct answer rate and response time in relation to the gender difference of brain function used in mental rotation.

466,Temperamental factors in remitted depression: The role of effortful control and attentional mechanisms,"Background: Temperamental effortful control and attentional networks are increasingly viewed as important underlying processes in depression and anxiety. However, it is still unknown whether these factors facilitate depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population and, more specifically, in remitted depressed individuals. Methods: We investigated to what extent effortful control and attentional networks (i.e., Attention Network Task) explain concurrent depressive and anxious symptoms in healthy individuals ( n = 270) and remitted depressed individuals ( n = 90). Both samples were highly representative of the US population. Results: Increased effortful control predicted a substantial decrease in symptoms of both depression and anxiety in the whole sample, whereas decreased efficiency of executive attention predicted a modest increase in depressive symptoms. Remitted depressed individuals did not show less effortful control nor less efficient attentional networks than healthy individuals. Moreover, clinical status did not moderate the relationship between temperamental factors and either depressive or anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: Our study shows that temperamental effortful control represents an important transdiagnostic process for depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults.

467,A naturalistic examination of the perceived effects of cannabis on negative affect,"Background: Cannabis is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of negative affect. However, a paucity of research has examined the acute effects of cannabis on negative affect in everyday life. The current study provides a naturalistic account of perceived changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of dose and concentration of Δ⁹tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Method: Data from the app Strainprint TM (which provides medical cannabis users a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and chemotypes of cannabis) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. In total, 11,953 tracked sessions were analyzed (3,151 for depression, 5,085 for anxiety, and 3,717 for stress). Results: Medical cannabis users perceived a 50% reduction in depression and a 58% reduction in anxiety and stress following cannabis use. Two puffs were sufficient to reduce ratings of depression and anxiety, while 10 + puffs produced the greatest perceived reductions in stress. High CBD (&gt; 9.5%)/low THC (&lt; 5.5%) cannabis was associated with the largest changes in depression ratings, while high CBD (&gt; 11%)/high THC (&gt; 26.5%) cannabis produced the largest perceived changes in stress. No changes in the perceived efficacy of cannabis were detected across time. However, baseline symptoms of depression (but not anxiety or stress) appeared to be exacerbated across time/tracked sessions. Limitations: The primary limitations are the self-selected nature of the sample and the inability to control for expectancy effects. Conclusions: Cannabis reduces perceived symptoms of negative affect in the short-term, but continued use may exacerbate baseline symptoms of depression over time.

468,Prospective predictors of first-onset depressive disorders in adolescent females with anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxious youth are at increased risk for later depressive disorders, but not all anxious youth develop depression. Sequential comorbidity models emphasize shared risk factors and anxiety sequelae, but some anxious youth who later develop depression may have risk factors that are relatively specific to depression, in addition to a liability to anxiety. We examined several variables that appear relatively specific to risk for depression—the personality traits of low positive affectivity and high sadness, and an electrophysiological measure of blunted response to reward—in predicting first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in clinically anxious adolescent girls. Methods: A sample of 114 adolescents with baseline anxiety disorders completed personality and psychopathology measures, psychophysiology tasks, and diagnostic interviews. Interviews and a measure of depressive symptoms were re-administered over 27 months. Results: After controlling for baseline depressive symptoms, blunted reward sensitivity uniquely predicted first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms 27 months later. Post-hoc analyses indicated that blunted reward sensitivity only predicted first-onset depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in girls with high social anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Analyses were unable to account for concurrent anxiety symptoms and disorders. Conclusions: The depression-specific risk factor, blunted reward sensitivity, may comprise one pathway to subsequent depressive disorders and symptoms in anxious youth and indicate which anxious youth need intervention to prevent later depression, particularly in socially anxious girls.

469,Anxiety disorders and figural fluency: A measure of executive function,"Background: Anxiety possibly interferes with executive functioning, although most studies rely on anxiety symptoms or lack control for comorbid depression. The objective of the present study is to examine the association between executive functioning and (individual) anxiety disorders with ak,ld without controlling for depression. Method: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, social phobia, as well as depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview in 82,360 community-dwelling people participating in the Lifelines cohort. Figural fluency as a measure of executive functioning was assessed with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFTT). Linear regression analyses with the RFFT score as the dependent variable and psychiatric diagnosis as independent variables (dummies) were performed, adjusted for potential confounders. Multivariate results are presented with and without adjustment for depression. Results: Presence of any anxiety disorder was associated with worse performance on the RFFT (B = − 0.78, SE = 0.32, p = .015), independent of depression. No dose-response relationship with the number of anxiety disorders was found. Only agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly associated with the RFFT score in the multivariate models. Agoraphobia remained significant when further adjusted for depressive disorder (B = − 1.14, SE = 0.41, p &lt; .01), while GAD did not (B = 0.013, SE = 0.431, p = .975). Limitations: Executive function was tested by only one measure, namely figural fluency. Conclusion: Agoraphobia is associated with worse executive functioning. Treatment of agoraphobia could be influenced by the executive dysfunction which clinicians should be aware of when regular treatment fails.

470,"Generalized anxiety disorder in urban China: Prevalence, awareness, and disease burden","Introduction: Limited published research has quantified the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) prevalence and its burden in China. This study aimed to fill in the knowledge gap and to evaluate the burden of GAD among adults in urban China. Methods: This study utilized existing data from the China National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) 2012–2013. Prevalence of self-reported diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD was estimated. Diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD respondents were compared with non-anxious respondents in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource utilization, and work productivity and activity impairment using multivariate generalized linear models. A multivariate logistic model assessed the risk factors for GAD. Results: The prevalence of undiagnosed/diagnosed GAD was 5.3% in urban China with only 0.5% of GAD respondents reporting a diagnosis. Compared with non-anxious respondents, both diagnosed and undiagnosed GAD respondents had significantly lower HRQoL, more work productivity and activity impairment, and greater healthcare resource utilization in the past six months. Age, gender, marital status, income level, insurance status, smoking, drinking and exercise behaviors, and comorbidity burdens were significantly associated with GAD. Limitations: This was a patient-reported study; data are therefore subject to recall bias. The survey was limited to respondents in urban China; therefore, these results focused on urban China and may be under- or over-estimating GAD prevalence in China. Causal inferences cannot be made given the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: GAD may be substantially under-diagnosed in urban China. More healthcare resources should be invested to alleviate the burden of GAD.

471,Trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety from pregnancy to three years and child development at 3 years of age: Findings from the All Our Families (AOF) pregnancy cohort,"Background: Existing literature on maternal distress has focused on stress and anxiety during the pregnancy or postnatally and their relationship with child development. However, few studies have investigated the association between maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time and child development in preschool children. The aim of this study was to examine the association between trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum and child development at age three years. Methods: Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of women's stress and anxiety across from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the stress and anxiety trajectories and child developmental delays while adjusting for the covariates. Results: LCA identified three distinct trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time. Multivariate analysis showed mothers assigned to the high anxiety symptoms class had an increased risk (adjusted OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.80 (1.42─5.51), p = 0.003) of having a child with developmental delays at 3 years. Limitations: The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and no data on fathers’ mental health are our study's limitations. Conclusions: The findings from a population-based Canadian sample provide empirical support for a relationship between maternal anxiety overtime and risk of child developmental delays. Identifying and supporting mothers experiencing high anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period may mitigate the risk of these delays in children.

472,A computerized version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 as an ultra-brief screening tool to detect emotional disorders in primary care,"Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) is an ultra-brief self-report consisting of a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2) and a 2-item anxiety scale (GAD-2). The aim of the present study is to determine the psychometric properties of a computerized version of the PHQ-4 used to detect emotional disorders (anxiety and depression) in the primary care setting. Method: A total of 1052 patients with suspected anxiety, depression, or somatic symptoms were recruited from 28 primary care centres participating in the PsicAP trial and completed the full version of the computerized PHQ. In addition, 178 of these patients also underwent in clinical interviews as a gold standard. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses showed very good fit indices for a two-factor solution. This model was structurally invariant among the various age and gender groups and internal consistency was acceptable (PHQ-4; α = .83, PHQ-2; α = .86, and GAD-2; α = .76). The best cut-off points to obtain high sensitivity values was 3, on both the PHQ-2 (major depressive disorder) and the GAD-2 (generalized anxiety disorder). The criterion validity (sensitivity and specificity) for the PHQ-2 were .90 and .61 and for the GAD-2, .88 and 0.61. Limitations: The study was not designed as a prevalence study. Therefore, does not contain information on patients whose general practitioners do not consider them to suffer emotional disorders. Conclusion: This is the first study to provide evidence for the reliability and validity of a computerized version of the PHQ-4. This computerized tool can be used to detect depression and anxiety in a primary care setting.

473,Genome-wide QTL analysis for anxiety trait in bipolar disorder type I,"Background: Genetic studies have been consistent that bipolar disorder type I (BPI) runs in families and that this familial aggregation is strongly influenced by genes. In a preliminary study, we proved that anxiety trait meets endophenotype criteria for BPI. Methods: We assessed 619 individuals from the Central Valley of Costa Rica (CVCR) who have received evaluation for anxiety following the same methodological procedure used for the initial pilot study. Our goal was to conduct a multipoint quantitative trait linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to anxiety trait in subjects with BPI. We conducted the statistical analyses using Quantitative Trait Loci method (Variance-components models), implemented in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR), using 5606 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Results: We identified a suggestive linkage signal with a LOD score of 2.01 at chromosome 2 (2q13-q14). Limitations: Since confounding factors such as substance abuse, medical illness and medication history were not assessed in our study, these conclusions should be taken as preliminary. Conclusions: We conclude that region 2q13-q14 may harbor a candidate gene(s) with an important role in the pathophysiology of BPI and anxiety.

474,Temporal dynamics and longitudinal co-occurrence of depression and different anxiety syndromes in youth: Evidence for reciprocal patterns in a 3-year prospective study,"Background: Depression is highly comorbid with anxiety in youth. It is frequently reported that anxiety precedes depression; however, evidence surrounding the temporal precedence of anxiety over depression is mixed. Many studies of anxiety-depression co-occurrence lump distinct forms of anxiety, obscuring information regarding trajectories of specific anxiety syndromes. This study sought to more accurately describe the development of anxiety and depression over time by moving beyond the question of temporal precedence to investigate a developmentally dynamic model of anxiety-depression co-occurrence. Methods: A community sample of 665 youth ( M = 11.8, SD = 2.4; 55% female) completed repeated self-report measures of depression and anxiety (social, physical, and separation anxiety) over a 3-year longitudinal study. Prospective associations between distinct syndromes of anxiety with depression were analyzed using an autoregressive cross-lagged path model over four time points. Results: Physical symptoms and depression symptoms reciprocally predicted each other, above and beyond the stability of either domain. Social anxiety and depression symptoms similarly predicted each other in a systematic pattern. Limitations: Our study is limited in its generalizability to other forms of anxiety, like worry. Additional research is needed to determine whether similar patterns exist in clinical populations, and whether these processes maintain symptoms once they reach diagnostic levels. Conclusions: The development of syndromes of depression, physical, and social anxiety during childhood and adolescence occurs in a predictable, systematic reciprocal pattern, rather than sequentially and unidirectionally (i.e., anxiety syndromes precede depression). Results are clinically useful for predicting risk for disorder, and demonstrate the necessity of tracking symptom levels across domains.

475,Inflammatory markers as predictors of depression and anxiety in adolescents: Statistical model building with component-wise gradient boosting,"Background: Immune system abnormalities have been repeatedly observed in several psychiatric disorders, including severe depression and anxiety. However, whether specific immune mediators play an early role in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unknown. Methods: In a longitudinal design, component-wise gradient boosting was used to build models of depression, assessed by the Mood-Feelings Questionnaire-Child (MFQC), and anxiety, assessed by the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in 254 adolescents from a large set of candidate predictors, including sex, race, 39 inflammatory proteins, and the interactions between those proteins and time. Each model was reduced via backward elimination to maximize parsimony and generalizability. Results: Component-wise gradient boosting and model reduction found that female sex, growth- regulated oncogene (GRO), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) predicted depression, while female sex predicted anxiety. Limitations: Differential onset of puberty as well as a lack of control for menstrual cycle may also have been responsible for differences between males and females in the present study. In addition, investigation of all possible nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the outcomes was beyond the computational capacity and scope of the present research. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for novel statistical modeling to identify reliable biological predictors of aberrant psychological behavior.

476,A systematic review of the associations between maternal nutritional biomarkers and depression and/or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum,"Background: Nutritional requirements need to be met in order to adapt to pre- and postnatal changes. Our aim was to systematically review the evidence of associations between nutritional biomarkers and psychological distress during pregnancy and in the first postnatal year. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scielo, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for articles from inception to 4/15/2016. Studies of maternal nutritional biomarkers in blood (fatty acids/micronutrients/amino acids) and associations with psychological distress (depression/anxiety/stress) were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data based on study designs, participants, outcomes, exposures, and association measures. Results: Thirty-eight studies were included. A total of 13 studies showed divergent or no associations between serum/plasma/erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations and depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. Changes in serum cholesterol levels from pregnancy to postpartum showed a significant inverse correlation with depression in one out of three studies. Five out of seven studies found an inverse association between serum vitamin D levels and pre- and postnatal depression. Plasma tryptophan levels were inversely correlated with postnatal depression scores in three out of four studies. We identified that one out of two studies presented no significant association between vitamin B₁₂/folate/ferritin concentrations and depression in postpartum. Limitations: There was higher variability between association measures, time and scales of depression and anxiety assessments. Conclusions: The majority of high-quality studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels may be associated with postpartum depression. However, further evidence is needed for guiding clinical practice on nutritional biomarkers.

477,High levels of mitochondrial DNA are associated with adolescent brain structural hypoconnectivity and increased anxiety but not depression,"Background: Adolescent anxiety and depression are highly prevalent psychiatric disorders that are associated with altered molecular and neurocircuit profiles. Recently, increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-cn) has been found to be associated with several psychopathologies in adults, especially anxiety and depression. The associations between mtDNA-cn and anxiety and depression have not, however, been investigated in adolescents. Moreover, to date there have been no studies examining associations between mtDNA-cn and brain network alterations in mood disorders in any age group. Methods: The first aim of this study was to compare salivary mtDNA-cn between 49 depressed and/or anxious adolescents and 35 well-matched healthy controls. The second aim of this study was to identify neural correlates of mtDNA-cn derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, in the full sample of adolescents. Results: There were no diagnosis-specific alterations in mtDNA-cn. However, there was a positive correlation between mtDNA-cn and levels of anxiety, but not depression, in the full sample of adolescents. A subnetwork of connections largely corresponding to the left fronto-occipital fasciculus had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in adolescents with higher than median mtDNA-cn. Limitations: Undifferentiated analysis of free and intracellular mtDNA and use of DTI-based tractography represent this study's limitations. Conclusions: The results of this study help elucidate the relationships between clinical symptoms, molecular changes, and neurocircuitry alterations in adolescents with and without anxiety and depression, and they suggest that increased mtDNA-cn is associated both with increased anxiety symptoms and with decreased fronto-occipital structural connectivity in this population.

478,State-trait anxiety levels during pregnancy and foetal parameters following intervention with music therapy,"Background: Research indicates that anxiety during pregnancy may be a risk factor for the development of alterations in the mental health of the pregnant woman and of obstetric complications. Objective: to investigate the effect of music therapy on maternal anxiety, before and after a non-stress test (NST), and the effect of maternal anxiety on the birthing process and birth size. Methods: 409 nulliparous women coming for routine prenatal care were randomized in the third trimester to receive either music therapy (n = 204) or no music therapy (n = 205) during an NST. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after the NST. Results: After the NST, the women from the music group showed significantly lower scores in state anxiety (OR = 0.87; p &lt; 0.001) as well as trait anxiety (p &lt; 0.001) than the control group. Furthermore, the pregnant women from the music group presented lower levels of state-trait anxiety than the control group in relation to the variables of birth process, and higher birth weight and chest circumference in the newborn (OR = 3.5 and OR = 0.81, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This study was limited by the fact that it was a single-centre study; the observers conducting the NST were not blinded to the allocation, although neither midwife had any knowledge of the maternal anxiety scores, and we could not apply the double-blind method due to the nature of the observation. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that music therapy intervention during pregnancy could reduce elevated state-trait anxiety levels during the third trimester. Further research into the influence of music therapy as intervention on maternal anxiety and on the birthing process and birth size is required during pregnancy.

479,"Transdiagnostic assessment of repetitive negative thinking and responses to positive affect: Structure and predictive utility for depression, anxiety, and mania symptoms","Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a cognitive process that is repetitive, passive, relatively uncontrollable, and focused on negative content, and is elevated in emotional disorders including depression and anxiety disorders. Repetitive positive thinking is associated with bipolar disorder symptoms. The unique contributions of positive versus negative repetitive thinking to emotional symptoms are unknown. The first aim of this study was to use confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the psychometrics of two transdiagnostic measures of RNT, the Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ-10) and Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ), and a measure of repetitive positive thinking, the Responses to Positive Affect (RPA) Questionnaire. The second aim was to determine incremental predictive utility of these measures. Method: All measures were administered to a sample of 2088 undergraduate students from the Netherlands ( n = 992), Australia ( n = 698), and America ( n = 398). Results: Unidimensional, bifactor, and three-factor models were supported for the RTQ-10, PTQ, and RPA, respectively. A common factor measured by all PTQ items explained most variance in PTQ scores suggesting that this measure is essentially unidimensional. The RNT factor of the RTQ-10 demonstrated the strongest predictive utility, although the PTQ was also uniquely although weakly associated with anxiety, depression, and mania symptoms. The RPA dampening factor uniquely predicted anxiety and depression symptoms, suggesting that this scale is a separable process to RNT as measured by the RTQ-10 and PTQ. Limitations: Findings were cross-sectional and need to be replicated in clinical samples. Conclusions: Transdiagnostic measures of RNT are essentially unidimensional, whereas RPA is multidimensional. RNT and RPA have unique predictive utility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
480,12-month prevalence and concomitants of DSM-IV depression and anxiety disorders in two violence-prone cities in Brazil,"Background: Estimating 12-month prevalence of depression, anxiety, and comorbid anxiety/depression in noninstitutionalized adults (age 15–75) in two violence-prone cities. Methods: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview v2.1 (Portuguese), administered in population-representative surveys (age 15–75) in São Paulo (N = 2536) and Rio de Janeiro (N = 1208), yielded 12-month prevalence of violent events experienced, and DSM-IV diagnoses of depression and anxiety, which were classified into mutually exclusive groups: 1) no anxiety/depression; 2) anxiety only; 3) depression only; 4) comorbid anxiety/depression. Weighted analyses estimated 12-month prevalence, multinomial logistic regression compared the demographic characteristics of the diagnosis groups, and association with experienced violence. Results: Twelve-month prevalence of anxiety alone, depression alone, and comorbid anxiety/depression was 12.7% (of whom 24.9% were also depressed), 4.9% (of whom 46.2% had anxiety), and 4.2% respectively for São Paulo; and 12.1% (18.2% of whom were depressed), 4.6% (37.0% with anxiety), and 2.7% respectively for Rio de Janeiro. All conditions were approximately twice as prevalent in women than in men in both cities. In São Paulo, comorbidity was associated with age under 60, depression alone was more prevalent among 30–59 year olds, but in 23–29 year-olds in Rio de Janeiro. Exposure to violence increased the odds of anxiety, depression, and their comorbidity. With rare exception, marital status, education, and race/ethnicity were not associated with anxiety, depression, or their comorbidity. Limitations: Cross-sectional design. Conclusions: Prevalence rates for all conditions were high, and particularly associated with exposure to violence. Means to ameliorate violence, and its mental health effects, particularly for women, are needed.

481,A systematic review and meta-analysis of interpersonal psychotherapy for perinatal women,"Background: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has demonstrated efficacy for the prevention and treatment of perinatal depression. Previous systematic reviews have not evaluated the effects of IPT on other outcomes, most notably symptoms of anxiety and interpersonal functioning, or assessed moderators of treatment efficacy specific to IPT. Method: A systematic review identified 28 studies assessing the efficacy of IPT during pregnancy or the first year postpartum. Random effects meta-analyses assessed the average change in outcomes (depression, anxiety, relationship quality, social adjustment, and social support) from pre- to post-treatment, the difference in the change in outcomes between treatment and comparison conditions, and the difference in prevalence of depressive episodes between treatment and comparison conditions. Study, intervention, and sample characteristics were evaluated as potential moderators of effect sizes. Results: In prevention studies, IPT was effective for reducing depressive symptoms and the prevalence of depressive episodes. In treatment studies, IPT reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety and improved relationship quality, social adjustment and social support. Few significant moderators were identified, and results of moderation analyses were inconsistent across outcomes. Limitations: There are insufficient studies to evaluate the effects of preventive IPT on anxiety and interpersonal outcomes. Analyses of potential moderators were limited by the number of studies available for subgroup comparisons. Conclusions: IPT is an effective preventive intervention for perinatal depression. IPT is clearly effective for treating depressive symptoms and promising as a treatment for anxiety and improving interpersonal functioning. Further research is necessary to assess whether adaptations to IPT enhance its efficacy.

482,The influence of comorbid anxiety on the effectiveness of Cognitive Therapy and Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Anxious depression is an important subtype of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) defined by both syndromal (anxiety disorders) and dimensional (anxiety symptoms) criteria. A debated question is how anxiety affects MDD treatment. This study examined the impact of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms on the effectiveness of and dropout during Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for MDD. Methods: Depressed individuals were randomized to CT ( n = 76) or IPT ( n = 75). Outcome was depression severity measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at the start of each therapy session, post treatment, and monthly up to five months follow-up. Anxiety disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, (phobic) anxiety symptoms were assessed with Brief Symptom Inventory subscales. Results: Approximately one third of participants had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Comorbid anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms were associated with less favorable depression change during IPT as compared to CT in the treatment phase, but not in the trial follow-up phase. Individuals with a comorbid anxiety disorder had significantly higher treatment dropout during both treatments. Limitations: Not all therapists and participants were blind to the assessment of comorbid anxiety disorders and the assessments were performed by one rater. Conclusions: A preference for CT over IPT for MDD is justifiable when comorbid anxiety is present, although long-term differences are not established and replication of this finding is needed. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of dropout for depressed individuals with an anxiety disorder.

483,A systematic review of the association of anxiety with health care utilization and costs in people aged 65 years and older,"Theoretical background: In older people, anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders and a high proportion suffers from clinically relevant anxiety symptoms. Despite studies suggesting an association of anxiety with health care utilization (HCU) and a resulting economic burden to the health care system, we found no review systematically analyzing evidence on this association in older people. Objective: To analyze and synthesize evidence on the association of anxiety disorders and symptoms with HCU and costs in people aged 65 years and over in a systematic review. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature was conducted in three electronic databases. Additional references were identified through reference lists of included studies. Inclusion criteria were: studies reporting the association of anxiety disorders or symptoms with HCU or costs, specifically in people aged 65 years and over, with observational study design, in German or English language. Findings were synthesized qualitatively and study quality was assessed. Results: N = 15 studies (HCU n = 10, costs n = 5) were included in the final synthesis. Overall, studies either reported significantly increased HCU in anxiety disorders compared to a healthy comparison group/according to degree of symptoms, or found no significant association between these variables. Total excess costs for anxiety disorders ranged from -116 to 19,003 $PPP per year. Limitations: Differences in methodology limited the comparability of included studies. Conclusion: Most studies suggest an increased economic burden due to anxiety in older people. Studies using standardized instruments are needed.

484,Towards an evidence-based unified psychodynamic protocol for emotional disorders,"Background: In psychotherapy research unified, transdiagnostic and modular treatments have emerged. This is true for both cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Recently, two unified psychodynamic protocols were presented, one for anxiety disorders, another for depressive disorders. Integrating the treatment principles for these two highly prevalent disorder groups into one protocol for ""emotional disorders"" may be useful for both clinical practice and training in psychotherapy. Methods: After updating the evidence for psychodynamic therapy in anxiety and depressive disorders in terms of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by a systematic search, the treatment elements applied in those RCTs providing evidence for the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy in depressive or anxiety disorders were reviewed and compared. Results: Twenty-seven RCTs for anxiety or depressive disorders were identified. A review revealed a high overlap between the principles used for the psychodynamic treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, reflecting the transdiagnostic nature of psychodynamic therapy. The overlap suggested to integrate the identified treatment principles into one unified psychodynamic protocol for ""emotional disorders"" (UPP-EMO). As a result, seven treatment principles or modules were distilled which can be flexibly applied depending on the patient´s symptoms and needs. In addition, a separate module addresses diagnostic assessment. Across modules, a focus on resources has been included. Limitations: Despite being based on RCTs, UPP-EMO has not yet been examined in an RCT—which is planned as a next step. Conclusions: As psychodynamic therapy is transdiagnostic in origin focusing on core underlying processes of mental disorders, acceptability of UPP-EMO among psychodynamic psychotherapists is likely to be high.

485,"affron®, a standardised extract from saffron (Crocus sativus L.) for the treatment of youth anxiety and depressive symptoms: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study","Background: Saffron has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in adults with mild-to-moderate depression. However, this is the first study examining its mood-related effects in teenagers. Methods: In this 8-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, youth aged 12–16 years, with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depressive symptoms were given tablets containing placebo or a saffron extract (affron®, 14 mg b.i.d). The youth and parent versions of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) were used as outcome measures. Results: 80 participants were enrolled and 68 completed the study. Based on youth self-reports, affron® was associated with greater improvements in overall internalising symptoms (p = 0.049), separation anxiety (p = 0.003), social phobia (p = 0.023), and depression (p = 0.016). Total internalising scores decreased by an average of 33% compared to 17% in the placebo group (p = 0.029). However, parental reports of improvements were inconsistent as mean improvements in RCADS scores were greater in the saffron group (40% vs 26%) (p = 0.026), although no other significant differences were identified. affron® was well-tolerated and there was a trend of reduced headaches in participants on the active treatment. Limitations: The use of a self-report instrument, limited study duration, single treatment dose, and non-clinical sample used in this study limit the generalisability of study findings. Conclusion: The administration of a standardised saffron extract (affron®) for 8 weeks improved anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth with mild-to-moderate symptoms, at least from the perspective of the adolescent. However, these beneficial effects were inconsistently corroborated by parents.

486,"Course, risk factors, and mental health outcomes of excessive daytime sleepiness in rural Chinese adolescents: A one-year prospective study","Background: This study aimed to examine the one-year incidence and persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in rural Chinese adolescents and their risk factors. In addition, we also aimed to explore the potential bidirectional associations of EDS with anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 3736 adolescents from 5 high schools from rural area in the south China were eligible for follow-up. Among them, 2787 responded to follow-up after one year. EDS was defined as having a total score of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale over 10. Results: The one-year persistence rate and incidence rate of EDS were 27.6% and 9.3%, respectively. After controlling for age and sex, new incident EDS was significantly associated with perceived high study stress, depressive symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and high life events at baseline. Baseline EDS predicted new onsets of depression and anxiety at follow-up. Cross-lagged analyses further revealed that there were bidirectional associations between EDS and anxiety symptom and between EDS and depressive symptoms. Persistent EDS was only associated with eveningness chronotype. In particular, short sleep duration and obesity were associated with neither new incidence nor persistence of EDS in this population. Limitations: All measures relied on self-reported questionnaires rather than objective assessments, which might have led to report bias. Conclusions: We have identified a number of risk factors of the one-year incidence of EDS (such as perceived high study stress, depressive symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and high life events) and persistence of EDS (eveningness chronotype) in rural adolescents. There is a reciprocal relationship of EDS with anxiety and depression. In this population, sleep loss and obesity seem not related to the course of EDS.

487,Exploring the pathway from anxiety sensitivity intervention to suicide risk reduction: Chained mediation through anxiety and depressive symptoms,"Background: The suicide rate in the Unites States continues to increase suggesting novel intervention strategies are needed. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a suicide risk factor that can be ameliorated via a single-session, computerized intervention called the Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST). Results from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that reductions in suicidal ideation (SI) due to CAST were mediated by AS reductions. However, a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms of SI reduction due to AS interventions is needed to further our understanding of theoretical models of AS and suicide, and to refine AS treatments. Methods: Participants ( N = 74) with co-occurring anxiety pathology and SI were randomized to a single-session computerized treatment (CAST + cognitive bias modification) or a control intervention. Assessments were conducted immediately post treatment, and at 1 month and 4 month follow-ups. Results: Chained mediation models revealed significant reductions in SI (month 4 follow-up) through AS (post-treatment) and subsequently anxiety symptoms (month 1 follow-up), but not depressive symptoms. There were no direct mediation effects through either AS or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include self-report assessment of symptoms, a sample of only individuals with a diagnosed anxiety pathology, and exploratory nature of anxiety/depression dimension analyses. Conclusions: Results of the current study help clarify the mechanistic pathways of SI reduction due to an AS intervention, and suggest future work attempting to increase the efficacy of AS interventions should consider the potentially important role of downstream mechanisms that follow AS reduction.

488,Unique trajectories of anxiety among Chinese-Canadian women across the first postpartum year: A longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Our objectives were to identify subtypes of Chinese-Canadian women with unique trajectories of anxiety symptomatology over the first postpartum year, investigate covariates associated with group membership, and determine if mental healthcare utilization varies by group membership. Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study of 570 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto, Canada with live births in 2010–2014. Covariates were age, immigrant status, income, fatigue, social support, acculturative stress, and depression. Mental healthcare utilization included visits at 4–24 weeks postpartum. Anxiety symptomatology was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify latent classes corresponding to trajectories of anxiety symptomology at 4–52 weeks. Results: Three groups were identified: “consistently non-anxious” (74%, stable low levels of anxiety), “consistently anxious” (19.5%, clinically meaningful anxiety at baseline and across time), and “anxious-improving” (6.5%, high anxiety at baseline followed by decline). Compared to consistently non-anxious women, consistently anxious women were more likely to report baseline fatigue, depression, and acculturative stress; anxious-improving women were more likely to report baseline fatigue, depression, and history of depression before pregnancy. At 12–24 weeks, 13.8% of anxious-improving women sought mental healthcare compared to 8.6% of consistently-anxious women and 4.7% of non-anxious women (p = .06). Limitations: Our sample comprised Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women; results should be replicated in other groups. Conclusions: We identified three subtypes of postpartum anxiety trajectories. These groups of women may respond differently to interventions due to exposure to various combinations of risk factors.

489,Social and academic functioning in adolescents with anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent during adolescence. Although literature points out that anxiety symptoms are related to problems in social and academic functioning, the extent of these problems among adolescents with clinical anxiety disorders has not been systematically reviewed before. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to October 2017, with keywords representing anxiety disorders, adolescents, and social or academic functioning. The inclusion criteria were studies with a sample of adolescents (10–19 years) with anxiety disorders that provided data regarding their social or academic functioning. 3431 studies were examined, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Adolescents with anxiety disorders had a lower social competence relative to their healthy peers. They reported more negativity within interpersonal relationships, higher levels of loneliness, and victimization. Most adolescents with anxiety disorders felt impaired at school, however, findings of their average school results, compared to peers, were mixed. In addition, they had a higher risk for school refusal and entered higher education less often. Impairments in social and academic functioning differed across type and the number of anxiety disorders. Limitations: Most studies examined social phobia or anxiety disorders in general and methodological approaches varied widely between studies. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that adolescents with anxiety disorders experience a range of significant problems in both social and academic functioning. These findings suggest that the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescence should focus on improving functioning across domains.

490,Do clinically anxious children cluster according to their expression of factors that maintain child anxiety?,"Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, yet a significant proportion of children do not benefit from it. CBT for child anxiety disorders typically includes a range of strategies that may not all be applicable for all affected children. This study explored whether there are distinct subgroups of children with anxiety disorders who are characterized by their responses to measures of the key mechanisms that are targeted in CBT (i.e. interpretation bias, perceived control, avoidance, physiological arousal, and social communication). Methods: 379 clinically anxious children (7–12 years) provided indices of threat interpretation, perceived control, expected negative emotions and avoidance and measures of heart rate recovery following a speech task. Parents also reported on their children's social communication difficulties using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Results: Latent profile analysis identified three groups, reflecting (i) ‘Typically anxious’ (the majority of the sample and more likely to have Generalized anxiety disorder); (ii) ‘social difficulties’ (characterized by high SCQ and more likely to have social anxiety disorder and be male); (iii) ‘Avoidant’ (characterized by low threat interpretation but high avoidance and low perceived control). Limitations: Some measures may have been influenced by confounding variables (e.g. physical variability in heart rate recovery). Sample characteristics of the group may limit the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Clinically anxious children appear to fall in to subgroups that might benefit from more targeted treatments that focus on specific maintenance factors. Treatment studies are now required to establish whether this approach would lead to more effective and efficient treatments.

491,Neurobiology of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in GAD: Aberrant neurometabolic correlation to hippocampus and relationship to anxiety sensitivity and IQ,"Introduction: The neurometabolism underlying the cognitive and affective symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) remain poorly understood. After we have linked worry to intelligence in patients with GAD, we hypothesized that aberrant neurometabolic correlations between hippocampus and neocortical regions may underlie a shared substrate in GAD patients for both anxiety sensitivity and intelligence. Methods: GAD patients (n = 16; F = 11) and healthy volunteers (n = 16; F = 10) were assessed using 1H-MRSI. Co-axial planes I [hippocampus (HIPP)] and co-axial plane III [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), central gyrus (CG)] were examined. Using general linear models, we examined resting metabolite concentrations using HIPP as a hub to CG and DLPFC. Neocortical ROIs were related to Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) in GAD patients versus controls. Results: Right hippocampal Cho/Cr directly predicted left DLPFC Cho/Cr in GAD (r = 0.75), an effect distinguishable (p = 0.0004) from controls. Left HIPP Cho/Cr positively predicted left CG Cho/Cr in GAD, an effect distinguishable from controls. In patients, both left and right DLPFC Cho/Cr positively predicted ASI but only left DLPFC Cho/Cr inversely predicted IQ. By contrast, IQ in controls correlated directly with left CG Cho/Cr. Limitations: Small sample size precluded us from investigating how gender and FSIQ subscales related to neurochemical correlations in the ROIs examined. Conclusions: Aberrant resting state neurochemical correlation between left DLPFC and right HIPP may contribute to GAD symptomatology. Unlike controls, in GAD, IQ and worry may share a common yet inverse neurometabolic substrate in left DLPFC.

492,The regional homogeneity of cingulate-precuneus regions: The putative biomarker for depression and anxiety,"Objectives: In addition to clinical interview, the modern putative biomarker to differentiate depression and anxiety would be warranted. The translational medicine characteristics of neuroimaging, such as the regional homogeneity (ReHo), is an option for depression and anxiety. Therefore we designed this study trying to identify the biomarker pattern for depression and anxiety. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired for 53 patients with first-episode medicine-naïve major depressive disorder (MDD), 53 first-episode medicine-naïve patients with panic disorder (PD) and 54 controls. The calculation of ReHo was performed. The ANOVA repeated measures were applied for the 3 groups to investigate the putative differences between MDD and PD (FDR corrected p &lt; 0.05). Results: After multiple comparisons, the major findings of ReHo were found in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral precuneus. MDD group had lower ReHo values than PD group in the left anterior cingulate cortex. MDD group had significant alterations of ReHo in the left anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral precuneus when compared to controls. PD group had alterations in the bilateral precuneus when compared to controls. Conclusion: The specific cingulate alterations might be a putative ReHo biomarker to differentiate MDD from PD in cingulate-precuneus background for ReHo alterations.

493,Mapping network connectivity among symptoms of social anxiety and comorbid depression in people with social anxiety disorder,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and depressive symptoms often covary. Yet, uncertainty still abounds vis-à-vis the individual symptom-to-symptom associations between these two disorders. Inspired by the network approach to psychopathology that conceptualizes comorbidity as a natural consequence arising from bridge symptoms that can transmit activation from one disorder to the other, we applied network analytic methods to characterize the associations among core symptoms of SAD—i.e. fear and avoidance of social situations—and comorbid depressive symptoms among 174 individuals with DSM-IV-TR criteria for SAD. Methods: We first explored the general structure of these symptoms by estimating a regularized partial correlation network using the graphical LASSO algorithm. Then, we specifically focused on the symptoms’ importance and influence. Of critical interest was the estimation of the unique influence of each symptom from one disorder to all symptoms of the other disorder using a new metric called bridge expected influence. Results: The graphical LASSO revealed several cross-associations between SAD and comorbid depression. For each disorder, symptoms exhibiting the strongest cross-association with the other disorder were identified. Limitations: Given our cross-sectional data, our findings can only suggest hypotheses about cause-effect relationships. Conclusions: This study adds to a small but growing empirical literature revealing that the co-occurrence between two disorders is best portrayed as sets of symptom-to-symptom connections. As some individual symptoms show differential association in the co-occurrence between SAD and depression, those symptoms may be valuable targets for future research and treatment.

494,Evaluation of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in screening stroke patients for symptoms: Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis,"Background: Variations have been reported in the number of underlying constructs and choice of thresholds that determine caseness of anxiety and /or depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). This study examined the properties of each item of HADS as perceived by stroke patients, and assessed the information these items convey about anxiety and depression between 3 months to 5 years after stroke. Methods: The study included 1443 stroke patients from the South London Stroke Register (SLSR). The dimensionality of HADS was examined using factor analysis methods, and items’ properties up to 5 years after stroke were tested using Item Response Theory (IRT) methods, including graded response models (GRMs). Results: The presence of two dimensions of HADS (anxiety and depression) for stroke patients was confirmed. Items that accurately inferred about the severity of anxiety and depression, and offered good discrimination of caseness were identified as “I can laugh and see the funny side of things” (Q4) and “I get sudden feelings of panic” (Q13), discrimination 2.44 (se = 0.26), and 3.34 (se = 0.35), respectively. Items that shared properties, hence replicate inference were: “I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen” (Q3), “I get a sort of frightened feeling like butterflies in my stomach” (Q6), and “Worrying thoughts go through my mind” (Q9). Item properties were maintained over time. Limitations: Approximately 20% of patients were lost to follow up. Conclusion: A more concise selection of items based on their properties, would provide a precise approach for screening patients and for an optimal allocation of patients into clinical trials.

495,Parental bonding and adolescents’ depressive and anxious symptoms in Pakistan,"Introduction: A quantitative cross sectional study was carried out to investigate the role of parental bonding in relation to depressive and anxious symptoms among secondary school adolescents in Pakistan. The study also aimed to investigate the construct validity of the parental bonding inventory in the cultural context of Pakistan. Methods: The sample consisted of 1124 adolescents recruited from eight secondary schools in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Urdu translated versions of Parental Bonding Instrument (Qadir et al., 2005) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (Mumford et al., 1991) were administered in classroom settings. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. Results: Results from the CFA of the Urdu version of the Parental Bonding Instrument supported a modified version of the three factor model proposed by Kendler (1996) consisting of warmth, protectiveness and authoritarianism. Based on SEM, we found a significant relationship between low parental warmth and depression symptoms among adolescents, whereas maternal protectiveness was a significant predictor for anxiety. Parental authoritarianism was not a significant predictor for depression or anxiety. Discussion: Findings of this study indicate that parental bonding is a central construct within a developmental framework in the cultural context of Pakistan, and is important when considering long-term psychosocial functioning of individuals. It should be explored further in clinical populations of Pakistani adolescents to ascertain significance of these constructs for interventions.

496,Specificity in mediated pathways by anxiety symptoms linking adolescent stress profiles to depressive symptoms: Results of a moderated mediation approach,"Background: We investigated the specificity in mediated pathways that separately link specific stress dimensions through anxiety to depressive symptoms and the protective utility of resilience. Thus, this study goes beyond lumping together potential mediating and moderating processes that can explain the relations between stress and (symptoms of) psychopathology and the buffering effect of resilience. Methods: Ghanaian adolescents between 13 and 17 years (female = 285; male = 244) completed the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ). Independent samples t -test, multivariate analysis of covariance with follow-up tests and moderated mediation analyses were performed. Results: Evidences were found for specificity in the associations between dimensions of adolescent stressors and depressive symptoms independent of transient anxiety. Transient anxiety partly accounted for the indirect effects of eight stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Except stress of school attendance and school/leisure conflict, resilience moderated the indirect effects of specific stress dimensions on depressive symptoms. Results suggested differences in how Ghanaian adolescents view the various stress dimensions, and mediated pathways associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Use of cross-sectional data does not show causal process and temporal changes over time. Conclusions: Findings support and clarify the specificity in the interrelations and mediated pathways among dimensions of adolescent stress, transient anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Conditional process analyses shows that resilience does not only buffer direct, but also indirect psychological adversities. Interventions for good mental health may focus on low resilience subgroups in specific stress dimensions while minimizing transient anxiety.

497,"Incidence, recurrence and comorbidity of anxiety disorders in four major developmental stages","Background: Anxiety disorders are common in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and frequently comorbid with other mental disorders. Objective: The main aim of the present study was to examine the incidence, recurrence and comorbidity rates of anxiety disorders across four developmental periods, namely, during childhood (5– 12.9 years), adolescence (13–17.9 years), emerging adulthood (18–23.9 years), and adulthood (24–30 years). Method: Eight hundred and sixteen participants from a large community sample were interviewed twice during adolescence, at age 24, and at age 30. They completed self-report measures of psychosocial functioning and semi-structured diagnostic interviews during adolescence and adulthood. Results: The result showed first incidence of anxiety disorders to be significantly higher in childhood and adulthood than in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Female gender was associated with first incidence, but not with recurrence. Significant comorbidity was found between anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD) across the four developmental periods. The comorbidity between anxiety and substance use disorders (SUD) was significant in childhood, emerging adulthood and adulthood, but not in adolescence. The presence of anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence significantly increased the probability of having an anxiety disorder during emerging adulthood. Limitations: The participants are ethically and geographically homogenous. Conclusion: Incidence and recurrence rates of anxiety disorders differed across four diverse developmental periods. The magnitude of comorbidity between anxiety disorders and MDD was comparable across periods.

498,Delta-beta correlation as a candidate endophenotype of social anxiety: A two-generation family study,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an extreme and intense fear and avoidance of social situations. In this two-generation family study we examined delta-beta correlation during a social performance task as candidate endophenotype of SAD. Methods: Nine families with a target participant (diagnosed with SAD), their spouse and children, as well as target's siblings with spouse and children performed a social performance task in which they gave a speech in front of a camera. EEG was measured during resting state, anticipation, and recovery. Our analyses focused on two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation within families and heritability. Results: Co-segregation analyses revealed increased negative delta-low beta correlation during anticipation in participants with (sub)clinical SAD compared to participants without (sub)clinical SAD. Heritability analyses revealed that delta-low beta and delta-high beta correlation during anticipation were heritable. Delta-beta correlation did not differ between participants with and without (sub)clinical SAD during resting state or recovery, nor between participants with and without SAD during all phases of the task. Limitations: It should be noted that participants were seen only once, they all performed the EEG tasks in the same order, and some participants were too anxious to give a speech. Conclusions: Delta-low beta correlation during anticipation of giving a speech might be a candidate endophenotype of SAD, possibly reflecting increased crosstalk between cortical and subcortical regions. If validated as endophenotype, delta-beta correlation during anticipation could be useful in studying the genetic basis, as well as improving treatment and early detection of persons at risk for developing SAD.

499,Patterns of change in anxiety and depression during pregnancy predict preterm birth,"Background: To determine whether changes in anxiety and depression during pregnancy influence the risk of having a preterm birth (PTB), and whether chronic stress modifies this relationship. Methods: The data source for the current study is the All Our Babies prospective cohort (AOB). Anxiety and depression were measured at 17–24 weeks and again at 32–36 weeks’ gestation using the Spielberg State Anxiety Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, respectively. Chronic stress was assessed at 17–24 weeks’ gestation as a potential covariate, and was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to assess each relationship Results: Women who experienced an increase in anxiety scores, (time point 32–36 weeks, compared to the earlier time point 17–24 weeks), had 2.70 times higher odds of preterm delivery, compared to those with a reduction in anxiety scores (95% CI 1.28, 5.69). Consistent low or high depression scores did not significantly influence the odds of PTB compared to a decrease in depression scores. A co-occurring increase in anxiety and depression scores was not found to increase the risk of PTB, and chronic stress did not modify any of these relationships. Limitations: This study was limited by a relatively small sample of women who delivered preterm, and therefore it was not possible to conduct additional analyses. Further, the analyses were limited to mostly late preterm infants (32–36 weeks’ gestation). Conclusions: These findings should be validated with additional cohorts and a larger sample size. Ultimately, primary prevention could address anxiety during pregnancy.

500,"The prevalence, reporting, and treatment of anxiety among older adults in nursing homes and other residential aged care facilities","Background: Little is known about anxiety in aged care populations, despite its increase in this frail population. This study investigated the prevalence, recording, and treatment rate of anxiety disorders among aged care residents. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational design was used to assess 180 elderly residents from 12 aged care facilities in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were assessed for threshold and subthreshold anxiety disorders and comorbid depression using the MINI for DSM-5. Medical files were also reviewed to determine whether there was any indication that anxiety had previously been detected, and what treatment those with a threshold/ subthreshold diagnosis were receiving. Results: Overall prevalence of threshold and subthreshold anxiety disorders was 19.4% and 11.7%, respectively. Generalized anxiety disorder was the most common threshold disorder and agoraphobia was the most prevalent subthreshold anxiety disorder. While less than half of those with a threshold or subthreshold anxiety disorder had an indication of anxiety in their file, the majority received psychotropic medication. Cognitive impairment was not significantly associated with the prevalence or treatment of anxiety. Conclusions: The prevalence of threshold and subthreshold anxiety in aged care settings is high, but remains under-reported by staff and GPs. Facility staff and GPs should ensure they are aware of how anxiety presents in elderly residents and routinely screen for this common mental health issue. This cohort had poor access to psychological treatments for their condition.

501,Worry amplifies theory-of-mind reasoning for negatively valenced social stimuli in generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Theory-of-mind (ToM) is the ability to accurately infer others’ thoughts and feelings. In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), cognitive and emotion regulation theories allude to the plausibility that ToM is conditional on the degree of individuals’ state worry, a hallmark symptom. GAD and state worry may interact to predict ToM constructs. However, no experiments have directly tested such interactional hypotheses, and used ToM as a framework to advance understanding of social cognition in GAD. This study therefore aimed to address this gap. Methods: 171 participants (69 GAD, 102 Controls) were randomly assigned to either a Worry or Relaxation induction and completed well-validated ToM decoding (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test) and reasoning (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition) tasks. Results: GAD status significantly interacted with state worry to predict accuracy of overall reasoning, cognitive-reasoning, positive-reasoning, and negative-reasoning ToM. Worry, as opposed to relaxation, led sufferers of GAD to display more accurate overall reasoning and cognitive-reasoning ToM than controls, especially for negative signals. Participants with GAD who worried, but not relaxed, were also significantly better than the norm at interpreting negative signals. These findings remained after controlling for gender, executive function, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms. For other ToM abilities, mean scores of persons with and without GAD who either worried or relaxed were normative. Limitations: The ToM reasoning measure lacked self-reference, and these preliminary findings warrant replication. Conclusions: Theoretical implications, such as the state worry-contingent nature of ToM in GAD, and clinical implications are discussed.

502,"Test anxiety effects, predictors, and correlates: A 30-year meta-analytic review","Background and objectives: Since the 1988 publication of Hembree's seminal meta-analysis on test anxiety, much has changed in the theoretical conceptualization of test anxiety, as well as the influences on test performance. The present study examined the influence of test anxiety on a variety of educational outcomes, in addition to demographic and intrapersonal correlates. Design and methods: Results of 238 studies from 1988 to the present, were synthesized via a meta-analytic framework to explicate predictors, correlates, and relationships with the test anxiety construct. Pooled effect sizes were calculated. Results: Results indicated that test anxiety was significantly and negatively related to a wide range of educational performance outcomes, including standardized tests, university entrance exams, and grade point average. Results were most pronounced at the middle grades level. Self-esteem was a significant and strong predictor of test anxiety. Perceived difficulty of the test and the high-stakes nature or consequences of the test was also related to higher test anxiety. Conclusions: The magnitude of the relationship of test anxiety across a number of variables was in the small to moderate range. Implications for researchers and educators are discussed including the use of evidence-based assessment and interventions when warranted.

503,Determinants of comorbid depression and anxiety postnatally: A longitudinal cohort study of Chinese-Canadian women,"Background: Women with comorbid depression and anxiety in the postpartum period experience more complex and severe symptoms than women with depression or anxiety alone; however, little is known about what influences these symptoms, especially among women from specific ethnic backgrounds. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of comorbid depression and anxiety symptomatology by 24 weeks postpartum in a cohort of Chinese-Canadian women. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was completed where 549 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto were followed to 24 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires included risk factors measured at 4 weeks. Logistic regression was used to develop a model of comorbidity (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score &gt; 9; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score &gt; 40) up to and including 24 weeks. Results: Previous history of postpartum (AOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42–4.14) and non-postpartum (AOR 4.20, 95% CI 2.21–7.98) depression, maternal age&lt; 26 years (AOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04–3.22), perception of support (AOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–1.00), acculturative stress (AOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04), maternal fatigue (AOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.17), and perceived infant sleep problems (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.27–3.43) were significantly associated with comorbid depression and anxiety in the first 24 weeks postpartum. Limitations: Our sample consisted of Chinese-Canadian women; this study should be replicated in other ethnic groups to see if and how risk factors of postpartum comorbidity differ. Conclusion: The factors identified herein offer insight into groups of Chinese-Canadian women who might benefit most from early identification and treatment and suggest targets for prevention.

504,Association of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with suicidal behaviors,"Background: Suicidal behaviors are strong predictors of suicide death and are much more common than completed suicides. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and transitions of suicidal behaviors in an Inner Mongolian City of China and to explore the association of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with suicidal behaviors. Method: This study was a cross-sectional study. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview-3.0 (CIDI-3.0) was administered face-to-face to make diagnoses of mental disorders, measure suicidal behaviors and collect social demographic information. Results: A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt were 1.52%, 0.70% and 0.54%, respectively. Among those respondents with suicidal ideation, 21.1% of them had planned suicide attempt, and 6.6% had unplanned suicide attempt. When comorbidity was not considered in the model, mood and anxiety disorders were the most important drivers of suicidal behaviors. However, when including the comorbidity, those respondents with mood and anxiety disorders, rather than those with a specific disorder only, had a significant positive association with suicidal behaviors. In the model, being unemployed, rural, female, no income and childhood adversities were also related to suicidal behaviors. Limitations: There might be systematic recall bias as the data were based on retrospective self-reports. Suicide is a sensitive question, so the respondents were probably ashamed to talk about suicidal behaviors. Conclusions: The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders was the most important risk factor of suicidal behaviors. Special attention should be paid to those patients with this comorbidity.

505,Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression,"Background: Anxiety symptoms are common in bipolar disorder. We explored the effect of anxiety on the outcome of acute and continuation pharmacotherapy of bipolar II depression. Methods: Data were derived from a randomized double-blind 12-week acute (N = 129) and 6-month continuation (N = 55) comparison of venlafaxine versus lithium monotherapy in bipolar II depression in adults. We distinguished between the items of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) that capture depression vs. anxiety (i.e., psychomotor agitation, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-compulsive concerns) and examined the effect of treatment on depression and anxiety. Additionally, we explored whether baseline anxiety or depression predicted changes over time in depression and anxiety ratings or moderated treatment outcomes. We also explored whether residual depressive and anxious symptoms predicted relapse during continuation therapy. Results: Venlafaxine was superior to lithium in reducing both depression and anxiety, though its effects on anxiety were more modest than those on depression. Baseline anxiety predicted change over time in anxiety, but not depression. By contrast, baseline depression did not predict change over time in depression or anxiety. Residual anxiety, specifically uncontrollable worry, was a stronger predictor of relapse than residual depression. Conclusion: Successful treatment of symptoms of anxiety in bipolar depression may protect against depressive relapse.

506,Offspring of depressed and anxious patients: Help-seeking after first onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder,"Background: Offspring of patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders are at high risk of developing a similar disorder themselves. Early recognition and treatment may have substantial effects on prognosis. The main aim of this study was to examine the time to initial help-seeking and its determinants in offspring after the first onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder. Methods: Data are presented of 215 offspring with a mood and/or anxiety disorder participating in a cohort study with 10 year follow-up. We determined age of disorder onset and age of initial help-seeking. Offspring characteristics (gender, IQ, age of onset, disorder type, suicidal ideation) and family characteristics (socioeconomic status, family functioning) were investigated as potential predictors of the time to initial help-seeking. Results: The estimated overall proportion of offspring of depressed/anxious patients who eventually seek help after onset of a mood and/or anxiety disorder was 91.9%. The time to initial help-seeking was more than two years in 39.6% of the offspring. Being female, having a mood disorder or comorbid mood and anxiety disorder (relative to anxiety) and a disorder onset in adolescence or adulthood (relative to childhood) predicted a shorter time to initial help-seeking. Limitations: Baseline information relied on retrospective reports. Age of onsets and age of initial help-seeking may therefore be subject to recall bias. Conclusion: Although most offspring eventually seek help after onset of a mood/anxiety disorder, delays in help seeking were common, especially in specific subgroups of patients. This information may help to develop targeted strategies to reduce help-seeking delays.

507,Predictors and outcomes of somatization in bipolar I disorder: A latent class mixture modeling approach,"Background: Mood disorders are often associated with somatic symptoms. The role of somatic symptoms on disease progression in unipolar depression is substantially better characterized than that role in bipolar disorder. Moreover, the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders and medical illness is not well understood. Method: We investigated 527 patients with bipolar I disorder clustered within 102 families using a latent class approach. Predictors were added stepwise into the model. Anxiety and commonly associated medical illnesses were added as covariates. Results: The rate of somatic symptoms in this sample was 73% (mean 1.7 symptoms), and 27.3% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. A two-class model, with a subgroup at high-risk for somatization, gave the best fit to the data. Multilevel mixture modeling accounted for family clusters. Somatic symptoms were independently associated with disease severity, defined as earlier age of first seeking psychiatric help (x = 21.7 vs x = 24.7, p = 0.005) and first psychiatric hospitalization (x = 25.7 vs x = 28.2, p = 0.03), greater probability of attempting suicide (x = 0.41 vs x = 0.32, p = 0.047), and rapid-cycling disease course (x =0.57 vs x = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001). Persons with few or no somatic symptoms were more likely to be hospitalized for severe mania (x = 0.63 vs x = 0.51; p = 0.013), but did not significantly differ in hospitalization for severe depression. Limitations: The study is correlational. Information on pharmacologic interventions and comorbid diseases was limited. Conclusions: Somatic symptoms in bipolar disorder could be an independent indicator for disease severity, suicidality, and rapid-cycling disease course. In severe mental illness, somatic and psychological symptoms must be jointly addressed.

508,Dorsomedial frontal cortical metabolic differences of comorbid generalized anxiety disorder in refractory major depression: A [¹⁸F] FDG PET brain imaging study,"Background: Refractory major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder, chronic and difficult to treat. Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is frequently observed as a comorbid diagnosis, little is known on the comorbid neurobiological substrate. Better insights may improve adequate treatment algorithms. Objective: To examine this poorly understood clinical question, we recruited 52 individuals to participate in a [¹⁸F] FDG PET brain imaging study. Methods: Twenty-two refractory MDD patients were diagnosed with and 15 refractory MDD patients without comorbid GAD. To compare to the none-depressed state a sample of 15 age and gender matched never-depressed individuals were included. Results: Compared to healthy control subjects, all patients showed significantly higher metabolic activity in the bilateral parahippocampal areas. Compared to MDD patients, healthy subjects displayed significant higher metabolic activity in distinct (bi)frontotemporal and parietal cortices. Refractory MDD patients without comorbid GAD showed significant higher metabolic activity in the dorsomedial parts of the frontal cortex (dmFC). Conclusions: The impaired dmFC metabolic activity observed in comorbid GAD within refractory MDD may be indicative of specific emotional dysfunctional top-down processing in this subgroup, conform the anxiety state. Additional psychotherapeutic interventions may be warranted.

509,"Saffron in the treatment of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders: Current evidence and potential mechanisms of action","Background: Depression and anxiety are two common mental health problems with high economic and social costs. Currently, a number of treatments are available for patients with depression and anxiety disorders such as psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy and antidepressant drugs. Due to safety concerns, adverse effects, limited efficacy and low tolerability associated with many antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, identification of novel agents with less toxicity and more favorable outcome is warranted. Methods: The current article provides a non-systematic review of the available in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence on the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of saffron and its active ingredients in the treatment of anxiety, depression and other mental disorders. Results: Several interesting data have been reported about the antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties of saffron, the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., in several preclinical and clinical studies. In particular, a number of clinical trials demonstrated that saffron and its active constituents possess antidepressant properties similar to those of current antidepressant medications such as fluoxetine, imipramine and citalopram, but with fewer reported side effects. Conclusion: Saffron may exert antidepressant effects and represents an efficacious and safe treatment.

Stressful life events are an important research focus and a psychometrically valid measure could provide useful clinical information. The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable and valid measurement of stressful life events and to assess its reliability and validity using established measures of social support, stress, depression, anxiety and maternal and child health. Methods: The authors used an adaptation from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to describe the prevalence of life events; they developed a 4-factor stressful life events subscales and used Medical Outcomes Social Support Scale, Social Support Scale, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and 14 general health items for validity analysis. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Spearman's rho, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Results: The 4-factor stressful life events subscales showed acceptable reliability. The resulting subscale scores were significantly associated with established measures of social support, depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver health indicators. Limitations: The study presented a number of limitations in terms of design and recall bias. Conclusions: Despite the presence of a number of limitations, the study provided valuable insight and suggested that further investigation is needed in order to determine the effectiveness of the measures in revealing the family's wellbeing and to develop and strengthen a more detailed analysis of the stressful life events/health association.

511,Prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression in a nonclinical online sample with DSM-5 internet gaming disorder,"Background: We investigated the prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression among patients with internet gaming disorder using the Internet Gaming Disorder scale (IGD-9) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among nonclinical online survey respondents. Methods: Korean adolescents and adults from 14 to 39 years of age were selected. We compared internet gaming use patterns and sociodemographic and clinical variables between patients with internet gaming disorder who had depression and those without depression. Results: In 2016, 7200 people participated in an online survey. Respondents with internet gaming disorder that was comorbid with depression were older, more often female, had greater Internet Addiction Test total scores, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 total scores, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence total scores, and higher Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument dysfunctional subscale scores than those without depression. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender, problematic alcohol use, anxiety, and a past history of psychiatric counseling or treatment due to internet gaming use were significant predictors for comorbid depression among participants with internet gaming disorder. Conclusion: Depression was a common comorbidity of internet gaming disorder. Internet gaming disorder with comorbid depression was related to more serious psychiatric phenomenology and a greater psychiatric burden.

512,Video game play and anxiety during late adolescence: The moderating effects of gender and social context,"Background: Few studies have examined factors that moderate the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology in a sample of 441 11th and 12th grade students, while considering both gender and the social context (whether they played alone or with others). Methods: Participants (66% non-Hispanic White) were administered a survey (including measures of technology use and anxiety symptomatology) in school at baseline and one year later. Results: Both gender and the social context moderated the relationship between playing video games and anxiety symptomatology. Boys who played video games the most had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas girls who played video games the most had the highest levels of anxiety. This relationship was exacerbated in the context of playing with others. Limitations: Although the study has a number of strengths including the longitudinal design and the diverse sample, the study relied on self-report data. In addition, the sample was limited to adolescents residing in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Therefore, caution should be taken in regard to generalizing the results. Conclusions: Findings from this study underscore the need to consider both gender and the social context when examining the relationship between playing video games and adolescent psychological adjustment.

513,Quantitative genetic analysis of anxiety trait in bipolar disorder,"Background: Bipolar disorder type I (BPI) affects approximately 1% of the world population. Although genetic influences on bipolar disorder are well established, identification of genes that predispose to the illness has been difficult. Most genetic studies are based on categorical diagnosis. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is the use of quantitative endophenotypes, as has been done for other medical disorders. Methods: We studied 619 individuals, 568 participants from 61 extended families and 51 unrelated healthy controls. The sample was 55% female and had a mean age of 43.25 (SD 13.90; range 18–78). Heritability and genetic correlation of the trait scale from the Anxiety State and Trait Inventory (STAI) was computed by using the general linear model (SOLAR package software). Results: we observed that anxiety trait meets the following criteria for an endophenotype of bipolar disorder type I (BPI): 1) association with BPI (individuals with BPI showed the highest trait score (F = 15.20 [5,24], p = 0.009), 2) state-independence confirmed after conducting a test-retest in 321 subjects, 3) co-segregation within families 4) heritability of 0.70 (SE: 0.060), p = 2.33 × 10 –14 and 5) genetic correlation with BPI was 0.20, (SE = 0.17, p = 3.12 × 10 −5 ). Limitations: Confounding factors such as comorbid disorders and pharmacological treatment could affect the clinical relationship between BPI and anxiety trait. Further research is needed to evaluate if anxiety traits are specially related to BPI in comparison with other traits such as anger, attention or response inhibition deficit, pathological impulsivity or low self-directedness. Conclusions: Anxiety trait is a heritable phenotype that follows a normal distribution when measured not only in subjects with BPI but also in unrelated healthy controls. It could be used as an endophenotype in BPI for the identification of genomic regions with susceptibility genes for this disorder.

514,Peripheral proinflammatory cytokines in Chinese patients with generalised anxiety disorder,"Background: Inflammatory responses and inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of affective disorders, particularly major depression. Given the limited evidence relating to the potential role of proinflammatory cytokines in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), we aimed to examine peripheral proinflammatory cytokines in Chinese patients with GAD. Methods: A case-controlled cross-sectional study design, with recruitment of 48 patients with first episode GAD and 48 matched healthy controls. All participants completed measures of anxiety using well-established questionnaires, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured using multiplex technology. Results: Serum levels of CRP, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in the GAD group in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Pearson correlation revealed significant positive correlations between anxiety measures and serum levels of CRP, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF (p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: The cross-sectional study design does not permit definite conclusions on causal directions between inflammation and GAD. The study was limited to a panel of 8 cytokines and does not exclude the possibility of other important cytokines being involved. Conclusions: These findings indicate an elevated peripheral proinflammatory response, and provide further support for low grade inflammation in GAD. Further research may identify an ‘inflammatory signature’ for diagnosis and treatment response, and guide the search for novel pharmacological interventions.

515,Relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy to maternal sleep and mental well-being: The GUSTO cohort,"Background: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental wellbeing. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score &gt; 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 μmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 μmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation: Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions: We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.

516,Specificity and overlap of attention and memory biases in depression,"Background: Attentional and memory biases are viewed as crucial cognitive processes underlying symptoms of depression. However, it is still unclear whether these two biases are uniquely related to depression or whether they show substantial overlap. Methods: We investigated the degree of specificity and overlap of attentional and memory biases for depressotypic stimuli in relation to depression and anxiety by means of meta-analytic commonality analysis. By including four published studies, we considered a pool of 463 healthy and subclinically depressed individuals, different experimental paradigms, and different psychological measures. Results: Memory bias is reliably and strongly related to depression and, specifically, to symptoms of negative mood, worthlessness, feelings of failure, and pessimism. Memory bias for negative information was minimally related to anxiety. Moreover, neither attentional bias nor the overlap between attentional and memory biases were significantly related to depression. Limitations: Limitations include cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusions: Our study showed that, across different paradigms and psychological measures, memory bias (and not attentional bias) represents a primary mechanism in depression.

517,Binge eating behaviours in bipolar disorders,"Background: Recent research, especially from the USA, suggests that comorbid binge eating (BE) behaviour and BE disorder are frequent in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Although basic clinical associations between BD and BE have been investigated, less is known about psychological or temperamental dimensions and qualitative aspects of eating habits. In a French cohort of patients with BD, we investigated the prevalence of BE behaviour and any associations with illness characteristics, anxiety, impulsivity, emotional regulation and eating habits. Methods: 145 outpatients with BD (I and II) were assessed for the presence of BE behaviour using the Binge Eating Scale (BES). Characteristics identified in univariate analyses as differentiating BD cases with and without BE behaviour were then included in a backward stepwise logistic regression (BSLR) model. Results: In this sample, 18.6% of BD patients met criteria for BE behaviour. Multivariate analysis (BSLR) indicated that shorter duration of BD, and higher levels of anxiety and emotional reactivity were observed in BD with compared to BD without BE behaviour. Limitations: Relatively small sample referred to specialist BD clinics and cross-sectional evaluation meant that it was not possible to differentiate between state and trait levels of impulsivity, emotional instability and disinhibition. These dimensions may also overlap with mood symptoms. Conclusion: BE behaviour is common in females and males with BD. Emotional dysregulation and anxiety may represent important shared vulnerability factors for worse outcome of BD and increased likelihood of BE behaviour.

518,Prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression in Japanese women: A population-based longitudinal study,"Background: This study aimed to describe the prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression, via measures of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) total and factor scores, from 20 weeks’ gestation to 3 months postpartum, stratified by parity, in a Japanese female population. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at maternity facilities in Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan. Of the 1775 women who participated, 1311 women met the inclusion criteria of this analysis. All data, including EPDS, were collected via self-administrated questionnaires at 20 weeks’ gestation and at 5 time points postpartum, from the first few days to 3 months postpartum. We divided EPDS items into three factors: “anxiety,” “anhedonia,” and “depression,” according to factor analysis. Results: The prevalence of individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms, EPDS total score, and each factor score peaked at two weeks postpartum in primiparas (EPDS total = 5.58, anhedonia = 0.47, anxiety = 2.64, and depression = 1.23). In contrast, the EPDS total score and factor scores for “anxiety” and “depression” gradually decreased for multiparas, from the prenatal to postpartum period (EPDS total 3.33, 3.03, 3.03, 2.72, 2.76, and 2.37). Limitations: Each factor score was not weighted; instead, we simply added up the item scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each question. Additionally, the population representativeness of Japanese women was not high, although the sample was population-based and had a high follow-up rate. Conclusions: This study shows that the trends of EPDS total and factor scores differ by parity throughout the preand postnatal periods among a Japanese female population.

519,"The influence of alexithymia on mobile phone addiction: The role of depression, anxiety and stress","Background: Alexithymia is an important predictor of mobile phone addiction. Enhancing and improving college students’ mental health can reduce the rate of mobile phone addiction. However, it is not clear about the role of depression, anxiety and stress in the relationship between college students’ alexithymia and mobile phone addiction. Methods: A total of 1105 college students were tested with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Mobile Phone Addiction Index. Results: An individual’s level of alexithymia was significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, stress and mobile phone addiction. Alexithymia had a significantly positive prediction effect on mobile phone addiction, and depression, anxiety, and stress on mobile phone are positive predictors. Depression, anxiety or stress had partially mediating effects between alexithymia and mobile phone addiction. Alexithymia not only directly had a positively impact on mobile phone addiction, but both also had an indirect effect on mobile phone addiction through depression, anxiety or stress. Limitations: Limitations included sampling method and modest sample size, self-report measures, and unmeasured potential confounders. Conclusion: Alexithymia is an important correlate of mobile phone addiction, and depression, anxiety or stress is an important mediator in this relationship.

520,The effectiveness of adjunct mindfulness-based intervention in treatment of bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been increasingly used as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for a few psychiatric disorders. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of MBIs in bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of MBIs as an adjunctive treatment in BD. Major electronic databases were independently searched by two authors for controlled and uncontrolled studies which examined the effects of MBIs on psychiatric symptoms in subjects with BD. Data from original studies were synthesized by using a random effects model. Results: Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion into current meta-analysis, including three controlled studies (n=132) and nine uncontrolled studies (n = 142). In within-group analysis, MBIs significantly reduced depressive (7 studies, n = 100, Hedges’ g = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (4 studies, n = 68, Hedges’ g = 0.34, p = 0.043) symptoms, but not manic symptoms (6 studies, n = 89, Hedges’ g = 0.09, p = 0.488) and cognition (3 studies, n=43, Hedges’ g = 0.35, p = 0.171), compared to baseline. In between-group analysis (intervention group versus waiting list group, all patients with BD), MBIs did not reduce depressive (3 studies, n = 132, Hedges’ g = 0.46, p = 0.315) or anxiety (3 studies, n=132, Hedges’ g = 0.33, p = 0.578) symptoms. Limitations: Only three controlled trials compared MBIs to control conditions. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed significantly beneficial effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms of BD patients in within-group analysis. However, this significance was not observed in comparison with the control groups. Further clinical trials are warranted to investigate the differences in the benefits of MBIs between treatment and control subjects.

521,Anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment as predictors of outcome in bipolar disorder,"Background: Comorbid anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment have each been linked with unfavourable outcomes in people with bipolar disorder. Because childhood maltreatment is associated with anxiety disorders in this population, their respective predictive value remains to be determined. Methods: In 174 adults with bipolar disorder, we assessed childhood maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and lifetime anxiety disorders with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We constructed an overall index of severity of bipolar disorder as a sum of six indicators (unemployment, psychotic symptoms, more than five manic episodes, more than five depressive episodes, suicide attempt, and hospital admission). We tested the relationship between childhood maltreatment, the number of anxiety disorders and the overall severity index using ordered logistic regression. Results: The number of lifetime anxiety disorders was associated with the overall severity index (OR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.01–2.04, p = 0.047). This relationship was only slightly attenuated when controlled for childhood maltreatment (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.97–2.00, p = 0.069). The relationship between childhood maltreatment and the overall severity index was not statistically significant (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.92–1.74, p = 0.151). Secondary analyses revealed that childhood maltreatment was associated with suicide attempts (OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.15–2.51, p = 0.008) and obsessive compulsive disorder was associated with the overall severity index (OR = 9.56, 95%CI = 2.20–41.47, p = 0.003). Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study with a moderate-sized sample recruited from a specialist program. Conclusions: While comorbid anxiety disorders are associated with the overall severity of bipolar disorder, childhood maltreatment is specifically associated with suicide attempts. Clinicians should systematically assess both factors. Interventions to improve outcomes of people with bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment are needed.

522,"Intolerance of Uncertainty, anxiety, and worry in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis","Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been implicated in the development and maintenance of worry and anxiety in adults and there is an increasing interest in the role that IU may play in anxiety and worry in children and adolescents. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize existing research on IU with regard to anxiety and worry in young people, and to provide a context for considering future directions in this area of research. The systematic review yielded 31 studies that investigated the association of IU with either anxiety or worry in children and adolescents. Results: The meta-analysis showed that IU accounted for 36.00% of the variance in anxiety and 39.69% in worry. Due to the low number of studies and methodological factors, examination of potential moderators was limited; and of those we were able to examine, none were significant moderators of either association. Most studies relied on questionnaire measures of IU, anxiety, and worry; all studies except one were cross-sectional and the majority of the studies were with community samples. Limitations: The inclusion of eligible studies was limited to studies published in English that focus on typically developing children. Conclusions: There is a strong association between IU and both anxiety and worry in young people therefore IU may be a relevant construct to target in treatment. To extend the existing literature, future research should incorporate longitudinal and experimental designs, and include samples of young people who have a range of anxiety disorders.

523,Uric acid in major depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Uric acid has neuroprotective effects, owing to its antioxidant properties. Lowered antioxidant capacity, causing increased oxidative stress, may be involved in affective disorders and might be altered by antidepressants. This study investigated the association of plasma uric acid, the greatest contributor to blood antioxidant capacity, with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. Methods: Data were from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety including patients with current (N = 1648), remitted (N = 609) MDD and/or anxiety disorders (of which N = 710 antidepressant users) and 618 controls. Diagnoses were established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Symptom severity was assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Fear Questionnaire. Uric acid was measured in plasma. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, health and lifestyle variables. Results: Plasma uric acid adjusted mean levels were lower in current MDD and/or anxiety disorder(s) (289 μmol/l) compared to remitted disorders (298 μmol/l, p &lt; .001) and controls (299 μmol/l, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d .10). This finding was independent of antidepressant use. Depressive (β-.05, p = .0012), anxiety (β-.04, p = .009) and phobic (β-.03, p = .036) symptom severity, and symptom duration (β-.04, p = .009) were negatively associated with uric acid. Limitations: Limitations include the lack of data on dietary intake which could be a potential confounding factor. From these cross-sectional findings, the association between uric acid and psychopathology cannot be inferred to be causal. Conclusion: This large scale study finds plasma uric acid levels are lower in current, but not remitted, MDD and/or anxiety disorders, according to a dose-response gradient. This suggests the involvement of decreased antioxidant status in affective disorders, and points to their potential as an avenue for treatment.

524,Effects of traumatic experiences on obsessive-compulsive and internalizing symptoms: The role of avoidance and mindfulness,"Background: Trauma exposure is associated with adverse psychological outcomes including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Adolescence is increasingly recognized as a period of vulnerability for the onset of these types of psychological symptoms. The current study explored the mediating roles of experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes in the association between retrospective reports of childhood trauma and current internalizing and OC symptoms in adolescents. Method: A group of at-risk adolescents ( N = 51) and a group of college students ( N = 400) reported on childhood trauma, experiential avoidance, mindfulness, anxiety, depressive, and OC symptoms. Mediation analyses were performed to examine the mechanistic roles of avoidance and mindfulness in the association between trauma and internalizing and OC-specific symptoms. Results: In the group of at-risk adolescents, experiential avoidance and mindfulness both significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and OC symptoms. In the college student sample, experiential avoidance mediated the association between trauma and OC symptoms. Experiential avoidance, as well as the observe, act with awareness , and nonjudgmental facets of mindfulness all significantly mediated the association between trauma and internalizing symptoms. Limitations: The group of at-risk adolescents was small, and the college student group was demographically homogeneous. All data was self-report and cross-sectional. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes may be the mechanisms through which the association between trauma and obsessive-compulsive and trauma and internalizing symptoms exist in adolescents. These findings provide potential targets for clinical intervention to improve outcomes for adolescents who have experienced trauma.

268,Course of subthreshold depression into a depressive disorder and its risk factors,"Background: Information on the natural course of subthreshold depression and risk factors for the development of a full-blown depressive disorder in the general population is scarce. This information is crucial to understand the development of depression and to advance indicated depression prevention. Methods: Using longitudinal data from a representative population-based study (the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2) we assessed 3-year course of subthreshold depression (depressive symptoms causing clinically significant distress for at least 2 weeks, or for 3 days per month for a year; n = 120), compared to an asymptomatic group ( n = 4111) and a depressive disorder group (major depression or dysthymia; n = 294). Next, risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder among adults with subthreshold depression were determined. Results: Twelve percent of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder during 3-year follow-up. Risk factors were lower social support, having recurrent short episodes of depressive symptomatology, remitted and current anxiety disorder, remitted substance use disorder, lifetime suicide thoughts, a chronic physical disorder and diminished mental and physical functioning. Limitations: The number of subjects with subthreshold depression that developed a depressive disorder was small. This limits the possibility to detect significant risk factors. Conclusion: Only a minority of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder over three years. This shows that subthreshold depression does not, by itself, carry an a priori risk to warrant focusing indicated prevention. The identified risk factors could help to detect those subthreshold cases in whom depression prevention is economically and practically viable.

269,"Child maltreatment, psychopathological symptoms, and onset of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and COPD in adulthood","Background: The aim of this study was to assess the associations between child maltreatment (CM), psychopathological symptoms, and onset of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism (i.e., low metabolism), and chronic bronchitis/emphysema/COPD in adulthood. Methods: The present analysis used cross-sectional data collected in 2007–2008 within the Tromsø Study, Norway ( N = 12,981). CM was measured with a single item, and self-reported information on psychopathological symptoms and physical health outcomes was used. The associations between CM, psychopathological symptoms, and physical health outcomes were assessed with linear and Poisson regression models. Mediation was assessed with difference-in-coefficients method. Results: In the fully-adjusted models, CM was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, psychological distress, difficulty in sleeping, insomnia, and use of sleeping pills and antidepressants in adulthood ( p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, CM was associated with a more than two-folds increased risk of consultation with psychiatrist ( p &lt; 0.001), a 26% increased risk of forgetfulness ( p &lt; 0.001), a 15% increased risk of decline in memory ( p &lt; 0.001), and a 96% increased risk of psychiatric problems ( p &lt; 0.001) over the course of life. In the fully-adjusted models, CM was associated with a 27–82% increased risk of physical health outcomes in adulthood ( p &lt; 0.05). Indicators of psychopathological symptoms significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) mediate the associations between CM and physical health outcomes. Limitations: The design of this study is cross-sectional, and all measures are self-reported. Conclusion: The associations between retrospectively-reported CM and physical health outcomes in adulthood are partially driven by psychopathological symptoms in adulthood.

Y. Chan, Grace Y. Y. Sun, Wilson W. S. Tam, Kelvin K. F. Tsoi and Samuel Y. S. Wong ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2017[Jan][15], Vol 208, 345-354). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief of the Journal of Affective Disorders, as the choice of data analyzed was found to be inaccurate after updated data was provided by the authors, and this had a significant impact on the original article data and conclusions. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-60687-051). Background: Depression is a common mental health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Amongst various psychological treatments for depression, individual behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be effective and relatively simple in its delivery by health care providers although its effectiveness as a group based intervention requires further evidence. The objective of this study is to evaluate and update on the effectiveness of group-based BA to relieve symptoms of depression. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed and prospective randomized trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials comparing group-based BA intervention versus usual care or waitlist controls were included. Depressive symptom measured by various validated scales was the primary outcome. As the interventions can be heterogeneous across the included studies, all analyses were performed by random-effects model. Results: Seven randomized control trials were identified from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden and Iran from 2003 to 2013. A total of 240 subjects were randomly assigned to group-based BA, and all participants included met the criteria for moderate to severe depression at baseline with the majority of participants being females. Participants who joined the group-based BA showed lower depressive symptoms (MD of BDI-II: −6.06 (95% CI: −8.28 to −3.85 and MD of HRSD: −2.82 (95% CI: −4.62 to −1.02)) than participants randomized to the control group with usual treatment. The group-based BA also showed significant reduction in anxiety level (MD of BAI: −3.66 (95% CI: −6.11 to −1.22)) but not quality of life according to two studies. Risk of bias was evident amongst the studies as blinding of health providers and patients were not feasible in psychological studies. Conclusions: Group-based behavioral activation remains promising in relieving depressive symptoms for people with moderate to severe depression from this meta-analysis. Future studies should be higher quality research with larger sample size, longer follow-up periods, and synchronized clinical outcome measures. Patient feedback for group-based behavioral activation can also be further evaluated in order to ensure long term satisfaction and usage in health services.

271,"Medical and non-medical marijuana use in depression: Longitudinal associations with suicidal ideation, everyday functioning, and psychiatry service utilization","Background: Marijuana use is clinically problematic in depression, and non-medical and medical use may both contribute to barriers to care in this population. Among outpatients with depression, we examined the differential impact of medical or non-medical marijuana use, relative to no-use, on psychopathology and service use over time. Method: Participants were 307 psychiatry outpatients participating in a trial of drug/alcohol use treatment for depression. Measures of past 30-day marijuana use, depression/anxiety symptoms, psychiatry visits, and functional data related to health status were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Regressions (baseline and 1 year) and growth models (over time) predicted clinical and psychiatry visit outcomes, from medical or non-medical marijuana use (no-use = reference). Results: At baseline, 40.0% of the sample used marijuana and more reported non-medical (71.7%) than medical (28.2%) use. Relative to non-users at baseline, patients using medically had worse mental/physical health functioning ( p 's &lt; 0.05), and non-medical use was associated with higher suicidal ideation ( B = 1.08, p = .002), worse mental health functioning ( B = -3.79, p = .015), and fewer psychiatry visits ( B = -0.69, p = .009). Patients using non-medically over time improved less in depression symptoms ( B = 1.49, p = .026) and suicidal ideation ( B = 1.08, p = .003) than non-users. Limitations: Participants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Marijuana use, especially non-medical use, among patients with depression may impede depression symptom improvement while lessening the likelihood of psychiatry visits. Marijuana use and associated barriers to care should receive consideration by depression treatment providers.

In the original article, there were errors in Table 5 and in the abstract. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-26491-004). Background: Heterogeneity in the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may be explained by relatively stable individual psychological differences. Therefore, we studied multiple personality and coping traits using a person-centered approach, and examined the predictive value of this approach for patient-reported outcomes. Method: 657 CAD patients (age = 66.39 ± 10.6; 79% men) completed multiple self-report questionnaires focusing on demographics, negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS14), neuroticism and extraversion (EPQ), resilience (DRS-15), and coping styles (CISS) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and treatment adherence (MOS) were assessed at 6 months follow-up. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A step-3 latent class analysis identified four subgroup profiles: Low distress (31%), Passive coping (21%), Active coping (20%), and High distress (28%). For all patient-reported outcomes, overall significant differences between the subgroups were observed ( p- values &lt; .05). The High distress profile was associated with the highest levels of emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .94), and lowest levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02) and treatment adherence ( d = −2.75) at follow-up. Patients with an Active coping profile also experienced increased emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .50), but participated in cardiac rehabilitation most often ( d = .13), and reported high levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02). Patients with a Passive coping profile displayed few emotional problems after six months (d’s &lt; .30), but participation to cardiac rehabilitation was relatively low ( d = .04). Conclusions: This study revealed four distinct psychological latent subgroups, which were predictive of patient-reported outcomes. The results indicate that a person-centered approach is useful in explaining heterogeneity in recovery from PCI, and may enhance personalized medicine in patients with CAD.

273,Treatment of acute stress disorder for victims of violent crime,"Background: Victims of violent crime are at elevated risk of developing acute stress disorder (ASD) as well as subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both of which are linked to severe psychological distress. The aim of this 12-month prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy with a significant other (CBT-SO), relative to usual care (UC), for the improvement of post-traumatic, depression and anxiety symptoms and the prevention of PTSD among victims of violent crime with ASD. Methods: A total of 166 victims of violent crime with ASD were assigned to CBT (n = 54), CBT-SO (n = 52) or UC (n = 60). Self-report assessments and diagnostic interviews were completed at pre-treatment and post-treatment as well as at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Results: CBT and CBT-SO participants had fewer depression symptoms than those in the UC group up to 12 months post-event. Significantly fewer participants in the CBT condition met criteria for PTSD than in the UC group up to 12 months post-event. The CBT group did not differ from the CBT-SO group on any variable at any assessment time. Limitations: Findings must be interpreted in light of the quasi-experimental nature of the study and limitations concerning the management of missing data. Conclusions: Further research is warranted in order to assess whether more extensive involvement of a significant other in therapy may lead to better outcomes for victims of violent crime with ASD.

274,Bipolar features in major depressive disorder: Results from the Iranian mental health survey (IranMHS),"Background: Past research suggests that individuals suffering from depressive disorders with bipolar features might have different clinical outcomes resembling bipolar disorders. The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of bipolar features among individuals meeting the criteria for 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Iranian population and to examine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with these features. Methods: Data were drawn from the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS), a representative household survey of the Iranian population aged 15–64 years. The study sample consisted of all individuals with a 12-month MDD (n = 1014) ascertained by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1) without a lifetime history of bipolar I or II disorders. Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used to screen for the lifetime history of bipolar features among participants with MDD. Results: Among participants meeting the 12-month MDD criteria, 22.1% (95% CI: 19.6–24.7) had a lifetime history of bipolar features. Compared with those without these features, participants with bipolar features had higher odds of endorsing suicidal ideations and suicide attempts, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders, severe impairment, history of psychotic symptoms, some features of atypical depression and fewer depressive symptoms. Associations with comorbid anxiety disorders [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00–2.03] and history of psychotic symptoms (OR = 2.63 95% CI: 1.81–3.81) persisted in multivariable models. Limitation: Relying on self-reports of lifetime bipolar symptoms which is open to recall bias, and cross-sectional study design which limits interpretation of outcome and course of MDD are two major limitations of this study. Conclusion: The presence of bipolar features is associated with a distinct demographic and clinical profile in MDD. Identifying these cases would enhance the homogeneity of the depressive disorder phenotype in general population surveys. Identifying MDD patients with these features has potential clinical implications.

275,Cortical thickness reductions in the middle frontal cortex in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Panic disorder (PD), an anxiety disorder characterized by the recurrence of panic attacks, has been reported to be associated with volumetric changes in several brain regions. There are, however, very few studies investigating abnormalities in cortical thickness, and little is known about the relationship between cortical thickness and social dysfunction in PD. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 healthy control participants (HC) were recruited for this study. A whole-brain analysis was performed to evaluate groupwise differences in cortical thickness using the FreeSurfer software. Symptom severity and social functioning were evaluated with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Results: The patients with PD demonstrated a significant reduction in cortical thickness in the left rostral middle frontal cortex (MFC), compared with the HC. Correlational analyses revealed that cortical thickness in the left rostral MFC showed a significant negative relationship with PDSS score and a significant positive relationship with GAF scores in the PD patients. Limitations: All the patients received medication. Conclusion: PD patients showed reduced cortical thickness in the left rostral MFC compared with HC. Furthermore, cortical thickness in this region was associated with patients’ symptom severity and degree of social dysfunction.

276,Deficits of perceived spatial separation-induced prepulse inhibition in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls,"Objective: This study aimed to assess sensorimotor gating deficits in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) using a modified perceived spatial separation-induced prepulse inhibition (PSS-PPI) paradigm. The relationships between PSS-PPI, demographic and clinical characteristics, and cognitive functioning were also analyzed. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 30 patients with BD were compared to 33 healthy controls (HC) with respect to prepulse inhibition measures of PSS-PPI using a 120 ms lead interval. The Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale were used to assess manic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. Cognition was evaluated using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and the Stroop color-word test. Results: Compared with HC, patients with BD had a lower PSS-PPI level. PSS-PPI showed medium effect size (ES) between patients with BD and HC (ES = 0.65). Among patients with BD, PSS-PPI was positively correlated with the language domain of RBANS and negatively correlated with double word time and color interference time. There were no differences in PSS-PPI levels between patients with and without psychotic symptoms or between those euthymic patients or depressive patients with BD. Conclusions: Patients with BD show a sensorimotor gating deficit as measured by perceived spatial separation-induced PPI of the startle response, which was more sensitive compared to the classic PPI paradigm. Euthymic bipolar patients and depressive bipolar patients show similar PPI level. PPI deficit in patients with BD is related to cognition, but not with demographic and clinical characteristics.

277,History of suicide attempt and right superior temporal gyrus volume in youth with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder,"Background: Growing evidence suggests an endophenotype for suicidality, including brain morphometric features, could provide an improved platform for suicide risk assessment. Reduced right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) volumes have been implicated in suicidality across psychiatric disorders. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has unique neurobiology and adolescents with TRD are at increased suicide risk. Here, we investigated whether reduced rSTG volume was present in adolescents with TRD and history of suicide attempt. Methods: 45 adolescents—14 with history of suicide attempt and TRD, 14 without a suicide attempt history and TRD, and 17 healthy controls—underwent magnetic resonance imaging and reconstructed rSTG volumes were compared. Depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed with Hamilton depression and anxiety rating scales, and differences between attempters and non-attempters were explored. Results: Adolescents with TRD and history of suicide attempt showed reduced rSTG volume compared to healthy controls. Exploratory analyses revealed greater diurnal variation in depressive symptoms in the suicide attempt group compared to non-attempters. Limitations: Sample size and temporal separation between suicide attempt date and data collection limits interpretation of findings. Conclusions: Reduced rSTG volume may serve as a marker of suicide attempt in adolescence and specific symptom features may have a role in suicide risk assessment. Presently, risk assessment is limited by patient self-report and clinical judgement. A biological model of suicidality will be key to improve risk assessment and could lead to novel treatment approaches. Our findings extend previous results and contribute to our neurobiological understanding of suicidality.

278,State and trait hopelessness in a prospective five-year study of patients with depressive disorders,"Background: Hopelessness is a common experience of patients with depressive disorders (DD) and an important predictor of suicidal behaviour. However, stability and factors explaining state and trait variation of hopelessness in patients with DD over time are poorly known. Methods: Patients with DD ( n = 406) from the Vantaa Depression Study and the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study filled in the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Social Support Scale–Revised (PSSS-R), and Eysenck Personality Inventory–Q (EPI-Q) at baseline, at six and eighteen months, and at five years. We conducted a multilevel linear regression analyses predicting BHS with these covariates. Results: During the five-year follow-up half of the variance in BHS was attributable to between-patient variance (50.6%, CI = 41.2–61.5%), and the rest arose from within-patient variance and measurement errors. BDI and BAI explained 5.6% of within-patient and 28.4% of between-patient variance of BHS. High Neuroticism and low Extraversion explained 2.6% of the between-patient variance of BHS. PSSS-R explained 5% of between-patient variance and 1.7% of within-patient variance of BHS. Limitations: No treatment effects were controlled. Conclusions: Hopelessness varies markedly over time both within and between patients with depression; it is both state- and trait-related. Concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms and low social support explain both state and trait variance, whereas high Neuroticism and low Extraversion explain only trait variance of hopelessness. These variations influence the utility of hopelessness as an indicator of suicide risk.

279,Venus and Mars on the benches of the faculty: Influence of gender on mental health and behavior of medical students. Results from the BOURBON national study,"Medical student wellness has emerged as an important issue in medical education. Objective: To evaluate the gender influence on psychiatric and/or psychological follow-up, psychotropic and illicit drug consumption, addictive behaviors, quality of life and motives for consumption in a large multicentric national sample of medical students. Methods: Medical students of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and fulfilled Internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: Overall, 10,985 medical students were included in the present study (mean age 21.8 years, 9640 (87.8%) women). Compared to men, women were found to smoke tobacco and cannabis less frequently (aOR = 0.8 [0.7–0.9], p &lt; 0.0001 and aOR = 0.3 [0.3–0.4], p &lt; 0.0001 respectively), to have lower rate of alcohol use disorders (aOR = 0.7 [0.6–0.7], p &lt; 0.0001). Men were also found to consume more frequently ecstasy, cocaine, mushrooms, amphetamine, LSD, codeine and ketamine (all p &lt; 0.0001) for pleasure and novelty seeking, group effect, but also alleviating anxiety, sedative and stimulant effect and stress before exam (all p &lt; 0.001) while women were more frequently followed-up by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist (aOR = 2.0 [1.7–2.3], p &lt; 0.0001), consumed more frequently anxiolytics (aOR = 1.6[1.3–1.9], p &lt; 0.0001) and antidepressants (aOR = 1.4[1.1–1.9], p = 0.01), reported lower rates of physical and mental quality of life in all subscores (all p &lt; 0.0001). They were more frequently exposed to sexual assault (aOR = 4.1 [2.5–6.9], p &lt; 0.0001) and domestic violence (aOR = 1.6[1.1–2.5], p = 0.02) while men were more frequently exposed to physical assault (aOR = 0.4[0.4–0.5], p &lt; 0.0001) during their medical studies. Conclusions: Medical students are mostly women. While men and women are both exposed to professional and personal stress with differences, men are more frequently involved in addictive behavior and psychoactive substance consumption while women are mostly followed-up by psychiatrist and/or psychologist and psychotropic drug consumers, with more impaired self-reported mental and physical quality of life scores. These results should orientate future health strategies for the prevention of later mental illness onset and stress at work in hospital.

280,Psychiatry: A discipline at specific risk of mental health issues and addictive behavior? Results from the national BOURBON study,"Background: Physicians are at risk for burnout, anxiety and depression. Objective: To explore the self-reported mental health status, substance use behavior and motives of a national sample of interns in psychiatry compared to other specialties. Methods: Interns of the 35 French Medicine faculties were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2018 and fulfilled internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: Overall, 2165 interns (302 interns in psychiatry and 1863 in other specialties) mean aged 25.9 years (± 2.8), 35% males were included in the present study. In multivariate analyses, interns in psychiatry were found to have higher rates of current tobacco smoking (aOR = 1.9 [1.4–2.5], p &lt; 0.001), alcohol use disorder (aOR = 1.5 [1.2–2.0], p = 0.001), cannabis use disorder (aOR = 2.7 [1.8–4.2], p &lt; 0.001)). They were more frequently followed by a psychiatrist and/ or a psychologist (aOR = 2.5 1.9–3.3], p &lt; 0.001), they consumed more often antidepressants (aOR = 3.8 [2.2–6.6], p &lt; 0.001) and anxiolytic (aOR = 1.8[1.2–2.8]; p = 0.006). They reported to have been more frequently exposed to sexual assault (aOR = 2.2 [1.1–4.8], p = 0.04) and physical assault (aOR = 1.9[1.3–2.9], p = 0.002), and to have lower vitality (β = 3.5 [0.6–6.4], p = 0.02). Interns in psychiatry reported to have more often experienced ecstasy (aOR = 1.6 [1.2–2.3], p = 0.004), mushrooms (aOR = 1.5 [1.1–2.2], p = 0.04), amphetamines (aOR = 1.9 [1.2–3.1], p = 0.009) and LSD (aOR = 1.8 [1.1–3.1], p = 0.04). Beyond classical motives for this consumption (party, group effect), interns in psychiatry reported to seek more frequently disinhibition (aOR = 1.7 [1.3–2.2], p &lt; 0.001), dealing with anxiety (aOR = 1.7 [1.3–2.3], p = 0.001), and to seek both stimulant (aOR = 1.4 [1.1–1.9], p = 0.04) and sedative effects (aOR = 1.9[1.3–2.7], p = 0.001). Conclusions: Interns in psychiatry are more exposed to violence during medical studies, they report lower vitality and increased substance use behavior. Their motives for consumption suggest mental health problems associated with increased engagement in psychotherapy and self-medication of antidepressant/anxiolytic. This population should be targeted as a specific vulnerable population among interns in medicine to prevent ulterior bad health outcomes.

281,The association of duration and severity of disease with executive function: Differences between drug-naïve patients with bipolar and unipolar depression,"Background: The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in executive function and the relationship with clinical factors between drug-naïve patients with bipolar depression (BDD) and unipolar depression (UPD). Methods: Drug-naïve patients with BDD, UPD and healthy controls (HC) were recruited (30 cases in each group). All patients were assessed with Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 (HAM-D), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Executive function was evaluated by Stroop color-word test (CWT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Results: In the BDD group, only the CWT number of missing was higher than HCs ( P = 0.047). In the UDP group, CWT number of correct was lower, CWT number of missing was higher, and the WCST indices were worse than the HC group ( P &lt; 0.05). The WCST percentage of errors (PE) and percentage of conceptual level responses (PCLR) in the UPD group were worse than the BDD group ( P &lt; 0.05). In the BDD group, no correlations between CWT and WCST indices and clinical features were detected after correcting for multiple comparisons ( P &gt; 0.05). In the UDP group, the WCST PE, PCLR, number of categories completed (CC), and the percentage of perseverative responses (PPR) were correlated to the number of mood episodes ( P &lt; 0.01). Limitation: This was a small-sample cross-sectional study. The possibility of UPD transforming to bipolar disorder (BD) in future could not be ruled out. Conclusion: Our results suggested only small differences in executive function between drug-naïve patients with BDD and UPD, but in this sample only the UPD group showed differences with HCs. The executive function of drug-naïve BDD patients may be associated with duration of current depressive episode, while for UDP patients executive function indices were significantly correlated with number of mood episodes.

282,Subconstructs of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale in a postpartum sample in Mexico City,"Background: Postpartum depression is an important cause of morbidity in mothers and children. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the most widely used self-reported measure of postpartum depression, was conceived as a one-dimensional measure. However, evidence that depressive symptoms may be experienced differentially across cultural and racial groups highlights the need to examine structural equivalence using factor analysis across populations. Variation in factor structure for the EPDS remains understudied in middle/low income countries. Methods: We examined the factor structure of the EPDS assessed 6 months postpartum in 628 Mexican women in a longitudinal Mexico City birth cohort. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the optimal fit in our sample and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the fit of two- and three-factor models previously reported in Hispanic populations. Results: The majority of participants had no more than high school education (77%), maternal age was 28 ± 5.4 years and the mean total EPDS score was 6.72 ± 5.8. Using EFA, we identified that the three-factor model provided the optimal fit, with subscales for depression, anxiety, and anhedonia. CFA confirmed that the three-factor model provided the best fit. Limitations: The study population was lower SES, potentially limiting generalizability. The single administration of the EPDS measure in the postpartum period limited our ability to assess stability over time. Conclusions: Better delineation of the multi-factorial structure of the EPDS will allow a more comprehensive understanding of psychological functioning in postpartum women and better inform diagnosis, management and policy.

283,Mapping depression rating scale phenotypes onto research domain criteria (RDoC) to inform biological research in mood disorders,"Background: Substantial research progress can be achieved if available clinical datasets can be mapped to the National Institute of Mental Health Research-Domain-Criteria (RDoC) constructs. This mapping would allow investigators to both explore more narrowly defined clinical phenotypes and the relationship of these phenotypes to biological markers and clinical outcomes approximating RDoC criteria. Methods: Using expert review and consensus, we defined four major depression phenotypes based on specific RDoC constructs. Having matched these constructs to individual items from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, we identified subjects meeting criteria for each of these phenotypes from two large clinical trials of patients treated for major depression. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the overall treatment response based on the phenotypes: Core Depression (CD), Anxiety (ANX), and Neurovegetative Symptoms of Melancholia (NVSM) and Atypical Depression (NVSAD). Results: The phenotypes were prevalent (range 10.5–52.4%, 50% reduction range 51.9–82.9%) and tracked with overall treatment response. Although the CD phenotype was associated with lower rates of remission in both cohorts, this was mainly driven by baseline symptom severity. However, when controlling for baseline severity, patients with the ANX phenotype had a significantly lower rate of remission. Limitations: The lack of replication between the studies of the phenotypes’ treatment prediction value reflects important variability across studies that may limit generalizability. Conclusion: Further work evaluating biological markers associated with these phenotypes is needed for further RDoC concept development.

284,Factors associated with false positives in MDQ screening for bipolar disorder: Insight into the construct validity of the scale,"Background: Identifying bipolar patients in the first phases of the illness is essential to establish adequate treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the discriminant ability of the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) in recognizing bipolar patients referred to a tertiary care structure. Methods: Between 2006 and 2012, we assessed 843 individuals referred to the Mood Disorders Program by family physicians in the community. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) was used to assess diagnoses. A nurse collected the information about lifetime symptoms of (hypo)mania in 759 individuals using the MDQ. Univariate chi-square test and logistic regression were used for the statistical analysis. Results: Overall, 86% of the sample had a current anxiety or depressive disorder. When compared to the diagnoses formulated through the SCID, the sensitivity of the MDQ was 75.0%, the specificity was 74%, the positive predictive value was 55%, and the negative predictive value was 88%. Among non-bipolar patients, current post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, current or early remission substance use disorder, and the history of childhood abuse were independently associated with false positive screening using the MDQ. Limitations: Individuals with current substance use disorders were under-represented, whether or not the patients were aware of their diagnosis of bipolar disorder was not recorded, and the history of childhood abuse was collected based on an open interview. Conclusions: The self-rated measure of the symptoms listed by the MDQ seems to measure a dimension shared by both bipolar disorder and other conditions characterized by affective instability and impulsivity.

285,"The influences of vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation on clinical, metabolic and genetic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome","Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid on clinical, metabolic and genetic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 subjects, aged 18–40 years old with PCOS. Subjects were randomly allocated to take either 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks plus 2000 mg/day omega-3 fatty acid from fish oil ( n = 30) or placebo ( n = 30) for 12 weeks. Gene expression analysis of inflammatory cytokines was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PCOS women using RT-PCR method. Results: Vitamin D and omega -3 fatty acid co-supplementation significantly decreased serum total testosterone levels (−0.2 ± 0.5 vs. + 0.1 ± 0.4 ng/mL, P = 0.02) compared with the placebo. In addition, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-supplementation resulted in a significant improvement in beck depression inventory (−1.4 ± 1.6 vs. −0.5 ± 0.6, P = 0.01), general health questionnaire scores (−4.5 ± 4.3 vs. −1.9 ± 2.3, P = 0.005) and depression anxiety and stress scale scores (−5.0 ± 5.1 vs. −2.3 ± 3.5, P = 0.01) compared with the placebo. Additionally, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-administration significantly decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (−1.2 ± 1.9 vs. + 0.1 ± 0.7 mg/L, P = 0.001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (−0.4 ± 0.4 vs. + 0.2 ± 0.6 µmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), and significantly increased plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels (+ 114.6 ± 122.2 vs. -2.4 ± 168.2 mmol/L, P = 0.003) compared with the placebo. Results of RT-PCR demonstrated that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid co-supplementation significantly downregulated gene expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) ( P = 0.03), and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ( P = 0.004) in PBMCs of subjects with PCOS, when compared with placebo. Conclusions: Overall, the co-administration of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on mental health parameters, serum total testosterone, hs-CRP, plasma TAC and MDA levels, and gene expression of IL-1 and VEGF among women with PCOS.

In the original article, there were errors in Table 5 and in the abstract. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: Heterogeneity in the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients may be explained by relatively stable individual psychological differences. Therefore, we studied multiple personality and coping traits using a person-centered approach, and examined the predictive value of this approach for patient-reported outcomes. Method: 657 CAD patients (age = 66.39 ± 10.6; 79% men) completed multiple self-report questionnaires focusing on demographics, negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS14), neuroticism and extraversion (EPQ), resilience (DRS-15), and coping styles (CISS) after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and treatment adherence (MOS) were assessed at 6 months follow-up. Clinical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. Results: A step-3 latent class analysis identified four subgroup profiles: Low distress (31%), Passive coping (21%), Active coping (20%), and High distress (28%). For all patient-reported outcomes, overall significant differences between the subgroups were observed ( p- values &lt; .05). The High distress profile was associated with the highest levels of emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .94), and lowest levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02) and treatment adherence ( d = −2.75) at follow-up. Patients with an Active coping profile also experienced increased emotional distress ( d ’s &gt; .50), but participated in cardiac rehabilitation most often ( d = .13), and reported high levels of positive mood ( d = −1.02). Patients with a Passive coping profile displayed few emotional problems after six months (d’s &lt; .30), but participation to cardiac rehabilitation was relatively low ( d = .04). Conclusions: This study revealed four distinct psychological latent subgroups, which were predictive of patient-reported outcomes. The results indicate that a person-centered approach is useful in explaining heterogeneity in recovery from PCI, and may enhance personalized medicine in patients with CAD.

287,Meta-analysis: Second generation antidepressants and headache,"Background: To assess the risk of headache associated with commonly prescribed antidepressant medications and to examine the impact of medication class, pharmacodynamics and dosage on risk of headache. Methods: We searched PubMed to identify all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of second generation antidepressant medications in the treatment of adults with depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorders. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis to examine the pooled risk ratio of headache reported as a side-effect in adults treated with second generation antidepressants compared to placebo. We used stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression to examine the effects of medication type, class, dosage, indication, and receptor affinity profile on the measured risk of headache. Results: SSRIs were associated with a significantly increased risk of headache (RR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.00–1.13, z = 2.0, p = 0.045) when compared to placebo. There was no significant difference (test for subgroup differences χ² = 2.2, df = 1, p = 0.14) in the risk of headache between SSRIs and SNRIs (RR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.88–1.06, p = 0.63). There was no significant difference in the relative risk of headache with second generation antidepressants based on diagnostic indication, pharmacological properties and dosage of medications. The only antidepressants that were found to be significantly associated with increased risk of headache compared to placebo were bupropion (RR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.06–1.41, z = 2.73, p = 0.006) and escitalopram (RR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.01–1.37, z = 2.11, p = 0.04). Limitations: The small number of studies that examined side effects within fixed-dose trials may have limited the power to examine the association between medication dosing and risk of headache. Additionally, reporting bias could potentially occur non-randomly across agents and therefore effect meta-analysis results. Conclusions: Headaches reported after the initiation of second generation antidepressant medications are more likely to be coincidental than a treatment-emergent side effect of these medications.

288,"A naturalistic longitudinal study of extended inpatient treatment for adults with borderline personality disorder: An examination of treatment response, remission and deterioration","Background: Experts express reluctance to hospitalize patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) for more than a few days, arguing that extended inpatient care leads to deterioration and adverse events. To date, there is no empirical support for these assertions. Aims: The current study examined the assumption of iatrogenic effects among BPD adults. Methods: Clinically significant and reliable change in symptoms, functional capacities, and adverse events were quantified for both inpatients with BPD (n = 245) and a well-matched inpatient reference (n = 220) sample. Latent growth curve (LGC) models were used to evaluate moderators of the trajectory of PHQ-9 depression scores over the course of hospitalization. Results: Large effect size improvements were observed in depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and functional disability among patients with BPD (Cohen's d ≥ 1.0) and those in the reference sample (Cohen's d ≥ .80). Clinical deterioration and adverse events were rare (occurring in no more than 1.1% of BPD and reference patients on any outcome) with no difference across patient cohorts. BPD diagnosis failed to influence the trajectory of continuous depression severity. Rather, trait emotion dysregulation was associated with initial depression severity. Conclusions: Twenty-five years ago it was assumed that adults with BPD could not benefit from psychiatric treatment. Today there are a number of effective evidence-based outpatient treatments for BPD, but beliefs about extended inpatient treatment have changed little. Current results indicate that extended inpatient treatment can result in significant and clinically meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement in BPD patients without iatrogenic effects.

In the original article, the odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the total and the direct effect of each mediator have been switched in Table 4. For example, the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the total effect of alcohol dependence were supposed to be 2.46 and [1.76, 3.46], respectively, and the odd ratio and 95% confidence interval of the direct effect 2.39 and [1.70, 3.35], respectively. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-12472-052). Background: Studies on the association between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical multimorbidity (i.e., ≥ 2 chronic conditions) are lacking. Thus, we assessed the association between PTSD symptoms and physical multimorbidity using nationally representative, community-based data of the UK adult population. Methods: Data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were analyzed. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ). A total score of ≥ 6 points indicated a probable PTSD. Information was collected on 20 doctor/other health professional diagnosed physical health conditions that were present in the past 12 months. Multimorbidity was defined as ≥ 2 physical diseases. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between PTSD and physical multimorbidity, and the influence of behavioral and psychological factors in this association. Results: Among 7403 individuals aged ≥ 16 years [mean age (SD) = 46.3 (18.6) years; 51.5% females], the prevalence of PTSD increased from 2.1% in individuals with no physical conditions to 5.4% in those with ≥ 4 physical conditions. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and lifetime occurrence of a traumatic event, PTSD was associated with higher odds for physical multimorbidity (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.71–3.56). Anxiety, depression, and disordered eating explained 35%, 21%, and 8% of the PTSD-multimorbidity association, respectively. Limitations: Causality or temporal associations cannot be established due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. In addition, PTSD and physical conditions were assessed using self-reports. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms may be risk factors for physical multimorbidity. Anxiety and depressive symptoms might play an important role in this association. Screening for chronic physical conditions among individuals with PTSD and treating them simultaneously may lead to better clinical outcomes.

290,The association between severity of depression and prescription opioid misuse among chronic pain patients with and without anxiety: A cross-sectional study,"Background: In light of the increased rates of Prescription Opioid (PO) misuse and associated mortality in several developed countries in recent years, efforts have been made to identify populations who may be at increased risk for misuse of POs. Though the association between depression and PO misuse among pain patients is well documented, little is known regarding the effects of severity of depression on rates of misuse. In this study we explored rates of PO misuse among chronic pain patients screening positive for depression according to level of severity. Methods: Participants included chronic pain patients receiving POs ( N = 554). All participants were screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; cut-off scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 for mild, moderate, moderate-severe and severe depression, respectively) and for opioid misuse using the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM). Logistic regression analyses controlling for additional sociodemographic and clinical factors were conducted. Results: Participants who screened positive for depression were at significantly increased odds to screen positive for opioid misuse (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.63; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.71–7.7) compared to those without depression. Severity of depression was significantly associated with increased odds for opioid misuse for moderate (AOR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–13.76), moderate-severe (AOR = 6.28; 95% CI = 1.6–24.57) and severe (AOR = 14.66; 95% CI = 3.28–65.52) depression but not among those who screened positive for mild depression (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI = 0.39–5.68). Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need to properly asses and address level of severity of co-morbid depression among chronic pain patients receiving POs.

291,Scared and surrounded by clutter: The influence of emotional reactivity,"Background: Home visits can improve treatment outcomes for hoarding disorder, but factors influencing the success of home visits remain unknown. As home visits expose individuals to clutter and fear, the present study examined the effect that fear and emotional reactivity have on the relationship between clutter and discarding behaviour. Methods: Participants with at least subclinical discarding problems ( n = 143) were asked to save or discard personal possessions of varying value following an emotional induction that took place in either a tidy or cluttered context. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing hoarding severity, emotional state, and emotional reactivity, as defined by one's sensitivity, persistence, and intensity of reactions to emotional stimuli. Results: As expected, participants discarded more items in the presence of clutter and when feeling fearful. However, emotional reactivity moderated the relations between environmental context, acute emotional state, and discarding. Low sensitivity, low persistence, and high emotional intensity negatively influenced discarding in the cluttered context. When feeling fearful, low dispositional emotional intensity negatively influenced discarding in the tidy context. Limitations: Individuals in the tidy environment reported higher levels of fear and anxiety than individuals in the cluttered environment after the fear induction. These differences could have contributed to the difference noted between the two contexts when examining the effect of emotional intensity tendencies. Conclusions: Providing treatment in an environment more representative of the cluttered home can improve discarding or at the very least give therapists a more accurate picture of what clients do in the context that matters most.

292,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of Internet-delivered behavioral activation,"Background: Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence-based treatment for depression which has attracted interest and started to accumulate evidence for other conditions when delivered face-to-face. Due to its parsimoniousness, it is suitable to be delivered via the Internet. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy of Internet-based BA and assess the quality of this evidence. Methods: Studies were identified from electronic databases (EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, CINHAL, PsycINFO, Cochrane) and reference lists of included studies. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted data. They assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Results: Nine RCTs on different forms of depression were included with 2157 adult participants. Random effects meta-analyses showed that in non-clinical settings, guided Internet-based BA was non-inferior to other forms of behavioral therapy and mindfulness (mainly very low to low quality evidence) and superior to physical activity (very low quality evidence), psychoeducation/treatment as usual (moderate quality evidence) and waitlist (low quality evidence) at reducing depression and anxiety outcomes at post-treatment and short follow-up. Limitations: The poor quality of some of the findings means that results should be cautiously interpreted. Conclusions: Evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based BA as a treatment for depression is promising. However, high quality studies with longer follow-ups are needed to increase confidence in findings and determine its efficacy in clinical settings and other conditions.

293,Cognitive behavioral therapy for post-stroke depression: A meta-analysis,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used for post-stroke depression (PSD), but the findings have been inconsistent. This is a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for PSD. Methods: Both English (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase) and Chinese (WanFang Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and SinoMed) databases were systematically searched. Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMDs/SMDs), and the risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model. Results: Altogether 23 studies with 1,972 participants with PSD were included and analyzed. Of the 23 RCTs, 39.1% (9/23) were rated as high quality studies, while 60.9% (14/23) were rated as low quality. CBT showed positive effects on PSD compared to control groups (23 arms, SMD = −0.83, 95% CI: −1.05 to −0.60, P &lt; 0.001). Both CBT alone (7 arms, SMD = −0.76, 95% CI: −1.22 to −0.29, P = 0.001) and CBT with antidepressants (14 arms, SMD = −0.95, 95% CI: −1.20 to −0.71, P &lt; 0.00001) significantly improved depressive symptoms in PSD. CBT had significantly higher remission (6 arms, RR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37–2.25, P &lt; 0.00001) and response rates (6 arms, RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22–1.63, P &lt; 0.00001), with improvement in anxiety, neurological functional deficits and activities of daily living. CBT effects were associated with sample size, mean age, proportion of male subjects, baseline depression score, mean CBT duration, mean number of CBT sessions, treatment duration in each session and study quality. Conclusion: Although this meta-analysis found positive effects of CBT on depressive symptoms in PSD, the evidence for CBT is still inconclusive due to the limitations of the included studies. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the benefits of CBT in PSD.

294,Childhood adversities as predictors of improvement in psychiatric symptoms and global functioning in solution-focused and short- and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy during a 5-year follow-up,"Background: Childhood adversities are frequent among adults who seek treatment for depression or anxiety. These disorders are commonly treated by psychotherapy. Yet it is not known if specific types or durations of psychotherapy are particularly suited for patients who have suffered various early adversities. Methods: 221 depressed and anxious adult outpatients from community, student, occupational, and private healthcare services filled the Childhood Family Atmosphere Questionnaire. They were randomly assigned to short- (solution-focused or psychodynamic) or long-term (psychodynamic) psychotherapy. Outcome was assessed via patient questionnaires and clinician interviews of psychiatric symptoms and global functioning during a 5-year follow-up. Linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Less separations from caregivers expectedly predicted better outcomes in all therapies; unexpectedly, so did greater abuse. Family unhappiness and parental problems predicted faster or greater improvement when patients were assigned to a short- or long-term psychodynamic therapy model. Limitations: As patients with psychotic, substance abuse, and severe personality disorders were screened out, findings might not generalize to these patient groups. Conclusions: Patients with certain childhood adversities appear to respond with faster or greater improvement when the psychotherapy model is explicitly focused on working through the potential connections between past and current problems. If confirmed by in-depth studies, the findings may help match psychotherapeutic models with given patient complaints, as well as fine-tune different psychosocial interventions to individual needs for optimizing treatment outcomes.

295,Psychological and genetic risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders,"Introduction: To prevent suicide, a nationwide important issue in Korea, understanding its etiology is essential. This study aimed to delineate the risk factors for suicidal behavior in mood disorder patients in Korea. Methods: 216 patients with mood disorders were recruited. We measured suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) history and the association of six gene polymorphisms with SB: COMT (rs4680), HTR1A (rs6295), TPH1 (rs1800532), BDNF (rs6265), SLC1A3 (rs2269272), and SLC1A2 (rs4755404). Results: Patients in the high-SI and SA groups reported more severe depressive, hopelessness, and anxiety symptoms and lower resilience and used less social support-seeking coping than those in the non-significant SI and non-SA groups. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that depressive disorder, depressive symptoms, poor social support, and less social support-seeking coping were significant independent predictors of suicidal ideation. After adjustment for covariates, age, alcohol consumption, and the rs4680 AA genotype in the COMT gene were associated with suicide attempt. Limitations: The modest sample size and a relatively few candidate genes are limitations of the study. In addition, there is no normal control group and the retrospective evaluation of SA limits the interpretation of the causal relationship with factors affecting SA. Conclusions: Suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders may be associated with younger age, alcohol consumption, depressive symptoms, poor social support, less social support-seeking coping, and the COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype.

296,‘Cool’ and ‘Hot’ executive functions in suicide attempters with major depressive disorder,"Rationale: The World Health Organization reports that, by 2030, depression is expected to be the largest contributor to disease burden. Only small proportion of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) achieves remission and the majority of them do not achieve long-term functional recovery. One of the neuropsychological domains that have been shown to be particularly impaired in depression, is that of executive function (EF). Objectives: We examined whether the patients with MDD with and without suicide attempts had deteriorated ‘cool’ EF and ‘hot’ EF. Methods: The study population comprised 34 MDD attempters, 36 MDD non-attempters, and 55 healthy controls. We adopted the symmetry span task (SSPAN) to measure the updating and the affective shifting task (AST) to measure the inhibition and set-shifting in general and in response to emotional material. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was used to examine the affective decision-making ability. Results: After controlling for PHQ-9, Anxiety (HADS), suicidal ideation, education year and gender, we reported that (1) the MDD non-attempters had worse updating than the healthy controls and the MDD attempters; (2) the MDD attempters had worse general inhibition (GI) than the healthy controls and the MDD non-attempters; (3) the MDD non-attempters had worse general set-shifting (GS) than the healthy controls and the MDD attempters; (4) there was no between-group difference in the ‘hot’ EFs; and (5) MDD attempters with longer durations (over 5 years) since last attempt had worse general inhibition. Conclusions: The disrupted ‘cool’ EFs patients with MDD are consistent with previous review and meta-analytic studies. On the other hand, the two groups with MDD performed similarly to the healthy controls in the ‘hot’ EF.

297,Effects of repeated attachment security priming in outpatients with primary depressive disorders,"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the potential effectiveness of secure attachment priming in outpatients with depressive disorders. Methods: Forty-eight participants engaged in secure attachment priming or neutral priming in the laboratory (Time 1), after which they received three daily consecutive primes via text message (Times 2–4), aimed at maintaining the effects from Time 1. A follow-up one day later (Time 5) was also included. Dependent measures were assessed at Times 1, 4 and 5. Results: Participants in the secure attachment priming condition experienced higher felt-security than the control group at all time-points, indicating that the felt-security benefit was maintained through repeated priming. Secure priming had a greater impact on reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in comparison to the control prime, though the differences were only significant at Time 4. Limitations: The moderate sample size limited our statistical power. Conclusions: This study was the first experiment using repeated secure attachment priming within a clinical sample. Our findings have potential clinical implications; security priming could be used alongside other treatments to improve outcome. Recommendations for further research are discussed.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summarise relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in cognitive and emotional self-control. Optical technique acquisitions, such as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), seem to be very promising during developmental ages, as they are non- invasive techniques and less influenced by body movements than other neuroimaging methods. Recently, these new techniques are being widely used to measure neural correlates underlying neuropsychological deficits in children with ADHD. Methods: In a short series of articles, we will review the results of functional NIRS (fNIRS) studies in children with ADHD. The present brief review will focus on the results of the fNIRS studies that investigate cortical activity during neuropsychological and/or emotional tasks. Results: According to the reviewed studies, children and adolescents with ADHD show peculiar cortical activation both during neurological and emotional tasks, and the majority of the reviewed studies revealed lower prefrontal cortex activation in patients compared to typically developmental controls. Limitations: a consistent interpretation of these results is limited by the substantial methodological heterogeneity including patients’ medication status and washout period, explored cerebral regions, neuropsychological tasks, number of channels and sampling temporal resolutions. Conclusions: fNIRS seems to be a promising tool for investigating neural substrates of emotional dysregulation and executive function deficits in individuals with ADHD during developmental ages.

This Section of JAD focuses on the relevance of translational and neuroscience studies in providing a better understanding of the neural basis of affective disorders. The main aim is to briefly summaries relevant research findings in clinical neuroscience with particular regards to specific innovative topics in mood and anxiety disorders","Background: Although it has been consistently reported the important role of genetic and environmental risk factors on structural and functional alterations in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the mechanism and the magnitude of the interactions between specific genetic and/or environmental risk factors on brain structures in this disabling disorder are still elusive. Therefore, in the last two decades an increased interest has been devoted to neuroimaging investigations on monozygotic and dizygotic twin samples mainly because their intrinsic characteristics may help to separate the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors on clinical phenotypes, including MDD. Methods: In this context, the present review summarizes results from structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies that investigated twin samples in correlation with MDD. Results: Overall the results confirmed that a) MDD is characterized by significant alterations in selective brain areas presiding over emotion recognition and evaluation, including amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortices, and b) both genetic and environmental risk factors play a key role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Limitations: Few MRI studies exploring MDD in twin samples. Conclusions: The specific contribution of both aspects is still not fully elucidated especially because genes and environment have an impact on the same brain areas, which are particularly vulnerable in MDD. Expansion of the current twin sample sizes would help to clearly establish the potential relationship between risk factors and the development of MDD.

301,Low cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide levels in human cerebrospinal fluid of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients,"Background: Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is a candidate neuropeptide as a biomarker for major depressive disorder (MDD) because of its effects on emotion and distribution covering brain areas involved in the pathophysiology of MDD symptoms. However, it is unknown whether CART peptide levels are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MDD patients and are correlated with MDD symptoms. Methods: Subjects were 24 patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity (Japanese). We measured CSF CART levels by a commercially available immunoassay kit and analyzed the relationships of the levels with antidepressant dose and symptoms assessed with the 21 item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21). Results: CSF CART levels were significantly decreased in the patients than in the controls ( p &lt; 0.05). In MDD patient group, the CART levels had a negative correlation with antidepressant dose (imipramine-equivalent dose) (ρ = −0.55, p &lt; 0.01) and significantly decreased in antidepressant-treated group (AD-treated group) compared to controls ( p &lt; 0.05). CSF CART levels showed significant negative correlations with psychomotor retardation, somatic anxiety, and general somatic symptoms (all p &lt; 0.05) and a positive correlation with obsessive and compulsive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: In our analysis, all classes of antidepressants were combined together and the effects of medication use in a longitudinal manner did not confirm. Conclusions: We report for the first time that CSF CART peptide levels are reduced in patients with MDD compared with healthy controls. The CART levels showed negative correlations with antidepressant dose and some symptoms, supporting the possibility that CART peptide is involved in the development of depressive symptoms.

303,Young adult’s attachment style as a partial mediator between maternal functioning and young adult offsprings’ functioning,"Background: The quality of our early attachment relationships with primary caregivers is carried forward to new developmental domains, including interpersonal contexts in adulthood. One of the factors that can disrupt early attachment is maternal depression, which may be associated with less responsive care and may impede the development of a secure attachment. Moreover, this disruption in secure attachment may act as a mechanism by which offspring of depressed mothers are more likely to experience their own psychopathology. In this study we predicted that attachment anxiety and avoidance would mediate the relationship between maternal depression diagnosis and functional impairment predicting young adult offspring's functional impairment. Methods: This study utilized longitudinal data from 98 families with clinically diagnosed depressed and well mothers, and two of their young adult children, an older and younger sibling ( N = 123, Female = 75, M age = 22.09, SD = 2.57). Mother's and young adult children's functioning was based on clinical ratings on the Global Assessment Scale. Attachment was based on the young adult's self-report on the Experiences in Close Relationships. Results: Results indicate that maternal diagnosis and functional impairment predicted offspring's functional impairment. This relationship was partially mediated through offspring's attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance. Limitations: The mediator and outcome variable were measured concurrently, thus causal implications are limited. Conclusions: Our study provides critical evidence that early experiences with depressed mothers may have influence into young adulthood in typical and atypical domains of development. This work extends our understanding of the impact of early experiences in long-term development, and may have treatment implications for intervening on both maternal and romantic relationships to improve attachment.

304,Differential associations between patterns of child maltreatment and comorbidity in adult depressed patients,"Background: Types of maltreatment often co-occur and it is unclear how maltreatment patterns impact on comorbidity in depressed patients. Methods: We analysed associations of maltreatment patterns with a broad range of comorbidities assessed with diagnostic interviews in 311 treatment-seeking depressed outpatients. Results: Latent class analyses identified a “no maltreatment class” (39%), a “mild to moderate abuse and neglect class” (34%), a “severe abuse and neglect class” (14%) and a “severe neglect class” (13%). We found a dose-response association for the first three classes with comorbid disorders, a general psychopathology factor and an interpersonal insecurity factor. Patients in the “severe abuse and neglect” class had increased odds ratios (OR) of suffering from an anxiety disorder (OR 3.58), PTSD (OR 7.09), Borderline personality disorder (OR 7.97) and suicidality (OR 10.04) compared to those without child maltreatment. Patients in the “severe neglect” class did not have a higher risk for comorbidity than those in the “no maltreatment” class. Limitations: Class sizes in the “severe abuse and neglect” and the “severe neglect” classes were small and findings should be replicated with other clinical and population samples. Conclusions: A higher severity rather than the constellation of types of child abuse and neglect was associated with more comorbid disorders. An exception were patients reporting solely severe emotional and physical neglect who had a similar risk for comorbidity as patients without a history of child maltreatment. This may be associated with distinct learning experiences and may inform treatment decisions.

305,Physical exercise for late-life depression: Effects on symptom dimensions and time course,"Background: Physical exercise is increasingly recognized as a treatment for major depression, even among older patients. However, it is still unknown which depressive symptoms exercise affects most, (e.g. somatic vs. affective) and the timing of its effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the changes of depressive symptoms after treatment with exercise. Methods: We analyzed data from the SEEDS study, a trial comparing the antidepressant effectiveness of sertraline (S) and sertraline plus exercise (S + EX). Exercise was delivered thrice weekly in small groups and monitored by heart rate meters. Patients with late life depression (n = 121) were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks with the Hamilton Depression Scale. Scores of affective, vegetative, anxiety and agitation/insight factors were analyzed using Multilevel Growth Curve Models and sensitivity analyses (multiple imputation). Results: Compared with the S group, patients in the S + EX group displayed significantly greater improvements of the affective symptom dimension (total effect size = 0.79) with largest changes in the first 4 weeks and last 12 weeks. Improvements were mainly driven by depressed mood and psychomotor retardation. Limitations: Sample size; lack of an exercise only treatment arm Conclusions: Adding exercise to antidepressant drug treatment may offer significant advantages over affective symptoms of depression, rather than somatic symptoms or other dimensions of depression. Compared with standard antidepressant treatment, clinical advantages should be expected both at an early (first 4 weeks) and later stage (after 12 weeks).

306,Are affective temperaments determinants of quality of life in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder?,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a disabling illness that is associated with low quality of life (QoL). This low QoL goes further than mood episodes, which suggests that stable traits, such as affective temperaments, can cause functional impairment. Objective: Our study analyses the impact of affective temperaments on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of QoL in euthymic BD patients. Methods: A multicentre study was conducted in 180 euthymic BD patients and 95 healthy controls. Firstly, statistical analyses were performed to compare QoL and affective temperaments between the two groups. Secondly, Adaptive Lasso Analysis was carried out to identify the potential confounding variables and select the affective temperaments as potential predictors on the PCS and MCS of QoL in BD patients, as well as the control group. Results: QoL scores in terms of PCS and MCS in BD patients were significantly lower than in healthy individuals. Whereas anxious temperament, anxiety disorder comorbidity, and age were the best predictors of PCS impairment in BD patients, anxious temperament, subclinical depressive symptoms, and age were the best predictors of MCS impairment. Limitations: Further longitudinal studies with unaffected high-risk relatives are needed to examine the potential interaction between affective temperament and psychopathology. Conclusions: Anxious temperament has an impact on QoL in BD in terms of both the physical component and the mental component. Systematic screening of temperament in BD would give clinicians better knowledge of QoL predictors. Further research should allow more individualized treatment of BD patients based on temperamental factors.

307,Association of suicidal risk with ratings of affective temperaments,"Background: Ratings of particular temperament-types with the TEMPS-A autoquestionnaire have been associated with suicidal risk, and combinations of such ratings may enhance the association. However, the predictive value of scores for individual temperaments and combinations remains to be quantified. Method: We evaluated associations of TEMPS-A ratings for anxious (anx), cyclothymic (cyc), dysthymic (dys), hyperthymic (hyp) and irritable (irr) temperaments, with a history of suicidal acts or reported suicidal ideation in 882 patients with bipolar (BD; n = 509), major depressive (MDD; n = 268) or anxiety (ANX; n = 105) disorders. Results: With BD, scores for cyc and irr were highest and anx lowest; with MDD, dys scored highest, hyp lowest; anx was highest with ANX and MDD. Women (n = 497) had higher anx and cyc scores than men; scores for irr and hyp decreased with age. Scores for dys, anx, and cyc, were higher, and hyp lower, with greater HDRS21 depression ratings. Among 347 suicidal subjects (112 with attempts), cyc, dys, and irr scores were higher, hyp lower. Pooled score [ cyc + dys + irr—hyp ] best distinguished subjects with suicide attempts versus nonsuicidal subjects, including in Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis (AUC for acts = 70.1% [64.9– 75.3]). Multivariable modeling associated suicidal acts with TEMPS-A [cyc + dys + irr—hyp] composite-score, depression severity, BD or MDD diagnosis, and older at illness-onset. Conclusions: Subjects with suicidal acts or ideation were best distinguished by composite TEMPS-A score [ cyc + dys + irr—hyp ]. These factors should help to identify those at suicidal risk.

308,"Relationship between sedentary behavior and depression: A mediation analysis of influential factors across the lifespan among 42,469 people in low- and middle-income countries","Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) is associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and low mood. There is a paucity of multi-national research investigating SB and depression, particularly among low- and middle-income countries. This study investigated the association between SB and depression, and factors which influence this. Methods: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. Depression was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The association between depression and SB (self-report) was estimated by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. Mediation analysis was used to identify influential factors. Results: A total of 42,469 individuals (50.1% female, mean 43.8 years) were included. People with depression spent 25.6 (95%CI8.5–42.7) more daily minutes in SB than non-depressed participants. This discrepancy was most notable in adults aged ≥ 65 y (35.6min more in those with depression). Overall, adjusting for socio-demographics and country, depression was associated with a 1.94 (95%CI1.31–2.85) times higher odds for high SB (i.e., ≥ 8 h/day). The largest proportion of the SB-depression relationship was explained by mobility limitations (49.9%), followed by impairments in sleep/energy (43.4%), pain/discomfort (31.1%), anxiety (30.0%), disability (25.6%), cognition (16.1%), and problems with vision (11.0%). Other health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking), body mass index, and social cohesion did not influence the SB-depression relationship. Conclusion: People with depression are at increased risk of engaging in high levels of SB. This first multi-national study offers potentially valuable insight for a number of hypotheses which may influence this relationship, although testing with longitudinal studies is needed.

309,"Pregnant women with depressive and anxiety symptoms read, talk, and sing less to their fetuses","Of interest in this paper is the study of mothers’ vocalizations directed toward the fetus in relation to maternal mood disorder. This would be important to know because as documented in the literature, maternal verbal output has an important impact on young children's cognitive and social-emotional development. Moreover, as reviewed above, fetuses respond to and learn maternal vocalizations, suggesting that the fetal brain may be primed to receive maternal language output. For the purpose of our study, we recruited pregnant women in their third trimester and examined how they were communicating with their fetuses using a scale developed for this study (Communicating with your Baby Scale: CBS). Generally, the scale examined the frequency and type of maternal auditory output aimed at the fetus. In particular, the scale assessed the frequency of maternal reading, singing, and talking directed at the fetus during the latter part of pregnancy as well as other types of stimulation provided to the fetus. We hypothesized that depressed and/or anxious mothers would read, sing and talk to their fetuses less frequently than non-depressed/non-anxious pregnant women based on postnatal research on how mood affected women interact with their children.

310,Amyloid burden and incident depressive symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease,"Background: Relationships between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may become clearer if studied in preclinical AD where dementia is not present. Method: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively, relationships between brain amyloid-β (Aβ), depressive symptoms and screen positive depression in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Inventory (GDS-15) in CN adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study without depression at baseline and classified as having abnormally high (Aβ+; n = 136) or low (Aβ−; n = 449) Aβ according to positron emission tomography at 18-month intervals over 72 months. Results: Incident cases of screen positive depression were not increased in Aβ+ CN adults although small increases in overall depressive symptoms severity ( d = − 0.25; 95% CI, − 0.45, − 0.05) and apathy-anxiety symptoms ( d = − 0.28; 95% CI − 0.48, − 0.08) were. Limitations: As the AIBL sample is an experimental sample, no individuals had severe medical illnesses or significant psychiatric disorders. Additionally, individuals who had evidence of screen-positive depression at screening were excluded from enrolment in the AIBL study. Thus, the current data can be considered only as providing a foundation for understanding relationships between Aβ and depression in preclinical AD. Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence of a depressive disorder or even increased depressive symptoms are themselves unlikely to be a direct consequence of increasing Aβ. New depressive disorders presenting in CN older adults could therefore be investigated for aetiologies beyond AD.

311,Early life social stress and resting state functional connectivity in postpartum rat anterior cingulate circuits,"Introduction: Continued development and refinement of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI techniques in both animal and clinical studies has enhanced our comprehension of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health. The objective of the current study was to assess both maternal behavior and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes in these animals when they were dams caring for their own young. It was hypothesized that ECSS exposed dams would express depressed maternal care and exhibit similar (same networks), yet different specific changes in RSFC (different individual nuclei) than reported when they were adult females. Methods: We have developed an ethologically relevant transgenerational model of the role of chronic social stress (CSS) in the etiology of postpartum depression and anxiety. Initial fMRI investigation of the CSS model indicates that early life exposure to CSS (ECSS) induces long term changes in functional connectivity in adult nulliparous female F1 offspring. Results: ECSS in F1 dams resulted in depressed maternal care specifically during early lactation, consistent with previous CSS studies, and induced changes in functional connectivity in regions associated with sensory processing, maternal and emotional responsiveness, memory, and the reward pathway, with robust changes in anterior cingulate circuits. Limitations: The sample sizes for the fMRI groups were low, limiting statistical power. Conclusion: This behavioral and functional neuroanatomical foundation can now be used to enhance our understanding of the neural etiology of early life stress associated disorders and test preventative measures and treatments for stress related disorders.

312,"Examining a transdiagnostic measure of repetitive thinking in depressed, formerly depressed and never-depressed individuals","Background: Evidence that repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a shared feature of a number of disorders has prompted the need for transdiagnostic self-report instruments; that is, measures of RNT that can be administered to individuals irrespective of their diagnosis. The Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ; McEvoy et al., 2010) was developed to meet this need, and its psychometric properties and capacity to predict psychopathology have been tested in undergraduate and clinically anxious samples. Methods: We administered the RTQ to currently depressed ( n = 29), formerly depressed ( n = 61) and never-depressed ( n = 93) community participants. Results: The RTQ demonstrated good psychometric properties, with excellent internal consistency for the RNT subscale (α = .93) and good convergent validity with measures of negative affect and psychopathology symptoms ( r s = .47–.61). In addition, and in accord with our predictions, currently depressed and recovered depressed participants reported more RNT than never-depressed participants, but currently and recovered depressed participants did not differ. In addition, RNT scores explained additional variance in depression and anxiety symptoms, after controlling for gender, age, neuroticism, state negative affect, and intolerance of uncertainty. Limitations: Our sample was drawn from the community but participants were not treatment–seeking, and we employed a cross-sectional design. Discussion: Taken together with previous experimental and longitudinal studies, our results support the utility of addressing RNT in the treatment and prevention of relapse in depression. Moreover, these data confirm the utility of the RTQ as a brief, transdiagnostic self-report measure of RNT.

313,The effects of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on parameters of mental health and gene expression related to insulin and inflammation in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on parameters of mental health and gene expression related to insulin and inflammation in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: Forty PCOS women were allocated into two groups and treated with 1000mg omega-3 fatty acids plus 400 IU vitamin E supplements (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) per day for 12 weeks. Parameters of mental health were recorded at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Gene expression related to insulin and inflammation were measured in blood samples of PCOS women. Results: After the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation led to significant improvements in beck depression inventory total score (− 2.2 ± 2.0 vs. − 0.2 ± 1.3, P = 0.001), general health questionnaire scores (− 5.5 ± 4.6 vs. − 1.0 ± 2.3, P &lt; 0.001) and depression anxiety and stress scale scores (− 7.2 ± 5.2 vs. − 1.3 ± 1.3, P &lt; 0.001). Compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation could up-regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression (P = 0.04) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of PCOS women. In addition, compared with the placebo, omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation down-regulated interleukin-8 (IL-8) (P = 0.003) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression (P = 0.001) in PBMC of PCOS women. There were no significant difference between-group changes in glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in PBMC of PCOS women. Conclusion: Omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation was effective in improving parameters of mental health, and gene expression of PPAR-γ, IL-8 and TNF-α of women with PCOS.

314,Association of comorbid personality disorders with clinical characteristics and outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing two psychotherapies for early-onset persistent depressive disorder,"Background: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is associated with high rates of comorbid personality disorders (PD). The association of comorbid PD and clinical characteristics has not been systematically studied in PDD. Results regarding effects on treatment outcome are heterogeneous. Methods: We analyzed the association of comorbid personality disorders with clinical characteristics and outcome in a randomized controlled trial comparing the disorder-specific Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) with nonspecific supportive psychotherapy (SP) in patients with early-onset PDD. The main outcome measure was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Further baseline measures were comorbid axis-I diagnoses (SCID-I), quality of life (QLDS), global functioning (GAF), interpersonal problems (IIP-64) and childhood maltreatment (CTQ). Results: Out of the 268 patients, 103 (38.4%) met criteria for at least one PD. PD was associated with higher rates of axis I comorbidities (mainly anxiety disorders) and interpersonal problems (patients with PD were more vindictive, more self-sacrificing, less assertive and more inhibited socially than patients without PD). There was no significant main effect of PD on treatment outcome and no significant interaction between PD and treatment group. Limitations: The main limitation was the exclusion of patients with certain personality disorders (antisocial, schizotypal, and borderline personality disorders). Furthermore, the study was underpowered to find interaction effects of small size. Conclusion: Persistently depressed patients with and without comorbid PD primarily seemed to differ in the rate of axis I comorbidity and the severity of interpersonal problems. Treatment outcomes appear to be not significantly affected by the presence of PD.

315,Predictors of remission from probable depression among Hong Kong adolescents—A large-scale longitudinal study,"Background: This study investigated the incidence of remission from probable depression among adolescents in Hong Kong. Remissions were defined as having Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) scores changed from ≥ 16 at baseline to &lt; 16 over the 12-month follow-up period. The study tested the predictors of remissions, including perceived changes in family support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, positive affect, negative events, social anxiety, and loneliness. Methods: The study surveyed 9666 secondary school students and identified 5487 (57%) students with probable depression in Hong Kong. A questionnaire assessing the levels of the aforementioned variables was completed at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Results: Among participants with probable depression at baseline, 23.2% remitted from depression at follow-up. Remissions were more common among males than females. Univariate logistic regression showed that perceived changes in all the aforementioned variables significantly predicted remission for both males and females. The same is true for most of these variables when they were entered together into multiple logistic regression models (with and without controlling for baseline CESD scores), except for family support in the female model and self-efficacy in both male and female models. Limitations: Limitations include potential self-report bias and only one follow-up observation over time. The design treats cases of probable mild to severe depression as a single group (CESD ≥ 16). Conclusions: The findings are potentially useful for designing and guiding related intervention programs. Results highlight the importance of long-term follow-up of those screened as probable depression to understand the course of changes in levels of depression.

316,A meta-analysis of the use of probiotics to alleviate depressive symptoms,"Introduction: Some preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the positive impact of probiotic supplementation on depressive symptoms. This paper aims to provide an updated meta-analysis on the topic. Methods: Using the keywords [probiotics OR gut OR microflora OR microbiome OR bacteria OR yeast OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium] AND [mood OR depression OR MDD OR suicide], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Ovid, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR) and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine database yielded 917 papers published in English between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-June-2017. Results: 10 clinical trials with a total of 1349 patients were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. There was no significant difference in mood between the treatment and placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference (SMD) was −0.128 (95% CI −0.261 to 0.00463, P = 0.059). A separate subgroup analysis of studies conducted in healthy versus depressed individuals found significant improvements in the moods of individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (SMD −0.684, 95% CI −1.296 to −0.0712, P = 0.029) and non-significant effects in healthy individuals (SMD −0.0999, 95% CI −0.235 to 0.0348, P=0.146). Limitations: Inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing, bacterial strains and strain combinations limit the comparability of current clinical trials. Furthermore, majority of existing RCTs were conducted in healthy individuals, making it difficult to extrapolate the results to depressed individuals. Conclusion: Probiotic supplementation has an overall insignificant effect on mood. Future studies should be conducted on more patients with clinically diagnosed depression.

317,Psychological distress and risk for suicidal behavior among university students in contemporary China,"Background: Psychological distress and suicidal behavior are important mental health problems among university students and warrant research to inform strategies for effective prevention in this young population. The present study aimed to assess psychological distress and suicidal behavior and to unravel their associations among university students. Methods: A total of 5972 undergraduate students, randomly selected from six universities in central China, comprised the sample. The Chinese version of the Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R) was used to assess various psychological symptoms. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between psychological distress and risk for suicidal behavior. Results: 40.7% of the university students reported positive in a least one of the 9 psychological symptom dimensions assessed by the SCL-90-R. 7.6% of the students reported suicidal behavior in the previous twelve months. The risk of suicidal behavior was significantly associated with psychological symptoms of all types, but there were notable differences by sex. For male students, depression and phobic anxiety increased the risk of suicidal behavior. Meanwhile, depression and obsessive-compulsiveness were positively associated with suicidal behavior in female students. Furthermore, increasing risk of suicidal behavior was associated with increasing positive symptom total (PST) score and a statistically significant trend was observed. Limitations: Data collected from a cross-sectional survey does not allow any examination of causal inference. Conclusions: Psychological distress and suicidal behavior were both common among university students; and psychological distress was highly associated with suicidal behavior. The findings underscore the importance of mental health care for university students.

318,Predictors of hospitalization length of stay among re-admitted treatment-resistant Bipolar Disorder inpatients,"Background: Hospitalization accounts for significant health care resource utilization for treatment-resistant Bipolar Disorder (BD), especially among frequent users of acute inpatient psychiatric units. Appraisal of the clinical features and predictive role of selected variables is therefore crucial in such population, representing the aim of the present research. Methods: A hundred and nineteen BD inpatients with an established history of pharmacological treatment resistance for either mania or bipolar depression were classified as long hospitalization cases (LOS + ) and their controls and compared against each other for a number of demographic, clinical, and psychopathological features. Results: Overall, female sex, current second-generation atypical antipsychotic (SGA)/mood stabilizer other than lithium as well as antidepressant treatment at the admission occurred statistically more frequently among LOS + cases, concordant with higher scores at the Hamilton scales for depression and anxiety. Lithium utilization at the time of hospitalization did not differ between cases and controls (LOS-, n = 81/119), as predominant affective temperament and other psychopathological rating did not. Overall, the time of admission, use of SGA, anticonvulsant (other than lithium), antidepressant, lifetime alcohol dependence, and BD Type (-I or -II), but not current mood polarity at the time of hospitalization, correctly predicted LOS + grouping 68.2% of the times: Exp(B) = 3.151, p042. Limitations: Post-hoc, cross-sectional study, relatively small sample size, recall and selection bias on some diagnoses. Conclusions: Overall, LOS+ treatment-resistant BD inpatients characterize for higher severity and greater pharmaco-utilization use, which warrants replication studies to include additional predictors to shed further light on the matter.

319,Prenatal maternal mood patterns predict child temperament and adolescent mental health,"Background: This study quantifies the dynamics of maternal mood focusing on unpredictability, and to assess if greater unpredictability of prenatal maternal mood predicts child temperament and internalizing symptoms through early adolescence. Methods: The association between prenatal mood predictability and child internalizing symptoms were assessed in two longitudinal cohorts (N's = 227 and 180). Maternal mood was assessed repeatedly during pregnancy as early as 15 weeks’ gestation. Predictability of maternal mood was calculated by applying Shannon's entropy to the distribution of responses on mood questionnaires. Maternal reports of child negative affectivity (a predictor of later internalizing) were collected at 6, 12, 24 months and 7 years of age. Child self-reports of anxiety symptoms were collected at 10 years and reports of depression symptoms at 13 years. Results: Fetal exposure to more elevated maternal mood entropy predicted higher levels of child negative affectivity at 12 months (r = .36; p &lt; 01), 24 months (r = .31; p &lt; 01) and 7 years (r = .32; p &lt; 01) of age. In addition, children exposed to higher prenatal maternal mood entropy, reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms at 10 years (r = .24; p &lt; 01) and elevated depressive symptoms at 13 years (r = .29; p &lt; .01). These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal pre and postnatal mood valence (e.g. depression levels) and for other relevant demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Our findings provide strong support for the notion that patterns of maternal mood influence the developing brain. More specifically, they suggest that prenatal maternal mood predictability may be a critical predictor of developmental mental health trajectories and should be considered when assessing early life influences on lifespan mental health.

320,Major depressive disorder in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Prevalence and clinical characteristics,"Background: This study investigated the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We enrolled patients with at least one service claim for ambulatory or inpatient care with a principal diagnosis of MDD and at least two service claims for ambulatory care or one service claim for inpatient care with a principal diagnosis of T2DM, as listed in Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Results: We enrolled 715,756 people from the general population (GP), 61,589 patients with T2DM but without MDD, and 778 patients with both T2DM and MDD. The prevalence of MDD increased from 0.70% to 1.25% in the patients with T2DM, whereas it increased from 0.25% to 0.67% in the GP from 2000 to 2010. The higher prevalence of MDD was associated with the female sex, residing in the southern regions of Taiwan, and having comorbidities of cerebrovascular disease and anxiety disorder as well as higher comorbidity severity (Charlson comorbidity index, 1–2 and &gt; 2). Limitations: One limitation is the use of secondary data on diagnoses of MDD and T2DM. Another limitation is that we could not access some crucial related variables. Conclusions: The prevalence of MDD was higher in the patients with T2DM than in the GP. In this study, the prevalence of MDD in the patients with T2DM was lower than that reported in Western countries.

321,"Alexithymia, not fibromyalgia, predicts the attribution of pain to anger-related facial expressions","Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain, occurring predominantly in women. Previous studies have shown that patients with FM display a pattern of selective processing or cognitive bias which fosters the encoding of pain-related information. The present study tested the hypothesis of an increased attribution of pain to facial expressions of emotions (FEE), in patients with FM. As previous studies have shown that alexithymia influences the processing of facial expressions, independent of specific clinical conditions, we also investigated whether alexithymia, rather than FM per se, influenced attribution of pain to FEE. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three women (41 with FM, 82 healthy controls, HC) were enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study. We adopted two pain-attribution tasks, the Emotional Pain Estimation and the Emotional Pain Ascription, both using a modified version of the Ekman 60 Faces Test. Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and alexithymia was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Patients with FM did not report increased attribution of pain to FEE. Alexithymic individuals demonstrated no specific problem in the recognition of basic emotions, but attributed significantly more pain to angry facial expression. Limitations: Our study involved a relatively small sample size. The use of self-reported instruments might have led to underestimation of the presence of frank alexithymia in individuals having borderline cut-off scores. Conclusions: Alexithymia, rather than FM per se, plays a key role in explaining the observed differences in pain attribution to anger-related facial expressions.

322,Engagement in mobile phone app for self-monitoring of emotional wellbeing predicts changes in mental health: MoodPrism,"Background: Mobile apps are being used increasingly for mental health purposes, but evidence of their efficacy remains limited. The mechanisms underlying any effects of such apps are also unclear. This study examined the effectiveness of a self-monitoring mobile phone app by investigating the relationships between app engagement and mental health outcomes. Method: Participants downloaded the MoodPrism app from the iOS and Android app stores, completing in-app assessments at start of use and again 30 days later. The app prompted participants daily to complete a short mood questionnaire and formulated their responses into a mood diary. Data from 234 assessment completers (73% female; M age = 34.8 years) were analysed via hierarchical and mediation regressions. Results: In this community sample, app engagement ratings predicted decreases in depression and anxiety, and increases in mental well-being. These effects were mediated by increases in emotional self-awareness, but only for participants who were clinically depressed or anxious at the time of the baseline assessment. Mental health literacy and coping self-efficacy did not play mediating roles. Limitations: Findings suggest that other influential mediators may have not been measured, and future studies could verify the findings by using alternative methodologies, such as comparison with a control group. Conclusions: Engaging with an emotional wellbeing self-monitoring app may reduce depressive and anxious symptoms, and increase mental well-being. Increases in emotional self-awareness may mediate these changes in clinical populations, and further research is needed to reveal other mechanisms that mental health apps can utilize.

323,Changes in miRNA-132 and miR-124 levels in non-treated and citalopram-treated patients with depression,"Background: Neurotrophins including brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) are implicated in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, the roles of brain-specific BDNF-related miRNAs miR-132 and miR-124 are unclear. Methods: We enrolled 45 treatment-free patients with MDD, 32 citalopram-treated patients with MDD, and 32 healthy control subjects. Participants were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). In a case-control sub-study, we followed 14 treatment-free patients who were subsequently treated with citalopram for 2 months. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect plasma BDNF, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify relative plasma miR-132 and miR-124 expression. Results: Patients with MDD had significantly higher HAMA and HAMD scores than the control group, with the highest scores in the treatment-free MDD group. Plasma miR-132 in the treatment-free MDD group was 2.4-fold that in the control group and significantly higher than that in the citalopram-treated MDD group. Plasma miR- 124 in the treatment-free MDD and citalopram-treated MDD groups was 1.8-fold and 4-fold that in the control group, respectively. Compared to the control group, plasma BDNF levels were increased in both MDD groups, but not significantly different between them. There was a positive correlation between miR-132 and HAMD and HAMA scores, whereas no significant correlations were identified for plasma miR-124 or BDNF. Limitations: The range of neurotrophin-related MiRNAs and the number of follow-up cases were limited. Conclusions: BDNF and miR-124 in plasma increase with depression and antidepressants. Plasma MiR-132 might be an indication for depression status.

324,The centrality of DSM and non-DSM depressive symptoms in Han Chinese women with major depression,"Introduction: We compared DSM-IV criteria for major depression (MD) with clinically selected non-DSM criteria in their ability to represent clinical features of depression. Method: We conducted network analyses of 19 DSM and non-DSM symptoms of MD assessed at personal interview in 5952 Han Chinese women meeting DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MD. We estimated an Ising model (the state-of-the-art network model for binary data), compared the centrality (interconnectedness) of DSM-IV and non-DSM symptoms, and investigated the community structure (symptoms strongly clustered together). Results: The DSM and non-DSM criteria were intermingled within the same symptom network. In both the DSMIV and non-DSM criteria sets, some symptoms were central (highly interconnected) while others were more peripheral. The mean centrality of the DSM and non-DSM criteria sets did not significantly differ. In at least two cases, non-DSM criteria were more central than symptomatically related DSM criteria: lowered libido vs. sleep and appetite changes, and hopelessness versus worthlessness. The overall network had three sub-clusters reflecting neurovegetative/mood symptoms, cognitive changes and anxiety/irritability. Limitations: The sample were severely ill Han Chinese females limiting generalizability. Conclusions: Consistent with prior historical reviews, our results suggest that the DSM-IV criteria for MD reflect one possible sub-set of a larger pool of plausible depressive symptoms and signs. While the DSM criteria on average perform well, they are not unique and may not be optimal in their ability to describe the depressive syndrome.

325,Insular subdivisions functional connectivity dysfunction within major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive and affective deficits. Previous studies suggested that insula is a crucial node of the salience network for initiating network switching, and dysfunctional connection to this region may be related to the mechanism of MDD. In this study, we systematically investigated and quantified the altered functional connectivity (FC) of the specific insular subdivisions and its relationship to psychopathology of MDD. Methods: Resting-state FC of insular subdivisions, including bilateral ventral/dorsal anterior insula and posterior insula, were estimated in 19 MDD patients and 19 healthy controls. Abnormal FC was quantified between groups. Additionally, we investigated the relationships between insular connectivity and depressive symptom severity. Results: MDD patients demonstrated aberrant FC for insular subdivisions to superior temporal sulcus, inferior prefrontal gyrus, amygdala and posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, depression symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scorers) were associated with the FC values of insular subdivisions. Limitations: First, the sample size of our current study is relatively small, which may affect the statistic power. Second, using standardized insular subdivision seeds for FC analyses may neglect subtle natural differences in size and location of functional area across individuals and may thus affect connectivity maps. Conclusions: Abnormal FC of insular subdivisions to default network and central executive network may represent impaired intrinsic networks switching which may affect the underlying emotional and sensory disturbances in MDD. And our findings can help to understand the pathophysiology and underlying neural mechanisms of MDD.

326,Development of a prognostic model for predicting depression severity in adult primary patients with depressive symptoms using the &lt;i&gt;diamond&lt;/i&gt; longitudinal study,"Background: Depression trajectories among primary care patients are highly variable, making it difficult to identify patients that require intensive treatments or those that are likely to spontaneously remit. Currently, there are no easily implementable tools clinicians can use to stratify patients with depressive symptoms into different treatments according to their likely depression trajectory. We aimed to develop a prognostic tool to predict future depression severity among primary care patients with current depressive symptoms at three months. Methods: Patient-reported data from the diamond study, a prospective cohort of 593 primary care patients with depressive symptoms attending 30 Australian general practices. Participants responded affirmatively to at least one of the first two PHQ-9 items. Twenty predictors were pre-selected by expert consensus based on reliability, ease of administration, likely patient acceptability, and international applicability. Multivariable mixed effects linear regression was used to build the model. Results: The prognostic model included eight baseline predictors: sex, depressive symptoms, anxiety, history of depression, self-rated health, chronic physical illness, living alone, and perceived ability to manage on available income. Discrimination (c-statistic =0.74; 95% CI: 0.70–0.78) and calibration (agreement between predicted and observed symptom scores) were acceptable and comparable to other prognostic models in primary care. Limitations: More complex model was not feasible because of modest sample size. Validation studies needed to confirm model performance in new primary care attendees. Conclusion: A brief, easily administered algorithm predicting the severity of depressive symptoms has potential to assist clinicians to tailor treatment for adult primary care patients with current depressive symptoms.

327,Longitudinal association between mental disorders in childhood and subsequent depression—A nationwide prospective cohort study,"Background: Depression ranges among the most impairing mental disorders worldwide, and early detection is a global health priority. Little is known about the association between non-affective mental disorders in childhood/ adolescence and later depression. Methods: Nationwide register-based prospective cohort study, estimating cumulative incidences and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for later depression in individuals with and without non-affective mental disorders in early life. Results: 475,213 females and 484,813 males born 1990–2007 were followed for a mean of 9.14 years (contributing a total of 8778,331 person-years of observation). In the cohort, 7963 (5451 females) were diagnosed with depression. Depression was more common in individuals with prior non-affective mental disorders in adolescence (15.98% in females and 7.02% in males) and in childhood (4.98% in females and 1.6% in males), than in the background population (3.94% and 1.3% in females; 1.37% and 0.47% in males). Eating and anxiety disorders in childhood/adolescence carried the highest absolute risk of depression. The relative risk of depression was particularly high the first year after the first non-affective disorder (IRR = 15.5; 14.07–17.10), but remained highly elevated more than five years after the first non-affective diagnosis (IRR = 2.05; 1.84–2.28), when compared to young people without such disorders. Limitations: This study only included diagnoses given at hospital departments, representing the more severe mental disorders. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with non-affective mental disorders were at substantially increased absolute and relative risk of developing depression in young adulthood, especially females diagnosed with anxiety or eating disorders in adolescence. These findings may help identify groups of children and adolescents at very high risk of developing depression.

328,Evaluating an e-mental health program (“deprexis”) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Background: Depressive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions for depression have shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psychotherapy for depression. Methods: Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy plus a web-based depression program („deprexis“). Primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results: The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-group effect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = .51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on secondary outcomes (Cohen's d = .07–.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations: The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions: This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to consider in future treatment for depression.

329,Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments, and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods: Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results: Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations: The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions: Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.

330,"Acceptance alone is a better predictor of psychopathology and well-being than emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness","Emotional competence, emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance have all been strongly associated to emotional disorders and psychological well-being in multiple studies. However little research has compared the unique predictive ability of these different constructs. We hypothesised that they will all share a large proportion of common variance and that when compared to the broader constructs emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness, acceptance alone would predict a larger proportion of unique variance Methods: 228 participants from a community sample completed anonymously measures of anxiety, depression, happiness, acceptance, mindfulness, emotional competence and emotion regulation. We then ran multiple regressions to assess and compare the predictive ability of these different constructs. Results: For measures of psychological distress, the acceptance measure uniquely accounted for between 4 and 30 times the variance that the emotional competence, emotion regulation and mindfulness measures did. Limitations: These results are based on cross-sectional designs and non-clinical samples, longitudinal and experimental studies as clinical samples may be useful in order to assess the potential protective power of acceptance over time. Another limitation is the use of self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: Results confirmed our hypothesis, supporting the research on the importance of acceptance as a central factor in the understanding of the onset and maintenance of emotional disorders.

331,Elevation of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in schizophrenia patients,"Background: Psychiatric diseases are usually accompanied by immune dysregulation and activation of the inflammatory response system. However, the characteristics of immunoinflammatory markers in psychiatric diseases are not well defined. Methods: Seventy-three patients with psychiatric diseases were divided into four groups, including a schizophrenia group, an anxiety disorder group, a unipolar depression group, and a bipolar disorder group, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and associated classical immunoinflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), total leukocyte count (TLC), and neutrophilic granulocyte percentage (NEU%) were analysed; patients with physical diseases were excluded to avoid confounders. Fifteen healthy, age- and gender-matched individuals served as controls. Results: Compared with the corresponding values in the control group, the level of CRP in each psychiatric disease group, the levels of IFN-γ and NGAL in the schizophrenia group, and the NEU% in the depression group were significantly elevated (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the levels in the schizophrenia group, the levels of CRP in the bipolar disorder and depression groups, the level of IFN-γ in the bipolar disorder group, and the levels of NGAL in the anxiety disorder and depression groups were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the depression group, the bipolar disorder group showed significant elevation the NGAL level. Limitation: The sample size was relatively small. Conclusions: Immunoinflammatory markers were elevated in patients with psychiatric diseases, especially schizophrenia. We are the first to report that the level of NGAL is significantly increased in schizophrenia patients.

332,Group-based multicomponent treatment to reduce depressive symptoms in women with co-morbid psychiatric and psychosocial problems during pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Depressive symptoms in pregnant women, which are common and debilitating, are often co-morbid with other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety and personality disorders), and related to low socioeconomic status (SES). This situation may hamper treatment outcome, which has often been neglected in previous studies on the treatment of depression during pregnancy. We developed a new group-based multicomponent treatment (GMT) comprising cognitive behavioral therapy, psycho-education and body-oriented therapy and compared the effect on depressive symptoms with individual counseling (treatment as usual, TAU) in a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES. Methods: An outpatient sample from a university hospital of 158 pregnant women who met DSM-IV criteria for mental disorders were included and 99 participants were randomized to GMT or TAU from January 2010 until January 2013. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) was used at baseline, every 5 weeks during pregnancy and as the primary outcome measure of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcome measures included the clinician-reported Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), obstetric outcomes and a ‘Patient Satisfaction’ questionnaire. Results: 155 participants were included the intention-to-treat (ITT)-analysis. GMT was not superior above TAU according to estimated EDS (β = 0.13, CI = − 0.46–0.71, p = 0.67) and HDRS scores (β = − 0.39, CI = − 0.82–0.05, p = 0.08) at 6 weeks postpartum. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the GMT and TAU, nor between the randomized condition and patient-preference condition. Limitations: The ability to detect an effect of GMT may have been limited by sample size, missing data and the ceiling effect of TAU. Conclusions: GMT is an acceptable treatment for a heterogeneous group of pregnant women with depressive symptoms and co-morbid mental disorders and/or low SES, but not superior to TAU. Further research should focus on understanding and treating co-morbid disorders and psychosocial problems during pregnancy.

333,A study in the general population about sadness to disentangle the continuum from well-being to depressive disorders,"Objective: Sadness is both a common experience in general population and one of the main criteria of major depressive disorder (MDD). We tested the hypothesis of a depressive continuum using sadness as an intermediate experience between well-being and disorder. Methods: A French cross-sectional Mental Health survey in General Population interviewed 38,694 individuals. We examined prevalences and compared sociodemographic correlates and psychiatric disorders of individuals in 3 independent groups 1) MDD, 2) sadness without MDD, and 3) controls. Results: The prevalence of sadness was of 29.8% in the whole sample and of 93% in subjects suffering from MDD (n = 4976). The “sadness” group shared the same sociodemographic patterns as the “MDD” group. All psychiatric disorders assessed (i.e. bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, psychotic disorder and suicide attempts) were significantly associated with both “sadness” and “MDD” groups compared to “controls”. Individuals with sadness, compared to those with MDD, were significantly less likely to meet the criteria for all psychiatric disorders. MDD's sensitivity of sadness was 94,2%. Limitations: Even though we used a quota sampling method, the sample was not strictly representative of the general population. Conclusion: Sadness validates the depressive continuum hypothesis, since it is more frequent in the general population than MDD itself and at the same time shares with MDD the same sociodemographic and clinical correlates. A gradual association from controls to MDD was observed for psychiatric comorbidities. Finally, the high sensitivity of sadness may suggest its use to screen at-risk individuals converting from well-being to full psychiatric disorders.

334,"The associations between problematic Facebook use, psychological distress and well-being among adolescents and young adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: A growing body of research has analyzed the potential risks of problematic Facebook use for mental health and well-being. The current meta-analysis is the first to examine the associations between problematic Facebook use, psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) and well-being (life satisfaction, positive mental health) among adolescents and young adults. Method: A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies in PsychInfo, Pubmed, Scopus, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar. Results: The final sample included 23 independent samples with a total of 13,929 participants (60.7% females; M age = 21.93, range: 16.5–32.4). Results of random effects meta-analysis confirmed a positive correlation between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress ( r = .34, 95% CI [.28, .39]). Moderation analysis revealed that effect sizes were larger in older samples. Moreover, a negative correlation between problematic Facebook use and well-being was observed ( r = −.22, 95% CI [−.28, −.15]). Limitations: All available studies used a cross-sectional design thus hampering the possibility to establish the direction of the association between problematic Facebook use and psychological distress and well-being. Conclusions: Results are discussed within the extant literature on problematic Facebook use and future research directions are proposed. This research may also inform clinical and prevention interventions on problematic Facebook use.

335,Video game addiction in emerging adulthood: Cross-sectional evidence of pathology in video game addicts as compared to matched healthy controls,"Background: The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS) is a widely used measure of video game addiction, a pathology affecting a small percentage of all people who play video games. Emerging adult males are significantly more likely to be video game addicts. Few researchers have examined how people who qualify as video game addicts based on the IGDS compared to matched controls based on age, gender, race, and marital status. Method: The current study compared IGDS video game addicts to matched non-addicts in terms of their mental, physical, social-emotional health using self-report, survey methods. Results: Addicts had poorer mental health and cognitive functioning including poorer impulse control and ADHD symptoms compared to controls. Additionally, addicts displayed increased emotional difficulties including increased depression and anxiety, felt more socially isolated, and were more likely to display internet pornography pathological use symptoms. Female video game addicts were at unique risk for negative outcomes. Limitations: The sample for this study was undergraduate college students and self-report measures were used. Conclusions: Participants who met the IGDS criteria for video game addiction displayed poorer emotional, physical, mental, and social health, adding to the growing evidence that video game addictions are a valid phenomenon.

336,Sleep disturbance may impact treatment outcome in bipolar disorder: A preliminary investigation in the context of a large comparative effectiveness trial,"Background: Bipolar patients experience sleep disturbances during and between mood episodes. Yet the impact of sleep on treatment with different medications has not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential impact of poor sleep at baseline on outcomes in a randomized effectiveness trial of quetiapine and lithium. Methods: The Bipolar CHOICE study was a 6-month, parallel group, multisite randomized controlled trial. Participants with bipolar disorder (N = 482; 59% female and age 18–70 years) received quetiapine or lithium. Patients were allowed to also receive adjunctive personalized treatments, which were guideline-informed, empirically- based medications added to treatment as needed. Medication changes were recorded as necessary clinical adjustments (NCA). Fisher's exact tests, mixed-regression models, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess demographic and clinical characteristics as well as whether sleep disturbance would predict outcomes. Results: 63% of patients had baseline sleep disturbance. Individuals with sleep disturbance had worse bipolar illness severity, greater severity of depression, mania, anxiety, irritability, and psychosis, were less likely to have sustained response (17% vs. 29%; adjusted RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38–0.78, p = 0.0006) and had more NCAs (median 0.71 vs. 0.59, p = 0.03). Limitations: Our findings were limited by how we defined sleep disturbance, and by how severity of sleep disturbance was assessed with one item with a non-sleep specific measure. Conclusions: Baseline sleep disturbance was associated with more severe bipolar symptoms and worse 6-month outcomes. Further research is warranted on improving sleep in bipolar disorder, especially the role of psychosocial interventions.

337,Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care,"Background: Attachment theory posits that attachment has a persistent, long-term impact on depression. Empirical data on associations between adult attachment and the long-term course of depression is, however, scarce. The present study addresses this omission. Method: Primary care patients with a history of depression ( n = 103) completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire measuring adult attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and styles (secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful). The subsequent seven-year course of depression was assessed with the face-to-face administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and a life-chart interview based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). At the end of the seven-year follow-up severity of depression was additionally measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: The attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety both showed significant associations during the seven-year course with lower proportions of depressive symptom-free time and higher severity of depression (LIFE and BDI). The secure style predicted compared to preoccupied attachment a significantly higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 1.10 years), compared to dismissing attachment a higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 2.20 years) and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.14; BDI 6.04 vs. 9.52), and compared to fearful attachment a lower relapse/recurrence rate (45.7% vs. 76.9%), higher proportions of depression diagnosis-free time (7.31 vs. 6.65 years) and symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 0.29 years), and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.19; BDI 6.04 vs. 15.54). Limitations: Sample size was restricted. Conclusion: Insecure attachment predicts an unfavorable course of depression over a seven-year period.

338,Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the longitudinal treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder with fear of harm phenotype,"Objectives: Fear of Harm (FOH) is a pediatric onset phenotype of bipolar disorder (BD) characterized by BD plus treatment resistance, separation anxiety, aggressive obsessions, parasomnias, and thermal dysregulation. Intranasal ketamine (InK) in 12 youths with BD-FOH produced marked improvement during a two-week trial. Here we report on the open effectiveness and safety of InK in maintenance treatment of BD-FOH from the private practice of one author. Methods: As part of a chart review, patients 18 years or older and parents of younger children responded to a clinical effectiveness and safety survey. Effectiveness was assessed from analysis of responses to 49 questions on symptomatology plus qualitative content analyses of written reports and chart review. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed by frequency, duration and severity. Peak InK doses ranged from 20 to 360 mg per administration. Results: Surveys were completed on 45 patients treated with InK for 3 months to 6.5 years. Almost all patients were “much” to “very much” improved clinically and in ratings of social function and academic performance. Significant reductions were reported in all symptom categories. There were 13 reports of persistent AEs, none of which resulted in discontinuation. Acute emergence reactions were sporadically observed in up to 75%, but were mild and of brief duration. Limitations: Retrospective review from a single practice without placebo control with potential for response and recall bias. Conclusions: InK every 3–4 days at sub-anesthetic doses appeared to be a beneficial and well-tolerated treatment. Use of InK may be considered as a tertiary alternative in treatment refractory cases. Randomized control trials are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
339,Meta-analytic review of the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on threat processing in humans,"Background: Heightened threat sensitivity is a transdiagnostic feature in several psychiatric disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to reduce fear related behaviours and facilitated fear extinction in animals. These findings have led to increasing interest to explore the effects of intranasal oxytocin on threat processing in humans. Methods: The review included 26 studies (N = 1173), nine of which included clinical populations (N = 234). The clinical groups included were people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence disorder. We examined the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on startle response, attentional responses, and behavioural responses to threat. Results: A single dose of intranasal oxytocin significantly increased the physiological startle response to threat in healthy people with a small effect size. However, oxytocin did not have significant effects on attentional bias towards social or disorder-specific threat, fixation towards threatening stimuli among healthy or clinical populations, or on threat related behavioural approach or avoidance responses. Limitations: No studies investigated the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations. Additionally, only one of the reviewed studies had sufficient power to detect at least a moderate effect of oxytocin according to our criterion. Discussion: The synthesis of literature suggest that oxytocin may influence the salience of threatening stimuli among healthy individuals, increasing the startle response to threat. It would be of interest to investigate the effects of oxytocin on the startle response to threat among clinical populations.

340,The classification of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms in male and female adolescents,"Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) was categorised in DSM-5 within the newly created ‘obsessive-compulsive and related disorders’ chapter, however this classification remains subject to debate. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test competing models of the co-occurrence of symptoms of BDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, unipolar depression, anxiety, and eating disorders in a community sample of adolescents, and to explore potential sex differences in these models. Methods: Self-report questionnaires assessing disorder symptoms were completed by 3149 Australian adolescents. The fit of correlated factor models was calculated separately in males and females, and measurement invariance testing compared parameters of the best-fitting model between males and females. Results: All theoretical models of the classification of BDD had poor fit to the data. Good fit was found for a novel model where BDD symptoms formed a distinct latent factor, correlated with affective disorder and eating disorder latent factors. Metric non-invariance was found between males and females, and the majority of factor loadings differed between males and females. Correlations between some latent factors also differed by sex. Limitations: Only cross-sectional data were collected, and the study did not assess a broad range of DSM-5 defined eating disorder symptoms or other disorders in the DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorders chapter. Conclusions: This study is the first to statistically evaluate competing models of BDD classification. The findings highlight the unique features of BDD and its associations with affective and eating disorders. Future studies examining the classification of BDD should consider developmental and sex differences in their models.

341,Music-based interventions to reduce internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis,"Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted. Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = −0.73; 95%CI [−1.42;−0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions ( n = 100) compared to different control group interventions ( n = 95). Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design. Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed.

342,Reduced white matter integrity in borderline personality disorder: A diffusion tensor imaging study,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions. BPD may be linked to an abnormal brain anatomy, but little is known about possible impairments of the white matter microstructure in BPD or their relationship with impulsivity or risky behaviors. The aims of the present study were to explore the relationship between BPD and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and psychological tests. Methods: We evaluated 35 un-medicated BPD patients in a medication-free state and 50 healthy controls (HCs). We performed DTI tractography in BPD patients and HCs. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Profile of Mood State (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), and Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to BPD patients and HCs. Results: A tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) revealed that the BPD group had three clusters with a significantly lower axial diffusivity (AD) than the HC group: one located mainly in the cingulum and the other mainly in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Regarding the AD values, one cluster correlated negatively and significantly with POMS (Depression) and it was located in the cingulum, while another cluster correlated positively and significantly with DACS (Future Denial) and it was located in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Limitations: The small sample size of this study prevents us from forming any definitive conclusions, meaning that more studies are needed to confirm our findings. We are unable to generalize our findings to include other ethnic groups. Conclusions: Our results suggested that hypo-metabolism in a front-limbic network dysfunction is characterized by the cingulum and a front-occipital network dysfunction characterized by the occipital lobe, while an occipitaltemporal network dysfunction characterized by the inferior longitudinal fasciculus.

343,The relationship between cognitions and symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: The cognitive theory of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ascertains that catastrophic (mis) interpretations of normally occurring intrusive thoughts are related to the maintenance of OCD. Nonetheless, findings supporting the relationship between cognitive biases and OCD symptoms are largely inconsistent. In the present study we examined the relationship between OCD cognitions and symptoms among 382 OCD patients participating in the longitudinal Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association (NOCDA) study. Methods: OCD cognitions and OC, anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report questionnaires at baseline and at two-year follow-up. Baseline multiple regression analyses assessed the specificity of OC cognitions to OCD symptoms. Cross-lagged analyses examined whether cognitions predict OCD symptoms at two-year follow up. Results: Baseline analyses demonstrated significant relationships between comorbid anxiety, depressive severity and OC cognitions, adjusted for OCD symptoms (β =.283, p &lt; .001 and β =.246, p &lt; .001, respectively). OCD severity adjusted for comorbid symptoms was unrelated to cognitions at baseline (β = .040, p = n.s). Unique associations were found between cognitions and two OCD symptom subtypes (Impulses: β = .215, p &lt; .001; Rumination/doubting: β = .205, p &lt; .001). Longitudinal analyses yielded non-significant associations between OCD cognitions and symptom severity. Prospective analyses of cognitions and OCD symptom subtypes yielded significant effects for both bidirectional and unidirectional associations (β = .11–.16, p &lt; .05). Limitations: Given the naturalistic design of the study, we did not assess therapeutic interventions between baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Results only partially concord with the predictions of the cognitive theory of OCD. Future studies should focus on mechanisms alternative to cognitions when investigating the course of OCD.

156,Prenatal stress and child development: A scoping review of research in low- and middle-income countries,"Introduction: Past research has shown relationships between stress during pregnancy, and related psychosocial health measures such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, with infant, child, and adult outcomes. However, most research is from high-income countries. We conducted a scoping review to identify research studies on prenatal stress and outcomes of the pregnancy or offspring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to synthesize the stress measures and outcomes assessed, the findings observed, and directions for future research. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for English-language abstracts published from Jan 1960-Jan 2017. Search terms were related to stress and psychosocial health; pregnancy; infant or child development; and LMICs. Results: 48 articles were identified. Sixty percent of studies were in upper-middle, 25% in lower-middle, and 15% in low income countries. Most studies used questionnaires, either existing or tailor-made, to assess stress. Eight assessed cortisol. Most studies (n = 31) assessed infant outcomes at birth, particularly gestational age or preterm birth (n = 22, 12 showing significant relationships), and birthweight (n = 21, 14 showing significant relationships). Five studies analyzed outcomes later in infancy such as temperament and motor development, all showing significant results; and nine in childhood such as behavioral development, asthma, and physical growth, with eight showing significant results. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of prenatal stress on infant and child outcomes in LMICs. Methods used in high-income countries are successfully employed in LMICs, but tailored tools remain necessary. Careful assessment of covariates is needed to foster analyses of interactive effects and pathways. Studies including longer-term follow-up should be prioritized.

157,Adult attachment and social anxiety: The mediating role of emotion regulation strategies,"Despite extensive evidence relating attachment dimensions to maladaptive interpersonal behaviours and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, few studies have explored social anxiety in the context of adult attachment dimensions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are associated with symptoms of social anxiety and whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression) play a role in the relationship between adult attachment and social anxiety. A sample of 253 adults (male n = 47, 18.6%; female n = 202, 79.8%; gender not disclosed n = 4, 1.6%) ranging in age from 18 to 74 years (M = 33.12, SD = 11.56) completed an online questionnaire that consisted of the Experience in Close Relationships–Revised Questionnaire (ECR-R); The Inventory of Interpersonal Situations Discomfort scale (IIS-D); and The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Results indicated that both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have a direct effect on indices of social anxiety symptomology. Reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and social anxiety. However, the relationship between attachment avoidance and social anxiety was not mediated by the use of reappraisal and suppression. Findings of the study have implications for the development of clinical interventions targeting mediators of psychological distress associated with social anxiety.

158,Autonomic changes induced by precompetitive stress in cyclists in relation to physical fitness and anxiety,"Cycling is a sport which requires great physical effort from athletes. The stress and anxiety of competition might interfere greatly with performance, by impacting the autonomic system. Physiological alterations, such as situations that irritate, frighten or excite the individual can cause a stress response, defined as a response of the organism to reestablish the homeostasis, regardless of its relationship to a sports situation. The aim of this study was to present data on the autonomic changes induced by precompetitive stress in cyclists and their relation with physical fitness and anxiety. Twelve healthy cyclists aged between 18 and 40 years, with previous experience in competition at the regional level, participated in the study. Heart rate variability (HRV) and physical fitness (body mass index, body fat and aerobic capacity) were measured 5 days before the Mountain Bike championship and remeasured 45 minutes before the start of the race (HRV and Anxiety). Paired T test, effect size and correlational test were used. Cycling competition is a stressful situation capable of altering autonomic and hemodynamic parameters. We observed the increase in SDNN, reflecting an increase in sympathetic autonomic control. There were correlations between physical fitness with some autonomic parameters, while anxiety correlated with the years of experience in competition.

159,Impact of central and peripheral estrogen treatment on anxiety and depression phenotypes in a mouse model of postmenopausal obesity,"Obesity and diabetes increase the risk of depression, and the incidence of these conditions increases rapidly after menopause, but few animal models of postmenopausal obesity have been available. We developed a mouse model of postmenopausal obesity that exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in behavioral tests. To examine the effect of estradiol (E2) in the model, we prepared 4 experimental groups: 1) control, sham-operated female C57BL/6 mice fed a regular diet; 2) OVX-HF, ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high-fat diet (HF); 3) E2-SC, OVX-HF mice administered subcutaneous (SC) E2 (50 μg/kg/day); and 4) E2-ICV, OVX-HF mice administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) E2 (1 μg/kg/day). OVX-HF mice exhibited anxiety phenotypes in the open field test, but not in the light-dark box test, and E2 treatment via both routes effectively ameliorated it. OVX-HF mice demonstrated depressive phenotypes in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Both E2 treatments achieved significant improvement in the tail suspension test, but not in the forced swim test. Serum corticosterone levels did not differ among the groups. Hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and serotonin 1A receptor mRNA was significantly increased in OVX-HF mice and was decreased in E2-treated mice. The hypothalamic level of probrain- derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) protein was tended to decrease in OVX-HF mice, but neither E2 treatment increased it. Since this mouse model exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in relatively short experimental periods without genetic manipulations, it would be useful for further exploring psychiatric phenotypes or screening of therapeutic candidates in postmenopausal obesity.

160,"Prevalence, distribution, and associated factors of suicide attempts in young adolescents: School-based data from 40 low-income and middle-income countries","Suicide attempts are the most important known predictor of death by suicide. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence, distribution, and associated factors of suicide attempts among young adolescents in 40 low-income and middle-income countries. We used data from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (2009–2013) and a nationally representative study in China (2010), which are school-based surveys of students primarily aged 12–18 years that assess health behaviors using an anonymous, standardized, self-reported questionnaire. We calculated the prevalence of suicide attempts in young adolescents from 40 low-income and middle-income countries using the surveys. Multilevel logistic models were used to estimate the associations between suicide attempts and potential risk factors, adjusting for gender, age, school and survey year. Results show that the mean 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts was 17.2%, ranging from 6.7% in Malaysia to 61.2% in Samoa. The overall prevalence of suicide attempts was higher for girls than for boys (18.2% vs 16.2%, P &lt; 0.05). Among the suicide attempts, the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan was higher for girls than for boys (62.7% vs 53.2%, P &lt; 0.05). Both the prevalence of suicide attempts and the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan increased with age. Factors associated with suicide attempts included poor socioeconomic status, history of bullying, loneliness and anxiety, tobacco and alcohol use, and weak family and social relationships. In conclusion, suicide attempts are frequent among young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries. Girls and older adolescents tend to make suicide attempts with a plan. The data demonstrate the need to strengthen suicide intervention and prevention programs for young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries.

Tamara Escrivá-Martinez is not affiliated with #1 but with #2 Department of Personality, Evaluation and Psychological Treatment, Faculty of Psychology, Universitat de València, Valencia, Spain.] It is well established that repeated social defeat stress can induce negative long-term consequences such as increased anxiety-like behavior and enhances the reinforcing effect of psychostimulants in rodents. In the current study, we evaluated how the immune system may play a role in these long-term effects of stress. A total of 148 OF1 mice were divided into different experimental groups according to stress condition (exploration or social defeat) and pre-treatment (saline, 5 or 10 mg/kg of the anti-inflammatory indomethacin) before each social defeat or exploration episode. Three weeks after the last social defeat, anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus maze paradigm. After this test, conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced by a subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg). Biological samples were taken four hours after the first and the fourth social defeat, 3 weeks after the last defeat episode, and after the CPP procedure. Plasma and brain tissue (prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus) were used to determine the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Results showed an increase of peripheral and brain IL-6 levels after the first and fourth social defeat that was reverted three weeks later. Intraperitoneal administration of the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin before each episode of stress prevented this enhancement of IL-6 levels and also reversed the increase in the rewarding effects of cocaine in defeated mice. Conversely, this protective effect was not observed with respect to the anxiogenic consequences of social stress. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a modulatory proinflammatory contribution to stress-induced vulnerability to drug abuse disorders and highlight anti-inflammatory interventions as a potential therapeutic tool to treat stress-related addiction disorders.

162,The courses of maternal and paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during the prenatal period in the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study,"Maternal prenatal symptoms of depression and anxiety have been suggested to impose differential effects on later offspring development, depending on their characteristics, such as timing, intensity and persistence. Paternal symptoms have been less investigated. While knowledge on these trajectory characteristics is essential for improved comprehension of prenatal stress, prospective studies including both expecting parents have been scarce. We aim at identifying and comparing the trajectories of prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms in both parents in a pregnancy cohort design. The sample included 3202 mothers and 2076 fathers who were recruited to the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study (www.finnbrain.fi). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and general anxiety by the anxiety scale of the Symptom Checklist -90 (SCL-90) repeatedly at 14, 24, and 34 gestational weeks. Five differential depressive and four anxiety symptom trajectories were identified across pregnancy both in mothers and in fathers. The trajectories of consistently low depressive or anxiety symptoms were associated with higher educational level in both parents, and with nulliparity and non-smoking during pregnancy in mothers. Parents with consistently high or increasing levels of symptoms had more often prenatal SSRI medication. The congruences between elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms at any point in pregnancy, as well as parental trajectories within families were low. However, in this population-based sample, the self-reported symptom levels of both parents were generally very low. Variance in timing and persistence of parent-reported prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms is potentially important, while symptom trajectories are very similar in mothers and fathers. These differential symptom trajectories and the significance of their correlates should be acknowledged when studying prenatal stress exposures and the related outcomes in children.

163,The effectiveness of art therapy for anxiety in adults: A systematic review of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials,"Background: Anxiety disorders are one of the most diagnosed mental health disorders. Common treatment consists of cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. In clinical practice, also art therapy is additionally provided to patients with anxiety (disorders), among others because treatment as usual is not sufficiently effective for a large group of patients. There is no clarity on the effectiveness of art therapy (AT) on the reduction of anxiety symptoms in adults and there is no overview of the intervention characteristics and working mechanisms. Methods: A systematic review of (non-)randomised controlled trials on AT for anxiety in adults to evaluate the effects on anxiety symptom severity and to explore intervention characteristics, benefitting populations and working mechanisms. Thirteen databases and two journals were searched for the period 1997 –October 2017. The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017080733) and performed according to the Cochrane recommendations. PRISMA Guidelines were used for reporting. Results: Only three publications out of 776 hits from the search fulfilled the inclusion criteria: three RCTs with 162 patients in total. All studies have a high risk of bias. Study populations were: students with PTSD symptoms, students with exam anxiety and prisoners with prelease anxiety. Visual art techniques varied: trauma-related mandala design, collage making, free painting, clay work, still life drawing and house-tree-person drawing. There is some evidence of effectiveness of AT for pre-exam anxiety in undergraduate students. AT is possibly effective in reducing pre-release anxiety in prisoners. The AT characteristics varied and narrative synthesis led to hypothesized working mechanisms of AT: induce relaxation; gain access to unconscious traumatic memories, thereby creating possibilities to investigate cognitions; and improve emotion regulation. Conclusions: Effectiveness of AT on anxiety has hardly been studied, so no strong conclusions can be drawn. This emphasizes the need for high quality trials studying the effectiveness of AT on anxiety.

164,"Grit is associated with lower level of depression and anxiety among university students in Chiang Mai, Thailand: A cross-sectional study","Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are prevalent among university students in both developed and developing settings. Recently, grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has emerged as an indicator of success and well-being. However, the relationship between grit and poor mental health outcomes among university students is largely unknown. The current study investigates the relationship of grit with depression and anxiety among university students in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2018 among university students aged 18–24 years from Chiang Mai University, the first largest university in Chiang Mai Province. Depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scales, respectively. Grit was measured using the 8-item Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S). Grit scores were grouped into three categories: low (below the 25 th percentile); average (from the 25 th to the 75 th percentiles); and high (above the 75 th percentile). The other covariates included variables such self-esteem and socio-demographic variables. Results: Of the 800 participants included in the study, 405 (50.6%) were female and 395 (49.4%) were male. Respectively 21.4% and 7.8% of the participants had depression and clinical symptoms of GAD. Increasing levels of grit negatively correlated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Participants with high level of grit scored respectively 1.69 points ( P &lt; 0.001) and 1.71 points ( P &lt; 0.001) lower on the PHQ-9 scale and GAD-7 scores. Similarly, self-esteem was negatively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the negative correlation of grit with poor mental health outcomes, particularly depression and anxiety. Interventions designed to improve grit could play an essential role in the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes among university students.

165,Randomized controlled trial of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral intervention for Afro-descendants’ survivors of systemic violence in Colombia,"Background: Exposure to violence has negative consequences on mental health. Armed-conflict in Colombia has widely affected Afro-descendants in the Pacific region. Evidence regarding effectiveness of mental health interventions is lacking in low-income settings, especially in areas with active conflict. The objective of this study is to evaluate an individualized Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), a transdiagnostic psychotherapy model based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, for adult trauma survivors. Methods and findings: A referred sample of 521 adult Afro-descendants from Buenaventura and Quibdó, Colombia, experiencing significant sadness, suffering or fear (score &gt; 0.77 in Total Mental Health Symptoms), with history of traumatic experiences, and with associated functional impairment were randomly allocated to CETA intervention, standby group without intervention, but under monthly monitoring, or a Narrative Community-Based Group Therapy. CETA was provided by trained Lay Psychosocial Community Workers without previous mental health experience, supervised by psychologists, during 12–14 weekly, 1.5-hour sessions. Symptoms were assessed with a locally validated survey built based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the PTSD CheckList–Civilian Version, a qualitative study for additional general symptoms and a gender-specific functional impairment scale. CETA was compared with the control group and the intervention effects were calculated with mixed models using intention to treat analysis. Participant completion of follow-up was 75.1% and 13.2% voluntarily withdrew. Reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms was significant in both municipalities when comparing intervention and control groups (mean difference), with a with a moderate effect size in Buenaventura (Cohen’s d = 0.70) and a small effect size in Quibdó (d = 0.31). In Buenaventura, the intervention also had significant effects on depression (large effect size d = 1.03), anxiety (large effect size d = 0.80) and functional impairment (moderate effect size d = 0.70). In Quibdó, it had no significant effect on these outcomes. Changes in Total Mental Health Symptoms were not significant in neither city. Conclusions: This trial suggests that CETA, can be effective in improving depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and function among victims of systematized violence in low-income and active conflict settings. Nonetheless, the difference of effectiveness between the two cities of intervention may indicate that we cannot assume that a mental health intervention known to be effective in one setting will be effective in another, even in similar circumstances and population. This may have special importance when implementing and reproducing these types of intervention in non-controlled circumstances. Further research should address these concerns. Results can be of use by governmental decision-makers when defining mental health programs for survivors.

166,Students from single-sex schools are more gender-salient and more anxious in mixed-gender situations: Results from high school and college samples,"Gender segregation exists in all walks of life. One of the most common forms of institutionalized gender segregation is perhaps single-sex schooling. Because schooling experience has important influence on students’ psychosocial development, interest in gender-segregated education has been reviving over the globe. Skeptics of single-sex schooling have suggested that such schooling may increase students’ gender salience (awareness of gender in categorizations), reduce opportunities for mixed-gender interactions, and increase mixed-gender anxiety, but little evidence has been found. It is critical to explore how single-sex schooling is associated with these psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and young adults because they are in the developmental stage when the desire and need to establish mixed-gender relationships increase. We report two systematic studies on gender salience, mixed-gender friendships, and mixed-gender anxiety on 2059 high school students and 456 college students from single-sex or coeducational schools. Even with demographic background controlled, results suggested higher gender salience in single-sex school students in the high school sample, and greater mixed-gender anxiety and fewer mixed-gender friendships in these students in both samples. These differences were not moderated by student gender and were similar in first-year versus senior college students. Moreover, mixed-gender friendships, though not gender salience, appeared to engage in a possibly bi-directional mediation relationship with mixed-gender anxiety that is consistent with a vicious cycle of escalating anxiety and lack of mixed-gender interaction among single-sex school students. These findings help fill the knowledge gap about the correlates of gender-segregated schooling and shed light on the precursors of later social and achievement differences between single-sex and coeducational school students.

167,Does perceived ostracism contribute to mental health concerns among veterans who have been deployed?,"Posttraumatic stress–negative psychological experiences as a result of traumatic stressors–can hinder military veterans’ reintegration into society and cause various mental health problems. Veterans need quality social relationships to facilitate reintegration and to cope with posttraumatic stress and related mental health problems; discrimination or other forms of interpersonal rejection can exacerbate these veterans’ problems. Ostracism (i.e., being ignored and excluded) is a painful and psychologically distressing experience that may be one factor that contributes to the problems of veterans who are dealing with posttraumatic stress. To our knowledge, this connection has yet to be tested empirically. Thus, we investigated the correlation between posttraumatic stress, perceived ostracism, and other theoretically relevant variables (i.e., mental health problems, perceived social support, psychological need satisfaction) in a sample of veterans who have had at least one deployment. Our results provide preliminary empirical evidence suggesting that perceived ostracism may contribute to veteran’ deployment-related psychological problems. Veterans’ perceived ostracism correlated with psychological problems (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and psychological distress), and it explained additional variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms above and beyond common predictors of these symptoms (i.e., deployment stress, perceived military and civilian-based social support). Finally, perceived ostracism emerged as the most important predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms in a relative weights analysis.

168,Internal and external signal processing in patients with panic disorder: An event-related potential (ERP) study,"Self-absorption describes a pathological tendency towards the internal mental world (internalization) that often conflicts with the accurate monitoring of the external world. In performance monitoring, an augmented electrophysiological response evoked by internal signals in patients with anxiety or depressive disorder seems to reflect this tendency. Specifically, the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), an index of error processing based on internal signals, is larger in patients compared to controls. In the present experiment, we investigated whether the preferential processing of internal signals in patients is linked to diminished and inflexible external signal processing. To this end, the electrophysiological response evoked by external signals was analysed in patients with panic disorder and healthy controls. Participants performed a choice-response task, where informative or uninformative feedback followed each response, and a passive viewing task. As a replication of previous studies, patients presented an augmented Ne/ERN, indexing enhanced processing of internal signals related to errors. Furthermore, the vertex positive potential (VPP) evoked by visual stimuli was larger in patients than in controls, suggesting enhanced attention to external signals. Moreover, patients and controls showed similar sensitivity to the feedback information content, indicating a normal flexibility in the allocation of monitoring resources to external signals depending on how informative these signals are for performance monitoring. These results suggest that the tendency towards internal signals in patients with panic disorder does not hinder the flexible processing of external signals. On the contrary, external signals seem to attract enhanced processing in patients compared to controls.

169,Validity and reliability of the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) in family caregivers of children with chronic diseases,"Background: Information on the psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) in family caregivers of children with chronic diseases is currently unavailable, indicating a significant gap in the literature. Therefore, we investigated 1) which of the five evaluated measurement models had the best fit, 2) the scale’s reliability, and 3) the scale’s convergent validity. MethodS: In 2018, a cross-sectional ex post facto study with non-probability convenience sampling was conducted in 446 family caregivers of children with chronic diseases at the National Institute of Health in Mexico City; the family caregivers responded to the BDI-II and a battery of instruments measuring anxiety, caregiver burden, parental stress, well-being, and quality of life. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the fit of the five models. Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability were calculated to assess the scale’s reliability, and Spearman's rank correlation was used to investigate the scale’s convergent validity. Results: This study provided evidence that the two-factor somatic-affective and cognitive model had the best fit. The BDI-II demonstrated adequate reliability and evidence of convergent validity, as the BDI-II factors were positively correlated with anxiety, caregiver burden, and parental stress and negatively correlated with well-being and quality of life. Conclusions: The findings reveal that the BDI-II is a valid, reliable, and culturally relevant instrument to measure depression in family caregivers of children with chronic diseases.

170,Furious snarling: Teeth-exposure and anxiety-related attentional bias towards angry faces,"Dot-probe studies consistently show that high trait anxious individuals have an attentional bias towards threatening faces. However, little is known about the influence of perceptual confounds of specific emotional expressions on this effect. Teeth-exposure was recently recognized as an important factor for the occurrence of attentional bias towards angry faces in a closely related paradigm (the face-in-the-crowd paradigm). Therefore, we investigated the effect of exposed teeth on attentional bias towards angry faces in the dot-probe task. Participants ( N = 74) were asked to classify probe stimuli that were preceded by two simultaneously presented face cues, one angry and the other neutral. Half of the angry faces had exposed teeth, the other half had concealed teeth. Afterwards, participants completed the trait anxiety scale of the STAI. For angry faces with non-exposed teeth, we found the expected positive correlation ( r = .441) of trait anxiety with the attentional bias score (reaction times for probes replacing the neutral face minus reaction times for probes replacing the angry face). However, we found no influence of trait anxiety on attentional bias towards angry faces with exposed teeth. These results suggest that natural low-level stimulus confounds of emotional faces like exposed teeth can affect the manifestation of anxiety-related attentional biases towards angry faces in the dot-probe task.

171,"MRI-related anxiety in healthy individuals, intrinsic BOLD oscillations at 0.1 Hz in precentral gyrus and insula, and heart rate variability in low frequency bands","Participation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is associated with increased anxiety, thus possibly impacting baseline recording for functional MRI studies. The goal of the paper is to elucidate the significant hemispheric asymmetry between blood-oxygenation- level-dependent (BOLD) signals from precentral gyrus (PCG) and insula in 23 healthy individuals without any former MRI experience recently published in a PLOSONE paper. In addition to BOLD signals state anxiety and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed in two resting state sessions (R1, R2). Phase-locking and time delays from BOLD signals were computed in the frequency band 0.07–0.13 Hz. Positive (pTD) and negative time delays (nTD) were found. The pTD characterize descending neural BOLD oscillations spreading from PCG to insula and nTD characterize ascending vascular BOLD oscillations related to blood flow in the middle cerebral artery. HRV power in two low frequency bands 0.06–0.1 Hz and 0.1–0.14 Hz was computed. Based on the anxiety change from R1 to R2, two groups were separated: one with a strong anxiety decline (large change group) and one with a moderate decline or even anxiety increase (small change group). A significant correlation was found only between the left-hemispheric time delay (pTD, nTD) and anxiety change, with a dominance of nTD in the large change group. The analysis of within-scanner HRV revealed a pronounced increase of low frequency power between both resting states, dominant in the band 0.06–0.1 Hz in the large change group and in the band 0.1–0.14 Hz in the small change group. These results suggest different mechanisms related to anxiety processing in healthy individuals. One mechanism (large anxiety change) could embrace an increase of blood circulation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (vascular BOLD) and another (small anxiety change) translates to rhythmic central commands (neural BOLD) in the frequency band 0.1–0.14 Hz.

In the original article, there were errors in the Reference list. The errors were in References 11, 24, 25, 45 and 47. The corrected references are present in the erratum.] Resilience is a psychological characteristic which enhances personal assets and protects individuals from potential negative effects of various stressors. While this topic has been considered in the separate context of sports injuries and anxiety states, these issues have rarely been considered together. The objective of this study is to analyse the association between motivation to overcome injuries in football and the state of anxiety caused by those injuries. One hundred and eighty-five footballers from Spain were analysed by way of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, and an injury self-registration sheet. Statistical analyses were performed using structural equations. Results showed a direct and positive relationship between the capacity to face up to injuries or potential injuries and to adapt successfully to them for injured footballers, especially when anxiety was considered as a transitory emotional state. In addition, this relationship was stronger in non-injured sportspersons because their resilience capacity was not being impaired by the experience of an injury.

173,Relapse to smoking and health-related quality of life: Secondary analysis of data from a study of smoking relapse prevention,"Background: Previous studies have shown that smoking and smoking cessation may be associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this study, we compared changes in HRQoL in people who maintained abstinence with people who had relapsed to smoking. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from a trial of a relapse prevention intervention in 1,407 short-term quitters. The European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measured HRQoL at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Smoking outcome was continuous abstinence from 2 to 12 months, and 7-day smoking at 3 and 12 months. We used nonparametric test for differences in EQ-5D utility scores, and chi-square test for dichotomised response to each of the five EQ-5D dimensions. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between smoking relapse and HRQoL or anxiety/depression problems. Results: The mean EQ-5D tariff score was 0.8252 at baseline. People who maintained abstinence experienced a statistically non-significant increase in the EQ-5D score (mean change 0.0015, P = 0.88), while returning to smoking was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the EQ-5D score (mean change -0.0270, P = 0.004). After adjusting for multiple baseline characteristics, the utility change during baseline and 12 months was statistically significantly associated with continuous abstinence, with a difference of 0.0288 (95% CI: 0.0006 to 0.0571, P = 0.045) between relapsers and continuous quitters. The only difference in quality of life dimensions between those who relapsed and those who maintained abstinence was in the proportion of participants with anxiety/depression problems at 12 months (30% vs. 22%, P = 0.001). Smoking relapse was associated with a simultaneous increase in anxiety/depression problems. Conclusions: People who achieve short-term smoking abstinence but subsequently relapse to smoking have a reduced quality of life, which appears mostly due to worsening of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Further research is required to more fully understand the relationship between smoking and health-related quality of life, and to develop cessation interventions by taking into account the impact of anxiety or depression on smoking.

174,"Effect of behavioral inhibition system and childhood emotional neglect on serotonergic activity, negative affect, and rejection sensitivity in non-clinical adults","Introduction: Behavioral inhibition system (BIS) has a strong genetic basis, and emotional neglect (EN) in childhood is one of many environmental experiences that can affect individuals. This study aimed to examine the effects and interaction between BIS and EN on central serotonergic activity and other negative affect and cognition. Methods: A total of 153 non-clinical volunteers (54 men and 99 women; average age, 27.72 years, standard deviation = 6.40) were included in the analyses. The Behavioral Inhibition System scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and negative affect and cognition (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire) were measured. As a biomarker of central serotonergic activity, the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials was measured. Results: High EN was associated with higher loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) levels and low EN was associated with lower LDAEP levels in high BIS people only. People with high EN people showed significantly higher levels of depression and state anxiety than did those with low EN. Moreover, of people with low BIS, those who had more EN experience had higher levels of rejection sensitivity than did those with less EN experience, while people with high BIS did not show different patterns of rejection sensitivity regardless of the difference of EN. Conclusions: This study revealed different effects on physiological (loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials), intrapersonal (depression and state anxiety), and interpersonal aspects (rejection sensitivity) based on the interaction of BIS and EN. Our results suggest that the physiological and interpersonal aspects, but not the intrapersonal aspect, are significantly influenced by the interactive effect of BIS and EN.

175,Comorbidity and diagnosis distribution in transdiagnostic treatments for emotional disorders: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"The advantages of transdiagnostic protocols for emotional disorders (ED) (anxiety and depression) include the ability to treat multiple psychological disorders using the same treatment protocol, and the capacity to better address comorbidity. Comorbidity in ED has been associated with higher rates of severity, functional impairment, and chronicity. However, no attempts have been made in the literature to systematically review whether these studies include assessments to evaluate the treatment response in comorbid diagnoses, in addition to the principal diagnosis. Moreover, transdiagnostic treatments have been developed for a range of ED, but to date no study has analyzed the real distribution of diagnoses in these studies. The current study aimed to analyze: a) whether treatment response in comorbidity is evaluated in transdiagnostic treatments for ED; b) what diagnoses are targeted in transdiagnostic treatments for ED; and c) the real distribution of the diagnoses at baseline in these studies. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Fifty-two randomized controlled trials were identified, with a total of 7007 adult participants. The results showed that, although most of the studies reported data on comorbidity at baseline, only 40% of them examined the effects of the intervention on the comorbid disorders. The most commonly targeted diagnoses in transdiagnostic protocols were panic/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. Other disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety/depression not otherwise specified, were marginally included in these studies. Regarding the distribution of diagnoses at baseline, generalized anxiety, panic/agoraphobia, social anxiety, and depression were the most frequently observed, whereas depression not otherwise specified was the least represented. The results highlight the importance of assessing comorbidity in addition to the principal diagnoses in transdiagnostic treatments, in order to draw conclusions about the true potential of these interventions to improve comorbid symptoms. Implications of the current study and directions for future research are discussed.

176,Anxiety and depression in Klinefelter syndrome: The impact of personality and social engagement,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47, XXY) is the most common sex chromosome disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in every 660 newborn males. Despite the profound adverse effects of anxiety and depression, and their greater prevalence in KS populations, no research has been conducted to date to identify the determinants of anxiety and depression among patients with KS. We examined the relationships between personality traits, social engagement, and anxiety and depression symptoms among KS patients (n = 69) and a group of male controls (n = 69) matched for age and years of education. KS patients experienced more anxiety and depression symptoms than control participants. Neuroticism was the strongest and most consistent mediator between KS and both anxiety and depression symptoms. This research suggests that neuroticism may play a central role in attention switching, anxiety and depression among patients with Klinefelter syndrome. The central role of neuroticism suggests that it may be used to help identify and treat KS patients at particularly high-risk for attention-switching deficits, anxiety and depression.

177,Smaller volumes in the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala in patients with panic disorder,"The amygdala plays an important functional role in fear and anxiety. Abnormalities in the amygdala are believed to be involved in the neurobiological basis of panic disorder (PD). Previous structural neuroimaging studies have found global volumetric and morphological abnormalities in the amygdala in patients with PD. Very few studies, however, have explored for structural abnormalities in various amygdala sub-regions, which consist of various sub-nuclei, each with different functions. This study aimed to evaluate for volumetric abnormalities in the amygdala sub-nuclei, in order to provide a better understanding neurobiological basis of PD. Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 matched healthy control (HC) participants underwent structural MRI scanning. The volume of the whole amygdala, as well as its consistent sub-nuclei, were calculated using FreeSurfer software. Relative volumes of these amygdala sub-regions were compared between the two groups. Results showed significantly smaller volumes in the right lateral and basal nuclei in the patients with PD compared with the HC. Lateral and basal nuclei are thought to play crucial role for processing sensory information related with anxiety and fear. Our results suggest that these particular amygdala sub-regions play a role in the development of PD symptoms.

178,Placebo acceptability in chronic pain patients: More dependent on application mode and resulting condition than on individual factors,"Introduction: Placebo effects can be very effective in certain pain conditions, but their use is still highly controversial. Several studies show that patients would accept a placebo treatment under certain circumstances, particularly when they are informed prior to the treatment or when there are no effective treatment alternatives. This study examines the question, which factors influence the degree of acceptability of a hypothetical placebo application. Methods: Patients filled in a questionnaire dealing with placebo applications. Moreover general data, diagnosis, duration of pain, pain ratings and anxiety/depression/stress scores, sleep disorders and opioid intake were collected from the patients‘ charts. 129 patients (44 men / 85 women, mean age 51.5 years, 18.0–80.9 years) entered the study. All patients had chronic pain syndromes and were treated in an universitary academic interdisciplinary pain center. Mean duration of pain was 14.7 years. Results: The study did not show significant differences in placebo acceptability among patients with different pain diagnoses or accompanying psychological diagnoses or disorders. Hidden placebo application was considered much more unacceptable for the patients than the enhanced placebo or the open placebo application. An improved condition was associated with less feeling of deception, more trust and less negative mood than an unchanged or worsened condition. Conclusion: Acceptance of placebo as pain therapy is much more dependent on the way of application (hidden or open) or on the resulting condition (improved, unchanged or worsened) than on factors inherent in the individual patients.

179,Treatment adequacy for social anxiety disorder in primary care patients,"Objectives: There is a gap between clinical practice guidelines for social anxiety disorder and clinical practice that needs to be addressed to ensure the delivery of evidence-based treatments. The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe mental health service utilization in a cohort of primary care patients with social anxiety disorder; 2) to examine treatment adequacy for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy according to indicators based on clinical practice guidelines; and 3) to explore correlates of treatment adequacy. Method: The “Dialogue” project (Quebec, Canada) is a large study conducted in 67 primary care clinics. After a mental health screening in primary care (n = 14 833), participants with anxiety or depressive symptoms took part in a telephone/web structured interview on mental health symptoms and service utilization (n = 1956). This study included 289 participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder. Results: Overall, 86.2% of participants reported consulting for mental health reasons over the past 12 months. Only 23.6% of our sample reported the detection of social anxiety disorder by a healthcare professional in the past 12 months. Approximately 2 in 5 respondents with social anxiety disorder reported receiving pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy meeting our treatment adequacy indicators. Antidepressant medication was the most common treatment. Logistic regression models showed that the detection of major depression (OR = 4.651; 95% CI: 2.559–8.453) or other anxiety disorder(s) (OR = 2.957; 95% CI: 1.555–5.625) were associated with receiving any adequate treatment, but the detection of social anxiety disorder itself was not (OR = 1.420; 95% CI: 0.696–2.899). Conclusion: Low rates of detection and treatment adequacy based on our indicators demonstrate that efforts must be made to ensure the quality of care for individuals with social anxiety disorder in primary care.

180,Affective temperament in inflammatory bowel diseases: Another brick in the wall of differentiation,"Psychiatric disorders are significantly common complications among patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Affective temperament is a concept of core personality traits, which can decribe the vulnerability to mood disorders, therefore its evaluation might convey useful information about patients’ mental status in autoimmune disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the affective temperament in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) as characteristic features of these diseases, but also in the clinical course and the severity of anxiety and depression.Due to our knowledge this is the first study of this kind. The study enrolled 130 patients with IBD, including 68 with CD and 62 with UC. We used TEMPS-A to evaluate affective temperament and HADS scales to assess the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Harvey Bradshaw scale, Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Mayo Score were used to evaluate clinical severity of the diseases. We observed significantly higher prevalence of depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety temperaments in CD patients compared to the control group. Harvey Bradshaw scale, CDAI and Mayo Self Report showed statistically significant outcomes, including significant positive correlations with depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety subscales of TEMPS-A, and negative correlation with the hyperthymic temperament in CD subjects. Our findings indicate significant differences between CD and UC due to temperament traits, and suggest distinct pathogenesis of mood disorders in IBD.

181,A brief online transdiagnostic measure: Psychometric properties of the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) among Spanish patients with emotional disorders,"The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) is a self-report questionnaire designed to evaluate the severity and functional impairment associated with anxiety. Given its transdiagnostic nature, it can be used indistinctly across anxiety and depressive disorders. In this study, the psychometric properties of the online version of the OASIS were evaluated in a Spanish clinical sample with emotional disorders. Patients (n = 583) with anxiety (n = 250) and depression (n = 333) with a mean age of 37.21 (SD = 12.22), underwent a diagnostic interview and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. Factorial structure, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, cutoff scores, and sensitivity to change were analyzed. Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded a unidimensional factor structure, consistent with previous validations of the instrument. The analyses showed good internal consistency and adequate convergent and discriminant validity, as well as sensitivity to change. A cutoff score of 7.5 was found to meet the criteria used in this study to select the optimal cutoff point. Overall, in this study, the psychometric properties of the online version of the OASIS were found to be appropriate. The brevity and ease of use of the OASIS support its adequacy as a valid measure of anxiety severity and impairment in Spanish clinical samples with anxiety and depression.

In Table 1, ""ӽ"" is missing from the heading in the fourth column and the footnote. Please see the correct Table 1 in erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-47418-001). Objective: This study analyzed variability in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and its association with emotional, clinical and functional variables and medication use in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods: Using transcranial Doppler sonography, CBFV were bilaterally recorded in the anterior (ACA) and middle (MCA) cerebral arteries of 44 FMS patients and 31 healthy individuals during a 5-min resting period. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: Fast Fourier transformation revealed a spectral profile with four components: (1) a first very low frequency (VLF) component with the highest amplitude at 0.0024 Hz; (2) a second VLF component around 0.01-to-0.025 Hz; (3) a low frequency (LF) component from 0.075-to-0.11 Hz; and (4) a high frequency (HF) component with the lowest amplitude from 0.25-to-0.35 Hz. Compared to controls, FMS patients exhibited lower LF and HF CBFV variability in the MCAs (p &lt; .005) and right ACA (p = .03), but higher variability at the first right MCA (p = .04) and left ACA (p = .005) VLF components. Emotional, clinical and functional variables were inversely related to LF and HF CBFV variability (r ≥ -.24, p ≤ .05). However, associations for the first VLF component were positive (r ≥ .28, p ≤. 05). While patients´ medication use was associated with lower CBFV variability, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders were unrelated to variability. Conclusions: Lower CBFV variability in the LF and HF ranges were observed in FMS, suggesting impaired coordination of cerebral regulatory systems. CBFV variability was differentially associated with clinical variables as a function of time-scale, with short-term variability being related to better clinical outcomes. CBFV variability analysis may be a promising tool to characterize FMS pathology and it impact on facets of HRQoL.

183,Factors associated with common mental health problems of humanitarian workers in South Sudan,"Background: The latest data on major attacks against civilian aid operations have identified South Sudan as the most dangerous country for aid workers globally. Exposure to other traumatic events and chronic stress is also common in this population. No research exists on the mental health of humanitarian workers in South Sudan. Objectives: This study examined symptom burden and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol consumption, and burnout among humanitarian workers in South Sudan. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference. Results: A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p &lt; .001), depression (p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001), emotional exhaustion (p &lt; .01), and depersonalization (p &lt; .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p &lt; .001) and anxiety (p &lt; .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p &lt; .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p &lt; .01). Conclusion: Our results suggest that humanitarian workers in South Sudan experience substantial levels of mental ill-health. This study points to the need for staff support strategies that effectively mitigate humanitarian workers’ chronic stress exposure. The dynamics between coping and mental health among humanitarian workers require further study.

184,The association between socioeconomic status and reactions to radiation exposure: A cross-sectional study after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station accident,"Risk perception and individual reactions to risk are not necessarily comparable, and socioeconomic status may affect individual reactions to risk. This study aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic status and reactions to radiation exposure risk. This cross-sectional study, based on a self-reported online survey was conducted between 3 March and 21 March 2012, one year after the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. We used feelings of anxiety and risk-averse behavior concerning radiation exposure as dependent variables, and equivalent income and educational attainment as independent variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) with adjustment for possible confounders. Among 10 000 participants, 23.0% felt anxious and 12.0% engaged in risk-averse behavior for radiation exposure. Participants with a higher socioeconomic status tended not to feel anxious but undertook risk-averse behavior. Participants in the highest quartile income category did not report feeling anxious but showed prevalent undertaking of risk-averse behavior for radiation exposure compared to the lowest income category (for anxiety, aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93, for risk-averse behavior, aOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04–1.69). University or graduate-school graduates were associated with greater risk-averse behavior compared to junior high school or high school graduates (aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.29–1.73). Socioeconomic status may affect reactions to radiation exposure risk. Risk communication strategies should consider the socioeconomic status of those affected.

185,"Attentional bias for negative, positive, and threat words in current and remitted depression","Background: The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the maintenance of depression. We examined attentional bias (AB) for negative and positive adjectives and general threat words in strictly-defined clinical groups of participants with pure Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) without a history of anxiety disorders (AD), mixed MDD and AD, and remitted participants. Method: We investigated both stimulus specificity and time course of AB in these groups, adopting a cross-sectional design. Data were drawn from the large scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), from which we selected all participants with pure current MDD without a history of AD (n = 29), all participants with current MDD and co-morbid AD(s) (n = 86), all remitted MDD participants (n = 294), and a comparison group without (a history of) MDD or ADs (n = 474). AB was measured with an Exogenous Cueing Task covering short and long presentation times (500 and 1250 ms) and 4 stimulus types (negative, positive, threat, neutral). Results: Both traditional and trial level (dynamic) AB scores failed to show an AB for negative adjectives in participants with MDD or mixed MDD/AD. Specifically for long duration trials (1250 ms), remitted participants showed a larger AB traditional score (albeit the actual score still being negative) than the comparison group. The mixed MDD/AD group showed a higher trial-level AB score away from positive adjectives (1250 ms) than the comparisons. In addition, the mixed MDD/AD group showed higher and more variable trial-level AB scores away from short and towards longer presented general threat words together with a non-significant tendency to show less negative traditional AB scores for threat trials (500 ms) than the comparison group. Conclusions: All in all, the findings do not corroborate the view that an AB towards negative or away from positive adjectives is critically involved in currently depressed individuals. Yet, the relatively high (less negative) AB score for negative adjectives in remitted individuals points to the possibility that an AB for negative information may be involved as a risk factor in the recurrence of MDD.

Results: SER exhibited better improvement of social anxiety symptoms rate than PLA (25.73% vs. 9.46%, P &lt; .05). Neither GCBT differed from GPT (12.33% vs. 22.54%, P = .11) nor SER + GCBT from PLA + GCBT (17.65% vs. 7.69%, P = .20). However, SER + GPT was superior to PLA + GPT (33.33%, vs. 11.43%, P &lt; .05). M-MSSE had superior improvement for SER + GCBT vs PLA + GCBT ( P &lt; .01) but not for SER + GPT vs. PLA + GPT ( P = .80). SASD scores improvement were greater for SER than PLA ( P &lt; .01) and for SER + GCBT vs. PLA + GCBT ( P &lt; .05), but neither GCBT differed from GPT( P = .60) nor SER + GPT differed from PLA+GPT ( P = .09). Conclusions: In overall, SER + psychotherapy was superior to psychotherapy alone. SER potentiated GCBT by enhancing social skills acquisition.

Due to different tasks and study designs, the direct consequences of acute stress have been found to be wide-reaching: while some studies report prosocial effects, others report increases in antisocial behavior, still others report no effect. To control for specific effects of different stressors and to consider the role of social anxiety in stress-related social behavior, we investigated the effects of social versus physical stress on behavior in male participants possessing different levels of social anxiety. In a randomized, controlled two by two design we investigated the impact of social and physical stress on behavior in healthy young men. We found significant influences on various subjective increases in stress by physical and social stress, but no interaction effect. Cortisol was significantly increased by physical stress, and the heart rate was modulated by physical and social stress as well as their combination. Social anxiety modulated the subjective stress response but not the cortisol or heart rate response. With respect to behavior, our results show that social and physical stress interacted to modulate trust, trustworthiness, and sharing. While social stress and physical stress alone reduced prosocial behavior, a combination of the two stressor modalities could restore prosociality. Social stress alone reduced nonsocial risk behavior regardless of physical stress. Social anxiety was associated with higher subjective stress responses and higher levels of trust. As a consequence, future studies will need to investigate further various stressors and clarify their effects on social behavior in health and social anxiety disorders.

188,"Regulatory focus, coping strategies and symptoms of anxiety and depression: A comparison between Syrian refugees in Turkey and Germany","Civil war, flight, escape and expulsion are extremely stressful and assert a negative impact on refugees’ mental health. However scientific research about resilience and coping of refugees is scarce. Especially in the recent refugee crisis, calls have been made to consider factors contributing to coping and resilience in this vulnerable population. Therefore, the current research sought to investigate individual differences that could serve as antecedents of coping and contextual factors that might moderate these effects. Specifically, it took into account individual’s self-regulatory differences in terms of regulatory focus (i.e., a promotion focus on nurturance needs, ideals and gains vs. a prevention focus on security needs, oughts and losses). It furthermore explored contextual influences by considering Syrian refugees in Turkey (Sample 1, N = 273) and Germany (Sample 2, N = 169). Compared to Syrian refugees in Turkey, those in Germany had a stronger promotion focus. They also reported more problem-focused and less maladaptive coping, as well as less symptoms. Both promotion and prevention focus were positively related to problem-focused coping. Problem-focused coping, in turn, predicted more symptoms in Turkey but not in Germany. Furthermore, a stronger promotion focus was associated with less symptoms and maladaptive coping was associated with more symptoms in both samples. These results contribute to the coping literature in demonstrating that under certain conditions problem-focused coping can be maladaptive and extend the scarce previous work on self-regulation and coping. Most importantly, they highlight a promotion focus as a clear resilience factor and the role of maladaptive coping in increasing vulnerability. As such, they might inform the design of effective interventions among Syrian refugees and beyond.

189,Maternal nurturing experience affects the perception and recognition of adult and infant facial expressions,"The perception and recognition of facial expressions are crucial for parenting. This study investigated whether and how maternal nurturing experience and trait anxiety influence the perception and recognition of infant and adult facial expressions. This was assessed by comparing the performance of primiparous mothers ( n = 25) and non-mothers ( n = 28) on an emotional face perception task. Trait anxiety was measured using the Japanese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We found that mothers had higher recognition accuracy for facial expressions, but only of adults, not infants. Moreover, as trait anxiety increased, so did mothers’ sensitivity in perceiving facial expressions of both infants and adults. These findings suggest that maternal nurturing experience does enhance the recognition of adult emotional expressions, and an optimal level of maternal trait anxiety may enhance mothers’ sensitivity toward infants’ and adults’ emotional signals.

190,‘I take my tablets with the whiskey’: A qualitative study of alcohol and medication use in mid to later life,"Background: Concurrent alcohol and medication use can result in significant problems especially in mid to later life. Alcohol is often used instead of medication for a number of health-related conditions. This novel qualitative study explored concurrent alcohol and medication use, as well as the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes, in a sample of individuals in mid to later life. Methods: Twenty-four interviews (12 men/12 women, ages 51–90 years) and three focus groups (n = 27, 6 men/21 women, ages 50–95 years) from three branches of Age UK and two services for alcohol problems in North East England. Results: Older people in this study often combined alcohol and medication, frequently without discussing this with their family doctor. However, being prescribed medication could act as a motivating factor to stop or reduce alcohol consumption. Participants also used alcohol to self-medicate, to numb pain, aid sleep or cope with stress and anxiety. Some participants used alcohol to deal with depression although alcohol was also reported as a cause of depression. Women in this study reported using alcohol to cope with mental health problems while men were more likely to describe reducing their alcohol consumption as a consequence of being prescribed medication. Conclusions: As older people often combine alcohol and medication, health professionals such as family doctors, community nurses, and pharmacists should consider older patients’ alcohol consumption prior to prescribing or dispensing medication and should monitor subsequent drinking. In particular, older people should be informed of the dangers of concurrent alcohol and medication use.

191,Inhibitory attentional control in anxiety: Manipulating cognitive load in an antisaccade task,"Theorists have proposed that heightened anxiety vulnerability is characterised by reduced attentional control performance and have made the prediction in turn that elevating cognitive load will adversely impact attentional control performance for high anxious individuals to a greater degree than low anxious individuals. Critically however, existing attempts to test this prediction have been limited in their methodology and have presented inconsistent findings. Using a methodology capable of overcoming the limitations of previous research, the present study sought to investigate the effect of manipulating cognitive load on inhibitory attentional control performance of high anxious and low anxious individuals. High and low trait anxious participants completed an antisaccade task, requiring the execution of prosaccades towards, or antisaccades away from, emotionally toned stimuli while eye movements were recorded. Participants completed the antisaccade task under conditions that concurrently imposed a lesser cognitive load, or greater cognitive load. Analysis of participants’ saccade latencies revealed high trait anxious participants demonstrated generally poorer inhibitory attentional control performance as compared to low trait anxious participants. Furthermore, conditions imposing greater cognitive load, as compared to lesser cognitive load, resulted in enhanced inhibitory attentional control performance across participants generally. Crucially however, analyses did not reveal an effect of cognitive load condition on anxiety-linked differences in inhibitory attentional control performance, indicating that elevating cognitive load did not adversely impact attentional control performance for high anxious individuals to a greater degree than low anxious individuals. Hence, the present findings are inconsistent with predictions made by some theorists and are in contrast to the findings of earlier investigations. These findings further highlight the need for research into the relationship between anxiety, attentional control, and cognitive load.

192,Is cognitive behavioral therapy a better choice for women with postnatal depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The present study evaluated the combined effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for postnatal depression. A systematic search was conducted across databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to identify the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessing CBT versus control for postnatal depression until March 2017. Data was extracted by two reviewers, independently. The Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 11.0 were used to calculate the synthesized effect of CBT on depression, and anxiety. A total of 20 RCTs involving 3623 participants were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that CBT was associated with a better Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) than control in short-term (mean difference = -2.86, 95% CI: -4.41–1.31; P &lt; 0.05) and long-term (mean difference = -1.68, 95% CI: -1.81–1.56; P &lt; 0.05). CBT also improved short-term (mean difference = -6.30, 95% CI: -11.32–1.28; P &lt; 0.05) and long-term (mean difference = -4.31, 95% CI: -6.92–1.70; P &lt; 0.05) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Subgroup analysis based on intervention types showed that in-home and telephone-based therapy exhibited significant reductions in EPDS scores ( P &lt; 0.05 for all). CBT significantly improved the short-term [odds ratio (OR) = 6.57, 95% CI: 1.84–23.48; P &lt; 0.05] and long-term (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.61–2.48; P &lt; 0.05) depressive symptomatology as compared to control. CBT also reduced the score of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), though without significance. In conclusion, CBT effectively improved the symptoms and progression of postnatal depression.

193,Rates and predictors of recurrent work disability due to common mental health disorders in the United States,"Context: Despite the high prevalence of work disability due to common mental disorders (CMD), no information exists on the rates and predictors of recurrence in a United States population. Objective: To estimate recurrent work disability statistics and evaluate factors associated with recurrence due to CMDs including adjustment, anxiety, bipolar, and depressive disorders. Methods: Recurrent work disability statistics were calculated using a nationwide database of disability claims. For the CMDs, univariate and multiple variable analyses were used to examine demographic factors and comorbidities associated with the time to recurrence. Results: Of the CMDs, cases with bipolar (n = 3,017) and depressive disorders (n = 20,058) had the highest recurrence densities, 98.7 and 70.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively. These rates were more than three times higher than recurrence rates for other chronic disorders (e.g., diabetes, asthma; n = 105,558) and non-chronic disorders (e.g., injury, acute illnesses; n = 153,786). Individuals with CMD were also more likely to have a subsequent disability distinct from their mental health condition. Risk factors for recurrent CMD disability included being younger, being an hourly employee, living in a geographic area with more college graduates, having more previous psychiatric visits, having a previous work leave, and the type of work industry. Conclusions: Results indicate that CMD patients may benefit from additional care and disability management both during and after their work absence to help prevent subsequent CMD and non- CMD related leaves.

194,Doctor's recommendations for psychosocial care: Frequency and predictors of recommendations and referrals,"Background: A significant number of oncological patients are heavily burdened by psychosocial stress. Doctors recommending or referring their patients to psycho-oncologists in the course of routine consultations can positively influence psycho-oncological care. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and predictors of such recommendations and to examine the use of these services by patients. Methods: 4,020 cancer patients (mean age 58 years; 51% women) were evaluated in a multicenter, cross-sectional study in Germany. Data was gathered about doctors' referral practices, patients' utilization of psycho-oncological care services, and disease-related symptoms. The PHQ-9 depression scale and the GAD-7 anxiety scale were used to measure psychological burden. Descriptive data analysis was conducted on the basis of subgroup comparisons and multivariable analysis was done using binary logistical regression. Results: 21.9% of the respondents reported having been given a recommendation or referral for psycho- oncological care by a doctor within the course of their cancer diagnosis and treatment. This comprises 29.5% of the patients identified by screening as being psychologically burdened. Nearly half of the patients who received a recommendation or referral (49.8%) acted on it. Predictors for seeking out psycho-oncological care included: patient desire (OR = 2.0), previous experience with psycho-oncological care (OR = 1.59), and female gender (OR = 1.57). Multivariable analysis indicated that patients' level of psychological burden (depression, anxiety) had no effect on whether doctors gave them a recommendation or referral. Conclusions: Along with examining the degree to which patients are burdened (e.g. using screening instruments), determining whether or not patients would like to receive psycho-oncological care is an important aspect of improving referral practices and, by extension, will allow important progress in the field of psycho-oncological care to be made.

195,"Elimination testing with adapted scoring reduces guessing and anxiety in multiple-choice assessments, but does not increase grade average in comparison with negative marking","Background and hypotheses: This study is the first to offer an in-depth comparison of elimination testing with the scoring rule of Arnold &amp; Arnold (hereafter referred to as elimination testing with adapted scoring) and negative marking. As such, this study is motivated by the search for an alternative for negative marking that still discourages guessing, but is less disadvantageous for non-relevant student characteristics such a risk-aversion and does not result in grade inflation. The comparison is structured around seven hypotheses: in comparison with negative marking, elimination testing with adapted scoring leads to (1) a similar average score (no grade inflation); (2) students expressing their partial knowledge; (3) a decrease in the number of blank answers; (4) no gender bias in the number of blank answers; (5) a reduction in guessing; (6) a decrease in self-reported test anxiety; and finally (7) students preferring elimination testing with adapted scoring over negative marking. Methodology: To investigate the above hypotheses, this study implemented elimination testing with adapted scoring and negative marking in real exam settings in two courses in a Faculty of Medicine at a large university. Due to changes in the master of medicine the same two courses were taught to both students of the 1 st and 2 nd master in the same semester. Given that both student groups could take the same exam with different test instructions and scoring methods, a unique opportunity occurred in which elimination testing with adapted scoring and negative marking could be compared in a high-stakes testing situation. After receiving the grades on the exams, students received a questionnaire to assess their experiences. Findings The statistical analysis taking into account student ability and gender showed that elimination testing with adapted scoring is a valuable alternative for negative marking when looking for a scoring method that discourages guessing. In contrast to traditional scoring of elimination testing, elimination testing with adapted scoring does not result in grade inflation in comparison with negative marking. This study showed that elimination testing with adapted scoring reduces blank answers and finds strong indications for the reduction of guessing in comparison with negative marking. Finally, students preferred elimination testing with adapted scoring over negative marking and reported lower stress levels in elimination testing with adapted scoring in comparison with negative marking.

196,Does nutritional status affect Parkinson's Disease features and quality of life?,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional status and Parkinson's Disease (PD) features in association with depression, anxiety and quality of life in people with PD. Materials and methods: This study was conducted on 96 patients with idiopathic PD to whom the following scales were applied: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 39-item PD questionnaire (PDQ-39), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The scales and measurements were applied to patients at their first assessment. Patients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition were assessed by the dietitian and nutrition nurse. These patients received nutritional support through personalized diet recommendations and appropriate enteral nutritional products, considering factors such as age, comorbidity, socioeconomic and cultural conditions. At the end of 6 weeks, the scales and measurements applied during the first visit were again applied to the patients. Results: A significant and inverse correlation was determined between mental (Spearman r:-0.510, p &lt; 0.001), activities of daily living (Spearman r:-0.520, p &lt; 0.001), motor (Spearman r:-0.480, p &lt; 0.001), complications (Spearman r:-0.346, p &lt; 0.001) UPDRS subdivisions and total scores (Spearman r:-0.644, p &lt; 0.001) and total MNA score. A significant and inverse correlation was found between all PDQ-39 subdomains and total MNA score (p &lt; 0.05). The highest inverse correlations were found in mobility (Spearman r:-0.690, p &lt; 0.001) and stigma (Spearman r:-0.570, p &lt; 0.001). Both depression (Spearman r:-0.631, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (Spearman r:-0.333, p &lt; 0.001) scores were determined to be inversely correlated with total MNA score. At the 6-week control visit, significantly lower scores were found in all subdivisions and in the total UPDRS score, PDQ-39 score and in the patients' anxiety and depression scores (p &lt; 0.05). MNA scores were found to be significantly higher in the assessment performed after 6 weeks of support for patients who had abnormal nutritional status at inception (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: PD motor and nonmotor functions, disease duration and severity are related to nutritional status. Quality of life was also shown to be affected by changes in the nutritional status. These results show that nutritional status assessment should be a standard approach in the PD treatment and follow-up processes.

197,Fibroblast growth factor 2 is necessary for the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine,"Previous research has shown that fibroblast growth factor 2 protein (FGF2) can act as an anxiolytic and anti-depressive agent in rodents. Levels of hippocampal FGF2 and FGF2 receptors are decreased in post-mortem brains of individuals with mood disorders. No changes in FGF2 were noted in the post-mortem brains of individuals with mood disorders that were successfully treated with anti-depressant medication prior to death. Mutations in the FGF2 gene in humans have been shown to predict non-responsiveness to the therapeutic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These findings suggest that FGF2 may potentially be a target of and/or required for the therapeutic effects of antidepressant medications. To test this, we employed a rodent model of depressive behaviour, chronic variable stress (CVS) in conjunction with antidepressant treatment (fluoxetine) in wild-type (WT) and FGF2 knockout mice (FGF2KO) and examined depressive and anxiety behaviors. Results showed that fluoxetine reversed the effects of CVS on depressive and anxiety behaviours in wild-type mice only, suggesting that the FGF2 gene is indeed necessary for the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. Interestingly, CVS decreased hippocampal FGF2 levels and fluoxetine partially reversed this effect. Because FGF2 has been previously shown to modify HPA activity through hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GR), we examined levels of glucocorticoid receptors and found a decrease in GR in response to CVS, with a further decrease in FGF2KO. No effect of fluoxetine on GR was observed in either WT or FGF2KO mice. This suggests that further changes in glucocorticoid receptors are not necessary for the anti-depressant effects of fluoxetine in WT mice, although decreased glucocorticoid receptors in response to FGF2 deletion may preclude the therapeutic actions of fluoxetine in FGF2KO. Whether astroglia, astroglial functions, or HPA changes are the downstream target of FGF2-mediated changes induced by fluoxetine remains to be determined, however, the current study reaffirms the potential of FGF2 as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.

In the original article, Fig 5 was incorrectly printed as a duplicate of Fig 4. A link to the corrected Fig 5 is presented in the erratum.] Background: The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effectiveness of hatha yoga in treating acute, chronic and/or treatment-resistant mood and anxiety disorders. Methods: Medline, Cochrane Library, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.gov, NHR Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched through June 2018. Randomized controlled trials with patients with mood and anxiety disorders were included. Main outcomes were continuous measures of severity of mood and anxiety symptoms. Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of effect size. Meta-analyses using a random effects model was applied to estimate direct comparisons between yoga and control conditions for depression and anxiety outcomes. Publication bias was visually inspected using funnel plots. Results: Eighteen studies were found, fourteen in acute patients and four in chronic patients. Most studies were of low quality. For depression outcomes, hatha yoga did not show a significant effect when compared to treatment as usual, an overall effect size of Cohen's d -0.64 (95% CI = -1.41, 0.13) or to all active control groups, Cohen's d -0.13 (95% CI = -0.49, 0.22). A sub-analysis showed that yoga had a significant effect on the reduction of depression compared to psychoeducation control groups, Cohen's d -0.52 (95% CI = -0.96, -0.08) but not to other active control groups, Cohen's d 0.28 (95% CI = -0.07, 0.63) For studies using a follow- up of six months or more, hatha yoga had no effect on the reduction of depression compared to active control groups, Cohen's d -0.14 (95% CI = -0.60, 0.33). Regarding anxiety, hatha yoga had no significant effect when compared to active control groups, Cohen's d -0.09 (95% CI = -0.47, 0.30). The I² and Q-statistic revealed heterogeneity amongst comparisons. Qualitative analyses suggest some promise of hatha yoga for chronic populations. Conclusions: The ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by the notable heterogeneity and low quality of most of the included studies. With this caveat in mind, the results of the current meta-analysis suggest that hatha yoga does not have effects on acute, chronic and/or treatment-resistant mood and anxiety disorders compared to treatment as usual or active control groups. However, when compared to psychoeducation, hatha yoga showed more reductions in depression. It is clear that more high-quality studies are needed to advance the field.

A non-controlled, within-subjects longitudinal design was utilized with assessment at three time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and three months follow-up). Between-subjects analysis with two groups was also conducted to compare the outcomes of the Individual and Couples programs. Participants were recruited from ten programs in 2016 with a total of 47 veterans and partners from both an Individual program ( n = 25; veterans only) and a Couples program ( n = 22). Outcome measures included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, and Quality-of-Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form. Paired samples t-tests revealed that within both the Individual and Couples programs, there were significantly fewer psychological symptoms and significantly greater levels of happiness and quality of life at post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. Reduced psychological symptoms were maintained at the three months follow-up for participants of the Couples program only. Independent samples t-tests revealed participants in the Couples program reported significantly less symptoms of depression, stress, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at follow-up compared to participants in the Individual program. These results indicate there may only be meaningful benefits for equine-assisted therapy in the reduction of depression, stress, and PTSD symptoms for veterans, if partners are integrated into the intervention.

200,Trait anxiety impairs cognitive flexibility when overcoming a task acquired response and a preexisting bias,"Individuals with high trait anxiety tend to be worse at flexibly adapting goal-directed behavior to meet changing demands relative to those with low trait anxiety. Past research on anxiety and cognitive flexibility has used tasks that involve overcoming a recently acquired rule, strategy, or response pattern after an abrupt change in task requirements (e.g., choice X led to positive outcomes but now leads to negative outcomes). An important limitation of this research is that many decision making situations require overcoming a preexisting bias (e.g., deciding whether to withdraw a historically winning investment that has experienced recent losses). In the present study we examined whether anxiety differences in the ability to overcome an acquired response extend to the ability to overcome a preexisting bias, when the bias produces objectively disadvantageous decisions. High anxiety ( n = 78) and low anxiety participants ( n = 76) completed a commonly used measure of cognitive flexibility, reversal learning, and a novel Framed Gambling Task that assessed the extent to which they could make advantageous decisions when the normatively correct choice was inconsistent with a preexisting framing bias. High anxiety participants showed the expected diminished reversal learning performance and also had poorer ability to make advantageous choices that were inconsistent with the framing bias. Worse performance in the Framed Gambling Task was not driven by poor knowledge of risk contingencies, because high anxiety participants reported the same explicit knowledge as low anxiety participants. Instead, the results suggest high anxiety is associated with general deficits in resolving interference from prepotent responses.

The first sample, which included individuals from France and Canada ( N = 135, 52% in France, M age = 26.98, SD = 9.24), completed the DAPTQ in French, alongside measures of empathy, positive and negative affects, satisfaction with life, and self-esteem. The second sample included bilingual (French and English) individuals from France and Canada ( N = 141, 52% in France, M age = 29.73, SD = 9.09) who completed both versions of the DAPTQ (French and English), alongside measurements of perceived stress, trait anxiety, and creativity. The results support the DAPTQ−French version good internal consistency (α = .89/.87), convergent validity, and concurrent validity. Correlation between the DAPTQ total and subscales across versions (French-English) showed strong associations ( r = .84 to .96). These findings support the cross-cultural equivalence of the DAPTQ and its effectiveness as a valid assessment method of adaptive traits in the field of psychopathy.

202,"Risks of treated anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nurses: A nationwide longitudinal cohort study","The high level of occupational stress and burnout among nurses can lead to insomnia, anxiety, and depression. However, the actual risks for healthcare-seeking for these stress-related mental health problems among nurses are still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the risks and influencing factors of treated anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nurses. We used claims data obtained from the 2010 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Hospital nurses who had at least 3 coded ambulatory care claims or 1 inpatient claim with a principal diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or insomnia were identified. A cohort of 46,120 nurses and 92,240 matched controls were included. All the study subjects were followed up until the onset of any of the aforementioned outcomes, death, or the end of 2012. Results showed that the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for treated anxiety, depression, and insomnia among all the nurses were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88 ± 0.95), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55 ± 0.63), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.38 ± 1.48), respectively. Furthermore, the risks of these psychiatric problems in healthcare-seeking nurses were affected by age, gender, hospital level, and job tenure. Our findings suggest that hospital nurses have lower hazards of treated anxiety and depression than the general population, although they have a higher hazard of treated insomnia. There may be undertreatment in some subgroups of nurses with different demographic and working characteristics.

203,Alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns in anhedonic young adults performing a tandem skydive,"Background: Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) is characterized by low responsiveness to rewards and, by virtue of being one of the two core symptoms of depression, by altered responses to stress. We investigated the effect of an acute stress experience (i.e., a tandem skydive) that was expected to elicit both intense fear and intense euphoria in a sample of anhedonic young adults. Objective: (1) To examine individual differences in alpha-amylase reactivity to and recovery from a tandem skydive in anhedonic young adults; (2) to investigate whether trait depressive and anxiety problems, trait positive affect (PA), i.e., level of pleasure and reward responsiveness, and state anxiety, PA and self-esteem prior to the skydive were associated with alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns; (3) to investigate whether alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were associated with pre- to post-jump changes in state anxiety, PA, and self-esteem. Method: Participants were 61 individuals with persistent anhedonia (Mage = 21.38, 78.7% female), who filled out a baseline questionnaire at the start of the study, and momentary questionnaires (3 times per day) before and after the tandem skydive. Alpha-amylase was measured at four time points by means of salivettes (2 before and 2 after the skydive). Results: Alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were highly similar across individuals, although mean levels varied greatly. No associations were found between any of the trait and state measures and reactivity and recovery. Only state self-esteem was affected by the reactivity and recovery patterns, in that individuals who showed high reactivity and low recovery experienced decreases in self-esteem after the skydive. Conclusions: Alpha-amylase patterns following a tandem skydive in anhedonic individuals are highly similar to patterns previously found in healthy individuals. Although replication is warranted, our findings tentatively suggest that a strong stress response that cannot be downregulated well predicts a decrease in self-esteem.

204,Psychometric validation of the Serbian version of the Fear Avoidance Component Scale (FACS),"Objective: The Fear Avoidance Components Scale (FACS) is a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed to comprehensively evaluate fear avoidance (FA) beliefs and attitudes in persons with painful medical conditions. The original English version has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties, including concurrent and predictive validity. Two factors have been identified: 1. general fear avoidance; and 2. types of activities that are avoided. Methods: The FACS was first translated into Serbian, and then psychometrically validated. A cohort of 322 chronic musculoskeletal pain subjects completed the FACS-Serb and additional FA-related patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Their FACS-Serb scores were then compared to a cohort of 68 acute pain subjects. Results: Test-retest reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.928) and internal consistency for both Factors (Cronbach α 0.904 and 0,880 respectively) were very good. An acceptable fit was found with a confirmatory factor analysis of the 2-factor model found with the original English version of the FACS. Strong associations were found among FACS-Serb scores and other PRO measures of pain catastrophizing, depressive/anxiety symptoms, perceived disability, and pain intensity (p &lt; 0.001 for all analyses). FACS-Serb total scores, separate Factor scores, and subjective pain ratings were significantly higher in the chronic vs. acute pain cohorts (p &lt; 0.001 for all analyses). Conclusions: The FACS-Serb demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including strong reliability and internal consistency, criterion validity (through associations with other FA-related PRO measures), and discriminant validity (through comparisons with a separate acute pain cohort). The FACS-Serb appears to be a potentially useful pain-related assessment tool.

205,"Is psychological stress a predisposing factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)? An online international case-control study of premorbid life events, occupational stress, resilience and anxiety","Psychological stress has been suggested to be relevant to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, possibly via the generation of oxygen free radicals. We therefore sought to determine whether people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) had been subjected to more potentially stressful life events or occupations than controls, and whether they had differences in resilience or trait anxiety that would moderate their responses to these stressors. An online anonymous multilingual questionnaire was used to collect data on significant life events from people with and without ALS, using items from a modified Social Readjustment Rating Scale and from self-described significant events, which were combined to create a Life Events Inventory. Inventory scores were subdivided into 0 ± 20 years and 21 ± 40 years age ranges, and for the preceding 2, 5 and 10 years. Respondents also rated levels of stress experienced during different occupations. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and trait anxiety with a modified Geriatric Anxiety Inventory. Scores were compared using nonparametric statistics. Data from 400 ALS (251 male, 149 female) and 450 control (130 male, 320 female) respondents aged 40 years and over showed that Life Events Inventory scores were similar in male ALS respondents and controls, but lower in female ALS respondents than female controls for the preceding 5-year and 10-year periods. Occupational stress did not differ between ALS respondents and controls. Both male and female ALS respondents had higher resilience scores than controls. Anxiety scores did not differ between ALS and control groups. In conclusion, people with ALS reported no raised levels of potentially stressful premorbid life events or occupational stress, and did not have reduced levels of resilience, or increased levels of anxiety, that would augment the deleterious effects of stressors. On the contrary, ALS respondents had higher resilience than controls, though this conclusion relies on ALS respondents recalling their premorbid status. These results do not support the hypothesis that psychological stress from significant life events or occupational stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALS.

206,The structural equation model on self-efficacy during post-op rehabilitation among nonsmall cell lung cancer patients,"Backgrounds: Self-efficacy plays an important role in pulmonary rehabilitation, but it is still unknown which factors exert their effects on postsurgical rehabilitation self-efficacy among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This study aims to assess relationships among physical function, social factors, psychological factors, quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy, and the effects of these variables on self-efficacy among NSCLC patients. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 238 postsurgical NSCLC patients (response rate 95.2%) at five tertiary hospitals in Fuzhou, China. the participants completed a pack of questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypothetical model. Results: The SEM results supported the hypothesized structural model (χ²/df = 1.511, p &gt; 0.05). The final model showed that confrontation coping, subjective well-being (SWB), social support, psychological growth (PTG) and anxiety and depression can be directly related to self-efficacy (coefficient = 0.335, coefficient = 0.288, coefficient = 0.150, coefficient = 0.024, and coefficient = -0.004, respectively, p &lt; 0.01). Confrontation coping also had indirect effect via SWB (coefficient = 0.085, p &lt; 0.01), which had indirect connection via PTG (coefficient = 0.005, p &lt; 0.01). Social support and anxiety and depression had indirect pathways as well. As expected, self-efficacy directly affected the quality of life. Conclusions: This study suggests that higher confrontation coping style, SWB, social support, and PTG and lower anxiety and depression levels could effectively enhance their self-efficacy and consequently, improve QOL. These findings may help develop an intervention aimed at enhancing self-efficacy for this patient population.

The fourth author's name is missing the middle initial. The correct name is: Miguel A. Gandarillas. The affiliation of the fourth author is listed incorrectly. The correct affiliation is 5: Autonomous University of Madrid, Department of Social Psychology and Methodology, Madrid, Spain. In Table 1, ""ӽ"" is missing from the heading in the fourth column and the footnote. Please see the correct Table 1 in erratum.] Objective: This study analyzed variability in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and its association with emotional, clinical and functional variables and medication use in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods: Using transcranial Doppler sonography, CBFV were bilaterally recorded in the anterior (ACA) and middle (MCA) cerebral arteries of 44 FMS patients and 31 healthy individuals during a 5-min resting period. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: Fast Fourier transformation revealed a spectral profile with four components: (1) a first very low frequency (VLF) component with the highest amplitude at 0.0024 Hz; (2) a second VLF component around 0.01-to-0.025 Hz; (3) a low frequency (LF) component from 0.075-to-0.11 Hz; and (4) a high frequency (HF) component with the lowest amplitude from 0.25-to-0.35 Hz. Compared to controls, FMS patients exhibited lower LF and HF CBFV variability in the MCAs (p &lt; .005) and right ACA (p = .03), but higher variability at the first right MCA (p = .04) and left ACA (p = .005) VLF components. Emotional, clinical and functional variables were inversely related to LF and HF CBFV variability (r ≥ -.24, p ≤ .05). However, associations for the first VLF component were positive (r ≥ .28, p ≤. 05). While patients´ medication use was associated with lower CBFV variability, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders were unrelated to variability. Conclusions: Lower CBFV variability in the LF and HF ranges were observed in FMS, suggesting impaired coordination of cerebral regulatory systems. CBFV variability was differentially associated with clinical variables as a function of time-scale, with short-term variability being related to better clinical outcomes. CBFV variability analysis may be a promising tool to characterize FMS pathology and it impact on facets of HRQoL.

208,Multi-informant path models of the influence of psychosocial and treatment-related variables on adherence and metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Background: We assessed the associations between metabolic control and adherence and a broad range of adolescent and family characteristics (e.g., gender, family structure), treatment-related variables (e.g., disease duration, treatment modality), and psychosocial factors (e.g., symptoms of depression and anxiety, parental support, self-efficacy) in a nationwide study of Danish adolescents (age 12-17 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: Sixty-four percent of invited families participated by completing a survey and providing a blood sample. Two path models of associations between generic and diabetes-related family factors, adolescent self-efficacy, emotional difficulties, and metabolic control and adherence were tested, one for adolescents and one for caregivers. Demographic variables were included as covariates. Results: Both path models demonstrated a satisfying model fit. In both models, metabolic control was associated with adherence, age, and T1DM duration. In the adolescent model, metabolic control was also related to treatment modality, single-parent household, caregiver nonsupport, and anxiety, whereas in the caregiver model metabolic control was associated with family conflict and caregiver support. In both models, adherence was related to age, duration, treatment modality, family conflict, caregiver support, family functioning, and emotional difficulties of the adolescent. In the adolescent model, adherence was also related to adolescent self-efficacy, whereas in the caregiver model adherence was associated with adolescent gender and caregiver non-support and support. Adolescent self-efficacy, emotional well-being, and difficulties related to adolescent/caregiver interaction appeared to be particularly important, as indicated by their stronger association with adherence and/or metabolic control. Conclusion: The results highlight the value of applying a multi-informant approach to address the psychosocial well-being of adolescents with diabetes in a large national sample. Self-efficacy, emotional, and family-related difficulties are important aspects to address in both clinical care and future research regarding adolescents with T1DM.

209,Alexithymia mediates the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and anxiety,"A number of empirical and theoretical reports link altered interoceptive processing to anxiety. However, the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the two remains poor. We propose that a heightened sensibility for interoceptive signals, combined with a difficulty in attributing these sensations to emotions, increases an individual's vulnerability to anxiety. In order to investigate this, a large sample of general population adults were recruited and completed self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility, trait anxiety and alexithymia. Results confirmed that the positive association between interoceptive sensibility and trait anxiety was partially mediated by alexithymia, such that those most at risk for clinically significant levels of trait anxiety have both significantly higher levels of interoceptive sensibility and alexithymia. A subsequent factor analysis confirmed the independence of the three measures. Altered interoceptive processing in combination with alexithymia, increased the risk for anxiety above and beyond altered interoceptive processing alone. We suggest that a heightened sensibility for interoceptive signals, combined with a difficulty in attributing these sensations to emotions, leaves these sensations vulnerable to catastrophizing interpretation. Interventions that target the attribution of bodily sensations may prove valuable in reducing anxiety.

210,Viewpoints of pedestrians with and without cognitive impairment on shared zones and zebra crossings,"Background: Shared zones are characterised by an absence of traditional markers that segregate the road and footpath. Negotiation of a shared zone relies on an individual's ability to perceive, assess and respond to environmental cues. This ability may be impacted by impairments in cognitive processing, which may lead to individuals experiencing increased anxiety when negotiating a shared zone. Method: Q method was used in order to identify and explore the viewpoints of pedestrians, with and without cognitive impairments as they pertain to shared zones. Results: Two viewpoints were revealed. Viewpoint one was defined by ""confident users"" while viewpoint two was defined by users who ""know what [they] are doing but drivers might not"". Discussion: Overall, participants in the study would not avoid shared zones. Pedestrians with intellectual disability were, however, not well represented by either viewpoint, suggesting that shared zones may pose a potential barrier to participation for this group.

211,Depression history and memory bias for specific daily emotions,"Reports of emotions experienced over the past week can be influenced by memory bias, which is more pronounced for people with depression. No studies, however, have examined memory bias for specific emotion clusters (e.g., sadness, anxiety, and anger) experienced on a day-to-day basis among people with depression or a history of depression. Participants ( N = 1,657) from the Midlife in the United States Study were assessed for depression. Approximately 6 months later, participants reported their emotional experiences for 8 days and recalled these experiences on the final day. Differences in recalled and reported emotion were compared between participants with and without a history of depression. Participants overestimated experience only of negative emotions, particularly anger, and this negativity bias was greatest for participants with a history of depression. Feelings related to anger were prone to greater overestimation than sadness or anxiety. These findings emphasize the role of memory bias in retrospective reports of specific emotions and illustrate the presence of an amplified memory bias among people who are at a greater risk for recurrent depressive episodes.

212,Obligation and negative consequences in primary caregivers of dependent older relatives,"The purpose of this study was to analyse the multidimensional nature of obligation and the relations between each dimension of obligation and both anxiety and depression. A secondary analysis of data from two cross-sectional studies of primary home caregivers (N = 400; probabilistic sample) of older adult relatives in Spain was conducted. Data regarding obligation (four categories basing on beliefs of obligation and social pressure: low pressure and low beliefs, low pressure and high beliefs, high pressure and low beliefs and high pressure and high beliefs), stressors, anxiety and depression were collected by interview in 2013. The combination of high pressure and low beliefs had the highest levels of anxiety and depression, and the combination of low pressure and high beliefs had the lowest levels of anxiety and depression. When the relation of behavioural problems with anxiety and depression stratified by the previous four categories of obligation was analysed, behavioural problems were associated with anxiety and depression in the subgroups with low beliefs of obligation, whereas this association disappeared in the subgroups with high beliefs of obligation.

213,Loneliness predicts a preference for larger interpersonal distance within intimate space,"Loneliness is thought to serve as an adaptive signal indicating the need to repair or replace salutary social connections. Accordingly, loneliness may influence preferences for interpersonal distance. If loneliness simply motivates a desire to socially reconnect, then loneliness may be associated with a preference for smaller interpersonal distances. According to the evolutionary model of loneliness, however, loneliness also signals an inadequacy of mutual aid and protection, augmenting self-preservation motives. If loneliness both increases the motivation to reconnect and increases the motivation for self-protection, then the resulting approach-avoidance conflict should produce a preference for larger interpersonal distance, at least within intimate (i.e., proximal) space. Here, we report two survey-based studies of participants' preferences for interpersonal distance to distinguish between these competing hypotheses. In Study 1 ( N = 175), loneliness predicted preferences for larger interpersonal distance within intimate space net gender, objective social isolation, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, and marital status. In Study 2 ( N = 405), we replicated these results, and mediation analyses indicated that measures of social closeness could not adequately explain our findings. These studies provide compelling evidence that loneliness predicts preferences for larger interpersonal distance within intimate space, consistent with predictions from the evolutionary model of loneliness.

214,Can we learn to manage stress? A randomized controlled trial carried out on university students,"In our research, we examined the efficacy of an Internet-based stress management program. Our interest in evaluating this type of intervention is based on the increasing accessibility of the Internet today, the growth of Internet-based interventions for various psychopathological problems, and the observation that despite the prevalence of stress among university students, only a fraction of students ever seek professional help. Methodology: ""I'm managing my stress"" ("" Je gère mon stresse"" ), an Internet-based self-help program composed of four sessions, was examined in this study. The aforementioned program is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and was inspired by the ""Funambule"" program in Quebec. Four questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Scale of Satisfaction in Studies, and General Health Questionnaire) uploaded online were answered thrice: during ""preintervention"", ""postintervention"", and ""follow-up"" stages, the latter of which occurred three months after the intervention. The sample comprised 128 university students, with the majority being women (81.25%). The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (an experimental group and a control group that did not follow the program). Results: The self-esteem scores of the control group were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages. There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention. These differences no longer remained after three months. ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group. Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohen's d = 0.38 to 4.58). In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group. Conclusion: This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility. It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies. The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help. However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up. We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.

215,Effects of single-point acupuncture (HT7) in the prevention of test anxiety: Results of a RCT,"Background: The number of students using neuro enhancement to improve their performance and to prevent test anxiety is increasing. The acupuncture point Heart 7 (HT7) has been described as being prominent in reducing states of anxiety. Methods: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled, two-armed pilot trial to investigate the efficacy of a single-point acupuncture treatment at bilateral HT7 compared to sham laser acupuncture on test anxiety. Test anxiety was induced applying the standardised protocol of the Trier Social Stress Test. Outcome measures included saliva samples analysed for cortisol and amylase, anxiety questionnaires and heart rate variability. Results: Twenty-five male subjects (age 28 ± 5 years) were allocated to either verum acupuncture (n = 12) or sham laser acupuncture (n = 13). Cortisol peaked 20 min after the stress test (2-fold, 18.11 ± 2 nmol/l) and amylase 10 min after (2-fold, 259 ± 49 U/ml) with no difference between groups. There were no differences between groups regarding either anxiety questionnaires or physiological parameters. Compared to reference data (3-fold increase in cortisol), increase in stress hormones and heart rate seemed somewhat reduced. Conclusions: Acupuncture may be a possible approach for the treatment of anxiety. Due to the lack of a no control treatment group, we cannot determine the magnitude of possible specific needle effects at HT7 to promote specific effects in the neuroendocrine system. Finally this study only examines the efficacy of a single time treatment.

216,Perceptions of HIV cure research among people living with HIV in Australia,"Participation in HIV cure-related clinical trials that involve antiretroviral treatment (ART) interruption may pose substantial individual risks for people living with HIV (PLHIV) without any therapeutic benefit. As such, it is important that the views of PLHIV are considered in the design of HIV cure research trials. Examining the lived experience of PLHIV provides unique and valuable perspectives on the risks and benefits of HIV cure research. In this study, we interviewed 20 PLHIV in Australia about their knowledge and attitudes toward clinical HIV cure research and explored their views regarding participation in HIV cure clinical trials, including those that involve ART interruption. Data were analysed thematically, using both inductive and deductive coding techniques, to identity themes related to perceptions of HIV cure research and PLHIV's assessment of the possible risks and benefits of trial participation. Study findings revealed interviewees were willing to consider participation in HIV cure research for social reasons, most notably the opportunity to help others. Concerns raised about ART interruption related to the social and emotional impact of viral rebound, including fear of onward HIV transmission and anxiety about losing control. These findings reveal the ways in which PLHIV perspectives deepen our understanding of HIV cure research, moving beyond a purely clinical assessment of risks and benefits in order to consider the social context.

217,How does nature exposure make people healthier?: Evidence for the role of impulsivity and expanded space perception,"Nature exposure has been linked to a plethora of health benefits, but the mechanism for this effect is not well understood. We conducted two studies to test a new model linking the health benefits of nature exposure to reduced impulsivity in decision-making (as measured by delay discounting) via psychologically expanding space perception. In study 1 we collected a nationwide U.S. sample (n = 609) to determine whether nature exposure was predictive of health outcomes and whether impulsive decision-making mediated the effect. Results indicated that Nature Accessibility and Nature Exposure From Home significantly predicted reduced scores on the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) ( p &lt; .001, p = .03, respectively) and improved general health and wellbeing ( p &lt; .001, p &lt; .01, respectively). Nature Accessibility also predicted reduced impulsive decision-making ( p &lt; .01), and Nature Accessibility showed significant indirect effects through impulsive decision-making on both the DASS ( p = .02) and general health and wellbeing ( p = .04). In Study 2, a lab-based paradigm found that nature exposure expanded space perception ( p &lt; .001), and while the indirect effect of nature exposure through space perception on impulsive decision-making did not meet conventional standards of significance ( p &lt; .10), the pattern was consistent with hypotheses. This combination of ecologically-valid and experimental methods offers promising support for an impulsivity-focused model explaining the nature-health relationship.

218,Differential effects of emotion induced after encoding on item memory and reality-monitoring source memory,"Although studies have examined the effect of emotional stimuli on reality-monitoring source memory, it is poorly understood whether the effect observed would remain if emotion is induced after encoding. In addition, although there has been evidence that post-encoding emotion enhances item memory but not external monitoring source memory, it is unclear whether such a null effect extends to other types of source memory. To address these gaps, in the current study, participants encoded a list of words. For half of the words they were asked to think about the corresponding opposite words, and for the remaining half of words they viewed the corresponding opposite words. Following encoding they watched a neutral, positive or negative video. Replicating prior studies, both positive and negative emotions enhanced consolidation of item memory. Furthermore, participants at a high level of state anxiety, trait anxiety and depression were more likely to benefit from the enhancement effect of post-encoding emotion. However, no significant effect was observed on reality-monitoring source memory. Taken together the current study suggests that the enhancement effect of post-encoding emotion on item memory does not necessarily extend to reality-monitoring source memory.

219,Circulating catecholamines are associated with biobehavioral factors and anxiety symptoms in head and neck cancer patients,"Studies have shown that stress-related catecholamines may affect cancer progression. However, little is known about catecholamine secretion profiles in head and neck cancer patients. The present study investigated plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and patients with oral leukoplakia, as well as their association with clinicopathological and biobehavioral variables and anxiety symptoms. A total of 93 patients with HNSCC and 32 patients with oral leukoplakia were included. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), and psychological anxiety levels were measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were significantly higher in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to non-cancer patients. Oral SCC patients displayed plasma norepinephrine levels about six times higher than oropharyngeal SCC patients, and nine times higher than oral leukoplakia patients (p &lt; .001). Plasma epinephrine levels in oral SCC patients were higher compared to the oropharyngeal SCC (p = .0097) and leukoplakia (p &lt; .0001) patients. Oropharyngeal SCC patients had higher plasma norepinephrine (p = .0382) and epinephrine levels (p = .045) than patients with oral leukoplakia. Multiple regression analyses showed that a history of high alcohol consumption was predictive for reduced plasma norepinephrine levels in the oral SCC group (p &lt; .001). Anxiety symptom of “hand tremor” measured by the BAI was an independent predictor for higher plasma norepinephrine levels in HNSCC patients (β = 157.5, p = .0377), while the “heart pounding/racing” symptom was independently associated with higher plasma epinephrine levels in the oropharyngeal SCC group (β = 15.8, p = .0441). In oral leukoplakia patients, sleep deprivation and worse sleep quality were independent predictors for higher plasma norepinephrine levels, while severe tobacco consumption and higher anxiety levels were factors for higher plasma epinephrine levels. These findings suggest that head and neck cancer patients display sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and that changes in circulating catecholamines may be associated with alcohol consumption, as well as withdrawal-related anxiety symptoms.

220,"Depressive and socially anxious symptoms, psychosocial maturity, and risk perception: Associations with risk-taking behaviour","Risk-taking behaviour and onset of mental illness peak in adolescence and young adulthood. This study evaluated the interconnectedness of the domains of risk-taking behaviour, mental health (symptoms of depression and social anxiety), psychosocial maturity, risk perception, age, and gender in a sample of 306 adolescents and young adults. Participants between the ages of 16 and 35 completed online self-report measures assessing risk-taking behaviour, depressive symptoms, socially anxious symptoms, psychosocial maturity and risk perception. Socially anxious symptoms, psychosocial maturity, and risk perception were directly associated with risk-taking behaviour. Correlations between depressive symptoms, socially anxious symptoms, and psychosocial maturity were found. Psychosocial maturity proved a better predictor of risk-taking behaviour than age in this cohort. The findings indicate that mental health impacts upon risk-taking behaviour and that consideration should be given to psychosocial maturity in attempts to reduce adolescent and young adult risk-taking behaviour.

221,Is pornography use a risk for adolescent well-being? An examination of temporal relationships in two independent panel samples,"Cross-sectional evidence suggests that pornography use is related to lower mental wellbeing among adolescents but it remains unclear if changes in well-being are related to the dynamics of pornography use within this population. We examined the relationship between pornography use, subjective well-being, symptoms of depressions and anxiety, and self-esteem in two independent panel samples ( N = 455; N = 858) of Croatian adolescents using cross-lagged path analysis and lagged linear mixed models. After controlling for impulsiveness and family environment—factors that are unlikely to be influenced by pornography use—earlier levels of pornography use were not significantly associated with subsequent decreases in subjective well-being across gender and panel. However, pornography use was associated with increases in both self-esteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety, albeit only among adolescent women in one of the two panels. In addition, low subjective well-being was associated with a subsequent increase in pornography use, but only in female adolescents in one panel. This study's results are not consistent with concerns about pornography use negatively contributing to male adolescents' psychological well-being, but suggest potential antagonistic links between pornography use and specific facets of mental well-being in adolescent women. Such links should be considered tentative until verified with further research.

222,"Reliability, validation and norms of the Chinese version of Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 in a sample of military personnel","This study aimed to explore the properties of the Chinese version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index−3 (ASI-3) in a sample of military personnel. Using non-probabilistic sampling, the Chinese version of the ASI-3 was administered to 3,077 valid participants aged 16 to 36 years old (M = 22.35, SD = 3.57) from nine military units. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales- 21 (DASS-21) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to assess the construct validity. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the differences in the services and positions of the participants. It was found that ①The indices of confirmatory factor analysis met the standard values, which supported the hypothesis of the three-factor model of the original ASI-3; ②ASI-3 was significantly associated with DASS-21 in positive ways, which indicated the high convergent validity; on the other hand, the correlation between ASI-3 and TAI was relatively low, which indicated there was an empirical discrimination between anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety. ③The Cronbach's α coefficients were 0.926 for the total scale and 0.828±0.841 for the three subscales; ④At a cut-off score of 16, the sensitivity and specificity levels were 71.1% and 76.7%, respectively, where the sum of sensitivity and specificity becomes the maximum, accompanied with improvement of PPV and NPV; ⑤There were significant findings in the ASI and subscales among the five services and four positions. This study provides new evidence that the Chinese version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 has good validity and reliability and could be applied as an effective tool to assess anxiety sensitivity in military personnel. Our recommendations to researchers and practitioners are that the three factor model should be replicated across some different special forces and the items and constructs could be modified on Chinese culture.

223,A positive attitude towards provision of end-of- life care may protect against burnout: Burnout and religion in a super-aging society,"Aim: The aim of our study was to investigate factors associated with burnout of nurses and care workers in nursing homes and geriatric hospitals in Japan. The use of Buddhist priests, the major religion in Japan, was also explored. Methods: Questionnaires for nurses and care workers were sent to 10 care facilities. The survey questions included basic demographic information, the Japanese Burnout Index and the Japanese version of the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care Of Dying Scale Form B. They also asked questions about use of Buddhist priests for tasks such as helping to manage the anxiety or distress of patients, families, and staff, or providing sutra chanting. Results: In total, 323 questionnaires were returned, of which 260 were used for analysis. Only 18 (6.9%) answered that they had any religious beliefs, which was relatively low compared to 27% from governmental survey data. In total, however, 71% expressed a need for Buddhist priests to help with anxiety or distress among patients. A positive attitude towards providing end-of-life care was a protective factor against depersonalization. It was, however, also related to lower feelings of personal accomplishment. Conclusion: Care homes and geriatric hospitals may want to consider calling more on religious resources as a support for staff and patients.

224,When mathematics meets physical activity in the school-aged child: The effect of an integrated motor and cognitive approach to learning geometry,"Mathematics is a science which can lead to both anxiety in children and teaching difficulties in teachers. Together, these two difficulties can increase the time spent in teaching and learning mathematics. The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of a new integrated mathematics/geometry and physical activity program, specifically structured for increasing learning in fourth-grade pupils. Thirty-six children (age 10.36 ± 0.55) were divided into an experimental (n₁ = 19) group and a control (n₂ = 17) group. The experimental group of subjects learned mathematics and geometry via the integrated teaching method, while the control group of subjects learned these subjects via traditional teaching methods. We administered two ad hoc tests, before and after the intervention, in order to study its effect. One test was on geometry knowledge and the other on mathematics, in which there were questions about the implemented teaching topics: rectangles, squares and their perimeters. Using a factorial 2 × 2 ANOVA, the results after four weeks indicated that the group of subjects who gained their mathematics and geometry knowledge through our intervention program were significantly more successful ( P &lt; 0.05) than the control group. Our results suggest that the integrated teaching method proposed here could be considered a useful and efficient method for teaching mathematics and geometry based on motor tasks.

225,The analgesic effect of music on cold pressor pain responses: The influence of anxiety and attitude toward pain,"Objective: The analgesic effect of music has been recognized for pain relief, but individual differences and adjuvant methods are poorly understood. This study employed a cold-pressor task (CPT) to observe the effects of music (without considering personal preferences) on pain experience and how this is affected by individuals' general (and pain-specific) anxiety symptomology. Methods: Fifty participants were each presented with three conditions (randomized into different orders): music-listening, news-listening, and no sound (control). Pain responses, including pain tolerance time (PT), pain intensity (PI), and pain unpleasantness (PU), were assessed using CPT and compared with a 3x3 crossover design. Participants also completed the anxiety sensitivity index (ASI-16) and pain anxiety symptom scale (PASS-20). Results: CPT pain responses during the music intervention were significantly different from responses during the news intervention and control conditions, respectively. Among participants with normal anxiety levels, pain responses during the music condition differed significantly from the news and control groups; this was not the case for the anxiety risk group. Pain responses during the music condition for those with normal levels of pain-specific anxiety differed significantly from the control, but this was not the case for the risk group. Conclusions: Music appears to influence diminished pain responses relative to the absence of an intervention. However, this was not the case when individuals listened to news stories. These effects were more robust for individuals experiencing normal levels of general and pain-specific anxiety. Thus, music (even outside one's own preferences) was an effective adjuvant method for managing pain, especially among those without significant anxiety symptomology.

226,Correlation of tryptophan metabolites with connectivity of extended central reward network in healthy subjects,"Objective: A growing body of preclinical and clinical literature suggests that brain-gut-microbiota interactions play an important role in human health and disease, including hedonic food intake and obesity. We performed a tripartite network analysis based on graph theory to test the hypothesis that microbiota-derived fecal metabolites are associated with connectivity of key regions of the brain's extended reward network and clinical measures related to obesity. Methods: DTI and resting state fMRI imaging was obtained from 63 healthy subjects with and without elevated body mass index (BMI) (29 males and 34 females). Subjects submitted fecal samples, completed questionnaires to assess anxiety and food addiction, and BMI was recorded. Results: The study results demonstrate associations between fecal microbiota-derived indole metabolites (indole, indoleacetic acid, and skatole) with measures of functional and anatomical connectivity of the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and anterior insula, in addition to BMI, food addiction scores (YFAS) and anxiety symptom scores (HAD Anxiety). Conclusions: The findings support the hypothesis that gut microbiota-derived indole metabolites may influence hedonic food intake and obesity by acting on the extended reward network, specifically the amygdala-nucleus accumbens circuit and the amygdala-anterior insula circuit. These cross sectional, data-driven results provide valuable information for future mechanistic studies.

227,Spanish adaptation and psychometric properties of the child version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire,"Background: The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for children (CERQ-k) is a useful clinical and research tool to identify cognitive patterns of emotion regulation that predict the presence of emotional symptomatology. This study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the CERQ-k (the CERQ-Sk) using a sample of children from Spain, which is not available. Methods: The sample consisted of 582 children (48.6% girls) aged between 7 and 12 years ( M age = 9.49; SD = 1.2) recruited from Alicante, Spain. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies, anxiety and depressive symptomatology were self-reported evaluated. Factor structure, internal consistency, temporal stability with the Spanish version for children were examined. Convergent validity was evaluated using Spearman correlations to examine the relationships between the CERQ-k and measures of anxiety (trait anxiety subscale of STAI-C) and depression (CDI). Results: The Spanish version of CERQ-Sk had the same nine factors proposed in the original version. Ordinal alpha of the total scale was excellent (.88), and moderate indexes were found for each subscale (.56 to .75). The 8-week test-retest coefficient was adequate for the total scale (ICC = .74) and moderate for the subscales (.54 to .70). Evidence of convergent validity was provided through correlations with the CDI (depression) and trait anxiety subscale of the STAI-C (anxiety). Cognitive strategies such as Rumination, self-blame, catastrophizing, and other-blame were significantly and positively related to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, positive refocusing and planning seemed to act as strategies that have a positive effect on the prevention of depression in children. Conclusions: Results suggest that the CERQ-Sk is a reliable and valid tool that can be useful for researchers and clinicians to identify maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation patterns that may increase the risk of emotional problems, and orient treatment and prevention of mental health problems in children from Spanish-speaking countries.

228,Screening for neuropsychological impairment in COPD patients undergoing rehabilitation,"Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex multi-component disorder characterized by progressive irreversible respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary comorbidities, including anxiety-depression and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the prevalence of these impairments is still uncertain, due to non-optimal screening methods. This observational cross-sectional multicentre study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety-depressive symptoms and MCI in COPD patients, identify the most appropriate cognitive tests to screen MCI, and investigate specific cognitive deficits in these patients and possible predictive factors. Materials and methods: Sixty-five stable COPD inpatients (n = 65, aged 69.9 ± 7.6 years, mainly stage III-IV GOLD) underwent the following assessments: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a complete neuropsychological battery (ENB-2) including different cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive functions, and perceptive and praxis abilities). Results: Moderate-severe anxiety was present in 18.5% of patients and depressive symptoms in 30.7%. The prevalence of MCI varied according to the test: 6.2% (MMSE), 18.5% (MoCA) and 50.8% (ENB-2). In ENB-2, patients performed significantly worse compared to Italian normative data on digit span (5.11 ± 0.9 vs. 5.52 ± 1.0, p = 0.0004), trail making test-B (TMT-B) (176.31 ± 99.5 vs. 135.93 ± 58.0, p = 0.004), overlapping pictures (26.03 ± 8.9 vs. 28.75 ± 8.2, p = 0.018) and copy drawing (1.370.6 vs. 1.61 ± 0.5, p = 0.002). At logistic regression analysis, only COPD severity (p = 0.012, odds ratio, OR, 4.4 [95% CI: 1.4-14.0]) and anxiety symptoms (p = 0.026, OR 4.6 [1.2-17.7]) were significant and independent predictors of the deficit in copy drawing, which assesses visuospatial and praxis skills. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of neuropsychological impairments in COPD patients, the routine adoption in rehabilitation of screening tools for mood and cognitive function, including digit span, TMT-B and copy drawing, may be useful to detect psychosocial comorbidities and personalize the rehabilitative program.

229,Effects of heart rate variability biofeedback training in athletes exposed to stress of university examinations,"Introduction: Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BFB) training, a method whereby one controls an unusually low breathing rate to reach cardiac coherence, has been shown to reduce anxiety and improve cardiac autonomic markers in diseased people, but much less is known about HRV-BFB benefits in healthy people. Here we investigated potential benefits in young competitors experiencing stress during university examinations as well as persistence of benefits after HRV-BFB training cessation. Methods: A group of sports students (n = 12) practiced 5-min HRV-BFB training twice a day for 5- weeks using URGOfeel ® (URGOTECH) and was compared to a control group (n = 6). University examinations occurred immediately after HRV-BFB training (Exam1), then 12-weeks later (Exam2). Anxiety markers and cardiac autonomic markers were assessed at baseline, Exam1 and Exam2. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) that combined all these markers were computed at Exam1 and Exam2 to emphasize covariations. Results: At Exam 1, immediately after HRV-BFB training cessation, the experimental group demonstrated greater autonomic markers but similar states of anxiety when compared to the Control group. Twelve weeks later at Exam2, autonomic markers were greater and anxiety scores were lesser among the experimental group. PCA highlighted covariations only within cardiac autonomic markers at Exam1. Rather, variations in cardiac markers were associated with anxiety markers at Exam2. Conclusion: Short sessions of HRV-BFB training for a brief period of 5 weeks bring substantial benefits to autonomic markers and anxiety levels in young competitors. Here beneficial effects persisted for 12 weeks. Dissociated profiles of anxiety and cardiac autonomic adaptations shed new light on the role of the amygdala in heart-brain interactions after cardiac coherence training.

230,Cognitive behaviour treatment of co-occurring depression and generalised anxiety in routine clinical practice,"Background: Anxiety and depression are closely associated. However, they are typically treated separately and there is a dearth of information on tackling them together. Aims: The study's purpose was to establish how best to treat co-occurring anxiety and depression in a routine clinical service-specifically, to compare cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) focusing only on depression (CBT-D) to a broader CBT focusing on both depression and anxiety (CBT-DA). Method: Case notes of 69 patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety seen in a routine clinical service were randomly selected to review from a pool of 990 patients. The mean age was 44.61 years ( SD = 12.97). 65% of the sample were female and 88% reported their ethnicity white. The content of electronic records reporting techniques used and scores on a measure of depression (The Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment) were reviewed to categorise therapy as CBT-D or CBT-DA. Results: Results indicated significant overall improvement with CBT; 70% and 77% of the sample met criteria for reliable improvement on The Patient Health Questionnaire and The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment respectively. Fewer patients who received CBT-DA met The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment recovery criteria at the end of treatment than those who received CBT-D. Mean post treatment PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores remained above threshold for those receiving CBT_DA but not those receiving CBT-D. There was no evidence suggesting CBT-DA was superior to CBT-D. Conclusions: In patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety, a broader treatment addressing both anxiety and depression does not appear to be associated with improved outcomes compared to treatment focused on depression.

231,Psychological inflexibility explains distress in parents whose children have chronic conditions,"Experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and mindfulness have all been associated with psychological disorders and well-being. This study investigates whether they predict psychological distress, i.e., symptoms of burnout, depression, stress and anxiety, in parents of children with chronic conditions. We hypothesized that these factors would exhibit a large degree of common variance, and that when compared to mindfulness and defusion, experiential avoidance on its own would predict a larger proportion of unique variance. 75 parents of children with chronic conditions having burnout symptoms who participated in an intervention study completed measures of burnout, stress, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and mindfulness at the beginning of the intervention study (baseline). We ran several regression analyses to assess the predictive ability of these different constructs. Experiential avoidance on its own accounted for 28±48% of the variance in different psychological symptoms. Cognitive defusion and mindfulness did not make a significant contribution to explaining burnout, stress and anxiety, but cognitive defusion contributed to explaining depression. The results confirmed our hypothesis, supporting research on the importance of psychological flexibility as a central factor in understanding the occurrence of psychological distress.

232,Being Present: A single-arm feasibility study of audio-based mindfulness meditation for colorectal cancer patients and caregivers,"A metastatic cancer diagnosis is associated with high levels of distress in patients and caregivers. Mindfulness interventions can reduce distress and improve quality of life in cancer patients. However, standard mindfulness training relies on in-person instruction, which is often not practical for either patients receiving chemotherapy or their caregivers. In the Being Present single arm pilot study, we designed and tested an 8-week audio-based mindfulness meditation program for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy with or without a participating caregiver. The study accrued 33 of 74 (45%) eligible patients consenting together with 20 family caregivers (53 participants total) within nine months. Forty-one participants were evaluable (77%); 10 of 12 cases of attrition were attributable to hospitalization or death. Median participant age was 51 (range 21±78 years); 38% were men. Baseline levels of distress were similar in patients and caregivers. The top reasons for participation cited in pre-intervention interviews were to increase relaxation/calm, improve mood/emotions, and reduce stress/anxiety. In measures of adherence, 59% of responses to weekly texts asking: ""Have you practiced today?"" were ""Yes"" and 59% of interviewees reported practicing &gt;50% of the time. Compared to baseline, post-intervention surveys demonstrated significantly reduced distress (p = 0.01) and anxiety (p = 0.03); as well as increased non-reactivity (p &lt; 0.01), and feeling at peace (p &lt; 0.01). Post-intervention qualitative interviews, where 71% of participants reported benefit, were consistent with quantitative findings. In the interviews, participants spontaneously described reduced stress/anxiety and increased relaxation/calm. Benefits appeared to be accentuated in patient-caregiver pairs as compared to unpaired patients. Seventy-nine percent of participants reported plans for continued practice after study completion. We conclude that the Being Present audiobased mindfulness meditation program is of interest to, feasible, and acceptable for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and caregivers, with initial evidence of efficacy. These results will guide plans for a follow-up study.

233,"Salivary testosterone in relation to social cognition and social anxiety in children and adolescents with 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)","Background: Approximately 1 in 650 boys are born with an extra X chromosome. Boys and men with 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and specific cognitive impairments. This study was focused on social anxiety and social cognition. The aim was to assess if these aspects of the phenotype are related to testosterone deficiency, which is typically seen in 47,XXY from puberty onwards. Methods: In the study 20 boys with 47,XXY and 25 non-clinical controls between 8 and 19 years participated. None had ever used testosterone supplements. Cognitive tests measuring the labeling of facial expressions and perspective taking (Theory of Mind) were administered. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess social anxiety. Testosterone was measured in saliva. Results: Within the 47,XXY group lower levels of salivary testosterone were significantly associated with higher levels of social anxiety. The correlation was strong, andindependent of age and pubertal development. However, salivary levels of testosterone were uncorrelated to social cognitive skills. Discussion: These findings point out that lower testosterone levels might contribute to high social anxiety in 47,XXY, suggesting that anxiety should be monitored in pubertal boys with XXY presenting with testosterone deficiency. This should be done in addition to exploring cognitive behavioral therapy or psychopharmacologic treatments targeting anxiety, which are more evidence based. In contrast, testosterone levels were not associated with social cognitive functioning, suggesting that other mechanisms are driving vulnerabilities in this domain.

234,Anxiety and the severity of tension-type headache mediate the relation between headache presenteeism and workers' productivity,"The primary objective of this study was to explore the mechanisms and conditions whereby Tension-Type Headache (TTH) presenteeism relates to health-related loss of productivity as a result of both reduced physical and mental health. To this end, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to conduct a secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 78 Tension-type Headache (TTH) patients. The results showed that TTH presenteeism did not directly relate to health-related loss of productivity, either due to physical, or mental health problems. However, through anxiety-state, TTH presenteeism decreased patients' productivity, as consequence of reduced physical and mental health. Moreover, by increasing the severity of the Tension-Type Headache, TTH presenteeism indirectly decreased patients' productivity as consequence of reduced physical health (but not mental health). Finally, our results show that such indirect effects only occur when the cause of TTH is non-mechanical (e.g., hormonal causes, etc.). Our work provides an integrative model that can inform organizational behaviorists and health professionals (e.g., physiotherapists). Implications for organizational health are discussed.

235,Factorial validity and invariance of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 among clinical and non-clinical populations,"The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is commonly used to screen for depressive disorder and for monitoring depressive symptoms. However, there are mixed findings regarding its factor structure (i.e., whether it has a unidimensional, two-dimensional, or bi-factor structure). Furthermore, its measurement invariance between non-clinical and clinical populations and that between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and MDD with comorbid anxiety disorder (AD) is unknown. Japanese adults with MDD ( n = 406), MDD with AD ( n = 636), and no psychiatric disorders (non-clinical population; n = 1,163) answered this questionnaire on the Internet. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the bi-factor model had a better fit than the unidimensional and two-dimensional factor models did. The results of a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated scalar invariance between the nonclinical and only MDD groups, and that between the only MDD and MDD with AD groups. In conclusion, the bi-factor model with two specific factors was supported among the non-clinical, only MDD, and MDD with AD groups. The scalar measurement invariance model was supported between the groups, which indicated the total or sub-scale scores were comparable between groups.

236,Five-week yin yoga-based interventions decreased plasma adrenomedullin and increased psychological health in stressed adults: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs, e.g. cardiovascular disease) are responsible for high rates of morbidity and the majority of premature deaths worldwide. It is necessary to develop preventative interventions that can reduce the associated risk factors of NCDs. Researchers have found that the biomarker adrenomedullin (ADM) becomes elevated years before the onset of NCDs and might play an important role in their development. ADM has also been linked to psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression, which are known risk factors of NCDs. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined whether participating in a five-week yoga intervention reduces ADM and increases psychological health in middle- aged adults who self-report as moderately to highly stressed, but who otherwise exhibit no physical complaints. Methods: One hundred and five adults (78% women; mean age = 53.5, SD = 6.7) were randomly assigned to (1) a five-week Yin yoga intervention, (2) a five-week intervention combining Yin yoga with psychoeducation and mindfulness practice (called the YOMI program), or (3) a control group who did not practice yoga or mindfulness for five weeks. Results: Compared to the control group, we observed significantly greater pre-post reductions in plasma ADM levels ( p &lt; .001), anxiety (p .002), and sleep problems (p .003) in both intervention groups. Furthermore, the YOMI group exclusively showed significantly greater pre-post reductions in stress ( p = .012) and depression ( p = .021) compared to the control group. Significant correlations ( p &lt; .05) were found between pre-post reductions in ADM and anxiety symptoms ( p = .02) and depression ( p = .04) in the entire sample. Conclusion: The five-week Yin yoga-based interventions appeared to reduce both the physiological and psychological risk factors known to be associated with NCDs. The study suggests that incorporating Yin yoga could be an easy and low-cost method of limiting the negative health effects associated with high stress.

237,Development and pilot of a decision-aid for patients with bipolar II disorder and their families making decisions about treatment options to prevent relapse,"Introduction: Treatment decisions in bipolar II disorder (BPII) are finely-balanced and sensitive to patient preferences. This pilot study evaluated a decision-aid booklet (DA) for patients with BPII (and their family) to obtain evidence on its acceptability, feasibility, safety, and usefulness in potential end-users. Methods: The DA booklet was developed according to International Patient Decision-Aid Standards. Thirty-one patients diagnosed with BPII and their families ( n = 11), who were currently making or had previously made treatment decisions, participated. Participants read the DA and completed validated and purpose-designed questionnaires. A follow-up semi-structured telephone interview elicited more in-depth DA feedback ( n = 40). Results: Patients and family endorsed the DA booklet as: easy-to-use (100% agree), useful in treatment decision-making (100%), presenting balanced (patients = 96.8%, family = 100%), upto- date (93.5%, 100%) and trustworthy information (93.5%, 100%) that did not provoke anxiety (93.5%, 90.9%). All participants stated that they would recommend the DA to others. Following DA use, all except one participant (97.6%) demonstrated adequate treatment knowledge (&gt; 50% score). Patients reported low decisional conflict ( M = 18.90/100) following DA use and felt well-prepared to make treatment decisions ( M = 4.28/5). Most patients (90.3%) indicated uptake of treatments consistent with the best available clinical evidence. Additionally, a large proportion of patients made an informed choice about medication (65.5%) with adjunctive psychological treatment (50.0%), based on adequate knowledge and their treatment values. Interview findings further supported the DA's acceptability among participants. Discussion: Pilot findings indicate that patients with BPII and their family consider this DA booklet highly acceptable and useful in making evidence-based treatment decisions that align with their treatment preferences.

238,"Health-related quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms and structural brain changes in clinically isolated syndrome","Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are frequent in multiple sclerosis, where are associated with structural brain changes, but have been less studied in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Objective: To characterize HRQoL, neuropsychiatric symptoms (depressive symptoms, anxiety, apathy and fatigue), their interrelations and associations with structural brain changes in CIS. Methods: Patients with CIS (n = 67) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 46) underwent neurological and psychological examinations including assessment of HRQoL, neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning, and MRI brain scan with global, regional and lesion load volume measurement. Results: The CIS group had more, mostly mild, depressive symptoms and anxiety, and lower HRQoL physical and social subscores (p ≤ 0.037). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with most HRQoL subscores (β ≤ -0.34, p ≤ 0.005). Cognitive functioning unlike clinical disability was associated with depressive symptoms and lower HRQoL emotional subscores (β ≤ -0.29, p ≤0.019). Depressive symptoms and apathy were associated with right temporal, left insular and right occipital lesion load (ß ≥ 0.29, p≤0.032). Anxiety was associated with lower white matter volume (ß = -0.25, p = 0.045). Conclusion: Mild depressive symptoms and anxiety with decreased HRQoL are present in patients with CIS. Neuropsychiatric symptoms contributing to decreased HRQoL are the result of structural brain changes and require complex therapeutic approach in patients with CIS.

239,Newborn infants' hair cortisol levels reflect chronic maternal stress during pregnancy,"Cortisol obtained from hair samples represents a retrospective biomarker of chronic stress experienced by the subject in previous months. Although hair cortisol levels have been used to study the relationship between maternal and neonatal stress levels in primates, this has not yet been performed in humans using a longitudinal design and focusing specifically on this association. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether a relationship existed between maternal psychological stress and hair cortisol levels during pregnancy and postpartum, and neonatal hair cortisol levels. The sample consisted of 80 pregnant women and their 80 newborn infants. We conducted a longitudinal assessment of hair cortisol levels, psychological stress, anxiety, and depression in the three trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum. After childbirth, neonatal hair cortisol levels were also measured. We found that maternal hair cortisol levels in the first trimester negatively predicted neonatal hair cortisol levels. Perceived stress in the third trimester of pregnancy also predicted lower neonatal cortisol, whereas pregnancy-specific stress in the same trimester had a positive relation with neonatal cortisol. Cortisol is essential for embryonic and fetal development; consequently, if fetal synthesis of cortisol is affected by high maternal cortisol levels, such development could be impaired.

240,Anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis altered in a female rat model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy,"Surgical weight loss results in a host of metabolic changes that culminate in net positive health benefit to the patients. However, the psychological impact of these surgeries has not been fully studied. On one hand, surgical weight loss has been reported to improve standard quality of life and resolution of symptoms of depression. But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced obesity and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin ( avp ), pro-opiomelanocortin ( pomc ), and tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ). We report reduced dopamine receptor D1 ( drd1 ) gene in prefrontal cortex (PFC) in VSG animals in comparison to Sham. Further we report diet-driven changes in stress-relevant gene targets in the hypothalamus ( oxt, pomc, crhr1 ) and adrenal ( nr3c1, nr3c2, mc2r ). Taken together, these data suggest a significant impact of both surgical weight loss and diet on the HPA axis and further impact on behavior. Additional assessment is necessary to determine whether molecular and hormonal changes of surgical weight loss are the source of these findings.

241,The effect of depressive symptoms on cognition in patients with fibromyalgia,"Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) patients frequently complain of cognitive problems, but it remains unclear whether these cognitive complaints can be attributed to a dysfunction of the central nervous system or if they can be explained by other factors associated with the disease, such as depression, anxiety and sleep dysfunction. Methods; One hundred and ten patients with FM were compared with thirty-three patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder (DD) and fifty healthy controls (HC). Several measures of attention and executive functions were used to make these comparisons and the patients were also asked to complete questionnaires on depression, anxiety and sleep quality. Univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to identify and control confounders and multiple linear models were used to examine the effects of fibromyalgia and depression on cognitive measures. Results: FM and HC differed significantly with respect to depression, anxiety and sleep dysfunction, whereas FM and DD did not differ in terms of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, FM was associated with a worse quality of sleep than DD. Comparisons of cognitive performance between groups showed that short-term and working memory and inattention measures were only associated with symptoms of depression, whereas selective attention was associated with both depression and fibromyalgia, and processing speed, cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control showed a significant interaction between depression and fibromyalgia. Moreover, cognitive flexibility and inhibition abilities were specifically associated with FM. Conclusion: FM patients show a cluster of cognitive impairment in the attentional and executive domains, although some of the symptoms observed could be explained by the severity of the symptoms of depression, while others seem to depend on the effects of fibromyalgia. Implications of the findings for the understanding and management of cognitive impairment of FM patients are discussed.

242,One day you'll wake up and won't have to go to work: The impact of changes in time use on mental health following retirement,"Background: Retirement is a life transition involving an obligatory change in how people use their time. Because there are strong associations between use of time and health, different changes in time use following retirement may have different impacts on mental health. Methods: 105 participants were followed from 6 months before retirement to 12 months after retirement. At each time-point, use of time was quantified using a validated computerised 24-hour recall. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS21), well-being with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), life satisfaction with the Australian Unity Personal Well-being Index (AUPWI), and self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Time-use data were analysed using compositional data analysis, which treats the 24-h day as a holistic ""activity composition"" rather than as individual activity domains. Time flow analytics were used to map patterns of change in time use from pre-retirement to post-retirement. Regression analysis was used to determine whether changes in the activity composition were significantly associated with changes in mental health. Compositional isotemporal substitution models were used to illustrate dose-response relationships between changes in time use and conditional changes in mental health for individual activity domains, such as sleep, screen time and physical activity. Results: Following retirement, time no longer spent in work flowed mainly to household chores, sleep, screen time and quiet time (e.g. reading). Mental health improved overall. Changes in the activity composition were significantly related to conditional changes in DASS21 total score, depression, stress, and self-esteem, but not to anxiety, well-being or life satisfaction. Replacing work time with physical activity or sleep was associated with positive changes in mental health. Effect sizes for 60-minute substitutions ranged from −0.15 to +0.31. Conclusion: Following retirement, replacing work with physical activity, and to a lesser extent sleep, is associated with better mental health.

243,Mental health effects caused by red imported fire ant attacks ( &lt;i&gt;Solenopsis invicta&lt;/i&gt;),"Susceptible individuals who have suffered painful stings caused by red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta , usually experience physical health effects such as fever, dizziness, generalized urticaria, or other systemic reactions such as anaphylactic shock. Whether S. invicta stings also have negative effects on mental health is not clear. In the present study, the psychological impact of S. invicta stings was evaluated using a questionnaire that included a previously published posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 5th scale (PSQI(5)). A total of 96 valid questionnaires were obtained; 37 participants were placed in the stung group, and 59 participants were placed in the unstung group. Our results showed that symptoms of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances were not associated with S. invicta stings (for GAD-7 scale, Pearson Chi-Square test, χ² = 0.152, df = 1, P = 0.697; for the BAI, χ² = 2.252, df = 1, P = 0.133; for the PHQ-9, χ² = 0.098, df = 1, P = 0.754; for the PSQI(5), χ² = 0.536, df = 1, P = 0.453). In total, 2 of 83 individuals stung by S. invicta met the criteria (&gt; 50) for PTSD. However, there was no significant difference on PTSD between those stung by S. invicta in the 30-day group and the over 30-day group (χ² = 0.318, df = 1, P = 0.573). Overall, our data do not show an effect of S. invicta stings on mental health as measured using a range of indicators.

244,The relationship between anxiety and acute mountain sickness,"Introduction: Whilst the link between physical factors and risk of high altitude (HA)-related illness and acute mountain sickness (AMS) have been extensively explored, the influence of psychological factors has been less well examined. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between ‘anxiety and AMS risk during a progressive ascent to very HA. Methods: Eighty health adults were assessed at baseline (848 m) and over 9 consecutive altitudes during a progressive trek to 5140 m. HA-related symptoms (Lake Louise [LLS] and AMS-C Scores) and state anxiety (State-Trait-Anxiety-Score [STAI Y-1]) were examined at each altitude with trait anxiety (STAI Y-2) at baseline. Results: The average age was 32.1 ± 8.3 years (67.5% men). STAI Y-1 scores fell from 848 m to 3619 m, before increasing to above baseline scores (848 m) at ≥ 4072 m (p = 0.01). STAI Y-1 scores correlated with LLS (r = 0.31; 0.24–0.3; P &lt; 0.0001) and AMS-C Scores (r = 0.29; 0.22–0.35; P &lt; 0.0001). There was significant main effect for sex (higher STAI Y-1 scores in women) and altitude with no sex-x-altitude interaction on STAI Y-1 Scores. Independent predictors of significant state anxiety included female sex, lower age, higher heart rate and increasing LLS and AMS-C scores (p &lt; 0.0001). A total of 38/80 subjects (47.5%) developed AMS which was mild in 20 (25%) and severe in 18 (22.5%). Baseline STAI Y-2 scores were an independent predictor of future severe AMS (B = 1.13; 1.009–1.28; p = 0.04; r² = 0.23) and STAI Y-1 scores at HA independently predicted AMS and its severity. Conclusion: Trait anxiety at low altitude was an independent predictor of future severe AMS development at HA. State anxiety at HA was independently associated with AMS and its severity.

245,"Binge eating, trauma, and suicide attempt in community adults with major depressive disorder","Eating disorders comorbid with depression are an established risk factor for suicide. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of binge eating (BE) symptoms on suicidality and related clinical characteristics in major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 817 community participants with MDD were included. We compared two groups (with and without lifetime BE symptoms). The MDD with BE group was subdivided into a frequent BE (FBE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly) and any BE (ABE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly). The MDD with BE group comprised 142 (17.38%) patients. The FBE and ABE subgroups comprised 75 (9.18%) and 67 (8.20%) patients, respectively. Comorbid alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and history of suicide attempt were significantly more frequent in the MDD with BE group than MDD without BE group. Sexual trauma was also reported more frequently in MDD with BE group. No significant differences were observed between the ABE and FBE subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an association of suicide attempt with BE symptoms and sexual trauma. Structural equation modeling showed that sexual trauma increased BE (β = 0.337, P &lt; 0.001) together with alcohol use (β = 0.185, P &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (β = 0.299, p &lt; 0.001), which in turn increased suicide attempt (β = 0.087, p = 0.011). BE symptoms were associated with suicide attempt in MDD after adjusting for other factors associated with suicidality. BE symptoms also moderated an association between suicide attempt and sexual trauma.

246,The anxiolytic effect of probiotics: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical and preclinical literature,"Background: Probiotics have generated intensive research interest in recent years as a novel mode of treatment for physical and mental illness. Nevertheless, the anxiolytic potential of probiotics remains unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical and preclinical (animal model) evidence regarding the effect of probiotic administration on anxiety. Methods: The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were reviewed for preclinical and clinical studies that met the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The effects of probiotics on anxiety-like behavior and symptoms of anxiety were analyzed by meta-analyses. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted on diseased versus healthy animals, specific preclinical probiotic species, and clinical versus healthy human samples. Results: Data were extracted from 22 preclinical studies (743 animals) and 14 clinical studies (1527 individuals). Overall, probiotics reduced anxiety-like behavior in animals (Hedges' g = -0.47, 95% CI -0.77 −-0.16, p = 0.004). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction only among diseased animals. Probiotic species-level analyses identified only Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus as an anxiolytic species, but these analyses were broadly under-powered. Probiotics did not significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety in humans (Hedges' g = -0.12, 95% CI -0.29−0.05, p = 0.151), and did not differentially affect clinical and healthy human samples. Conclusions: While preclinical (animal) studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce anxiety, such findings have not yet translated to clinical research in humans, perhaps due to the dearth of extant research with clinically anxious populations. Further investigation of probiotic treatment for clinically relevant anxiety is warranted, particularly with respect to the probiotic species L. rhamnosus.

247,The regulation of emotions in adolescents: Age differences and emotion-specific patterns,"Two experiments addressed the issue of age-related differences and emotion-specific patterns in emotion regulation during adolescence. Experiment 1 examined emotion-specific patterns in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction strategies in 14-year-old adolescents ( N = 50). Adolescents were instructed to answer spontaneously or to down regulate their responses by using either distraction or cognitive reappraisal strategies before viewing negative pictures and were asked to rate their emotional state after picture presentation. Results showed that reappraisal effectiveness was modulated by emotional content but distraction was not. Reappraisal was more effective than distraction at regulating fear or anxiety (threat-related pictures) but was similar to distraction regarding other emotions. Using the same paradigm, Experiment 2 examined in 12-year-old ( N = 56), 13-year-old ( N = 49) and 15-year-old adolescents ( N = 54) the age-related differences a) in the effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction when implemented and b) in the everyday use of regulation strategies using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Results revealed that regulation effectiveness was equivalent for both strategies in 12-year-olds, whereas a large improvement in reappraisal effectiveness was observed in 13- and 15-year-olds. No age differences were observed in the reported use of reappraisal, but older adolescents less frequently reported using distraction and more frequently reported using the rumination strategy. Taken together, these experiments provide new findings regarding the use and the effectiveness of cognitive regulation strategies during adolescence in terms of age differences and emotion specificity.

248,"The association of fatigue, pain, depression and anxiety with work and activity impairment in immune mediated inflammatory diseases","Impairment in work function is a frequent outcome in patients with chronic conditions such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), depression and anxiety disorders. The personal and economic costs of work impairment in these disorders are immense. Symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety are potentially remediable forms of distress that may contribute to work impairment in chronic health conditions such as IMID. The present study evaluated the association between pain [Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale], fatigue [Daily Fatigue Impact Scale], depression and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] and work impairment [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale] in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (n = 255), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 248, rheumatoid arthritis (n = 154) and a depression and anxiety group (n = 307), using quantile regression, controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors, physical disability, and cognitive deficits. Each of pain, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue individually showed significant associations with work absenteeism, presenteeism, and general activity impairment (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.3 to 1.0). When the distress variables were entered concurrently into the regression models, fatigue was a significant predictor of work and activity impairment in all models (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). These findings have important clinical implications for understanding the determinants of work impairment and for improving work-related outcomes in chronic disease.

249,Women's decision-making regarding riskstratified breast cancer screening and prevention from the perspective of international healthcare professionals,"Introduction: Increased knowledge of breast cancer risk factors may enable a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all breast cancer screening to screening and subsequent prevention guided by a woman's individual risk of breast cancer. Professionals will play a key role in informing women about this new personalised screening and prevention programme. Therefore, it is essential to explore professionals' views of the acceptability of this new programme, since this may affect shared decision-making. Methods: Professionals from three European countries (the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden) participated in digital concept mapping, a systematic mixed methods approach used to explore complex multidimensional constructs. Results: Across the three countries, professionals prioritised the following five themes which may impact decision-making from the perspective of eligible women: (1) Anxiety/worry; (2) Proactive approach; (3) Reassurance; (4) Lack of knowledge; and (5) Organisation of risk assessment and feedback. Furthermore, Dutch and British professionals expressed concerns regarding the acceptability of a heterogeneous screening policy, suggesting women will question their risk feedback and assigned pathway of care. Swedish professionals emphasised the potential impact of the programme on family relations. Conclusions: The perspectives of Dutch, British, and Swedish professionals of women's decision-making regarding personalised breast cancer screening and prevention generally appear in line with women's own views of acceptability as previously reported. This will facilitate shared decision- making. However, concerns regarding potential consequences of this new programme for screening outcomes and organisation need to be addressed, since this may affect how professionals communicate the programme to eligible women.

250,Changes in the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with major depression,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition that afflicts the general population across a broad spectrum of ages and social backgrounds. The inflammatory hypothesis of depression posits that immune hyperactivation and dysregulated cytokine production are involved in depression. To investigate cytokine profiles in patients with MDD, we examined the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and those of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had significantly higher levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF- α, but significantly lower levels of IL-8. There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-6 or TGF-β1. We found linear correlations between IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8, and the severity of depression, as well as between IL-8 and anxiety level in patients with comorbid anxiety disorder. In addition, higher IL-1β and TNF-α levels were associated with higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, while higher IL-8 levels were associated with lower HAMD and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Here we present evidence of changes in cytokine levels in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Abnormal expression of inflammatory cytokines in patients with depression suggests that depression activates an inflammatory process. Immunological abnormalities may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression.

251,Elevated oxytocin and noradrenaline indicate higher stress levels in allergic rhinitis patients: Implications for the skin prick diagnosis in a pilot study,"Background &amp; Aims: The effects of acute stress on allergic symptoms are little understood. The intention of this clinical study was to study the effects of acute stress and related mediators in allergic rhinitis (AR), taking the wheal and flare reaction in skin prick testing (SPT) as a readout. Methods: 19 healthy and 21 AR patients were first subjected to SPTs with grass pollen-, birch pollenand house dust mite allergen extracts, histamine and negative control. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a standardized Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by SPT on the contralateral forearm. Stress responders were identified based on the salivary cortisol levels and State-subscale of State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). Blood samples were collected before and after TSST and adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, oxytocin, platelet activating factor and prostaglandin D2 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Results: SPT results of 14/21 allergics and 11/19 healthy who responded with stress after TSST were evaluated. No significant differences regarding SPT to allergens or histamine before and after the stress test could be calculated at the group level. But, the wheal and flare sizes after TSST increased or decreased substantially in several individuals, and unmasked sensitization in one ""healthy"" person, which could not be correlated with any mediator tested. The most significant finding, however, was that, independent of TSST, the baseline levels of oxytocin and noradrenaline were significantly higher in allergics. Conclusion: High baseline levels of noradrenaline points toward higher stress levels in allergic patients, which might be counterregulated by elevated oxytocin. Moreover, our data indicate that acute stress may have a significant influence on SPT fidelity in susceptible individuals.

252,The impact of maternal anxiety disorder on mother-infant interaction in the postpartum period,"Background: This study investigated whether postpartum anxiety disorder is associated to altered patterns of infant as well as maternal engagement in a Face-to-Face-Still-Face interaction (FFSF). Sampling and methods: n = 39 women with postpartum DSM-IV anxiety disorder and n = 48 healthy mothers were videotaped during a FFSF with their infant ( M = 4.1 months). Results: Infants of the clinical group showed significantly less positive engagement during the play episode than infants of controls. This result depended on infant sex: male controls demonstrated more positive interaction than males of anxious mothers. There was no such effect for female infants who engaged significantly less positively during the play episode than males and did not change their positive engagement during the FFSF. These findings imply pronounced interactive positivity and early vulnerability to maternal anxiety symptoms in male infants. Only the infants of the controls showed the still-face effect. They also protested significantly more during the still-face, while the clinical infants' protest increased significantly during the reunion. Women of both groups did not differ in their interaction. Maternal intrusiveness was associated to infant protest in the course of the FFSF. Conclusions: Results suggest that mother-infant intervention should consider affect regulation and infant sex-specific characteristics in anxious mother-infant dyads.

253,Socio-cognitive load and social anxiety in an emotional anti-saccade task,"The anti-saccade task has been used to measure attentional control related to general anxiety but less so with social anxiety specifically. Previous research has not been conclusive in suggesting that social anxiety may lead to difficulties in inhibiting faces. It is possible that static face paradigms do not convey a sufficient social threat to elicit an inhibitory response in socially anxious individuals. The aim of the current study was twofold. We investigated the effect of social anxiety on performance in an anti-saccade task with neutral or emotional faces preceded either by a social stressor (Experiment 1), or valenced sentence primes designed to increase the social salience of the task (Experiment 2). Our results indicated that latencies were significantly longer for happy than angry faces. Additionally, and surprisingly, high anxious participants made more erroneous anti-saccades to neutral than angry and happy faces, whilst the low anxious groups exhibited a trend in the opposite direction. Results are consistent with a general approach-avoidance response for positive and threatening social information. However increased socio-cognitive load may alter attentional control with high anxious individuals avoiding emotional faces, but finding it more difficult to inhibit ambiguous faces. The effects of social sentence primes on attention appear to be subtle but suggest that the anti-saccade task will only elicit socially relevant responses where the paradigm is more ecologically valid.

254,Functional disruption of stress modulatory circuits in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy,"Clinical data suggest that the neuroendocrine stress response is chronically dysregulated in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), potentially contributing to both disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Whether neuroendocrine dysregulation and psychiatric comorbidities reflect direct effects of epilepsy-related pathologies, or secondary effects of disease burden particular to humans with epilepsy (i.e. social estrangement, employment changes) is not clear. Animal models provide an opportunity to dissociate these factors. Therefore, we queried whether epileptic mice would reproduce neuroendocrine and behavioral changes associated with human epilepsy. Male FVB mice were exposed to pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Morning baseline corticosterone levels were elevated in pilocarpine treated mice at 1, 7 and 10 weeks post-SE relative to controls. Similarly, epileptic mice had increased adrenal weight when compared to control mice. Exposure to acute restraint stress resulted in hypersecretion of corticosterone 30 min after the onset of the challenge. Anatomical analyses revealed reduced Fos expression in infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, ventral subiculum and basal amygdala following restraint. No differences in Fos immunoreactivity were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampal subfields or central amygdala. In order to assess emotional behavior, a second cohort of mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests, including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, 24h homecage monitoring and forced swim. Epileptic mice showed increased anhedonic behavior, hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Together these data demonstrate that epileptic mice develop HPA axis hyperactivity and exhibit behavioral dysfunction. Endocrine and behavioral changes are associated with impaired recruitment of forebrain circuits regulating stress inhibition and emotional reactivity. Loss of forebrain control may underlie pronounced endocrine dysfunction and comorbid psychopathologies seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.

255,Attention and working memory deficits in a perinatal nicotine exposure mouse model,"Background: Cigarette smoking by pregnant women is associated with a significant increase in the risk for cognitive disorders in their children. Preclinical models confirm this risk by showing that exposure of the developing brain to nicotine produces adverse behavioral outcomes. Here we describe behavioral phenotypes resulting from perinatal nicotine exposure in a mouse model, and discuss our findings in the context of findings from previously published studies using preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure. Methodology/Principal findings: Female C57Bl/6 mice received drinking water containing nicotine (100μg/ml) + saccharin (2%) starting 3 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy, and until 3 weeks postpartum. Over the same period, female mice in two control groups received drinking water containing saccharin (2%) or plain drinking water. Offspring from each group were weaned at 3-weeks of age and subjected to behavioral analyses at 3 months of age. We examined spontaneous locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, object based attention, recognition memory and impulsive-like behavior. We found significant deficits in attention and working memory only in male mice, and no significant changes in the other behavioral phenotypes in male or female mice. Exposure to saccharin alone did not produce significant changes in either sex. Conclusion/Significance: The perinatal nicotine exposure produced significant deficits in attention and working memory in a sex-dependent manner in that the male but not female offspring displayed these behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have been reported in other studies that used pre- or perinatal nicotine exposure. Therefore, we suggest that preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure could be useful tools for modeling ADHD and related disorders.

256,Changes in the vibration sensitivity and pressure pain thresholds in patients with burning mouth syndrome,"Objective: To investigate the presence of changes in vibration detection and pressure pain threshold in patients with burning-mouth syndrome (BMS). Design of the study: Case-control study. The sample was composed of 30 volunteers, 15 with BMS and 15 in the control group. The pressure-pain threshold (PPT) and vibration-detection threshold (VDT) were examined. The clinical evaluation was complemented with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI, respectively). Results: BMS subjects showed a statistically significant higher PPT in the tongue (p = 0.002), right (p = 0.001) and left (p = 0.004) face, and a significant reduction of the VDT in the tongue (p = 0.013) and right face (p = 0.030). Significant differences were also found when comparing the PPT and the VDT of distinct anatomical areas. However, a significant interaction (group × location) was only for the PPT. BMS subjects also showed significantly higher levels of depression (p = 0.01), as measured by the BDI, compared to controls; and a significant inverse correlation between the VDT in the left face and anxiety levels was detected. Conclusions: The study of somatosensory changes in BMS and its correlations with the clinical features as well as the levels of anxiety and depression expands current understanding of the neuropathic origin and the possible contribution of psychogenic factors related to this disease.

257,Variables associated with sleep quality in chronic tension-type headache: A cross-sectional and longitudinal design,"Objective: To investigate variables associated at baseline (cross-sectional design) and at one year (longitudinal design) with the quality of sleep in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Methods: One hundred and eighty (n = 180) and 135 individuals with CTTH participated in the cross-sectional and longitudinal design respectively. Clinical features were collected with a 4-weeks headache diary at baseline and one-year follow-up. Sleep quality was assessed at baseline and 1-year follow-up with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-HADS), burden of headache (Headache Disability Inventory-HDI), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) at trigeminal, extra-trigeminal and widespread area were assessed at baseline. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between variables at baseline and 1-year follow-up with sleep quality. Results: At baseline positive correlations between sleep quality and headache intensity, headache frequency, headache duration, emotional and physical burden of headache and depression were observed. The regression analyses found that depression and emotional burden of headache explained 27.5% of the variance in sleep quality at baseline (r² = .262; F = 23.72 P &lt; .001). At one-year, sleep quality was significantly associated with baseline burden of headache, depression, widespread PPTs, vitality and mental health domains. Regression analyses revealed that vitality, PPT over the second metacarpal and PPT over the neck explained 30.0% of the variance of sleep quality at one-year (r² = .269, F = 9.71, P &lt; .001). Conclusions: It seems that sleep quality exhibits a complex interaction in individuals with CTTH since depression and the emotional burden were associated with sleep quality at baseline, but vitality and PPTs over extra-trigeminal areas were associated with the quality of sleep at one-year.

258,Early development of attention to threat-related facial expressions,"Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this ""fear bias"" in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants ( N = 269) and 36-month-old children ( N = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers' self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.

259,The efficacy of Life Review Therapy combined with Memory Specificity Training (LRT-MST) targeting cancer patients in palliative care: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care. Methods: In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient's life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (posttreatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2. Results: The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (p = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death. Conclusions: LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.

260,The provision of written information and its effect on levels of pain and anxiety during electrodiagnostic studies: A randomised controlled trial,"Objective: The provision of written information is a low-cost and readily available intervention that has been found to reduce pain and anxiety in a variety of clinical settings. The current study was undertaken to determine if information provision may improve patients' experience during conventional electrodiagnostic studies. Methods: 128 participants were recruited from a tertiary teaching hospital who were referred for electrodiagnostic studies. They were randomized into 2 groups where the intervention group was provided with written information about the electrodiagnostic testing. Patients were invited to complete a questionnaire that included pain and anxiety using a visual analogue scale (VAS) following the testing. All participants underwent nerve conduction studies (NCS) whilst a subset also underwent subsequent needle electromyography (EMG). Results: Those who received information had a statistically significant lower perception of anxiety during NCS, whilst only females who received information had a statistically significant lower perception of pain to both NCS and EMG. Conclusions: The provision of written information can reduce the degree of pain and anxiety experienced during electrodiagnostic testing. Significance: Improving patient comfort and tolerability during electrodiagnostic testing may have practical implications towards more reliable and accurate results obtained from such investigations that may in turn improve patient diagnosis and management.

In the original article, the third author's name was spelled incorrectly. The correct name is: Karimollah Hajian-Tilaki. There is also an error in reference 30. The correct reference is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-16341-001). Healthy behaviors in pregnant women have a major effect on pregnancy outcomes; however, only few studies have explored the relationship of multiple psychosocial factors with healthy lifestyles during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the five psychosocial factors of anxiety, stress, depression, marital dissatisfaction, and social support are associated with six domains of healthy lifestyles in pregnant women, including nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, stress management, interpersonal relationships, and self-actualization. In this cross-sectional study, 445 pregnant women from the obstetrics clinics of the teaching hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences were included. The subjects answered six questionnaires, including the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile, Beck Depression Inventory, Prenatal Distress Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Social Support Questionnaire, and Marital Satisfaction Scale. We developed a series of simple linear regression models based on each subscale of lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, stress management, interpersonal relationships, and self-actualization) as the dependent variables and the five psychological variables (anxiety, stress, depression, marital dissatisfaction, and social support) as the independent variables. State and trait anxieties were the strongest negative predictors of all aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, depression was negatively associated with all of the six subscales of a healthy lifestyle. Pregnancy-specific stress was the only negative predictor of stress management and self-actualization. Marital dissatisfaction was negatively associated with nutrition, stress management, health responsibility, and self-actualization. Social support had negative and positive associations with healthy behaviors. The study suggests that more attention should be paid to identifying the psychological risk factors in pregnancy in addition to providing suitable interventions for improving the lifestyle of pregnant women.

262,Effects of &lt;i&gt;Anma&lt;/i&gt; therapy (Japanese massage) on health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial,"Objectives: Anma therapy (Japanese massage therapy, AMT) significantly reduces the severity of physical complaints in survivors of gynecologic cancer. However, whether this reduction of severity is accompanied by improvement in health-related quality of life is unknown. Methods: Forty survivors of gynecologic cancer were randomly allocated to either an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8 weeks or a no-AMT group. We prospectively measured quality of life by using the Japanese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at 8-week follow-up. The QLQ-C30 response rate was 100%. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Measure of Adjustment to Cancer were also prespecified and prospectively evaluated. Results: The QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life showed significant improvement at 8 weeks ( P = 0.042) in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group, and the estimated mean difference reached a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (10.4 points, 95% CI = 1.2 to 19.6). Scores on fatigue and insomnia showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group ( P = 0.047 and 0.003, respectively). There were no significant between-group improvements in HADS anxiety and depression scales; however, POMS-assessed anger-hostility showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group ( p = 0.028). Conclusions: AMT improved health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors. AMT can be of potential benefit for applications in oncology.

263,Recognition of early stage thigmotaxis in Morris water maze test with convolutional neural network,"The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents' spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.

264,When approximate number acuity predicts math performance: The moderating role of math anxiety,"Separate lines of research suggest that people who are better at estimating numerical quantities using the approximate number system (ANS) have better math performance, and that people with high levels of math anxiety have worse math performance. Only a handful of studies have examined both ANS acuity and math anxiety in the same participants and those studies report contradictory results. To address these inconsistencies, in the current study 87 undergraduate students completed assessments of ANS acuity, math anxiety, and three different measures of math. We considered moderation models to examine the interplay of ANS acuity and math anxiety on different aspects of math performance. Math anxiety and ANS acuity were both unique significant predictors of the ability to automatically recall basic number facts. ANS acuity was also a unique significant predictor of the ability to solve applied math problems, and this relation was further qualified by a significant interaction with math anxiety: the positive association between ANS acuity and applied problem solving was only present in students with high math anxiety. Our findings suggest that ANS acuity and math anxiety are differentially related to various aspects of math and should be considered together when examining their respective influences on math ability. Our findings also raise the possibility that good ANS acuity serves as a protective factor for highly math-anxious students on certain types of math assessments.

265,"Mental distress and perceived wealth, justice and freedom across eight countries: The invisible power of the macrosystem","Health and well-being have been related to macro-level factors such as income, income inequality or socioeconomic status. With regard to the increasing burden of disease due to mental disorders worldwide, the association between the macrosystem and mental distress should be further explored, too. In this context, the subjective evaluation of the macrosystem might play an important role. In the present exploratory study, we assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress as well as perceived wealth, justice and freedom in population- based surveys in Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (n ≈ 1000 per country). The Swedish sample presented the lowest symptom ratings of depression, anxiety and stress and the highest self-rated health. The results also indicated that the subjective evaluation of the macrosystem matters in respect to mental distress. The complete model, including the control variables country, gender, age and education, and perceived wealth, justice and freedom predicted depression, anxiety and stress symptoms explained 8% of the variance of each symptom cluster. The present results encourage research to consider the macrosystem, and the subjective evaluation of macro-level factors, as a relevant component in biopsychosocial models of mental distress.

266,Measuring a new facet of post traumatic growth: Development of a scale of physical post traumatic growth in men with prostate cancer,"Purpose: This study developed a measure of physical post traumatic growth (physical post traumatic growth inventory; P-PTGI) in men with prostate cancer. Methods: A pool of items was created from themes identified in a qualitative study. A quantitative study was then conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the P-PTGI in a sample of 693 prostate cancer survivors. Results: Tests of dimensionality revealed that the 20-item P-PTGI contained two factors: Health Autonomy and Health Awareness. Results demonstrated that scale score reliability for the P-PTGI and its subscales was excellent. In support of the scale's convergent validity, scores on the P-PTGI correlated positively with mindfulness and quality of life, and correlated negatively with depression and anxiety. A statistically significant correlation between the P-PTGI and another robust indicator of post traumatic growth attests to its concurrent validity. Conclusions: While further investigation of the P-PTGI's psychometric properties is required, preliminary findings are promising.

267,Less screen time and more frequent vigorous physical activity is associated with lower risk of reporting negative mental health symptoms among Icelandic adolescents,"Objective: Few studies have explored the potential interrelated associations of screen time and physical activity with mental health in youth, particularly using objective methods. We examined cross-sectional associations of these variables among Icelandic adolescents, using objective and subjective measurements of physical activity. Methods: Data were collected in the spring of 2015 from 315 tenth grade students (mean age 15.8 years) in six elementary schools in metropolitan Reykjavik, Iceland. Participants reported, via questionnaire, on demographics, weekly frequency of vigorous physical activity, daily hours of screen time and mental health status (symptoms of depression, anxiety and somatic complaints, self-esteem and life satisfaction). Total physical activity was measured over one week with wrist-worn accelerometers. Body composition was determined by DXA-scanning. Poisson regression analysis was used to explore independent and interactive associations of screen time and physical activity with mental health variables, adjusting for gender, body fat percentage and maternal education. Results: Less screen time (below the group median of 5.3 h/day) and more frequent vigorous physical activity (≥ 4x/week) were each associated with reporting fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and life dissatisfaction. No significant associations were observed between objectively measured physical activity and mental health outcomes. Interactive regression analysis showed that the group reporting both less screen time and more frequent vigorous physical activity had the lowest risk of reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and life dissatisfaction. Conclusions: Reports of less screen time and more frequent vigorous physical activity were associated with lower risk of reporting mental health problems among Icelandic adolescents. Those who reported a combination of engaging in less screen time and more frequent vigorous physical activity had the lowest risk, suggesting a synergistic relationship between the two behaviors on mental health outcomes. Our results support guiding youth towards more active and less sedentary/screen-based lifestyle.

268,"Type D personality, stress, coping and performance on a novel sport task","We investigated (1) the relationship between Type D personality, stress intensity appraisal of a self-selected stressor, coping, and perceived coping effectiveness and (2) the relationship between Type D personality and performance. In study one, 482 athletes completed the Type D personality questionnaire (DS14), stress thermometer and MCOPE in relation to a recently experienced sport stressor. Type D was associated with increased levels of perceived stress and selection of coping strategies (more emotion and avoidance coping) as well as perceptions of their effectiveness. In study two, 32 participants completed a rugby league circuit task and were assessed on pre-performance anxiety, post-performance affect and coping. Type D was associated with poorer performance (reduced distance; more errors), decreases in pre-performance self-confidence and more use of maladaptive resignation/ withdrawal coping. Findings suggest that Type D is associated with maladaptive coping and reduced performance. Type D individuals would benefit from interventions related to mood modification or enhancing interpersonal functioning.

269,Executive function impairments in fibromyalgia syndrome: Relevance of clinical variables and body mass index,"Background: Several investigations suggest the presence of deterioration of executive function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The study quantified executive functions in patients with FMS. A wide array of functions was assessed, including updating, shifting and inhibition, as well as decision making and mental planning. Moreover, clinical variables were investigated as possible mediators of executive dysfunction, including pain severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and body mass index (BMI). Methods: Fifty-two FMS patients and 32 healthy controls completed a battery of 14 neuropsychological tests. Clinical interviews were conducted and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale and Oviedo Quality of Sleep Questionnaire were presented. Results: Patients performed poorer than controls on the Letter Number Sequencing, Arithmetic and Similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, an N-back task, a verbal fluency task, the Ruff Figural Fluency Test, the Inhibition score of the Stroop Test, the Inhibition and Shifting scores of the Five Digits Test, the Key Search Test and the Zoo Map Task. Moreover, patients exhibited less steep learning curves on the Iowa Gambling Task. Among clinical variables, BMI and pain severity explained the largest proportion of performance variance. Conclusions: This study demonstrated impairments in executive functions of updating, shifting inhibition, decision making and planning in FMS. While the mediating role of pain in cognitive impairments in FMS had been previously established, the influence of BMI is a novel finding. Overweight and obesity should be considered by FMS researchers, and in the treatment of the condition.

270,Wearable sensors detect childhood internalizing disorders during mood induction task,"There is a significant need to develop objective measures for identifying children under the age of 8 who have anxiety and depression. If left untreated, early internalizing symptoms can lead to adolescent and adult internalizing disorders as well as comorbidity which can yield significant health problems later in life including increased risk for suicide. To this end, we propose the use of an instrumented fear induction task for identifying children with internalizing disorders, and demonstrate its efficacy in a sample of 63 children between the ages of 3 and 7. In so doing, we extract objective measures that capture the full six degree-of-freedom movement of a child using data from a belt-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) and relate them to behavioral fear codes, parent-reported child symptoms and clinician-rated child internalizing diagnoses. We find that IMU motion data, but not behavioral codes, are associated with parent-reported child symptoms and clinician-reported child internalizing diagnosis in this sample. These results demonstrate that IMU motion data are sensitive to behaviors indicative of child psychopathology. Moreover, the proposed IMU-based approach has increased feasibility of collection and processing compared to behavioral codes, and therefore should be explored further in future studies.

271,Quantitative analyses of factors related to anxiety and depression in patients with retinitis pigmentosa,"The purpose of this study is to determine the factors related to anxiety and depression in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The status of anxiety and depression was determined in RP patients with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire which consisted of subscales for HADS-anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-depression (HADS-D). The vision-specific quality of life (VSQOL) was assessed with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ25). The correlations between the HADS-A or HADS-D scores and vision-related clinical parameters such as the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Functional Acuity Score, Functional Field Score, Functional Vision Score, the NEI-VFQ25 subscale score were determined. The socioeconomic status, such as the work status and membership in the RP society, was investigated to determine the factors related to the HADSA and HADS-D scores. One hundred and twelve RP patients (46 men and 66 women) with mean age of 60.7 ± 15.4 (standard deviation) years were studied. The HADS-A score was not significantly correlated with any visual functions but was significantly correlated with the general health condition (r = -0.34, P &lt; 0.001) and the role limitation (r = -0.20, P = 0.03) of the NEIVFQ25 subscale. The HADS-D score was significantly correlated with all the visual functions (r = -0.38 to 0.29, P &lt; 0.001), the NEI-VFQ25 subscale score (r = -0.58 to -0.33, P &lt; 0.001) by Spearman's correlations. The HADS-A score was significantly higher in the members of the RP society than in non-members ( P = 0.013). The mean HADS-D score of employed individuals was significantly lower than that of unemployed ones ( P = 0.001) by the Mann-Whitney U test. The results indicate that visual function impairments and vision-related quality of life are associated with a depressive state, and the general health condition is related to anxiety in RP patients. Being employed may be strongly correlated with the degree of depression in RP patients.

272,The impact of affect labelling on responses to aversive flying-cues,"Individuals with flying phobia experience increases in subjective anxiety in response to flying-related cues. However, the cognitive processes that contribute to cue-reactive anxiety in individuals with flying-related anxiety remain poorly understood. Preliminary research suggests that changes in visual imagery and volitional control may contribute to this cue-reactive anxiety. Engaging in affect labelling during exposure therapy has been shown to reduce cue-reactive anxiety in individuals with fears relating to a variety of stimuli but has not been investigated in the fear of flying. The present study recruited 110 participants with a range of flying-related anxiety scores to complete an online cue-reactivity experiment. The study sought to evaluate whether an aversive flying cue triggered changes in imagery, volitional control and anxiety, and whether changes in imagery and volitional control predicted level of cue-reactive anxiety. Participants were randomly allocated to an affect labelling or non-affect labelling condition to additionally assess whether engaging in labelling one's emotion following exposure to an aversive flying cue would attenuate cue-reactive changes in anxiety relative to a group who did not. Significant cue-reactive changes in anxiety, and volitional control were observed from neutral to aversive flying cue were observed. After accounting for the effects of flying anxiety severity, only volitional control significantly improved the prediction of cue-reactive anxiety. Participants in the affect labelling condition reported significantly smaller increases in anxiety than the non-affect labelling group following exposure to the aversive flight cue. This is the first study to indicate affect labelling may help to regulate aspects of cue-reactive anxiety in response to aversive flying stimuli.

273,Comparison of mental health screening tools for detecting antenatal depression and anxiety disorders in South African women,"Background: Antenatal depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. Screening of pregnant women in primary care antenatal settings provides an opportunity for entry to care, but data are needed on the performance of different screening tools. We compared five widely-used questionnaires in a sample of pregnant women in urban South Africa. Method: Pregnant women attending a primary care antenatal clinic were administered five tools by trained research assistants: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) and a shortened 6-item version (K6), the Whooley questions and the two-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Following this, a registered mental health counsellor administered the MINI Plus, a structured clinical diagnostic interview. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) from Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis was used to summarise screening test performance and Cronbach's α used to assess internal consistency. Results: Of 376 participants, 32% were diagnosed with either MDE and/or anxiety disorders. All five questionnaires demonstrated moderate to high performance (AUC = 0.78−0.85). The EPDS was the best performing instrument for detecting MDE and the K10 and K6 for anxiety disorder. For MDE and/or anxiety disorders, the EPDS had the highest AUC (0.83). Of the short instruments, the K10 (AUC = 0.85) and the K6 (AUC = 0.85) performed the best, with the K6 showing good balance between sensitivity (74%) and specificity (85%) and a good positive predictive value (70%). The Whooley questions (AUC = 0.81) were the best performing ultra-short instrument. Internal consistency ranged from good to acceptable (α = 0.89−0.71). However, the PPV of the questionnaires compared with the diagnostic interview, ranged from 54% to 71% at the optimal cut-off scores. Conclusions: Universal screening for case identification of antenatal depression and anxiety disorders in low-resource settings can be conducted with a number of commonly used screening instruments. Short and ultra-short screening instruments such as the K6 and the Whooley questions may be feasible and acceptable for use in these settings.

274,Association between particulate air pollution exposure during pregnancy and postpartum maternal psychological functioning,"Postpartum psychological functioning impacts both women's health and outcomes in children. Lower income, ethnic minority women may be at particular risk for adverse postpartum mental health outcomes. Studies link ambient air pollution exposure with psychological dysfunction in adults although this association has not been examined among postpartum women. Methods: We studied associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter with diameter 2.5 ìm (PM 2.5 ) and postpartum psychological functioning in a lower income, ethnically mixed sample of urban US women enrolled in a pregnancy cohort study. Analyses included 557 mothers who delivered at ≥ 37 weeks gestation. Daily estimates of residential PM 2.5 over gestation were derived using a satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved model. Outcomes included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score from 6 or 12 months postpartum and subscale scores for anhedonia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Associations were also examined within racial/ethnic groups. Distributed lag models (DLMs) were implemented to identify windows of vulnerability during pregnancy. Results: Most mothers had less than a high school education (64%) and were primarily Hispanic (55%) and Black (29%). In the overall sample, a DLM adjusted for age, race, education, prenatal smoking, and season of delivery, we found significant associations between higher PM 2.5 exposure in the second trimester and increased anhedonia subscale scores postpartum. In race stratified analyses, mid-pregnancy PM 2.5 exposure was significantly associated with increased total EPDS scores as well as higher anhedonia and depressive symptom subscale scores among Black women. Conclusions: Increased PM 2.5 exposure in mid-pregnancy was associated with increased depressive and anhedonia symptoms, particularly in Black women.

275,Dietary cyanogen exposure and early child neurodevelopment: An observational study from the Democratic Republic of Congo,"Background: Dietary cyanogen exposure from ingesting bitter (toxic) cassava as a main source of food in sub-Saharan Africa is related to neurological impairments in sub-Saharan Africa. We explored possible association with early child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional neurodevelopmental assessment of 12-48 month-old children using the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Gensini Gavito Scale (GGS). We used the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10 (HSCL-10) and Goldberg Depression Anxiety Scale (GDAS) to screen for symptoms of maternal depression-anxiety. We used the cyanogen content in household cassava flour and urinary thiocyanate (SCN) as biomarkers of dietary cyanogen exposure. We employed multivariable generalized linear models (GLM) with Gamma link function to determine predictors of early child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Results: The mean ( SD ) and median (IQR) of cyanogen content of cassava household flour were above the WHO cut-off points of 10 ppm (52.18 [32 79]) and 50 (30-50) ppm, respectively. Mean ( SD ) urinary levels of thiocyanate and median (IQR) were respectively 817 81 (474 59) and 688 (344-1032) μmole/l in mothers, and 617 49 (449 48) and 688 (344-688) μmole/l in children reflecting individual high levels as well as a community-wide cyanogenic exposure. The concentration of cyanide in cassava flour was significantly associated with early child neurodevelopment, motor development and cognitive ability as indicated by univariable linear regression ( p &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for biological and socioeconomic predictors at multivariable analyses, fine motor proficiency and child neurodevelopment remained the main predictors associated with the concentration of cyanide in cassava flour: coefficients of -0 08 to -.15 ( p &lt; 0 01). We also found a significant association between child linear growth, early child neurodevelopment, cognitive ability and motor development at both univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses coefficients of 1.44 to 7.31 ( p &lt; 0 01). Conclusion: Dietary cyanogen exposure is associated with early child neurodevelopment, cognitive abilities and motor development, even in the absence of clinically evident paralysis. There is a need for community-wide interventions for better cassava processing practices for detoxification, improved nutrition, and neuro-rehabilitation, all of which are essential for optimal development in exposed children.

276,Correlation between physical markers and psychiatric health in a Portuguese systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: The role of suffering in chronic autoimmune disease,"Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators. Methods: Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS &amp; FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 &amp; PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS &amp; CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values. Results: The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder's fatigue scale (p &lt; 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p &lt; 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort. Conclusion: These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort. Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus.

In the original article, the funding section is incorrect. The correct funding information is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-15445-001). Resilience is a multi-dimensional construct associated with health and well-being. At present, we do not yet have a valid, scientific instrument that is designed to evaluate adult resilience in Spanish-speaking countries and that accounts for family, social and individual components. This study aimed at investigating the construct and cross-cultural validity of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) by combining Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Hierarchical Regression models in a Hispanic Latin- American group. A community sample of 805 adults answered the RSA, Spanish Language Stressful Life-Events checklist (SL-SLE), and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL- 25). First-order CFA verified the six factors structure for the RSA (RMSEA = .037, SRMR = .047, CFI = .91, TLI = .90). Five RSA scales and total score have good internal consistency (scales α &gt; .70; total score α = .90). Two second-order CFA verified the intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions of the protector factors of resilience, as well as their commonality and uniqueness with affective symptoms (anxiety and depression). An exploratory MDS reproduced the relations of RSA items and factors at first and second-order levels against random simulated data, thereby providing initial evidence of its cross-cultural validity in a Spanish-speaking group. The Four-steps hierarchical model showed that the RSA scales are the strongest predictors of anxiety and depression±greater than gender, age, education and stressful life-events. Three RSA scales are significant unique predictors of affective symptoms. In addition, similar to findings in diverse cultural settings, resilience is positively associated with age but not with education. Women report higher scores of Social Resources and Social Competence and lower scores of Perception of the Self. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the construct and criterion-related validity of the RSA in broad, diverse and Spanish speaking sample.

Along with this increase, psychological outcomes have become prominent. The objective was to evaluate prospectively the prognostic effects of sociodemographic, medical, and psychological variables assessed before day-case surgery on psychological outcomes after surgery. Methods: The study was carried out between October 2010 and September 2011. We analyzed 398 mixed patients, from a randomized controlled trial, undergoing day-case surgery at a university medical center. Structural equation modeling was used to jointly study presurgical prognostic variables relating to sociodemographics (age, sex, nationality, marital status, having children, religion, educational level, employment), medical status (BMI, heart rate), and psychological status associated with anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A)), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)), aggression (State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS)), depressive moods (HADS-D), self-esteem, and self-efficacy. We studied psychological outcomes on day 7 after surgery, including anxiety, fatigue, depressive moods, and aggression regulation. Results: The final prognostic model comprised the following variables: anxiety (STAI, HADS-A), fatigue (MFI), depression (HADS-D), aggression (STAS), self-efficacy, sex, and having children. The corresponding psychological variables as assessed at baseline were prominent (i.e. standardized regression coefficients ≥ 0.20), with STAI-Trait score being the strongest predictor overall. STAI-State (adjusted R² = 0.44), STAI-Trait (0.66), HADS-A (0.45) and STAS-Trait (0.54) were best predicted. Conclusion: We provide a prognostic model that adequately predicts multiple postoperative outcomes in day-case surgery. Consequently, this enables timely identification of vulnerable patients who may require additional medical or psychological preventive treatment or−in a worst-case scenario−could be unselected for day-case surgery.

279,The Trier Social Stress Test and the Trier Social Stress Test for groups: Qualitative investigations,"The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its version for groups (TSST-G) are the gold standard for inducing acute psychosocial stress in human experimental settings and have been used in numerous studies since the early 1990s. The TSST and the TSST-G lead to effects on different physiological and psychological markers, such as salivary cortisol, anxiety, and emotional states. These effects were assessed with quantitative methods comparing pretest and post-test measures with statistical analyses. But to date, no qualitative analyses have been conducted to examine the meaningful experience of participants during the TSST and the TSST-G. This study is the first to conduct qualitative investigations to further clarify the stressful experience of participants confronted with these procedures. Preliminary results showed as expected that the TSST and the TSST-G effectively induced psychosocial stress, with cortisol levels, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and arousal increases, and with pleasure and dominance decreases. At the qualitative level, the results evidenced that the two theoretically stressful components of the TSST and the TSST-G, namely social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, were experienced as stress-inducing by the participants. Two case studies confirmed these findings. But the results also showed on one hand that psychosocial stress is a dynamic phenomenon, with important fluctuations throughout the tasks (mainly for the TSST-G); and on the other hand that despite the similar physiological and psychological responses between the TSST and the TSST-G evidenced by the literature, the experience of the participants was both similar and specific. Use of a qualitative method allowed us to provide a complementary point of view to understand the meaningful experience of participants during these stressful procedures, apprehending the dynamic of the subjective stress experience without disrupting it.

280,Impact of an animal-assisted therapy programme on physiological and psychosocial variables of paediatric oncology patients,"The objective of this study was to propose an intervention and safety protocol for performing animal-assisted therapy (AAT) and evaluating its efficacy in children under outpatient oncological treatment based on psychological, physiological, and quality of life indicators for the children and caregivers. The sample consisted of 24 children diagnosed with leukaemia and solid tumours (58% girls with a mean age of 8.0 years) who underwent an AAT programme consisting of three 30-min sessions in an open group. Two dogs (one Labrador retriever and one golden retriever) were used, and activities such as sensory stimulation, gait training, and socialization were conducted. The exclusion criteria were severe mental problems, inability to answer the questions included in the instruments used, allergy to animals, unavailability/lack of interest, isolation precaution, surgical wound, use of invasive devices, ostomy, no current blood count for evaluation, neutropaenia, infection, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory symptoms at the beginning of the intervention or 1 week before the intervention, hospitalization or scheduled surgery, and non-completion of the AAT programme. The variables analysed using validated self or other evaluations were stress, pain, mood, anxiety, depression, quality of life, heart rate, and blood pressure. A quasi-experimental study design was used. We observed a decrease in pain (p = 0.046, d = ± 0.894), irritation (p = 0.041, d = ± 0.917), and stress (p = 0.005; d = ± 1.404) and a tendency towards improvement of depressive symptoms (p = 0.069; d = ± 0.801). Among the caregivers, an improvement was observed in anxiety (p = 0.007, d = ±1.312), mental confusion (p = 0.006, d = ± 1.350), and tension (p = 0.006, d = ±1.361). Therefore, the selection criteria and care protocols used for the AAT programme in the oncological context were adequate, and the programme was effective.

281,Trajectories and predictors of women's health-related quality of life during pregnancy: A large longitudinal cohort study,"The objective of this study was to identify distinct trajectories and their predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of women during pregnancy in a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 3936 Dutch pregnant women in Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Information on potential predictors was collected in early pregnancy by questionnaire. Latent Class Mixture Modelling and Multinomial Logistic Regression were applied to assess the trajectory and predictors of HRQOL during pregnancy. HRQOL was measured by SF-12 in early, mid- and late pregnancy; physical and mental component summary (PCS-12/MCS- 12) scores were calculated. Four physical HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (`healthy') in 63.3%, consistently low (`vulnerable') in 10.8%; a small increase (`recovering') in 12.8% and a large decrease (`at risk') in 13.1%. Three mental HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (`healthy') in 86.1%; a large increase (`recovering') in 7.5%; and a large decrease (`at risk') in 6.4%. Compared with healthy trajectories, the likelihood of following the `vulnerable' physical HRQOL trajectory rather than a healthy trajectory was increased by daily fatigue(OR: 4.82[2.76, 8.40]), pelvic pain (OR:4.76[2.91, 7.78]) and back pain (OR:5.29[3.21, 8.70]); pregnancy-specific anxiety increased the likelihood of following the `at risk' mental HRQOL trajectory (OR:7.95[4.84, 13.05]). Healthy physical and mental HRQOL trajectories during pregnancy were most common. Predictors indicative of poor HRQOL trajectories included pregnancy-related symptoms and anxiety.

282,Childhood behavioral inhibition is associated with impaired mentalizing in adolescence,"Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12±18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; SD = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others' and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bidirectional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.

283,Autistic traits and social anxiety predict differential performance on social cognitive tasks in typically developing young adults,"The current work examined the unique contribution that autistic traits and social anxiety have on tasks examining attention and emotion processing. In Study 1, 119 typically-developing college students completed a flanker task assessing the control of attention to target faces and away from distracting faces during emotion identification. In Study 2, 208 typically-developing college students performed a visual search task which required identification of whether a series of 8 or 16 emotional faces depicted the same or different emotions. Participants with more self-reported autistic traits performed more slowly on the flanker task in Study 1 than those with fewer autistic traits when stimuli depicted complex emotions. In Study 2, participants higher in social anxiety performed less accurately on trials showing all complex faces; participants with autistic traits showed no differences. These studies suggest that traits related to autism and to social anxiety differentially impact social cognitive processing.

284,The Brazilian version of Skindex-16 is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the health-related quality of life of patients with skin diseases,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of Skindex-16 in patients with various skin diseases. Methods: Dermatologic assessments were performed for the diagnosis and classification of the severity of skin conditions. The clinical feasibility of Skindex-16 was assessed based on the time required to complete the questionnaire and the number of unanswered items. The participants (n = 110) answered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the Skindex-16 (Portuguese/Brazil version) questionnaires. Convergent validity was assessed based on the correlation of the Skindex-16 with the DLQI and HADS subscales. Known-groups validity was assessed based on the comparison of the mild, moderate and severe disease groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reproducibility using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) obtained with 29 participants who answered the Skindex-16 a second time 3 to 10 days after the first assessment. Results: The mean time to answer the questionnaire was 2 min 41 sec. Cronbach's alpha scores were 0.867, 0.930 and 0.888 for the Skindex-16 domains symptoms, emotions and functioning, respectively. The ICCs were 0.947, 0.860 and 0.843 for the Skindex-16 domains symptoms, emotions and functioning, respectively. All three Skindex-16 scales exhibited strong correlations with DLQI. Moderate correlations were found between HADS subscales and the Skindex-16 emotions domain. Known-groups validity showed differences in all three Skindex-16 domains between the mild and moderate skin disease groups (emotions: p &lt; 0.001; symptoms: p = 0.049; functioning: p &lt; 0.001) and between the mild and severe skin disease groups (emotions: p = 0.002; symptoms: p = 0.001; functioning: p = 0.002). Conclusion: The Portuguese/Brazil version of Skindex-16 is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the quality of life of patients with skin diseases.

285,"Pain catastrophizing, neuroticism, fear of pain, and anxiety: Defining the genetic and environmental factors in a sample of female twins","The objective of the present study was to establish the heritability of pain catastrophizing and its subdomains of helplessness, magnification, and rumination and to further explore the genetic and environmental sources that may contribute to pain catastrophizing as well as to its commonly reported psycho-affective correlates, including neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of pain. N = 2,401 female twin individuals from the TwinsUK registry were subject to univariate and multivariate twin analyses. Well validated questionnaires including the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale, the Ten Item Personality Index, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index were used to assess the study variables. Moderate estimates of heritability for pain catastrophizing (36%) and the three subdomains of helplessness (35%), rumination (27%), and magnification (36%) were detected. The high correlations observed between the three subdomains were explained mainly by overlapping genetic factors, with a single factor loading on all three phenotypes. High genetic correlations between pain catastrophizing and its psycho-affective correlates of fear of pain and anxiety sensitivity were found, while the genetic overlap between neuroticism and pain catastrophizing was low. Each measure of negative affect demonstrated relatively distinct environmental contributing factors, with very little overlap. This is the first study to show shared genetic factors in the observed association between pain catastrophizing and other measures of negative affect. Our findings provide deeper insight into the aetiology of pain catastrophizing and confirm that it is at least partially distinct from other measures of negative affect and personality that may influence the development and treatment of chronic pain conditions. Further research in males is warranted to check the comparability of the findings.

286,Hormonal contraception increases the risk of psychotropic drug use in adolescent girls but not in adults: A pharmacoepidemiological study on 800 000 Swedish women,"The burden of depression and anxiety disorders is greater in women, and female sex hormones have been shown to affect mood. Psychological side effects of hormonal contraception (HC) are also a common complaint in the clinic, but few previous studies have investigated this subject. We therefore wanted to investigate whether use of HC was associated with adverse psychological health outcomes, and whether this association was modified by age. All women aged 12-30 years on 31 December 2010, residing in Sweden for at least four years and with no previous psychiatric morbidity (n = 815 662), were included. We followed the women from their first HC use (or 31 December 2010, if they were non-users) at baseline, until a prescription fill of psychotropic drugs or the end of the one-year follow-up. We performed age-stratified logistic regression models and estimated odds ratios (OR) to measure the association between different HC methods and psychotropic drug use, as well as the area under the receiver operating curve to estimate discriminatory accuracy of HC in relation to psychotropic drugs. Overall, we found an association between HC and psychotropic drugs (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30−1.37). In the age-stratified analysis, the strongest association was found in adolescent girls (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 3.04−4.94 for age 12 to 14 years), while it was non-existent for adult women. We conclude that hormonal contraception is associated with psychotropic drug use among adolescent girls, suggesting an adverse effect of HC on psychological health in this population.

287,Efficacy and tolerability of short-term duloxetine treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder: A meta-analysis,"Objective: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine during short-term treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing duloxetine or duloxetine plus other antipsychotics with placebo for the treatment of GAD in adults. Outcome measures were (1) efficacy, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) anxiety subscale score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HAM-A) psychic and somatic anxiety factor scores, and response and remission rates based on total scores of HAM-A; (2) tolerability, assessed by discontinuation rate due to adverse events, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events(TEAEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs). Review Manager 5.3 and Stata Version 12.0 software were used for all statistical analyses. Results: The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs. Mean changes in the HADS anxiety subscale score [mean difference(MD) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.77−2.88, P &lt; 0.00001] and HAMA psychic anxiety factor score were significantly greater in patients with GAD that received duloxetine compared to those that received placebo (MD = 2.15, 95%CI 1.61−2.68, P &lt; 0.00001). However, there was no difference in mean change in the HAM-A somatic anxiety factor score (MD = 1.13, 95%CI 0.67−1.58, P &lt; 0.00001). Discontinuation rate due to AEs in the duloxetine group was significantly higher than the placebo group [odds ratio(OR) = 2.62, 95%CI 1.35−5.06, P = 0.004]. The incidence of any TEAE was significantly increased in patients that received duloxetine (OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.36−2.28, P &lt; 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.52−2.47, P = 0.75). Conclusion: Duloxetine resulted in a greater improvement in symptoms of psychic anxiety and similar changes in symptoms of somatic anxiety compared to placebo during short-term treatment in adults with GAD and its tolerability was acceptable.

After the publication of the original article, concerns were raised about the validity of the study design and conclusions reported. Following a post-publication assessment involving staff editors and members of the Editorial Board, the PLOS ONE Editors decided to retract this article due to methodological concerns that call into question the validity of the study and its conclusions which the peer review process did not adequately address. The concerns include: (1) no control group for the study; (2) participants were not blind to the treatment and were selected from a population for which placebo effects are anticipated. Furthermore, outcome data consist of self-reported measures including weight and symptoms; (3) The authors did not report on potential confounding variables such as medication or dietary supplement use by participants before or during the study; (4) The prebiotic and probiotic components of the diet are not reported in sufficient detail to enable reproducibility; (5) The authors did not report a power calculation to support the sample size and demonstrate it as adequate to assess the anticipated effects. Further concerns were raised about the statistical analysis methods and reporting, and reference to the intervention as a “microbiome restoration diet is not supported, and the authors did not assess the microbiome composition. In light of the concerns about the study design and methods used, the PLOS ONE Editors consider that the conclusions of this study are not supported by the data presented and retract this article. KL and JH do not agree with the retraction and stand by the article's conclusion. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-38616-001). Manipulating gut bacteria in the microbiome, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, has been found to have an influence on both physical and emotional wellbeing. This study uses a dietary manipulation ‘The Gut Makeover’ designed to elicit positive changes to the gut bacteria within the microbiome, 21 healthy participants undertook `The Gut Makeover' for a four week period. Weight and various aspects of health were assessed pre and post intervention using the Functional Medicine Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ). Paired sample t-tests revealed a significant reduction in self-reported weight at the end of the intervention. Adverse medical symptoms related to digestion, cognition and physical and emotional wellbeing, were also significantly reduced during the course of the dietary intervention. The intervention, designed to manipulate gut bacteria, had a significant impact on digestion, reducing IBS type symptoms in this non-clinical population. There was also a striking reduction in negative symptoms related to cognition, memory and emotional wellbeing, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Dietary gut microbiome manipulations may have the power to exert positive physical and psychological health benefits, of a similar nature to those reported in studies using pre and probiotics. The small sample size and lack of control over confounding variables means that it will be important to replicate these findings in larger-scale controlled, prospective, clinical trials. This dietary microbiome intervention has the potential to improve physical and emotional wellbeing in the general population but also to be investigated as a treatment option for individuals with conditions as diverse as IBS, anxiety, depression and Alzheimer's disease.

289,Prospective mental imagery as its link with anxiety and depression in prisoners,"Mental imagery is known to play a key role in the development and maintenance of depression and anxiety. Prisoners commonly experience psychological distress, but interventions to address this are currently lacking. We aimed to examine the link between prospective mental imagery and anxiety and depression among prisoners. One hundred twenty-three male prisoners from a Category C prison in southwest England participated in the study. They completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to measure whether they experience depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, they completed additional questionnaires to evaluate their prospective mental imagery. Results showed that 67.5% of prisoners presented with more depression symptoms and 27.7% with more anxiety symptoms. Supporting earlier findings, our data revealed that some dimensions of prospective mental imagery were significantly related with increased anxiety and depression symptoms in prisoners. Namely, intrusive negative personally relevant imagery was a positive predictor and likelihood of positive events a negative predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. The perceived likelihood of negative events was a positive predictor of depression. Intrusive verbal thought was a positive predictor of anxiety. The obtained results suggest the need to develop interventions not only targeting the reduction of prospective negative imagery but also the enhancement of positive mental imagery.

290,A randomized controlled trial of multi-session online interpretation bias modification training: Short- and long-term effects on anxiety and depression in unselected adolescents,"Introduction: Negatively biased interpretations play an important role in anxiety and depression, which are highly prevalent in adolescence, and changing such biases might thus reduce or prevent emotional disorders. We investigated the short- and long-term effects of an online interpretation bias modification training in unselected adolescents to explore its potential in preventing anxiety and depression. Methods: Participants (N = 173) were randomly allocated to eight online sessions of interpretation or placebo training. Interpretation bias was assessed pre- and post-training. Primary outcomes of anxiety and depression, and secondary measures of emotional resilience were assessed pre- and post-training and at three, six, and twelve months follow-up. Results: Compared to placebo, interpretation training marginally increased positive interpretations. Irrespective of training condition, symptoms of anxiety and depression showed a decline post-training and at follow-up, and indices of resilience showed an increase. Change in interpretation bias, baseline interpretation bias, stressful life events, or number of training sessions completed did not moderate the effects on anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Results suggest that interpretation training as implemented in this study has no added value in reducing symptoms or enhancing resilience in unselected adolescents.

291,The utility of the Diabetes Anxiety Depression Scale in Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II,"Background: Previous research using latent class analysis (LCA) identified classes of people with type 2 diabetes and specific profiles of depression and anxiety. Since LCA-derived anxious depression strongly predicts cardiovascular outcomes and mortality but cannot be applied to individuals, we developed a validated combined depression-anxiety metric, the Diabetes Anxiety Depression Scale (DADS), for potential clinical application in people with type 2 diabetes. Methods: 1,337 participants with type 2 diabetes from the observational community-based Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item version (PHQ- 9) to assess symptoms of depression, and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GADS) to assess symptoms of anxiety. A single score was calculated by adding all the PHQ-9 items and the four GADS items used for the LCA. Cut-off scores were calculated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Results: The optimum cut-off scores in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 18 points for major anxious depression and 8 points for minor anxious depression. A score of 8±17 was associated with a significantly increased incidence of coronary heart disease, whereas a score 18±39 was associated with an increase in both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: The DADS has strong psychometric validity in the identification of mixed depression-anxiety in type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk prediction.

Researchers are recommended to use part one of the STARS to assess statistics anxiety and part two to assess attitudes toward statistics.

Following from Weiner's (2010) attribution theory of achievement motivation, the present research examined relationships between causal attributions and emotions concerning academic computing difficulties in two studies. Study samples consisted of North American university students enrolled in both traditional and online universities (total N = 559) who responded to either hypothetical scenarios or experimental manipulations involving technological challenges experienced in academic settings. Findings from Study 1 showed stable and external attributions to be emotionally maladaptive (more helplessness, boredom, guilt), particularly in response to unexpected computing problems. Additionally, Study 2 found stable attributions for unexpected problems to predict more anxiety for traditional students, with both external and personally controllable attributions for minor problems proving emotionally beneficial for students in online degree programs (more hope, less anxiety). Overall, hypothesized negative effects of stable attributions were observed across both studies, with mixed results for personally controllable attributions and unanticipated emotional benefits of external attributions for academic computing problems warranting further study.

294,Sex differences in the association between internalizing symptoms and hair cortisol level among 10-12 year-old adolescents in China,"Although numerous studies have described the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation and internalizing symptoms among adolescents, research using hair cortisol concentrations in pre- and young adolescent samples has not been reported. We investigated the association of self-reported internalizing symptoms with cortisol concertration in hair among pre- and young adolescents aged 10 ± 12 years. Forty-six boys and 39 girls supplied a hair sample of at least 3 cm in length for an analysis of this period (3 months) cortisol excretion. Saliva cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) also was assessed. The study found a positive association between ratings of depressive symptoms and cumulative levels of hair cortisol only in boys. Furthermore, higher ratings of anxiety symptoms were associated with lower hair cortisol concertration and lower saliva cortisol reactivity among girls. This study provides the first evidence for the notion that depressive symptoms in boys are associated with long-term cortisol concertration in hair, whereas anxiety symptoms in girls are associated with HPA-axis hypoactivity, when hair cortisol concentrations and saliva cortisol reactivity to acute stress are assessed concurrently.

295,Attachment anxiety benefits from security priming: Evidence from working memory performance,"The present study investigates the relationship between the attachment dimensions (anxious vs. avoidance) and the cognitive performance of individuals, specifically whether the attachment dimensions would predict the working memory (WM) performance. In the n-back task, reflecting the WM-capacity, both attachment related and non-attachment related words were used. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups that received either the secure or the neutral subliminal priming. In the secure priming condition, the aim was to induce sense of security by presenting secure attachment words prior to the n-back task performance. In neutral priming condition, neutral words that did not elicit sense of security were presented. Structural equation modeling revealed divergent patterns for attachment anxiety and avoidance dimensions under the different priming conditions. In neutral priming condition, WM performance declined in terms of capacity in the n-back task for individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. However in the secure priming condition, WM performance was boosted in the n-back task for individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. In other words, the subliminal priming of the security led to increased WM capacity of individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. This effect, however, was not observed for higher levels of attachment avoidance. Results are discussed along the lines of hyperactivation and deactivation strategies of the attachment system.

296,Changes of attachment characteristics during psychotherapy of patients with social anxiety disorder: Results from the SOPHO-Net trial,"Objectives: Within a randomized controlled trial contrasting the outcome of manualized cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and short term psychodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to a waiting list condition (the SOPHO-Net trial), we set out to test whether self-reported attachment characteristics change during the treatments and if these changes differ between treatments. Research design and methods: 495 patients from the SOPHO-Net trial (54.5% female, mean age 35.2 years) who were randomized to either CBT, PDT or waiting list (WL) completed the partner-related revised Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) before and after treatment and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. ECR-R scores were first compared to a representative healthy sample (n = 2508) in order to demonstrate that the clinical sample differed significantly from the non-clinical sample with respect to attachment anxiety and avoidance. Results: LSAS scores correlated significantly with both ECR-R subscales. Post-therapy, patients treated with CBT revealed significant changes in attachment anxiety and avoidance whereas patients treated with PDT showed no significant changes. Changes between posttreatment and the two follow-ups were significant in both conditions, with minimal (insignificant) differences between treatments at the 12- month follow-up. Conclusions: The current study supports recent reviews of mostly naturalistic studies indicating changes in attachment as a result of psychotherapy. Although there were differences between conditions at the end of treatment, these largely disappeared during the follow-up period which is line with the other results of the SOPHO-NET trial.

297,Anti-TNFα therapy in IBD alters brain activity reflecting visceral sensory function and cognitive-affective biases,"Background: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), immune activation with increased circulating TNF-α is linked to the intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms and depression or anxiety. A central feature of depression is cognitive biases linked to negative attributions about self, the world and the future. We aimed to assess the effects of anti-TNFα therapy on the central processing of self-attribution biases and visceral afferent information in patients with Crohn's disease. Methods: We examined 9 patients with Crohn's disease (age 26.1 ± 10.6. yrs, 5 female, 5 ileocolonic, 2 colonic and 2 ileal disease) during chronic anti-TNFα therapy (5 adalimumab, 4 infliximab). Patients were studied twice in randomized order before and after anti-TNFα administration. On each occasion patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain during a test of implicit attribution biases regarding sickness/health and undertook a standardized nutrient challenge. Results: Following anti-TNFα treatment, ratings of `fullness' following nutrient challenge reduced compared to pre-treatment ratings (p &lt; 0.05). Reaction times revealed improved processing of self-related and positive health words, consistent with improved implicit sense of wellbeing that correlated with improvements in sensory function after treatment (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.05). Treatment-associated improvements in implicit processing were mirrored by alterations of prefrontal, amygdala, posterior cingulate and visual regions. Between patients, the degree of functional amygdala change was additionally explained by individual differences in attention regulation and body awareness rankings. Conclusion: In patients with Crohn's disease, anti-TNFα administration reduces visceral sensitivity and improves implicit cognitive-affective biases linked to alterations in limbic (amygdala) function.

298,Interaction between &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; variability and recent life events in the anxiety spectrum: Evidence for the differential susceptibility model,"Background: Gene-environment interaction (GxE) research has highlighted the importance of investigating the FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) gene as a sensitivity gene. However, previous GxE studies with FKBP5 have not measured the full environmental spectrum or applied statistical tests to discern whether the GxE interaction fits better with the differential-susceptibility or diathesis-stress hypotheses. This study examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on FKBP5 gene moderate the association of positive and negative recent life events (LEs) with depressive symptoms, state-anxiety, neuroticism, and social anxiety traits. Methods: A total of 86 nonclinical young adults were administered psychological measures and were genotyped for five FKBP5 SNPs (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, rs9470080 and rs4713916). Results: Regression analyses indicated significant GxE interactions for social anxiety and neuroticism. The interactions predicting neuroticism fit different models for different SNPs, although the overall effect indicated by the haplotype was consistent with the differential-susceptibility hypothesis: the risk-haplotype group presented higher neuroticism in the presence of more negative LEs and lower neuroticism in the presence of more positive LEs. The GxE interactions for social anxiety were consistent with the diathesis-stress model. The lack of significance in the for-better side for social anxiety might be related to the fact that it mapped onto low extraversion, which is associated with a lower permeability to positive experiences. Discussion: Findings underscore the importance of testing the differential-susceptibility model in relation to FKBP5 to adequately characterize its role in healthy and pathological developmental processes.

299,Attributional style and depressive symptoms in a male prison sample,"The reformulated learned helplessness model proposes that people who tend to make internal, stable, and global attributions in response to uncontrollable aversive events are more likely to develop depression. The present study sought to investigate the nature of the relationship between attributional style and depression in a male prison sample. One hundred and one adult male prisoners from four medium security prisons in Ireland completed the Attributional Style Questionnaire and measures of depression (BDI-II) and anxiety (BAI). Severity of self-reported depressive symptoms in the present sample was comparable to other prison and clinical samples, but higher than community samples. Participants were more severely affected by depressive symptoms than anxiety. The original attributional dimensions (i.e. internal, stable, and global) predicted a significant amount of variance in depression, but the model was not significant after controlling for anxiety. A subsequent regression model, comprising attributional dimensions for both negative events and positive events including a measure of `uncontrollability', accounted for 35% of the variance in depression and the model retained significance while controlling for anxiety. An attributional model of depression may be relevant to the prison population and could provide a valid insight into the development and treatment of depressive symptoms in prisoners. The findings are interpreted in relation to previous research and implications for theory, clinical practice, and rehabilitation are discussed.

300,Anxiety is not enough to drive me away: A latent profile analysis on math anxiety and math motivation,"Mathematics anxiety (MA) and mathematics motivation (MM) are important multi-dimensional non-cognitive factors in mathematics learning. While the negative relation between global MA and MM is well replicated, the relations between specific dimensions of MA and MM are largely unexplored. The present study utilized latent profile analysis to explore profiles of various aspects of MA (including learning MA and exam MA) and MM (including importance, self-perceived ability, and interest), to provide a more holistic understanding of the math-specific emotion and motivation experiences. In a sample of 927 high school students (13-21 years old), we found 8 distinct profiles characterized by various combinations of dimensions of MA and MM, revealing the complexity in the math-specific emotion-motivation relation beyond a single negative correlation. Further, these profiles differed on mathematics learning behaviors and mathematics achievement. For example, the highest achieving students reported modest exam MA and high MM, whereas the most engaged students were characterized by a combination of high exam MA and high MM. These results call for the need to move beyond linear relations among global constructs to address the complexity in the emotion-motivation-cognition interplay in mathematics learning, and highlight the importance of customized intervention for these heterogeneous groups.

301,Population-based validation of a German version of the Brief Resilience Scale,"Smith and colleagues developed the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) to assess the individual ability to recover from stress despite significant adversity. This study aimed to validate the German version of the BRS. We used data from a population-based (sample 1: n = 1.481) and a representative (sample 2: n = 1.128) sample of participants from the German general population (age ≥ 18) to assess reliability and validity. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted to compare one- and two-factorial models from previous studies with a method-factor model which especially accounts for the wording of the items. Reliability was analyzed. Convergent validity was measured by correlating BRS scores with mental health measures, coping, social support, and optimism. Reliability was good (α = .85, ω = .85 for both samples). The method-factor model showed excellent model fit (sample 1: χ2/df = 7.544; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .99; SRMR = .02; sample 2: χ2/df = 1.166; RMSEA = .01; CFI = 1.00; SRMR = .01) which was significantly better than the one-factor model (Δχ²(4) = 172.71, p &lt; .001) or the two-factor model (Δχ²(3) = 31.16, p &lt; .001). The BRS was positively correlated with well-being, social support, optimism, and the coping strategies active coping, positive reframing, acceptance, and humor. It was negatively correlated with somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, depression, and the coping strategies religion, denial, venting, substance use, and self-blame. To conclude, our results provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the German adaptation of the BRS as well as the unidimensional structure of the scale once method effects are accounted for.

302,The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 polymorphisms on neuropsychological performance in bipolar II disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorder,"Anxiety disorders (ADs), the most common comorbid illnesses with bipolar disorder (BP) has been reported to associate with dopamine system. Dopamine, metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), and the distribution of the ALDH2*1/*1, and ALDH2*1/*2+ALDH*2/*2 alleles in the Han Chinese general population is relatively equal. The association between dopamine metabolic enzymes and cognitive performance in patients with bipolar II disorder (BP-II) comorbid with AD is unclear. This study proposed to explore the role of ALDH2 polymorphisms on neuropsychological performance between BP-II comorbid with or without AD. One hundred ninety-seven BP-II patients with and without a comorbid AD were recruited and compared with 130 healthy controls (HCs). A polymerase chain reaction and a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were used to determine genotypes for ALDH2, and study participants underwent neuropsychological tests. An interaction between AD comorbidity and the ALDH2 polymorphisms was found in different domain of cognitive dysfunction in the BP-II patients. The ALDH2 polymorphisms might have different effects on the neuropsychological performance of BP-II patients with and without comorbid AD.

303,Preconception paternal bisphenol A exposure induces sex-specific anxiety and depression behaviors in adult rats,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine-disrupting compound, has drawn a great attention for its adverse effect on behavioral development. Maternal exposure to this compound has been reported to induce anxiety and depression in offspring, but the effect of its paternal exposure is rarely discussed. This study investigated whether preconception paternal BPA exposure can affect the emotions of male rats and their offspring. Eighteen adult male rats (F0) received either a vehicle or 50 μg/kg/day BPA diet for 21 weeks and were then mated with non-exposed females to produce offspring (F1). The affective behaviors of F0 and F1 rats were evaluated in the open-field test, the elevated-plus maze and the forced swimming test, and their serum corticosterone were then examined. BPA exposure induced increased anxiety behaviors along with increased serum corticosterone in F0 rats. This paternal exposure also led to increased anxiety behaviors in F1 females and aggravated depression behaviors in both sexes of F1 rats. Furthermore, only F1 females exhibited increased serum corticosterone. Overall, these data indicate that preconception paternal exposure to a low dose of BPA may induce transgenerational sex-specific impairments in the affection of adult rats.

304,Religiosity prevalence and its association with depression and anxiety symptoms among Hispanic/Latino adults,"Objectives: Religion plays an important role in the lives of people in the United States. We examined the prevalence of religiosity among Hispanic/Latinos in four regions of the United States and looked at its correlation to depression and anxiety symptoms. Design: The population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/ Study of Latinos enrolled a cohort of Hispanic/Latino adults ( N = 16,415) ages 18±74 in four US cities from June 2008 to June 2011. Participants with complete data on religiosity (i.e., religious affiliation, frequency of attending religious activities and importance of religion), depression (assessed with the CESD-10), and trait anxiety (assessed with the STAI-10) were included in the present study. Distribution of religiosity is described by sociodemographic characteristics. Associations between religiosity with depression and anxiety were examined with logistic regression models controlling for sex, age group, education, Hispanic/Latino background, clinical center, and nativity. Results: The majority of the population (89.5%) reported having a religious affiliation. Weekly attendance at religious activities was reported by 41.6% of participants, while 20.6% did not attend any religious activities. Religion was very important to 63.9% and not at all important to 6.7% of the population. The CES-D scores and trait anxiety scores were not significantly related in the overall group to frequency of attending religious activity or perceived importance of PLOS religion. However, in age-stratified analyses, among older individuals (65+ years old) reporting ""never"" participating in religious activities compared to more than once per week was associated with an 80% higher likelihood of having high depressive symptomatology. Similarly, in the older age group, no religious affiliation or reporting that religion is ""not at all important"" was associated with greater anxiety symptomatology. Conclusion: Religiosity varied by Hispanic/Latino background. Lack of religiosity was associated with elevated depressive or anxiety symptomology in older adults but not in young or middleaged adults.

305,Emotions surrounding friendships of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder in Japan: A qualitative interview study,"Emotions are embedded in culture and play a pivotal role in making friends and interacting with peers. To support the social participation of students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) it is essential to understand their emotional life in the context of ethnic and school cultures. We are particularly interested in how anxiety and loneliness are experienced in developing and maintaining friendships in the daily encounters of adolescents with ASD in the specific context of Japanese schools, because these emotions could serve either as facilitators or barriers to social interaction, depending on how individuals manage them. The present qualitative study investigated perceptions of emotions related to friendship in the everyday school life of 11 adolescents with ASD in Japan. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews, which revealed a wide range of motivations for socialization, limited future prospects to deepen friendships, robust self-awareness of one's own social challenges, and conscious efforts to cope with these challenges. An inductive approach to data analysis resulted in four themes: social motivation, loneliness, anxiety, and distress. To our knowledge this is the first study to uncover the rich emotional life of adolescents with ASD in the context of their friendships in an Asian culture.

306,Benefits of expressive writing in reducing test anxiety: A randomized controlled trial in Chinese samples,"Purpose: To explore the effect of expressive writing of positive emotions on test anxiety among senior-high-school students. Methods: The Test Anxiety Scale (TAS) was used to assess the anxiety level of 200 senior-high-school students. Seventy-five students with high anxiety were recruited and divided randomly into experimental and control groups. Each day for 30 days, the experimental group engaged in 20 minutes of expressive writing of positive emotions, while the control group was asked to merely write down their daily events. A second test was given after the month-long experiment to analyze whether there had been a reduction in anxiety among the sample. Quantitative data was obtained from TAS scores. The NVivo10.0 software program was used to examine the frequency of particular word categories used in participants' writing manuscripts. Results: Senior-high-school students indicated moderate to high test anxiety. There was a significant difference in post-test results ( P &lt; 0.001), with the experimental group scoring obviously lower than the control group. The interaction effect of group and gender in the posttest results was non-significant ( P &gt; 0.05). Students' writing manuscripts were mainly encoded on five code categories: cause, anxiety manifestation, positive emotion, insight and evaluation. There was a negative relation between positive emotion, insight codes and test anxiety. There were significant differences in the positive emotion, anxiety manifestation, and insight code categories between the first 10 days' manuscripts and the last 10 days' ones. PLOS Conclusions: Long-term expressive writing of positive emotions appears to help reduce test anxiety by using insight and positive emotion words for Chinese students. Efficient and effective intervention programs to ease test anxiety can be designed based on this study.

307,"Anxiety, fatigue, and attentional bias toward threat in patients with hematopoietic tumors","Cancer patients with hematopoietic tumors exhibit particularly high rates of anxiety disorders and depression, and often develop negative affect. In addition, psychological problems experienced by cancer patients impair their quality of life. When cancer patients feel anxious, they tend to direct their attention toward stimuli associated with threat in the surrounding environment. If attentional bias occurs in patients with hematopoietic tumors, who are at particular risk of developing negative affect, resolution of the bias could be useful in alleviating their anxiety. The current study examined the association between attentional bias and negative affect in patients with hematopoietic tumors and tested the hypothesis that negative affect would be more severe in those who exhibited greater attentional bias. Twenty-seven patients with hematopoietic tumors participated in the study. Reaction time (RT) was measured as the time between the presentation of the threatening and neutral images, and the subject's button press to indicate choice (neutral expressions). Eight combinations of ""threatening"" expressions with high emotional valence and ""neutral"" expressions with low emotional valence were presented. The images used to measure attentional bias were taken from the Japanese Female Facial Expression Database and had been rated as expressive of anger, sadness, or neutrality, with predetermined emotional valence. Psychological testing was performed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). To examine the association between attentional bias and negative affect, we calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for RTs and POMS. Subjects' mean RT was 882.9 ( SD = 100.9) ms, and 19 of the 27 subjects exhibited slower RTs relative to healthy individuals. RT was significantly positively correlated with Tension-Anxiety ( r = .679, p &lt; .01) and Fatigue ( r = .585, p &lt; .01) subscale scores. The results of the study suggested that attentional bias toward threatening expressions could be positively correlated with the mental intensity of anxiety and fatigue in patients with hematopoietic tumors.

308,Examining the short-term anxiolytic and antidepressant effect of Floatation-REST,"Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy) reduces sensory input to the nervous system through the act of floating supine in a pool of water saturated with Epsom salt. The float experience is calibrated so that sensory signals from visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, thermal, tactile, vestibular, gravitational and proprioceptive channels are minimized, as is most movement and speech. This open-label study aimed to examine whether Floatation-REST would attenuate symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in a clinical sample. Fifty participants were recruited across a spectrum of anxiety and stress-related disorders (posttraumatic stress, generalized anxiety, panic, agoraphobia, and social anxiety), most (n = 46) with comorbid unipolar depression. Measures of self-reported affect were collected immediately before and after a 1-hour float session, with the primary outcome measure being the pre- to post-float change score on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory. Irrespective of diagnosis, Floatation-REST substantially reduced state anxiety (estimated Cohen's d &gt; 2). Moreover, participants reported significant reductions in stress, muscle tension, pain, depression and negative affect, accompanied by a significant improvement in mood characterized by increases in serenity, relaxation, happiness and overall well-being (p &lt; .0001 for all variables). In reference to a group of 30 non-anxious participants, the effects were found to be more robust in the anxious sample and approaching non-anxious levels during the post-float period. Further analysis revealed that the most severely anxious participants reported the largest effects. Overall, the procedure was well-tolerated, with no major safety concerns stemming from this single session. The findings from this initial study need to be replicated in larger controlled trials, but suggest that Floatation- REST may be a promising technique for transiently reducing the suffering in those with anxiety and depression.

309,The effects of anxiety and external attentional focus on postural control in patients with Parkinson's disease,"Background: Although anxiety is a common non-motor outcome of Parkinson's disease (PD) affecting 40% of patients, little attention has been paid so far to its effects on balance impairment and postural control. Improvement of postural control through focusing on the environment (i.e. external focus) has been reported, but the role of anxiety, as a confounding variable, remains unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the influence of anxiety and attentional focus instruction on the standing postural control of PD patients. Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD (17 with high anxiety (HA-PD) and 17 with low anxiety (LA-PD)), as well as 17 gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects (HC) participated in the study. Postural control was evaluated using a combination of two levels of postural difficulty (standing on a rigid force plate surface with open eyes (RO) and standing on a foam surface with open eyes (FO)), as well as three attentional focus instructions (internal, external and no focus). Results: Only the HA-PD group demonstrated significant postural control impairment as compared to the control, as indicated by significantly greater postural sway measures. Moreover, external focus significantly reduced postural sway in all participants especially during the FO condition. Conclusion: The results of the current study provide evidence that anxiety influences balance control and postural stability in patients with PD, particularly those with high levels of anxiety. The results also confirmed that external focus is a potential strategy that significantly improves the postural control of these patients. Further investigation of clinical applicability is warranted towards developing effective therapeutic and rehabilitative treatment plans.

310,Population-based cohort study of the impacts of mild traumatic brain injury in adults four years post-injury,"There is increasing evidence that some people can experience persistent symptoms for up to a year following mild TBI. However, few longitudinal studies of mild TBI exist and the longer-term impact remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) four-years later. Adults (aged ≥ 16 years) identified as part of a TBI incidence study who experienced a mild-TBI four-years ago (N = 232) were compared to age-sex matched controls (N = 232). Sociodemographic variables, prior TBI and symptoms were assessed at the time of injury. Four years post-injury participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools. Analysis of covariance was used to compare differences between TBI cases four years post-injury and controls, controlling for prior TBI and depression. A multiple regression model was used to identify the predictors of increased symptoms and reduced participation. The mild-TBI sample experienced significantly increased self-reported cognitive symptoms (F = 19.90, p = &lt; 0.01) four years post-injury than controls. There were no differences between the groups for somatic (F = 0.02, p = 0.89) or emotional symptoms (F = 0.31, p = 0.58). Additionally, the mild-TBI group reported significantly poorer community participation across all three domains: productivity (F = 199.07, p = &lt; 0.00), social relations (F = 13.93, p = &lt; 0.00) and getting out and about (F = 364.69, p = &lt; 0.00) compared to controls. A regression model accounting for 41% of the variance in cognitive symptoms in TBI cases revealed a history of TBI, receiving acute medical attention and baseline cognitive symptoms, sleep quality, anxiety and depression were predictive of outcome. The results indicate that whilst somatic and emotional symptoms resolve over time, cognitive symptoms can become persistent and that mild TBI can impact longer-term community participation. Early intervention is needed to reduce the longer-term impact of cognitive symptoms and facilitate participation.

311,"Treatment with HC-070, a potent inhibitor of TRPC4 and TRPC5, leads to anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in mice","Background: Forty million adults in the US suffer from anxiety disorders, making these the most common forms of mental illness. Transient receptor potential channel canonical subfamily (TRPC) members 4 and 5 are non-selective cation channels highly expressed in regions of the cortex and amygdala, areas thought to be important in regulating anxiety. Previous work with null mice suggests that inhibition of TRPC4 and TRPC5 may have anxiolytic effects. HC-070 in vitro : To assess the potential of TRPC4/5 inhibitors as an avenue for treatment, we invented a highly potent, small molecule antagonist of TRPC4 and TRPC5 which we call HC-070. HC-070 inhibits recombinant TRPC4 and TRPC5 homomultimers in heterologous expression systems with nanomolar potency. It also inhibits TRPC1/5 and TRPC1/4 heteromultimers with similar potency and reduces responses evoked by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) in the amygdala. The compound is &gt; 400-fold selective over a wide range of molecular targets including ion channels, receptors, and kinases. HC-070 in vivo: Upon oral dosing in mice, HC-070 achieves exposure levels in the brain and plasma deemed sufficient to test behavioral activity. Treatment with HC-070 attenuates the anxiogenic effect of CCK-4 in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The compound recapitulates the phenotype observed in both null TRPC4 and TRPC5 mice in a standard EPM. Anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects of HC-070 are also observed in pharmacological in vivo tests including marble burying, tail suspension and forced swim. Furthermore, HC-070 ameliorates the increased fear memory induced by chronic social stress. A careful evaluation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship reveals that substantial efficacy is observed at unbound brain levels similar to, or even lower than, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) recorded in vitro, increasing confidence that the observed effects are indeed mediated by TRPC4 and/or TRPC5 inhibition. Together, this experimental data set introduces a novel, high quality, small molecule antagonist of TRPC4 and TRPC5 containing channels and supports the targeting of TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels as a new mechanism of action for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms.

312,"Pettiness: Conceptualization, measurement and cross-cultural differences","Although pettiness, defined as the tendency to get agitated over trivial matters, is a facet of neuroticism which has negative health implications, no measure exists. The goal of the current study was to develop, and validate a short pettiness scale. In Study 1 ( N = 2136), Exploratory Factor Analysis distilled a one-factor model with five items. Convergent validity was established using the Big Five Inventory, DASS, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale. As predicted, pettiness was positively associated with neuroticism, depression, anxiety and stress but negatively related to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, life satisfaction and resilience. Also, as predicted, pettiness was not significantly related to physical functioning, or blind and constructive patriotism, indicating discriminant validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Study 2 ( N = 734) revealed a stable one-factor model of pettiness. In Study 3 ( N = 532), the scale, which showed a similar factor structure in the USA and Singapore, also reflected predicted cross-cultural patterns: Pettiness was found to be significantly lower in the United States, a culture categorized as ""looser"" than in Singapore, a culture classified as ""tighter"" in terms of Gelfand and colleagues' framework of national tendencies to oppose social deviance. Results suggest that this brief 5-item tool is a reliable and valid measure of pettiness, and its use in health research is encouraged.

313,Sleep and biological parameters in professional burnout: A psychophysiological characterization,"Professional burnout syndrome has been described in association with insomnia and metabolic, inflammatory and immune correlates. We investigated the interest of exploring biological parameters and sleep disturbances in relation to burnout symptoms among white-collar workers. Fifty-four participants with burnout were compared to 86 healthy control participants in terms of professional rank level, sleep, job strain (Karasek questionnaire), social support, anxiety and depression (HAD scale). Fasting concentrations of glycaemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were assessed. Analysis of variance and a forward Stepwise Multiple Logistic Regression were made to identify predictive factors of burnout. Besides reporting more job strain (in particular job control p = 0.02), higher levels of anxiety (p &lt; 0.001), and sleep disorders related to insomnia (OR = 21.5, 95%CI = 8.8 ± 52.3), participants with burnout presented higher levels of HbA1C, glycaemia, CRP, lower levels of 25(OH)D, higher number of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (P &lt; 0.001 for all) and higher total-cholesterol (P = 0.01). In particular, when HbA1c is &gt; 3.5%, the prevalence of burnout increases from 16.6% to 60.0% (OR = 4.3, 95%CI = 2.8 ± 6.9). Strong significant positive correlation existed between HbA1C and the two dimensions (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization (r = 0.79 and r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.01)) of burnout. Models including job strain, job satisfaction, anxiety and insomnia did not predict burnout (p = 0.30 and p = 0.50). However, when HbA1C levels is included, the prediction of burnout became significant (P = 0.03). Our findings demonstrated the interest of sleep and biological parameters, in particular HbA1C levels, in the characterization of professional burnout.

314,Enhanced susceptibility to stress and seizures in GAD65 deficient mice,"Reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition has been implicated in both anxiety and epilepsy. GAD65 -/- (NOD/LtJ) mice have significantly decreased basal GABA levels in the brain and a lowered threshold for seizure generation. One fifth of GAD65 -/- mice experienced stress-induced seizures upon exposure to an open field at 4 weeks of age. In each successive week until 8 weeks of age, the latency to seizures decreased with prior seizure experience. 100% of GAD65 -/- mice exhibited stress-induced seizures by the end of 8 weeks. GAD65 -/- mice also exhibited marked impairment in open field exploratory behavior and deficits in spatial learning acquisition on a Barnes maze. Anxiety-like behavior in an open field was observed prior to seizure onset and was predictive of subsequent seizures. Immunohistochemical characterization of interneuron subtypes in GAD65 -/- mice showed a selective decrease in GABA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels and no change in calbindin (CLB) or calretinin (CLR) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Stem cells from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) were injected into the hippocampal hilus to restore GABAergic interneurons. One week after transplantation, MGE-transplanted mice demonstrated significant seizure resistance compared to sham surgical controls. The percent area of GFP + MGE graft in the hippocampus correlated significantly with the increase in seizure latency.

315,Associations of psychosocial factors with pregnancy healthy life styles,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 13(5)[e0197389] of PLoS ONE (see record 2018-22488-001). In the original article, the third author's name was spelled incorrectly. The correct name is: Karimollah Hajian-Tilaki. The name appears correctly in this record. There is also an error in reference 30. The correct reference is present in the erratum.] Healthy behaviors in pregnant women have a major effect on pregnancy outcomes; however, only few studies have explored the relationship of multiple psychosocial factors with healthy lifestyles during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the five psychosocial factors of anxiety, stress, depression, marital dissatisfaction, and social support are associated with six domains of healthy lifestyles in pregnant women, including nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, stress management, interpersonal relationships, and self-actualization. In this cross-sectional study, 445 pregnant women from the obstetrics clinics of the teaching hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences were included. The subjects answered six questionnaires, including the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile, Beck Depression Inventory, Prenatal Distress Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Social Support Questionnaire, and Marital Satisfaction Scale. We developed a series of simple linear regression models based on each subscale of lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, stress management, interpersonal relationships, and self-actualization) as the dependent variables and the five psychological variables (anxiety, stress, depression, marital dissatisfaction, and social support) as the independent variables. State and trait anxieties were the strongest negative predictors of all aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, depression was negatively associated with all of the six subscales of a healthy lifestyle. Pregnancy-specific stress was the only negative predictor of stress management and self-actualization. Marital dissatisfaction was negatively associated with nutrition, stress management, health responsibility, and self-actualization. Social support had negative and positive associations with healthy behaviors. The study suggests that more attention should be paid to identifying the psychological risk factors in pregnancy in addition to providing suitable interventions for improving the lifestyle of pregnant women.

316,What does media use reveal about personality and mental health? An exploratory investigation among German students,"The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between personality traits, mental health variables and media use among German students. The data of 633 participants were collected. Results indicate a positive association between general Internet use, general use of social platforms and Facebook use, on the one hand, and self-esteem, extraversion, narcissism, life satisfaction, social support and resilience, on the other hand. Use of computer games was found to be negatively related to these personality and mental health variables. The use of platforms that focus more on written interaction (Twitter, Tumblr) was assumed to be negatively associated with positive mental health variables and significantly positively with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. In contrast, Instagram use, which focuses more on photo-sharing, correlated positively with positive mental health variables. Possible practical implications of the present results for mental health, as well as the limitations of the present work are discussed.

317,Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on employees' mental health: A systematic review,"Objectives: The purpose of this exploratory study was to obtain greater insight into the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on the mental health of employees. Methods: Using PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL, we performed a systematic review in October 2015 of studies investigating the effects of MBSR and MBCT on various aspects of employees' mental health. Studies with a pre-post design (i.e. without a control group) were excluded. Results: 24 articles were identified, describing 23 studies: 22 on the effects of MBSR and 1 on the effects of MBSR in combination with some aspects of MBCT. Since no study focused exclusively on MBCT, its effects are not described in this systematic review. Of the 23 studies, 2 were of high methodological quality, 15 were of medium quality and 6 were of low quality. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the emergent and relatively uncharted nature of the topic of investigation, the exploratory character of this study, and the diversity of outcomes in the studies reviewed. Based on our analysis, the strongest outcomes were reduced levels of emotional exhaustion (a dimension of burnout), stress, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and occupational stress. Improvements were found in terms of mindfulness, personal accomplishment (a dimension of burnout), (occupational) self-compassion, quality of sleep, and relaxation. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review suggest that MBSR may help to improve psychological functioning in employees.

318,Physical multimorbidity and loneliness: A population-based study,"Multimorbidity has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes although as yet, there has been little research on its association with loneliness. This study examined the association between physical multimorbidity ( 2 physical diseases) and loneliness in the general population and its potential mediators. Data came from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 (N = 7403, aged 16 years). Information was obtained on 20 doctor diagnosed physical conditions that were present in the previous year. An item from the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ) was used to obtain information on loneliness. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. An increasing number of physical diseases was associated with higher odds for loneliness. Compared to no physical diseases, the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval: CI) for loneliness increased from 1.34 (1.13–1.59) to 2.82 (2.11–3.78) between one and 5 physical diseases. This association was particularly strong in the youngest age group (i.e. 16–44 years). The loneliness-physical multimorbidity association was significantly mediated by stressful life events (% mediated 11.1%-30.5%), anxiety (30.2%), and depression (15.4%). Physical multimorbidity is associated with increased odds for loneliness. Prospective research is now needed to further elucidate this association and the factors that underlie it.

319,"Effects of a psychological intervention programme on mental stress, coping style and immune function in percutaneous coronary intervention patients","Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effects of a psychological intervention programme on the mental stress, coping style and cortisol and IL-2 levels of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: A total of sixty cardiovascular patients scheduled for PCI with clear anxiety and depression screened by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were randomly divided into an experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 30) group. The participants in the experimental group received cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy and emotional support. Self-reported questionnaires, including the Self-Report Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and the Medical Coping Mode Questionnaire (MCMQ), and levels of IL-2 and cortisol were collected at baseline and the day before discharge. Results: Compared with the controls, patients in the intervention group had a better mental state and coping style (confrontation), higher levels of IL-2 and lower levels of cortisol (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The psychological intervention programme effectively improved mental state, reduced negative coping styles, increased levels of IL-2, and decreased cortisol levels in patients undergoing PCI. This programme may be an effective preoperative nursing intervention for PCI patients.

320,"The effect of relaxation techniques on edema, anxiety and depression in post-mastectomy lymphedema patients undergoing comprehensive decongestive therapy: A clinical trial","Objectives: Lymphedema is sometimes accompanied by high degrees of anxiety and depression. This study aimed to assess the effects of relaxation techniques on the level of edema, anxiety and depression in women undergoing Comprehensive Decongestive Therapy (CDT). Design: This clinical trial compared two treatment methods in 31 women with post-mastectomy lymphedema, including 15 cases who received CDT and 16 who received RCDT (Relaxation plus CDT). The edema volume, anxiety and depression scores were compared at the first and last sessions of the first phase of the treatment and six weeks afterwards. Results: The edema, anxiety and depression scores were 63.6%, 54.1% and 65.5% in the RCDT group and 60.7%, 31.4% and 35.2% in the CDT group. There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of the reduction in depression (p = 0.024) and anxiety (p = 0.011) scores throughout the study. This significant relationship was due to the differences in the depression score in the 3rd and 9th weeks of the study between the two groups. Similarly, anxiety levels differed significantly between the two groups at the 9th week of the study (P = 0.013). Conclusion: Relaxation techniques reduced the anxiety and depression scores and the volume of edema in the patients with lymphedema. The addition of this intervention to the therapeutic package for lymphedema patients requires further studies in terms of cost-effectiveness.

321,Mobile and traditional cognitive behavioral therapy programs for generalized anxiety disorder: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating mental health illness that affects approximately 3.1% of U.S. adults and can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). With the emergence of digital health technologies, mobile CBT may be a cost-effective way to deliver care. We developed an analysis framework to quantify the cost-effectiveness of internet-based CBT for individuals with GAD. As a case study, we examined the potential value of a new mobile-delivered CBT program for GAD. Methods: We developed a Markov model of GAD health states combined with a detailed economic analysis for a cohort of adults with GAD in the U.S. In our case study, we used pilot program efficacy data to evaluate a mobile CBT program as either prevention or treatment only and compared the strategies to traditional CBT and no CBT. Traditional CBT efficacy was estimated from clinical trial results. We calculated discounted incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the cohort lifetime. Case study results: In the base case, for a cohort of 100,000 persons with GAD, we found that mobile CBT is cost-saving. It leads to a gain of 34,108 QALYs and 81,492 QALYs and a cost reduction of $2.23 billion and $4.54 billion when compared to traditional CBT and no CBT respectively. Results were insensitive to most model inputs and mobile CBT remained cost-saving in almost all scenarios. Limitations: The case study was conducted for illustrative purposes and used mobile CBT efficacy data from a small pilot program; the analysis should be re-conducted once robust efficacy data is available. The model was limited in its ability to measure the effectiveness of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy. Conclusions: Mobile CBT may lead to improved health outcomes at lower costs than traditional CBT or no intervention and may be effective as either prevention or treatment.

322,"Does trait anxiety influence effects of oxytocin on eye-blink startle reactivity? A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study","Background: Previous research has demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin modulates social behaviors and reduces anxiety. However, effects of oxytocin on startle reactivity, a well-validated measure of defense system activation related to fear and anxiety, have been inconsistent. Here we investigated the influence of oxytocin on startle reactivity with particular focus on the role of trait anxiety. Methods: Forty-four healthy male participants attended two experimental sessions. They received intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) in one session and placebo in the other. Startle probes were presented in combination with pictures of social and non-social content. Eye-blink startle magnitude was measured by electromyography over the musculus orbicularis oculi in response to 95 dB noise bursts. Participants were assigned to groups of high vs. low trait anxiety based on their scores on the trait form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: A significant interaction effect of oxytocin with STAI confirmed that trait anxiety moderated the effect of oxytocin on startle reactivity. Post-hoc tests indicated that for participants with elevated trait anxiety, oxytocin increased startle magnitude, particularly when watching nonsocial pictures, while this was not the case for participants with low trait anxiety. Conclusion: Results indicate that effects of oxytocin on defense system activation depend on individual differences in trait anxiety. Trait anxiety may be an important moderator variable that should be considered in human studies on oxytocin effects.

22,"Superiority of magnesium and vitamin B6 over magnesium alone on severe stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial","Introduction: Animal and clinical studies suggest complementary effects of magnesium and high-dose pyridoxine (vitamin B6) on stress reduction. This is the first randomized trial evaluating the effects of combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on stress in a stressed population with low magnesemia using a validated measure of perceived stress. Methods: In this Phase IV, investigator-blinded trial (EudraCT: 2015-003749-24), healthy adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score &gt; 18 and serum magnesium concentration 0.45 mmol/L–0.85 mmol/L, were randomized 1:1 to magnesium–vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6 [Mg–vitamin B6]; daily dose 300 mg and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl [Mg]; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included change in DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (primary endpoint) and Week 4, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Results: In the modified intention-to-treat analysis (N = 264 subjects), both treatment arms substantially reduced DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (Mg–vitamin B6, 44.9%; Mg 42.4%); no statistical difference between arms was observed (p &gt; 0.05). An interaction (p = 0.0097) between baseline stress level and treatment warranted subgroup analysis (as per statistical plan); adults with severe/extremely severe stress (DASS-42 stress subscale score ≥ 25; N = 162) had a 24% greater improvement with Mg–vitamin B6 versus Mg at Week 8 (3.16 points, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.82, p = 0.0203). Consistent results were observed in the per protocol analysis and at Week 4. Overall, 12.1% of Mg–vitamin B6 treated and 17.4% of Mg-treated subjects experienced AEs potentially treatment related. Conclusions: These findings suggest oral Mg supplementation alleviated stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia and the addition of vitamin B6 to Mg was not superior to Mg supplementation alone. With regard to subjects with severe/extremely severe stress, this study provides clinical support for greater benefit of Mg combined with vitamin B6.

23,A pilot-study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy using video conference for patients with coronary artery heart disease,"Background: Many patients with coronary artery heart disease are unable to access traditional psychosocial rehabilitation conducted face to face due to excessive travel distance. Therefore, this study developed and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program, described the patterns of use and measured change in risk factors. Methods: This study adopted an online video conference system, JointNet, to maintain group interaction functions similar to face to face groups online, and also built an self-learning platform to deliver psychoeducation content and cognitive-behavior therapy related materials and homework. Forty-three out-patients were recruited in the pilot study, who then chose to participate in either the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy or face to face group based on their preference. Fourteen patients were assigned to the waiting-list control. Results: Seventeen participants (17/43 = 39.5%) chose the Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy program. Among them, thirteen participants (13/17 = 76.5%) finished the program and were more male (92.3% vs. 50%), employed (53.8% vs. 35.3%), and had longer education duration (13.9 vs. 12.5 years) than the counterparts of the face to face group. Furthermore, they were highly motivated with average number of log-ins (66.5 time), website surfing time (950.94 min), reading frequency (78.15 time) and reading time (355.90 min) for the self-learning platform during eight weeks; and also highly satisfied (97%) with visiting the self-learning platform and video conferences. The treatment effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavior group therapy was comparable with face to face one in reducing anxiety, hostility, respiration rate, and in improving vasodilation but not depression compared with the waiting-list control. Conclusion: These results indicated that the Internet-based group therapy program using video conference is feasible and acceptable for the psychosocial rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery heart disease, and provides an alternative for patients who are unable to obtain conventional psychosocial rehabilitation conducted face to face.

24,"Gender disparities in depression severity and coping among people living with HIV/AIDS in Kolkata, India","People living with HIV/AIDS (PLH) experience high rates of depression and related psychosocial risk factors that vary by gender. This study examines gender differences in depression severity among antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients (n = 362) from a large government ART clinic in Kolkata, India. Hypotheses for multiple linear regression models were guided by an integrated gendered stress process model focusing on variables reflecting social status (age, partner status), stressors (stigma), and resources (income, social support). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); 22% of the sample reached the cutoff for severe depression, 56% moderate, and 13% mild depression. Compared to men, women reported lower income, education (50% no formal education vs. 20% men), availability of emotional and instrumental support, and were less likely to be married or cohabiting (53% women vs. 72% of men). However, more women had partners who were HIV-positive (78% women vs. 46% men). Overall, depression severity was negatively associated with availability of emotional support and self-distraction coping, and positively associated with internalized HIV/AIDS stigma, availability of instrumental support, and behavioral disengagement coping. Interactions for instrumental support by income and partner status by age varied significantly by gender. Analyses stratified by gender indicated that: 1) Frequently seeking instrumental support from others was protective for men at all income levels, but only for high-income women; and 2) having a partner was protective for men as they aged, but not for women. These results suggest that gender disparities in depression severity are created and maintained by women’s lower social status and limited access to resources. The effect of stigma on depression severity did not vary by gender. These findings may inform the tailoring of future interventions to address mental health needs of PLH in India, particularly gender disparities in access to material and social resources for coping with HIV.

25,Virtual mortality and near-death experience after a prolonged exposure in a shared virtual reality may lead to positive life-attitude changes,"Mortality is an obvious if uncomfortable part of the human condition, yet it is impossible to study its impact on anyone who experiences it. Reports of phenomena associated with death such as out-of-the-body (OBE) and near death experiences (NDE) can only be studied post-hoc, since it is impossible to design a scientific study where an experimental group experiences death (and returns) and a control group does not. Yet NDEs seem to have a profound influence on the subsequent lives of people and are therefore worthy of study. Terror Management Theory, which argues that death anxiety contributes to in-group solidarity and hostility to out-groups, relies on studies that manipulate opinions and cannot be based on experiential evidence. Here we introduce a potential methodology that uses immersive virtual reality (VR) for the study of mortality and NDEs. Participants are embodied in alternate bodies in a beautiful island along with two companions. They explore the island and carry out tasks together. The mechanism of embodiment produces strong illusions of ownership over their life-sized virtual bodies. Over time each participant witnesses the death of the two companions and then her own death—which includes the reported features of an NDE (OBE, life review, the tunnel leading to white light) followed by a period of observation of the continuing activities in the virtual world on an external screen. Fifteen female participants experienced 6 sessions in the island, each starting as a child and gradually maturing, and eventually ageing and dying. Sixteen control subjects formed a waiting group. We introduce this as a methodology for the study of these issues, and present promising results, suggesting that those who experienced the island report life attitude changes, becoming more concerned with others and more interested in global rather than material issues compared to the control group. The results are based on a small sample size, and should be considered as indicative of the possibilities of this new methodology as a way forward for future studies in this field.

26,Association between medication adherence and illness perceptions in atrial fibrillation patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: An observational cross-sectional pilot study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between medication adherence and illness perceptions, and to explore the factors associated with poor medication adherence in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in a real-world clinical setting. Methods: An observational cross-sectional pilot study was conducted at a single Japanese university hospital. One hundred and twenty-nine patients who were diagnosed with AF and who were taking DOACs were recruited from outpatients between January 4 th and April 25 th , 2017. We evaluated medication adherence to DOACs using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) and illness perceptions using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). The patients' characteristics and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Results: Ninety-nine (76.7%) patients (male, n = 74; mean age, 71.4 ± 9.8 years) participated in this study. According to the MMAS-8, 21 (21.2%) of the patients were classified into the poor adherence group (MMAS-8 score of &lt; 6), and 78 (78.8%) were classified into the good adherence group (MMAS-8 score of 6-8). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (per year, odds ratio [OR] 0.912, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.853-0.965, p = 0.001), a history of warfarin use (OR 0.181, 95% CI 0.033-0.764, p = 0.019), duration of DOAC exposure (per 100 days, OR 1.245, 95% CI 1.084-1.460, p = 0.001), and the BIPQ emotional response score (per 1 point, OR 1.235, 95% CI 1.015-1.527, p = 0.035) were significantly associated with poor medication adherence in AF patients receiving DOACs. Conclusion: Poor medication adherence to DOACs was strongly associated with a stronger emotional response (i.e. stronger feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression), as well as younger age, the absence of a history of warfarin treatment, and longer DOAC exposure. Further evaluation of the factors associated with medication adherence in AF patients and the development and execution of strategies for improving poor adherence are warranted in the real-world clinical setting.

27,"Cancer-related effects on relationships, long-term psychological status and relationship satisfaction in couples whose child was treated for leukemia: A PETALE study","Objectives: Follow-up studies suggest that the psychosocial impact of pediatric cancer on parents often extends beyond the end of their child's cancer treatments, and parents can continue to experience both individual and relationship effects. In a long-term study of parents of children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we aimed to: 1) describe parents' adjustment (psychological distress, relationship satisfaction; 2) describe the perceived impact of cancer on couples' relationship, and; 3) identify to what extent the perceived impact of cancer on the couple is related to both parents' long-term adjustment. Methods: Parents of childhood ALL survivors (n = 103 couples) were surveyed as part of a cohort recall (PETALE cohort). Both parents completed questionnaires exploring adjustment (Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Dyadic Adjustment Scale) and perceived impact of cancer on the relationship (Impact of Cancer on the Couple). Mothers' and fathers' scores were compared using MANOVAs. We also examined the degree to which a parent's perceived changes in relationship dynamics following their child's cancer were associated with their own current adjustment (actor effects), and their partner's current adjustment (partner effects) using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). Results: Frequencies of current distress were normative in parents (mothers/fathers): general distress (6.8/7.8%), anxiety (5.8/6.8%), depression (2.9/6.8%), somatization (13.6/9.7%), and relationship distress (21.4/20.4%). Mothers and fathers typically agreed on their reported relationship satisfaction, and the perceived nature of relationship changes following the illness. Dyadic analyses indicated that whereas mothers' adjustment was related to their own perceived relationship changes, fathers' adjustment was primarily related to their partner's perceptions. Conclusion: In long-term stable couples, mothers may act as an influential bridge connecting the illness experiences of survivors and fathers. This could explain why mothers' perceptions of relationship changes were related to their partners' long-term adjustment, which was not the case for fathers.

28,Deletion of exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) causes defects in hippocampal signaling in female mice,"Previous studies demonstrate essential roles for the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP 1 and 2 (Epac1 and Epac2; here collectively referred to as Epac) in the brain. In the hippocampus, Epac contributes to the control of neuronal growth and differentiation and has been implicated in memory and learning as well as in anxiety and depression. In the present study we address the hypothesis that Epac affects hippocampal cellular responses to acute restraint stress. Stress causes activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is essential for proper feedback regulation of the stress response, both in the brain and along the HPA axis. In the hippocampus, GR expression is regulated by cAMP and the brain enriched micro RNA miR-124. Epac has been associated with miR-124 expression in hippocampal neurons, but not in regulation of GR. We report that hippocampal expression of Epac1 and Epac2 increased in response to acute stress in female wild type mice. In female mice genetically deleted for Epac, nuclear translocation of GR in response to restraint stress was significantly delayed, and moreover, miR- 124 expression was decreased in these mice. Male mice lacking Epac also showed abnormalities in miR-124 expression, but the phenotype was less profound than in females. Serum corticosterone levels were slightly altered immediately after stress in both male and female mice deleted for Epac. The presented data indicate that Epac1 and Epac2 are involved in controlling cellular responses to acute stress in the mouse hippocampus and provide novel insights into the underlying transcriptional and signaling networks. Interestingly, we observe sex specific differences when Epac is deleted. As the incidence and prevalence of stress-related diseases are higher in women than in men, the Epac knockout models might serve as genetic tools to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying differences between male and female with regard to regulation of stress.

29,Implementation of a psychosocial support package for people receiving treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Nepal: A feasibility and acceptability study,"Background and objectives: People receiving treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have high rates of depression. Psychosocial support in general, and treatments for depression in particular, form an important but neglected area of patient-centred care, and a key pillar in the global End TB strategy. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a psychosocial support package for people receiving treatment for MDR-TB in Nepal. Methods: This feasibility study used a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. We implemented the intervention package in two National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) MDR-TB treatment centres and 8 sub-centres. We screened patients monthly for depression and anxiety (cut-off ≥ 24 and ≥ 17 respectively on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist) and also for low social support (cut-off ≤ 3 on the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support). Those who screened positive on either screening tool received the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), which uses brief counselling based on behavioural activation theory. Other aspects of the psychosocial package were information/education materials and group interactions with other patients. Results: We screened 135 patients, of whom 12 (9%) received HAP counselling, 115 (85%) received information materials, 80 (59%) received an education session and 49 (36%) received at least one group session. Eight group sessions were conducted in total. All aspects of the intervention package were acceptable to patients, including the screening, information, group work and counselling. Patients particularly valued having someone to talk to about their concerns and worries. We were able to successfully train individuals with no experience of psychological counselling to deliver HAP. Conclusion: This psychosocial support package is acceptable to patients. The information materials we developed are feasible to deliver in the current NTP. However, the structured psychological counselling (HAP), is not feasible in the current NTP due to time constraints. This requires additional investment of counsellors in TB clinics.

30,A brief version of the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) in Spanish population: Stress of main family carers of chronic paediatric patients,"A chronic illness in childhood has a negative impact on the paediatric patient and on family functioning. Psychological stress in parents influences the level of adjustment to the illness of their children. The Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) was designed to measure stress in parents whose child has a chronic illness or requires prolonged medical monitoring. The main objective of this study is to provide a brief version of the Spanish translation of the PIP, across a sample consisting of 465 main familial caregivers (85.2% female, n = 396) between 27 and 67 years old ( Ẍ = 44.13; SD = 5.35) of paediatric patients between 9 and 18 years old ( Ẍ = 12.10, SD = 2.20; 56.8% men, n = 264) diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type I (20.9% of the sample; n = 97), short stature (32.5% of the sample; n = 151), or a chronic respiratory disease (asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis) (46.6% of the sample; n = 217). After performing several EFAs (Exploratory Factor Analyses) and CFAs (Confirmatory Factorial Analyses), it was decided that 30 items need to be removed. Reliability and validity results suggest that the new 12-item version possesses appropriate psychometric properties.

The PIP also showed predictive ability in regards to anxiety and depression, a positive relationship between the instrument's own scales and a negative relationship with the caregiver's age. Finally, depending on the paediatric patient's diagnosis, differences in stress levels were found.

31,Effectiveness of a multi-facetted blended eHealth intervention during intake supporting patients and clinicians in Shared Decision Making: A cluster randomised controlled trial in a specialist mental health outpatient setting,"Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a multi-facetted blended eHealth intervention, called SDM-Digital Intake (SDM-DI), in which patients and clinicians are supported in Shared Decision Making during the intake process. Methods: The study is a two-arm matched-paired cluster Randomised Controlled Trial in a specialist mental health outpatient setting with two conditions: SDM-DI and Intake As Usual (IAU). Four intake teams were allocated to each arm. All patients who followed an intake, were asked to participate if they were capable to complete questionnaires. Decisional Conflict (DC), referring to patients' engagement and satisfaction with clinical decisions, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were patient participation, applying Shared Decision Making (SDM), working alliance, treatment adherence and symptom severity. Effects were measured at two weeks (T1) and two months (T2) after intake. Multilevel regression and intention-to-treat analyses were used. Additionally, the influence of subgroups and intervention adherence on DC were explored. Results: At T1, 200 patients participated (47% intervention, 53% control), and at T2 175 patients (47% intervention, 53% control). At T1 and T2, no differences were found between conditions on DC. Subgroup analyses showed that effects of SDM-DI on DC were not modified by primary diagnoses mood, anxiety and personality disorders. Compared to IAU, at T2, patients reported positive effects of SDM-DI on SDM (β 7.553, p = 0.038, 95%CI:0.403 ± 14.703, d = 0.32) and reduction of symptoms (β -7.276, p = 0.0497, 95%CI:-14.544 ± -0.008, d = -0.43). No effects were found on patient participation, working alliance and treatment adherence. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that if SDM was applied well, patients reported less DC (β = -0.457, p = 0.000, 95%CI:-0.518 ± -0.396, d = -1.31), which was associated with better treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Although, this trial fails to demonstrate that SDM-DI by itself is sufficient to reduce DC, the results are encouraging for further efforts in improving and implementing the SDM intervention.

32,Biopsychosocial factors associated with non-recovery after a minor transport-related injury: A systematic review,"Background: Globally, road transport accidents contribute significantly to mortality and burden of disability. Up to 50 million people suffer a transport-related non-fatal injury each year, which often leads to long-term disability. A substantial number of people with minor injuries struggle to recover and little is known about the factors leading to poor or non-recovery. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of biopsychosocial factors related to poor or nonrecovery after a minor transport-related injury. Methods and findings: Studies were selected through searches of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library. Methodological quality was assessed using a Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklist for quantitative cohort studies and Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist for qualitative articles. Data were extracted using the Cochrane data extraction tool based on the biopsychosocial model of health (BPS). In total, there were 37 articles included. However, heterogeneity of the techniques and tools used to assess factors and outcomes across studies meant that pooling of results to determine biopsychosocial factors most predictive of poor or non-recovery was not possible. Hence, a narrative synthesis was conducted and shown multiple factors to be associated with poorer outcomes or non-recovery, most being identified in the biological and psychological domain of the BPS model. Factors that were the most representative across studies and have shown to have the strongest associations with poor or non-recovery were high initial pain intensity, pain duration and severity, pre-accident physical and mental health status and pain catastrophising. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the complexity of recovery and a challenge in reporting on predictors of recovery. It is evident that a range of multi-factorial biopsychosocial factors impact recovery. These factors are often inter-connected and multi-faceted and therefore, it was not feasible to select or focus on one single factor. In defining the most predictive factors, further research is required, yet the consensus around which tools to use to measure recovery outcomes is needed and is highly recommended. Regardless of the descriptive nature, the review demonstrated that high levels of post-injury pain are associated with poorer outcomes such as chronic pain and physical and mental disability. Therefore, early targeting of modifiable factors such as pain, pain catastrophizing and arising comorbidities such as PTSD, depression and anxiety may assist in reducing chronic pain and ongoing related disabilities.

33,Olfactory functioning in adults with Tourette syndrome,"Tourette syndrome is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder can be found. The overlap between neuroanatomical regions and neurotransmitter systems in the olfactory system and the pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome let us hypothesize altered olfactory performance in Tourette syndrome. The main objective of this study was to systematically assess olfactory functioning in subjects with Tourette syndrome and to compare it to healthy controls. We assessed 28 adults with Tourette syndrome (age 33.1± 9.4 years, disease duration 23.7 ± 9.7 years) and 28 healthy controls (age 32.9 ± 9.0 years) matched in regard to age, sex, education and smoking habits. The ""Sniffin Sticks"" test battery was applied to assess odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Additionally, the combined score of the odor threshold test, the odor discrimination test and the odor identification test of the ""Sniffin Sticks"" test battery was calculated. Although it was not the primary aim of this study, we assessed whether tics and comorbidity could contribute to olfactory alterations in adults with Tourette syndrome. Therefore, clinical scores were used to assess severity of tics and co-morbidity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression in subjects with Tourette syndrome. Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 ± 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 ± 3.1; p = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 ± 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 ± 1.4; p = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 ± 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 ± 1.6; p = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 ± 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 ± 2.2; p = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects ( p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.

34,The psychological health and associated factors of men who have sex with men in China: A cross-sectional survey,"Objectives: The psychological health of men who have sex with men (MSM) has received increased attention in recent years. We thus investigated the psychological status and associated factors among MSM in China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 248 MSM was conducted from April to September 2015 using Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) in Huludao and Zhengzhou, China. Statistical analyses utilized SPSS version 19.0 for Windows. Results: All Cronbach's α coefficients of the SCL-90 subscales exceeded 0.7, suggesting acceptable reliability. The coefficient range of the collective validity for all the subscales was &gt; 0.4. For the divisional validity, each item correlated better with the hypothetical subscale than with other subscales. Collective validity and divisional validity were both acceptable. The four most frequent types of psychological distress among MSM were depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, and anxiety. Results of the univariate analysis revealed that the following groups had significantly higher SCL-90 scores (P &lt; 0.05): peasantry, married MSM, respondents who reported condomless anal intercourse and a greater number of male partners, and respondents who had not undergone psychosocial counseling and whose family or friends did not know about their sexual identity. In a multivariate logistic regression model, the following parameters were independently associated with higher SCL-90 scores: being married (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 3.19; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.96 to 5.93), condomless anal intercourse (AOR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.31), number of male partners (AOR = 1.66 and 1.81; 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.34 and 1.32 to 2.69), family or friends not knowing about sexual identity (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.92), and lack of psychosocial counseling (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.06 to 4.09). Conclusions: Our results indicate that psychological health problems among MSM in China are of concern. It is thus necessary to strengthen intervention efforts, with more emphasis on intervention programs to improve psychological health among Chinese MSM.

35,Comparison of pain burden and psychological factors in Brazilian women living with HIV and chronic neuropathic or nociceptive pain: An exploratory study,"Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p &lt; 0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p &lt; 0.001), catastrophizing (p &lt; 0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain). Using scales such as the LANSS to identify the type of choric pain, could be of use to address relevant issues for the patients, and to propose tailored therapies.

36,The psychometric properties of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) in Canadian military personnel,"The psychometric properties of the ten-item Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) have been extensively explored in civilian populations. However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0−40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach's alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05−0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.

37,Trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and the first 12 months postpartum and child externalizing and internalizing behavior at three years,"Background: Most evidence of the association between maternal depression and children's development is limited by being cross-sectional. To date, few studies have modelled trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms from pregnancy through the early postpartum years and examined their association with social emotional and behavior functioning in preschool children. The objectives of this study were to: 1) identify distinct groups of women defined by their trajectories of depressive symptoms across four time points from mid-pregnancy to one year postpartum; and 2) examine the associations between these trajectories and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Methods We analyzed data from the All Our Families (AOF) study, a large, population based pregnancy cohort of mother-child dyads in Alberta, Canada. The AOF study is an ongoing pregnancy cohort study designed to investigate relationships between the prenatal and early life period and outcomes for children and mothers. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Children's behavioral functioning at age 3 was assessed using the Behavior Scales developed for the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Longitudinal latent class analysis was conducted to identify trajectories of women's depressive symptoms across four time points from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and children's behavior, while adjusting for other significant maternal, child and psychosocial factors. Results: 1983 participants met eligibility criteria. We identified four distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms: low level (64.7%); early postpartum (10.9%); subclinical (18.8%); and persistent high (5.6%). In multivariable models, the proportion of children with elevated behavior symptoms was highest for children whose mothers had persistent high depressive symptoms, followed by mothers with moderate symptoms (early postpartum and subclinical trajectories) and lowest for minimal symptoms. After accounting for demographic, child and psychosocial factors, the relationships between depression trajectories and child hyperactivity/ inattention, physical aggression (subclinical trajectory only) and separation anxiety symptoms remained significant. Conclusion: These findings suggest both externalizing and internalizing children's behaviors are associated with prolonged maternal depressive symptoms. There is a good case for the need to move beyond overly simplistic clinical cutoff approaches of depressed/not depressed in screening for perinatal depression. Women with elevated depressive symptoms at clinical and subclinical levels need to be identified, provided with evidence-based treatment, and monitored with repeat screening to improve maternal mental health outcomes and reduce the risk of associated negative outcomes on children's early social-emotional and behavior development.

38,High levels of caregiver burden in Prader-Willi syndrome,"Objectives: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact. Results: Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30±59 years old, non- Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver's children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption. Conclusions: Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.

39,"Loneliness in schizophrenia: Construct clarification, measurement, and clinical relevance","Loneliness is a highly prevalent experience in schizophrenia. Theoretical models developed in the general population propose that loneliness is tantamount to a feeling of being unsafe, is accompanied by enhanced environmental threat perception, and leads to poor physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Previous research has reported that loneliness is associated with poorer physical and emotional health in schizophrenia; however, few studies have directly compared loneliness and its correlates in persons with schizophrenia and non-psychiatric comparison subjects. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate similarities and differences in the construct of loneliness, the equivalency of the measurement of this construct, and similarities and differences in the pattern of external correlates of loneliness between schizophrenia and non-psychiatric comparison groups. The third version of the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) was administered to 116 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 106 non-psychiatric comparison subjects. Additional clinical and positive psychological measures were collected, as well as demographic characteristics of the two groups. Multiple groups confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the UCLA-3 was best characterized by a bifactor model in which all items loaded on a general loneliness dimension as well as one of two orthogonal method factors reflecting item wording in both groups. Furthermore, the UCLA-3 exhibited invariant measurement of these latent constructs across groups. Mean levels of loneliness were nearly a standard deviation higher in the schizophrenia group. Nonetheless, the overall pattern and strength of correlates were largely similar across groups, with loneliness being positively associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, and negatively correlated with mental well-being, happiness, and resilience. Subtle differences in correlates of age, optimism, and satisfaction with life were found. Overall, loneliness appears to be distinct from other schizophrenia-related deficits and operates similarly across schizophrenia and NC groups, suggesting that theoretical models of loneliness developed in the general population may generalize to schizophrenia.

40,Factors associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicines for prostate cancer by long-term survivors,"Objective: To assess whether the use of complementary and alternative medicines therapies (CAMs) for prostate cancer and/or its treatment side effects by long-term survivors is associated with selected socio-demographic, clinical, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) and/or psychological factors. Design, setting and participants: The Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study (PCOS) is a population-based cohort study of men with prostate cancer who were aged less than 70 years at diagnosis in New South Wales, Australia. Included in these analyses were men who returned a 10-year follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about CAM use. Methods: Validated instruments assessed patient's HRQOL and psychological well-being. Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of current CAM use for prostate cancer according to socio-demographic, clinical, HRQOL and psychological factors. Results: 996 of 1634 (61%) living PCOS participants completed the 10-year questionnaire. Of these 996 men, 168 (17%) were using CAMs for prostate cancer and 525 (53%) were using CAMs for any reason (including prostate cancer). Those using CAM for prostate cancer were more likely to be regular or occasional support group participants (vs. no participation RR = 2.02; 95%CI 1.41-2.88), born in another country (vs. Australian born RR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.17-2.16), have received androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) since diagnosis (RR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.12-2.28) or in the past two years (RR = 2.34; 95%CI 1.56-3.52). CAM use was associated with greater fear of recurrence (RR = 1.29; 95%CI 1.12-1.48), cancer-specific distress (RR = 1.15; 95%CI 1.01-1.30), cancer-specific hyperarousal (RR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.04-1.31), cancer locus of control (RR = 1.16; 95%CI 1.01-1.34) and less satisfaction with medical treatments (RR = 0.86; 95%CI 0.76-0.97), but not with intrusive thinking, cognitive avoidance, depression, anxiety or any HRQOL domains. Conclusions: In this study, about one in six long term prostate cancer survivors used CAMs for their prostate cancer with use centred around ADT, country of birth, distress, cancer control, fear of recurrence and active help seeking.

41,Do people with multiple sclerosis want to know their prognosis? A UK nationwide study,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a varied and uncertain trajectory. The recent development of analytical processing tools that draw on large longitudinal patient databases facilitates personalised long-term prognosis estimates. This has the potential to improve both shared treatment decision-making and psychological adjustment. However, there is limited research on how people with MS feel about prognosis communication and forecasting. This study investigated the prognosis communication experiences and preferences of people with MS and explored whether clinical, demographic and psychological factors are associated with prognosis information preferences. Methods: 3175 UK MS Register members (59% of those with active accounts) completed an online survey containing 17 questions about prognosis communication experiences, attitudes and preferences. Participants also completed validated questionnaires measuring coping strategies, tendencies to seek out (`monitor') or avoid ('blunt') information in threatening situations, and MS risk perceptions and reported their clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Data already held on the MS Register about participants' quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms and MS impact were obtained and linked to the survey data. Results: 53.1% of participants had never discussed long-term prognosis with healthcare professionals. 54.2% lacked clarity about their long-term prognosis. 76% had strong preferences for receiving long-term prognosis information. 92.8% were interested in using tools that generate personalised predictions. Most participants considered prognostication useful for decision- making. Participants were more receptive to receiving prognosis information at later time-points, versus at diagnosis. A comprehensive set of sociodemographic, clinical and psychological variables predicted only 7.9% variance in prognosis information preferences. Conclusions: People with MS have an appetite for individualised long-term prognosis forecasting and their need for information is frequently unmet. Clinical studies deploying and evaluating interventions to support prognostication in MS are now needed. This study indicates suitable contexts and patient preferences for initial trials of long-term prognosis tools in clinical settings.

42,Sexual dysfunctions in MS in relation to neuropsychiatric aspects and its psychological treatment: A scoping review,"Objective: Sexual dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) is a significant, but often underestimated and overlooked suffering. Interventions to treat sexual dysfunction in MS are rare. The relation between sexual dysfunction in MS and psychological as well as neuropsychological aspects is evident. However, this field of research remains markedly underdeveloped in this severe chronic illness. The aim of this scoping review is to describe the relevant knowledge in this area and to identify psychological interventions to treat sexual dysfunctions in MS. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to answer the following questions: (1) Which psychological and neuropsychological factors impact on sexual dysfunction in MS and vice versa? (2) What kind of psychological interventions aiming to improve sexual dysfunctions in MS are available? A comprehensive search and review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was completed by using a recent methodological framework for scoping reviews. Results: 23 publications covering a total of 13,259 people with MS and 532 healthy controls were identified. Sexual dysfunction was found to be very common in MS and there is an obvious relation to psychological disorders as e.g. depression and anxiety and also to psychological aspects as partner relationship and quality of life. The relation between sexual dysfunction in MS and neuropsychological impairment has only rarely been studied and no clear results were found. Only two studies were identified, assessing the effectiveness of psychological intervention studies on sexual dysfunction in people with MS, and a third study presenting a secondary analysis of a study targeting depression. All three studies reported significant improvements in sexual dysfunction as well as partly in psychological variables. Conclusions: There is a pressing need for the development and adequate evaluation of psychological interventions for sexual dysfunctions in MS. In addition, sexual dysfunction and its impact on psychological wellbeing should be more focussed in clinical care.

43,Allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis synergistically compromise the mental health and health-related quality of life of Korean adults: A nationwide population-based survey,"Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and rhinosinusitis (RS) negatively impact psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, few population-based studies have investigated the effects of these conditions on mental health and HRQoL. Purpose: To explore independent associations of AR and/or RS with mental health and HRQoL using data from the 2013-2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Methods: The KNHANES is a nationwide cross-sectional survey of the non-institutionalized population of Korea. A total of 15,441 adults completed the clinical examination and the health questionnaire. We divided all participants into four groups: AR-/RS-, AR-/RS +, AR +/RS-, and AR +/RS +. Logistic regression analyses were performed after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, general health behaviors, and other comorbidities. Results: The AR +/RS + group contained the highest proportion of subjects with perceived stress and depressed mood. Subjects with AR +/RS + also had more frequent problems in terms of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. After adjusting for all confounders, the odds ratios (ORs) were 2.96 (p = 0.009) for depressed mood and 3.17 (p = 0.013) for suicidal ideation in the AR +/RS + group compared with in the AR-/RS- group. The AR +/RS- group reported more perceived stress (OR, 1.56, p = 0.003) and depression (OR, 1.72, p = 0.024) compared with the AR-/RS- group. In terms of the ORs for HRQoL, the AR +/RS + group reported more problems in terms of self-care (OR, 3.73, p = 0.038) and more pain/discomfort (OR 2.19, p = 0.006) compared with the AR-/RS- group. Conclusions: In the Korean population, AR and RS exerted a synergistic negative impact on mental health and HRQoL, especially suicidal ideation. Most patients seek help from clinicians for impaired HRQoL. Therefore, clinicians should consider the underlying mental health and HRQoL of patients with AR and/or RS, as these may be impaired by their conditions.

177,"Impact of physical or sexual childhood abuse on plasma DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol in a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test and on cardiovascular risk parameters in adult patients with major depression or anxiety disorders","While the impact of childhood trauma on basal and dynamic cortisol regulation has widely been studied, the most abundant steroid hormones dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated derivative DHEA-S have received little attention in this context. One-hundred in-door patients suffering from major depression or an anxiety disorder filled in the Childhood Trauma Questionaire. A low dose dexamethasone suppression test (DST) measuring DHEA, DHEA-S and cortisol was performed. Furthermore, various cardiovascular risk parameters were measured. Forty-six percent of the patients reported a history of substantial physical or sexual childhood abuse. However, no significant differences in plasma DHEA or DHEA-S emerged in the DST between the traumatised group and the remaining patients. Basal plasma cortisol was significantly lower in the childhood trauma group. No impact of childhood trauma history on cardiovascular risk factor profile was detected. Current limited data about DHEA or DHEA-S in patients with childhood trauma are equivocal. Further study using more sophisticated assessment of trauma history and simultaneously measuring a multitude of putative biomarkers of traumatization are needed.

178,Psychological and electrophysiological indices of inattention in hoarding,"Individuals with elevated hoarding symptoms report elevated symptoms of ADHD and these symptoms are related to impaired daily functioning. Neuropsychological studies have found specific deficits in attention, and a recent review of attentional data from numerous hoarding studies concluded that inattention likely represents an etiological factor in hoarding, rather than a comorbidity. Our study aimed to examine which symptoms of ADHD, inattention or hyperactivity, are related to hoarding symptom severity, and whether individuals with hoarding symptoms display a neurophysiological marker of poor attention (Theta/Beta Ratio; THBR) that might explain these associations. The THBR indexes theta power relative to beta power in the frontal cortex and is often atypical in individuals with ADHD. We hypothesised that individuals would report more severe problems with inattention and would exhibit an elevated theta/beta ratio relative to a healthy control group. We also predicted that any relationship between hoarding and inattention would be independent of anxiety and depression symptoms. 17 hoarding-symptomatic participants and 16 healthy control participants completed self-report measures relating to ADHD, hoarding and general psychopathology, and then underwent resting measures of electroencephalography (EEG). Individuals with hoarding symptoms reported greater difficulties with inattention and hyperactivity, however they did not exhibit an elevated theta/beta ratio. When taking into account recent anxiety and depression, only inattention predicted hoarding symptom severity. Further investigations may help clarify this association and help inform attention-based treatments for hoarding.

179,"Expressed emotion, emotional distress, and individual and familial history of affective disorder among parents of adolescents with bipolar disorder","Parental expressed emotion (EE) attitudes are important prognostic indicators in the course of bipolar disorder (BD) in adolescents and adults. This study examined the hypothesis that parents’ own susceptibility to affective disturbances contributes to their likelihood of high-EE attitudes. We examined past-week levels of emotional distress, lifetime affective diagnoses, and family histories of affective disorder among high- and low-EE parents of 86 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder who were recovering from an episode of depression or (hypo) mania. High EE parents endorsed higher concurrent levels of depression, anxiety, and anger/hostility than low EE parents, and reported a greater familial history of depression and BD. No differences between high and low EE parents were found in concurrent levels of interpersonal sensitivity, lifetime rates of affective disorders, or familial loading of anxiety disorder. Parents’ distress at the time of the EE assessment was the strongest correlate of EE. The results suggest that susceptibility to affective psychopathology may be an important contributor to the development of EE attitudes among parents of adolescents with BD.

180,Mindful attention moderating the effect of experiential avoidance in terms of mental health among Latinos in a federally qualified health center,"The present study examined the moderating role of mindful attention in the relation between experiential avoidance and anxious arousal, social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the number of mood and anxiety disorders among a sample of Latinos seeking health services at a primary care facility. Participants included 326 adult Latinos ( M age = 39.79 years, SD = 11.27; 88.9% female; 98.2% used Spanish as their first language). Results provided empirical evidence of an interaction between mindful attention and experiential avoidance for anxious arousal, social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the number of mood and anxiety disorders in the studied sample. Specifically, among Latinos with lower (vs higher) levels of mindfulness, greater experiential avoidance was related to greater anxiety/depressive symptoms and number of mood and anxiety disorders. Together, these data provide novel empirical evidence of the clinically relevant interplay between mindful attention and experiential avoidance regarding a relatively wide array of negative emotional symptoms and disorders among Latino primary care patients. Limitations of the study include a largely female sample and cross-sectional data.

181,On continuum beliefs and psychiatric stigma: Similarity to a person with schizophrenia can feel too close for comfort,"Continuum belief interventions that blur boundaries between “normal” individuals and individuals with psychiatric problems have shown promise in reducing psychiatric stigma. Interventions to date have afforded participants considerable psychological distance from individuals with mental illness. An intervention that compels psychological closeness to individuals with mental illness may lead to increased anxiety/threat and an attenuated intervention effect on stigma. In a randomized experiment, one hundred thirty-five participants listened to a bogus interview involving an ostensible person with schizophrenia who shared numerous characteristics in common with participants. In the interview, the target person (1) did not verbally broach issues of similarity to “normal” people, (2) endorsed a continuum view, or (3) endorsed a categorical view. Participants then read a bogus research article on schizophrenia that (1) was agnostic with respect to the continuum/categorical distinction, (2) attested to a continuum view, or (3) attested to a categorical view. Correlational analyses demonstrated that greater endorsement of continuum beliefs predicted less stigma. Experimental analyses demonstrated that the continuum intervention had no effect on stigma. The continuum intervention increased participants’ feelings of anxiety/threat, measured via self-report and a lexical decision task. These findings might usefully inform the design of stigma reduction programming centered on continuum beliefs.

182,Does mindfulness help people adapt to the experience of hearing voices?,"Mindfulness-based interventions show promise in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. From a theoretical perspective, there may be several benefits of mindfulness for individuals who experience hearing voices. Related cross-sectional findings suggest mindfulness may protect against distress, disruption, negative beliefs, dysfunctional relational style and responding, and mood symptoms for individuals who hear voices. To extend on previous findings, this study aimed to identify whether mindful relating to voices predicted voice-related negative impacts (distress, disruption and resistance), when the influence of voice-topography and mood symptoms were controlled for. Overall, 62 participants with a psychotic disorder who had experienced hearing voices in the previous week were given the Southampton Mindfulness of Voices Questionnaire, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales, Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. As predicted, greater mindfulness of voices predicted less voice-related distress and lower resistance to voices. Regression analyses revealed that when associated voice topography and mood symptoms were controlled for, mindful relating to voices explained a significant proportion of variance in voice-related distress and resistance. Conversely, mindfulness of voices did not significantly predict voice-related disruption. In the context of existing literature, these findings suggest further mindfulness-based protocols for persistent voices should be developed and trialled.

183,Increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels predict severity of depression after six months of follow-up in outpatients with major depressive disorder,"Previous studies have reported dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Outpatients diagnosed with MDD ( n = 199) underwent psychological evaluation, and were followed up with a phone interview after 6 months, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). At 6-month follow-up, 59 out of 199 patients with MDD were still depressed (29.5%), as shown by scores ≥ 10 on the PHQ-9. The depressed group at follow-up showed significantly higher anxiety and suicidality levels at baseline than the non-depressed group at follow-up. Among the complete blood counts, lipid profiles, and hormone levels, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was the only parameter that was significantly increased in the still depressed group. Levels higher than 40 pg/mL of ACTH at baseline were associated with higher depression scores at follow-up. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that ACTH and cortisol predicted depression scores at follow-up, after controlling for baseline depression scores. Increased ACTH level at baseline may predict ongoing symptoms and severity of depression at follow-up, suggesting the role of dysfunctional HPA axis in MDD prognosis.

184,"Associations between negative life events and anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms: A cross-sectional study among Chinese male senior college students","The aims of this study were to explore the associations between negative life events and anxiety, depressive, and stress symptoms among male senior college students who experience negative life events in daily life. Data were obtained from 582 male senior college students recruited from universities in Chongqing China. Participants completed the Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Socio-demographic information, lifestyle information, and a blood sample were acquired. 39 (6.7%), 74 (12.7%), and 39 (6.7%) subjects were depressed, anxious, and stressed, respectively. The results confirmed that negative life events were positively related to mental health problems. Different types of negative life events had their specific associations with being depressed, anxious, or stressed. With respect to different types of negative life events, subjects with more “interpersonal relationship” related problems had a higher probability of being anxious and stressed; whereas, subjects with more “change for adaptation” related problems had a higher probability of being depressed and anxious. These results indicate that more concerns over the events with both high occurrence rate and severity might be helpful to mental health prevention and promotion for senior college students.

185,Correlations between TSIA and TAS-20 and their relation to self-reported negative affect: A study using a multi-method approach in the assessment of alexithymia in a nonclinical sample from Italy,"The 20 item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) has been set as the golden standard in assessing alexithymia despite its limitation due to its self-report structure. Overcoming this bound is the main reason that in 2006 brought Bagby, Taylor and Parker to develop the Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia (TSIA): a structured interview composed of 24 questions with the purpose of assessing four dimensions of alexithymia: Identifying emotional feelings (DIF), Describing emotional feelings (DDF), Imaginal processes (IMP), and Externally oriented thinking (EOT). The present study aimed to confirm the validity of the TSIA in the assessment of alexithymia, using internal consistency (alpha) and convergent validity (comparing TSIA and TAS-20). Since it has been demonstrated an association between alexithymia, measured with the TAS-20, and negative affect, an additional goal was to evaluate the correlation of TSIA with two measures of depression and anxiety (BDI-II and STAI-Y2). Our results showed a significant capability of the TSIA in assessing alexithymia while clearing the limitation of the TAS-20 in keeping aside partially overlapping construct such as depression and anxiety. The final suggestion is that a reliable assessment of alexithymia might come from the application of both a self-report and an observer-rated instrument.

186,Trait anxiety is associated with a decreased visual working memory capacity for faces,"Recent work has suggested that anxiety restricts working memory capacity, which may underlie a wide range of cognitive symptoms in anxiety. However, previous literature on the anxiety-visual working memory association yielded mixed results, with some studies demonstrating an anxiety-related increase in visual working memory capacity. In an attempt to gain a more thorough understanding of the relationship between anxiety and visual working memory maintenance function, the current study examined the influence of trait anxiety on visual working memory capacity and resolution for negative, positive, and neutral faces in a large unselected sample, by conducting two different experiments. Experiment 1 used a change-detection task to estimate visual working memory capacity, while Experiment 2 used a modified time-delay estimation task to measure memory precision. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the relationship between trait anxiety, emotional valence, and visual working memory. Results showed that trait anxiety was associated with decreased visual working memory capacity for faces in a valence-independent manner, whereas anxiety-related change in visual working memory resolution was not significant. This pattern of results was discussed in light of the theories of anxiety and visual working memory (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
187,Behavioral inhibition system and self-esteem as mediators between shyness and social anxiety,"Shyness has been demonstrated to be an important factor associating with social anxiety. However, it is less clear on the mechanisms responsible for such association. The aim of the present study was to examine whether behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and self-esteem mediated the relationship between shyness and social anxiety. A sample of 521 healthy volunteers in the age range of 18–25 years completed self-report measures of BIS, self-esteem, shyness and social anxiety. Our correlational analyses showed that shyness was positively associated with social anxiety, supporting the overlapping and continuum hypotheses. Furthermore, BIS was positively correlated with shyness and social anxiety while self-esteem was negatively related to them, indicating that BIS and self-esteem were different in the relation between shyness and social anxiety. Importantly, results from structural equation modeling revealed that the relation between shyness and social anxiety was partially mediated by BIS and self-esteem, which suggested that they might play important roles in the relation between shyness and social anxiety.

189,Validity and clinical utility of DSM and prototype diagnosis for depressive and anxiety spectrum disorders in predicting adaptive functioning,"Prototype matching, which involves comparing a patient clinical presentation with a prototype description of the disorder, addresses some of the clinical limitations of categorical approaches. Most research to-date on prototype matching has been conducted with personality disorders. Here, we examined the validity and clinical utility of prototype diagnosis for mood and anxiety disorders. We compared clinicians prototype diagnosis (based on DSM IV and empirically derived) to categorical diagnosis (based on independent SCID interview) in predicting patient global adaptive functioning rated across the clinician, patient and independent interviewer among N = 80 clinicians and N = 170 patients. Our findings show that prototype diagnosis (both one that is based on DSM criteria and empirically derived) demonstrates some incremental validity over and above the categorical DSM IV, in predicting patient's global adaptive functioning. This is particularly pronounced for mood disorders (MDD and dysthymia) as well as several anxiety disorders (OCD, social phobia) across a range of experience level of diagnosticians. Furthermore, clinicians rated the prototype matching approach as more useful in clinical practice compared with the binary categorical system. Using a dimensional approach, which is based on prototype matching that also preserves the advantages of categorical system offers a valid and efficient approach to psychiatric assessment.

190,CSF glutamate level decreases in heavy smokers and negatively correlates with BDI scores,"Glutamate is involved in mental disorders and nicotine addiction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate levels and mental status in Chinese heavy smokers. Participants comprised 41 non-smokers and 77 heavy smokers ( n = 118). Cerebrospinal fluid was extracted and glutamate levels were measured. We recorded age, years of education, BMI, the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). BIS action scores, total scores and BDI scores were significantly different between the groups. Partial correlation analyses with age and education years as covariates found that CSF glutamate levels negatively correlated with BDI scores, but did not correlate with SAS scores in heavy smokers. No correlation was found between CSF glutamate levels and BDI or SAS scores in non-smokers. In conclusion, heavy smokers had more impulsivity had lower levels of CSF glutamate and higher BDI scores. CSF glutamate levels negatively correlated with BDI scores in heavy smokers.

191,The association between schizotypal traits and social functioning in adolescents from the general population,"Difficulties in social functioning have been linked to schizotypy, which may reflect vulnerability to psychotic disorders. We investigated these links in early adolescence, a developmental stage when many mental illnesses first emerge. Using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences, we examined the association of peer-relationship problems and prosocial behavior with positive and negative schizotypy in a sample of 149 school children (70 girls, 79 boys) between 12 and 15 years old. The results showed that while increased positive schizotypy was significantly associated with increased peer-relationship problems, increased negative schizotypy was significantly associated with decreased prosocial behavior. These effects were observed after the potential effects of age, sex, general cognitive abilities, the ability to infer affective mental states, anxiety, and depression had been taken into account. These results suggest that different dimensions of schizotypy are associated with different aspects of social dysfunction in adolescents. Interventions aimed at improving social functioning in adolescence would benefit from considering these unique associations.

The study was performed on a database relative to 630 inpatients hospitalized with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Psychomotor agitation was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale—Excited Component (PANSS-EC). Prevalence of moderate and severe psychomotor agitation was 40.5% and 23.7%, respectively. Non-agitated patients were older, with longer illness history and duration of untreated psychosis, were more frequently on antipsychotic medication, had lower incidence of recent use of substances, and functioned better before the index hospitalization than moderately and/or severely agitated patients. Non-agitated patients had lower scores for total PANSS and Emsley's positive and anxiety dimensions. Compared with the severely agitated group, non-agitated and moderately agitated patients scored more in Emsley's depression dimension. Poor functioning before index hospital admission, higher scores for negative subscale and Emsley's positive dimension and use of substances exerted an effect on risk of psychomotor agitation.

Six hundred children with ADHD (mean age = 9.12 years), recruited from 2013 to 2017, participated in the study. A total of 96 (16%) children with ADHD displayed a comorbidity with GAD. ADHD + GAD were compared to 504 ADHD children without GAD in terms of cognitive and psychiatric profile, ADHD subtype and family psychiatric history. The ADHD + GAD, predominantly represented from ADHD combined (72.6%), displayed higher psychiatry comorbidity, in particular with depressive disorders, and were associated with higher rates of maternal depression, of ADHD in fathers, and bipolar disorders in second degree relatives. Moreover, younger preschool-primary school age children with ADHD + GAD showed significant higher frequency of depressive disorders versus younger preschool-primary children with ADHD without GAD. ADHD + GAD comorbidity represents a more complex clinical condition compared to ADHD without GAD, characterized by the higher frequency of multiple comorbidities and by a psychiatric family with higher rates of mood and disruptive disorders.

The aim of this meta-analysis a was to assess the weighted mean effect sizes of ToM performances in BPD compared to healthy controls (HC), and to investigate the effect of demographic variables and comorbidities on the variability of effect sizes across the studies. Seventeen studies involving 585 BPD patients and 501 HC were selected after literature search. Effect sizes for overall ToM, mental state decoding and reasoning, cognitive and affective ToM, and for task types were calculated. BPD patients significantly underperformed HC in overall ToM, mental state reasoning, and cognitive ToM, but had no deficits in mental state decoding. Affective ToM performance was largely task dependent in BPD. Comorbid anxiety disorders had a positive moderating effect on overall and affective ToM in BPD. Our results support the notion that BPD patients’ have specific ToM impairments. Further research is necessary to evaluate the role of confounding factors, especially those of clinical comorbidities, neurocognitive functions, and adverse childhood life events. Complex ToM tasks with high contextual demands seem to be the most appropriate tests to assess ToM in patients with BPD.

This study aims to explore the frequencies of NSSI as well as the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, and sleep problems among 889 Palestinian adolescents and young adults. The participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, PTSS, depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep difficulties. The results found that 13.8% of the total sample are frequently engaging in some form of NSSI behavior. Moreover, 43.1% exhibited severe symptoms of PTSD, and almost one-third of the sample reported severe symptoms of depression (30.1%); more than two-thirds of the sample (68.4%) experience sleep difficulties. Those who engage in NSSI were found to be at higher risk for sleep problems, depression, and PTSS. Avoidance/numbing, as well as hyperarousal symptoms clusters of PTSS, were significantly associated with NSSI above and beyond depressive symptoms. These results suggest that NSSI is frequently a sequelae of prolonged exposure to trauma and violence, and highlight the importance of routine assessment of this behavior. It is crucial to be familiar with the association between PTSS, sleep difficulties, and NSSI in a clinical setting to implement programs focusing on preventing these domains.

In this study, we defined anxiety attacks to refer to these phenomena and investigated their association with depression and suicide attempts. A total of 12,532 adults randomly selected population through the oneperson-per-household method completed a face-to-face interview using the Korean version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (K-CIDI). A total of 5.88% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks. Among them, 46.5% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations. ‘Anxiety attacks’ group reported more suicidal ideation, plan, and attempts, which were even higher frequencies in ‘anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations’ group than ‘anxiety attacks only with life-threatening situations’ group and showed stronger association with lifetime suicide attempts when it had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) (AOR = 9.69, 95%CI 5.90–15.90), compared with ‘never’ group. There was no association between each symptom of patients with anxiety attacks and their lifetime suicide attempt. In conclusion, the finding suggests that there are as many individuals who experience anxiety attacks without lifethreatening situations as those with life-threatening situations. And anxiety attacks appear to be relevant to an increased risk of suicide attempt, especially without life-threatening situations and with comorbid MDD.

199,Effects of post-exposure naps on exposure therapy for social anxiety,"Exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD) utilizes fear extinction, a memory process enhanced by sleep. We investigated whether naps following exposure sessions might improve symptoms and biomarkers in response to social stress in adults undergoing 5-week exposure-based group SAD therapy. Thirty-two participants aged 18–39 (18 females) with SAD were randomized. Before and after treatment, participants completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and underwent a Trier Social Stress Test with psychophysiological monitoring (mpTSST) that included skin conductance (SCL), electromyographic (EMG) and electrocardiographic recording, and an auditory startle procedure while anticipating the social stressor. At sessions 3 and 4, exposure was followed by either a 120-min polysomnographically monitored sleep opportunity (Nap, N = 17) or wakefulness (Wake, N = 15). Primary hypotheses about SAD symptom change (LSAS) and EMG blink-startle response failed to differ with naps, despite significant symptom improvement (LSAS) with therapy. Some secondary biomarkers, however, provided preliminary support for enhanced extinction learning with naps, with trend-level Time (pre-, post-treatment) × Arm interactions and significant reduction from pre- to post treatment in the Nap arm alone for mpTSST SCL and salivary cortisol rise. Because of the small sample size and limited sleep duration, additional well-powered studies with more robust sleep interventions are indicated.

The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and associated factors (with a focus on depression and cognition) in a national non-selected multicentric sample of community-dwelling SZ subjects (ii) to determine the rate of SZ patients being administered vitamin D supplementation and associated factors. Methods: A comprehensive 2 daylong clinical and neuropsychological battery was administered in 140 SZ subjects included between 2015 and 2017 in the national FondaMental Expert Center (FACE-SZ) Cohort. Hypovitaminosis D was defined by blood vitamin D level &lt; 25 nM. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale depressive subscore and current anxiety disorder by the Structured Clinical Interview for Mental Disorders. Results: Hypovitaminosis D has been found in 21.4% of the subjects and none of them had received vitamin D supplementation in the previous 12 months. In multivariate analysis, hypovitaminosis D has been significantly associated with respectively higher depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.18 [1.03–1.35], p = 0.02) and current anxiety disorder (aOR = 6.18 [2.15–17.75], p = 0.001), independently of age and gender. No association of hypovitaminosis D with respectively positive and negative symptoms, cognitive scores or other biological variables has been found (all p &gt; 0.05), however, a trend toward significance has been found for metabolic syndrome ( p = 0.06). Vitamin D supplementation has been administered during the previous 12 months in only 8.5% of the subjects but was associated with lower depressive symptoms (aOR = 0.67 [0.46–0.98], p = 0.04) and lower rate of current anxiety disorder (aOR = 0.06 [0.01–0.66], p = 0.02) compared to patients with hypovitaminosis D. Conclusion: Hypovitaminosis D is frequent and associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders in schizophrenia. Vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower depressive and anxiety symptoms, however patients with hypovitaminosis D remain insufficiently treated.

201,Posttraumatic stress disorder clusters and suicidal ideation,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. However, less is known about how the PTSD symptom clusters, namely alterations in arousal and reactivity (AAR), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM), avoidance, and intrusion, uniquely relate to suicidal ideation. This study aimed to characterize the associations among suicidal ideation and these symptom clusters. Methods: Study 1 ( n = 346) and Study 2 ( n = 194) included community members and treatment-seeking adults at an anxiety specialty clinic, respectively. Participants completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Results: In both studies, suicidal ideation significantly and positively correlated with all PTSD factors. In Study 1, Wald tests of parameter constraints indicated that NACM and AAR had the strongest associations with suicidal ideation, followed by intrusion and avoidance. Results were replicated when restricting the sample to individuals with probable PTSD. In Study 2, suicidal ideation significantly and positively correlated with all PTSD factors; there were no differences in the strength of the suicidal ideation-PTSD factors relations. Limitations: The studies were cross-sectional and relied on a single-item measure of suicidal ideation. Discussion: All PTSD factors significantly and positively correlated with suicidal ideation, and the NACM and AAR PTSD clusters were most strongly associated with suicidal ideation in Study 1. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious to thoroughly screen patients with elevations on these PTSD cluster scores for suicide risk.

202,The spark that might have ignited the fire: The association of cognitive and psychological factors with state anxiety in light of the Syrian-Israeli incident,"The current study aimed to explore Israelis' state anxiety due to a Syrian-Israeli incident that occurred on February 10, 2018, when an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Syrian air defense forces. In line with the ""looming vulnerability"" model which emphasizes the importance of the dynamic nature of psychologically threatening situations, the following psychological factors were suggested: associative memory of prior events, worries of future war, sense of safety, and death anxiety. We employed two cross-sectional points of time in our assessment: 36 hours and three months after the incident. Using an online survey, 162 adult participants were recruited in Study 1 and 172 in Study 2. The participants completed set of questionnaires measuring state anxiety along with other psychological measures. The results of the two studies suggested that higher levels of worry of future war and lower levels of sense of safety associated with higher state anxiety. The looming vulnerability model and variables associated with state anxiety were found to have a salient role in explaining state anxiety as a response to a negative unexpected event.

203,"Association of positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy dimensions with affective symptoms and experiences","Schizotypy offers a useful construct for investigating the etiology, development, and expression of schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology, as well as the comorbid expression of mood and anxiety disorders across the schizophrenia spectrum. The present study examined the associations of positive, negative, and disorganized schizotypy with affective symptoms and experiences in a sample of MTurk workers and college students ( n = 575). Participants completed the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale (MSS) and measures of depression, anxiety, social phobia, hypomanic traits, and state affect. As expected, positive schizotypy was significantly associated with hypomanic traits, whereas negative schizotypy was associated with reduced positive affect and reduced hypomanic traits. Although prior research has emphasized the association of positive schizotypy with depression and anxiety, the current results demonstrate that disorganized schizotypy is more strongly associated with elevated negative affect (over-and-above positive schizotypy). As such, these findings highlight the importance of examining disorganization of affect, in addition to the cognitive-behavioral deficits traditionally associated with disorganized schizotypy. Finally, the MSS and MSS-Brief demonstrated closely comparable findings. The present results provide further support for the construct validity of the MSS and the three-factor model of schizotypy.

204,Sex differences in an old adult sample with substance use disorder: A 6 months follow-up study,"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a worldwide concern that has its own particularities regarding age and sex. This study aims to assess the differences between old SUD women and men regarding socio-demographics, clinical factors and outcomes. A 6-months follow-up longitudinal study was conducted in an outpatient center, on a convenience sample of 115 SUD old adults (≥ 65 years old, average age of 71.57). Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. Data showed statistical significant differences between men and women related to sociodemographic variables (marital status, coexistence, criminal records and stress factors), medical and psychiatric conditions (women suffer higher rates of depression and anxiety, with worse health-related quality of life), family records (women had more presence of family psychiatric records) and SUD related parameters (men tend to use more alcohol, had an early onset, consume higher doses, report more craving and more tobacco life use while women had higher rates of prescription drugs use). At 6-month follow-up, the whole sample showed excellent rates of adherence and abstinence, without sex differences. The study points out sex differences on several sociodemographic and clinical variables, indicating their specific needs. This research could facilitate better approaches by considering a sex perspective in SUD old adults.

205,Neurocognitive deficits in a transdiagnostic clinical staging model,"There is a growing literature which suggests that neurocognitive deficits may be markers of susceptibility for serious mental illness development. This study assessed neurocognitive functioning in a sample of youth at risk of serious mental illness across different clinical stages as described by McGorry and colleagues and compared them to healthy controls. The sample was 243 male and female youths aged 12–26 and included: asymptomatic participants with psychiatric risk factors (Stage 0; n = 41); youth with early mood or anxiety symptoms (Stage 1a; n = 52); youth with attenuated psychiatric syndromes (Stages 1b; n = 108); and healthy controls ( n = 42). The neurocognitive battery included IQ measures and the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery. Participants in Stage 1b had lower scores than healthy controls on the composite score of neurocognitive performance, across all IQ measures, and in the domains of processing speed, working memory, attention and problem solving. They also had lower scores than subjects in Stage 0 across most IQ measures and in the domains of processing speed and working memory. This study increases what is known about neurocognitive performance associated with different stages of serious mental illness development.

206,Exploring the role of the DSM-5 performance-only specifier in adolescents with social anxiety disorder,"The DSM-5 social anxiety disorder section has recently added the performance-only specifier for individuals whose anxiety is limited to speaking or performing in public. The impact of the DSM-5 performance-only specifier remains a neglected area. The sample comprised 44 healthy controls and 50 adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of SAD (20% met criteria for the performance-only specifier). Findings revealed that adolescents with the specifier had a later age of onset; lower levels of depression, social anxiety symptomatology and clinical severity; and a lesser degree of comorbidity relative to adolescents with SAD but excluding the performance-only specifier. Specifiers only evidenced higher (cognitive) social anxiety symptomatology compared to healthy controls. Results of this study also suggested that the performance-only specifier may correspond to a mild form of social anxiety disorder. Data also revealed that SAD exists on a continuum of severity among healthy controls, specifier participants, and those with both interactional and performance fears, which is consistent with a dimensional structure for SAD. Finally, findings suggested a unique comorbid pattern for specifiers and those adolescents with SAD but excluding the performance-only specifier. The implications of these findings for the etiology, assessment, classification, and treatment of social anxiety in youth are discussed.

207,A 12-month study of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Clinical characterization and different subtypes proposal,"Social withdrawal is a new mental health problem increasingly common, present in different cultures, whose psychopathology and treatment is not yet established. This study aims to determine the socio-demographic and clinical features and possible clinical subtypes that predict the 12-month outcomes of cases with hikikomori syndrome, a severe form of social withdrawal. Socio-demographic and clinical data at baseline were analysed as well as data obtained for 12 months after at-home treatment in 190 cases. The inclusion criteria were: spending all time at home, avoiding social situations and relationships, significant deterioration due to social isolation, with a minimum duration of 6 months. Six major diagnostic groups were identified: affective, anxiety, psychotic, drug use, personality and other Axis I disorders. The anxiety-affective subgroup demonstrated lower clinical severity, but worse evolution. Less than half of the cases were available for medical follow-up at 12-months. Subjects undergoing intensive treatment had a higher medical follow-up rate and better social networks at 12-months. Therefore, our findings provide data to reach consensus on the specific characteristics of social isolation hikikomori syndrome. The analysis demonstrated the fragility and tendency to relapse and have disengagement, particularly relevant in the anxiety-affective subgroup, suggesting that intensive treatments are more effective.

208,Depression with or without comorbid social anxiety: Is attachment the culprit?,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently co-occurs with social anxiety disorder (SAD), and their comorbidity (MDD-SAD) increases clinical severity and functional impairment. Still, the specific psychological vulnerabilities of individuals with MDD-SAD are poorly understood. Individual attachment characteristics develop early in life through interactions with primary caregivers, and tend to persist throughout life. Early trauma can worsen attachment insecurity, increasing the risk for future anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study is to examine differences in individual attachment and history of trauma in depressed individuals with or without comorbid SAD and controls. One hundred sixty-two participants were categorized into three groups based on SCID-I interview: healthy controls (HC), individuals with current MDD without SAD (MDD), and individuals with current MDD comorbid with SAD (MDD-SAD). MDD-SAD group had significantly greater attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance compared to the MDD and HC groups. MDD-SAD group had greater clinician-rated depression severity and dysfunction compared to MDD group. In summary, the study further supports the clinical risks associated with MDD-SAD and suggests that insecure attachment might represent an associated vulnerability and a possible pathway which warrants further research and clinical attention.

209,"Worry, anxiety sensitivity, and electronic cigarettes among adults","Although electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is now a common substance use behavior, there is little understanding of the individual difference factors related to e-cigarette use beliefs and dependence. The present investigation sought to test a theoretically-driven model of anxiety sensitivity as an explanatory element in a worry-e-cigarette beliefs and dependence model. Participants included 558 adult e-cigarette users (51.4% female; 35.2 years, SD = 10.1) who were nationally recruited via an online survey system. Participants completed a single survey that assessed their mood and e-cigarette behavior and beliefs. Results supported a statistically significant indirect pathway for worry in relation to perceived benefits of e-cigarettes, e-cigarette positive outcome expectancies, and e-cigarette dependence via anxiety sensitivity; effect sizes were small. The indirect effects were evident when accounting for several theoretically relevant covariates (sex, income, education, concurrent cigarette use, and neuroticism). This study provides the first empirical evidence of the role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between worry and e-cigarette use beliefs and behavior, which may represent a novel intervention target.

210,Association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in general adult populations: An analysis of the dose-response relationship,"This study explored the magnitude and clinical correlates of anxiety in three groups of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD): those with comorbid anxiety disorders (the COM group), those with subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms that are the screening items for anxiety disorders on the MINI (the SUB group), and those with neither anxiety disorders nor subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms (the NON group). Anxiety symptomatology of 1052 patients from 8 psychiatric settings in mainland China, who met DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, was assessed using the MINI. The presence of core anxiety symptoms was determined by patient endorsement of any screening item of panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalences of comorbid subthreshold core anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders were 13% and 28.7%, respectively. The SUB and COM cases showed similar patterns of clinical presentation. Both were more likely than the NON cases to be characterized by younger age, concurrent dysthymia and OCD, suicidal ideation and attempted suicides. These findings highlight the importance of assessing both anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in the presence of MDD, and suggest the need for novel assessments capable of addressing different levels of anxiety in depressed patients.

211,Testing the exacerbation and attenuation hypotheses of the role of anxiety in the relation between ADHD and reactive/proactive aggression: A 10-year longitudinal study,"Both anxiety and aggression commonly co-occur with ADHD symptoms. Two competing hypotheses describing the role of anxiety in aggression associated with ADHD symptoms have previously been advanced. The exacerbation hypothesis proposes that the presence of anxiety increases the risk of aggression in the context of ADHD symptoms. The attenuation hypothesis proposes that the presence of anxiety protects against aggression in the context of ADHD symptoms. We tested these hypotheses using moderated cross-lagged panel models in the Zurich project on social development from childhood to adulthood (z-proso) sample using both self-report (3 waves) and informant-report (8 waves) data spanning ages 7–17. We found evidence that anxiety protects against both reactive and proactive aggression; however, the effect was direct: there was no evidence for anxiety moderating the strength of ADHD symptom-aggression links. Results suggest that anxiety likely plays an important role in inhibiting aggression but does not interact with ADHD symptoms in the manner predicted by either the exacerbation or attenuation hypothesis.

212,Refinement of anxiety sensitivity measurement: The Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI),"Anxiety sensitivity, defined as the fear of anxiety and arousal-related sensations, has been among the most influential cognitive-based transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factors in the study and treatment of emotional and related disorders. The currently available anxiety sensitivity measures are limited by their length. Specifically, the length of these instruments discourages the adoption of routine anxiety sensitivity assessment in clinical or medical settings (e.g., primary care). The goals of this study were to develop and assess the validity and reliability of a short version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007), entitled the Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI), using three independent clinical samples. Results indicated that the abbreviated five-item version of the SSASI had good internal consistency and a robust association with the ASI-3. Further, across the samples, there was evidence of unidimensionality and excellent convergent and discriminant validity. There also was evidence of partial measurement invariance across sex and full measurement invariance across time. Overall, the five-item scale offers a single score that can be employed to measure anxiety sensitivity. Use of the SSASI may facilitate screening efforts and symptom tracking for anxiety sensitivity, particularly within clinical settings where practical demands necessitate the use of brief assessment instruments.

213,Normal cholesterol levels in the immediate postpartum period: A risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms?,"We aimed to ascertain if cholesterol levels within the reference standards for healthy non-pregnant women are a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. During the first week after delivery, total cholesterol levels of 120 new mothers were measured and their mood state was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Two weeks before delivery, mothers’ personal and family history of mood disturbances was assessed with the Maternal History of Mood Disturbances (MHMD) scale. Only 26 (22%) of the new mothers had normal cholesterol levels (≤ 200 mg/dL). Mothers with normal levels did not differ on psychometric measures from those with high levels. However, in the subgroup of mothers with normal cholesterol, those with lower levels experienced more symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue and scored higher on the MHMD scale. In the larger group of mothers with high cholesterol levels, history of mood disturbances and postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms were not correlated with total cholesterol. Measuring cholesterol levels in the peripartum can be useful to identify a subgroup of women with naturally low cholesterol levels and an increased risk for postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms.

215,"Domain-specific associations between disability and depression, anxiety, and somatization in primary care patients","This study explores the associations between different disability domains and the most prevalent symptoms of mental disorders in primary care patients (i.e. depression, anxiety, and somatization). A total of 1241 participants from 28 primary care centres completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and somatization. This same sample also completed the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) to assess functional impairment in work, social life, and family life domains. Associations between the symptoms and each disability domain were examined using hierarchical regression analyses. Depression emerged as the strongest predictor of all three disability domains. Somatization was associated only with the work domain, and anxiety was associated only with the family life domain. Clinical symptoms explained a greater proportion of the variance than sociodemographic variables. In primary care patients, depression, anxiety and somatizations were associated with distinct domains of disability. Early provision of effective treatments in the primary care setting may be crucial to reduce the societal burden of common mental disorders.

Thus, to detail the understanding of the relationship between sleep quality and mental health, our study aims to assess the relationship between each component of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and depression, anxiety and stress. Also, we intend to analyse the moderating effects of gender, age and country on these relationships. The instruments PSQI and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were applied to a non-clinical population of 1552 participants from three different countries (Portugal, Spain and Brazil), aged over 18 years old. We estimated a multivariate regression model with AMOS Graphic 21.0 to test the seven proposed research hypotheses. The adjusted model explains 14.0%, 21.0% and 19.3% of the variances of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The conclusion of this study demonstrates that, with the exception of subjective sleep quality, all the other six components of the PSQI individually relate to mental health in nonclinical populations and that country is a significant moderator of these relationships.

217,The relationship between paternal prenatal depressive symptoms with postnatal depression: The PATH model,"The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between men's prenatal and postnatal depressive symptom (PDS). In a descriptive study, 403 fathers meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled using Poisson random sampling method from public health clinics in Zanjan, Iran. All participants were selected in the third trimester of pregnancy and were followed up eight weeks after childbirth. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen the participants for depressive symptoms. Data was analyzed using descriptive test, Path analysis at a confidence level of 95%. Results showed that the effect of the prenatal depressive symptoms on PDS had perfect good fitness indices. A high level of prenatal depressive symptoms predicted a high level of PDS. We found significant total mediating effects of state, trait, and total anxiety on PDS. The total moderating effect of income on PDS was not statistically significant. These results suggest that a high level of prenatal depressive symptoms is a risk factor for a high level of PDS. Therefore, health providers should pay more attention to the psychological health of fathers during the pre and postpartum period. The predictor factors should be considered in both intervention and clinical assessment of paternal PDS.

In Study 2, a clinical sample of individuals with BDD ( N = 50) reported higher disgust propensity compared to mentally healthy controls ( N = 36). This finding remained significant when controlling for depression and anxiety. Findings are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate a relationship between disgust propensity and BDD symptoms and provide directions for future research exploring the role of disgust in BDD.

Hypervigilance in social anxiety disorder,"The vast majority of research on attentional biases to threat focusses on selective attention, even though several cognitive-behavioral models furthermore assume hypervigilance to be important in this regard. Thus, the current study examined hypervigilance in trait and state social anxiety. We analyzed visual scanpath lengths and fixation counts of participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) ( n = 61) and healthy controls ( n = 60) in a combined visual search and eye tracking paradigm, including photographs of facial expressions. Half of all participants were randomly assigned to a state anxiety induction. Interaction effects revealed opposed attentional patterns of participants with SAD as compared to healthy controls considering overall visual scanpath lengths ( F (1,117) = 5.32, p = 0.023, η² partial = 0.043) and fixation counts ( F (1,117) = 5.10, p = 0.026, η² partial = 0.042). Accordingly, participants with SAD showed signs of hypervigilance in the anxiety induction condition. In contrast, there was no main effect of diagnostic group, indicating that individuals with SAD shift their attentional focus to broad scanning behavior only under conditions of threat. Our results add to the small number of existing studies on hypervigilance in SAD and suggest the topic to be promising for future research.

This study examined the differences in affect-related psychological variables among BMI classes. A total of 134 adults seeking treatment for obesity and 124 controls completed a set of questionnaires to assess: trait emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, anxiety, depression, binge eating behaviors and happiness. Correlations and multivariate analysis of variance were run per each study variable controlling for BMI class (normal weight, overweight, or obesity class I, II, III). Individuals with obesity class III were characterized by reduced trait emotional intelligence and happiness, and a higher tendency to use emotion suppression compared to normal weight individuals. All individuals with obesity also showed higher levels of depression and binge eating behaviors compared to both normal weight and overweight adults. Depression and emotion suppression were the most relevant discriminant factors across BMI classes, while trait emotional intelligence resulted as an important psychological factor clustering individual differences between obese and non-obese individuals. These results suggest that more attention to the affective domain of psychological functioning is needed for proper and comprehensive treatment of obesity.

The study was conducted with online survey among 1010 volunteered participants of university students and/or amateur or professional gamers. Scale scores were higher among the group with high probability of ADHD ( n = 190, 18.8%). In linear regression analysis, both Inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions of ADHD were related with the severity of IA symptoms, together with depression and non-accept dimension of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Similarly, presence of probable ADHD was related with the severity of IA symptoms in ANCOVA, together with depression, neuroticism and non-accept dimension of DERS. Participants were two different groups of nonclinical samples and all scales were self-rated. Also common comorbidities were not screened. Finally, since this study is cross-sectional the findings of this study cannot address the causal relationships among the primary constructs of interest. These findings suggest that the presence of probable ADHD is related with the severity of IA symptoms, together with the difficulties in emotion regulation, particularly non-accept dimension, depression and neuroticism among young adults.

The aim of this study was twofold: to identify different cluster solutions across functional profiles of school refusal behavior (I. Avoidance of Negative Affectivity, II. Escape from Social and/or Evaluative Situations, III. Pursuit of Attention, and IV. Pursuit of Tangible Reinforcement) and to determine whether these profiles differ from each other based on dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. The sample consisted of 1582 Ecuadorian adolescents aged 12–18 years ( M = 14.83; SD = 1.86) who completed the School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised (SRAS-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Latent class analysis revealed three school refusal profiles: non-school refusal behavior, school refusal behavior by tangible reinforcements, and school refusal behavior by multiple reinforcements. The last group displayed the most maladaptive profile and revealed highest mean scores on the three dimensions of the DASS-21 compared to other groups. To promote mental health in this group it is a necessary goal due to their link with these negative emotional states. Prevention measures to strengthen emotional self-regulation should be considered in these cases.

223,Reduced heart rate variability in a treatment-seeking early psychosis sample,"Reduced cardiac autonomic function is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with heart rate variability (HRV) providing an accessible index of cardiac autonomic function. HRV may provide a candidate physiological mechanism linking reduced cardiac autonomic function to increased risk for CVD in schizophrenia illness. This study examines whether HRV is also reduced in a community sample of treatment-seeking participants experiencing early psychosis ( n = 48) compared to healthy volunteers ( n = 48) and social anxiety control groups ( n = 48) matched by gender and age. HRV was assessed during a five-minute interbeat interval recording at rest. Participants also completed self-report psychiatric symptom measures. Early psychosis participants showed significant reductions in HRV compared to social anxiety and healthy control groups. Reductions in HRV were also observed in early psychosis participants taking anticholinergic medications compared to both control groups taking cardio-benign medications or who were non-medicated. Lastly, whether or not early psychosis participants were taking anticholinergic medications was not associated with reductions in HRV. Findings provide preliminary evidence that early psychosis is associated with reduced HRV. This study supports further research with larger sample sizes to precisely determine the influence of anticholinergic drugs on HRV in early psychosis populations.

Since suicide attempts are considered the strongest predictor of suicide completion, it is valuable to identify adolescents with a high suicide attempt risk. This study aimed to develop a decision tree model for the interactive prediction of high suicide attempt risk in Chinese adolescents. A classification tree analysis was conducted in a sample of senior high school students ( N = 6,686) based on the CRUISE program. The results indicated that depression, anxiety, social support, gender, self-esteem, family cohesion and adaptability were significant predictors of high suicide attempt risk, and interactions among these predictors constructed a hierarchical decision tree model. The tree model offered a series of reliable rules to identify Chinese adolescents with high suicide attempt risk, for example, adolescents with high depression scores had the highest probability (69.22%) of having a suicide attempt, female adolescents with low social support and low depression scores had the second highest probability (57.58%), and adolescents with low anxiety, low family adaptability, and medium depression scores had the third highest probability (55.77%). These exploratory findings suggested that different screening criteria are needed to detect at-risk Chinese adolescents with different severities of depression.

225,The anxiolytic-like effects of estazolam on a PTSD animal model,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric disorder. Estazolam has been shown to produce anxiolytic-, hypnotic-, amnestic-, and sedative-like effects. However, few studies are concerned about its anti- PTSD-like effects. The anti-PTSD-like effects of estazolam were evaluated by single prolonged stress animal model. After exposure to single prolonged stress, rats (Sprague-Dawley, male, 8 weeks) were administered by estazolam (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) from day 2 to 13 once daily. The behavioral assessments were performed during treatment with drugs. After the behavioral evaluation, the role of allopregnanolone in the anti-PTSD-like effects of estazolam was also evaluated via astrocyte cells and brain tissues (e.g. prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala). The PTSD-like behavioral deficits were significantly blocked by estazolam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) without affecting locomotor activity. Consistently, the levels on allopregnanolone were increased by estazolam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The levels of allopregnanolone were increased by sertraline (1 μmoL/L) and estazolam (4 μmoL/L), while the effects were antagonized by trilostane (1 μmoL/L) and finasteride (1 μmoL/L) in astrocyte cells, respectively.

226,The prevalence of diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder and associated comorbidities: A population-based Canadian study,"The objective of this study was to provide epidemiological data regarding obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in Canada, and examine related conditions, childhood experiences and healthcare utilization. A Statistics Canada population-based health survey was utilized (N = 25,097). The prevalence of diagnosed OCD in Canada was 0.93% (95% CI 0.75–1.11). People with OCD were younger and more likely to have lower incomes. They were more likely to have mood disorders including depression and bipolar disorder (both diagnosed conditions and by screening), and generalized anxiety disorder. The diagnosis of OCD was also associated with alcohol dependence and substance abuse and dependence. Negative childhood experiences were more common in people with OCD, with 72.33%(95% CI 62.25%–82.41%) of people with OCD having experienced some form of childhood maltreatment. Healthcare utilization was more frequent in people with OCD, but they were also more likely to desire help but feel as if they did not receive it. The higher proportion of people with OCD reporting not receiving the care they needed may reveal a crucial gap in treatment and available resources.

227,"Interrelations among negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and low self-directedness, putative central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in cognitive, attachment and psychobiological personality theories","The present study examined the interrelations among negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and low self-directedness, to test if the central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in cognitive, attachment and psychobiological personality theories are integrated into negative self-image. The subjects were 410 healthy Japanese medical students and staff. Negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety and self-directedness were evaluated by the Brief Core Schema Scales, Experiences in Close Relationships and Temperament and Character Inventory, respectively. There were strong interrelations among the three factors. The present study suggests that the central constructs of depression vulnerabilities in the three theories are integrated into negative self-image.

228,Exploring anxiety in schizophrenia: New light on a hidden figure,"Anxiety is among the least studied features of schizophrenia, despite evidence of its significant impact on disease outcome. This work aims to investigate the anxiety construct in a sample of outpatients with schizophrenia, exploring the interplay of clinical, neurocognitive and social cognitive domains, as well as adverse childhood experiences and their relative contribute in determining anxiety. A forward stepwise regression model was performed on a sample of 68 outpatients with schizophrenia, to examine the predictive effect of different variables on anxiety. Predictors have been selected based on previous literature and include psychopathological, neurocognitive and social cognitive measures, as well as premorbid environmental factors. The analysis showed a significant contribution of childhood adverse experiences, followed by personal distress, while no significant effect was found for symptom's severity, nor global cognitive efficiency. The results show that anxiety is mainly determined by early environmental factors, as well as by socio-cognitive dimensions, such as personal distress. Data also suggest that anxiety can be considered as an independent construct, rather than as a mere epiphenomenon of the illness. The study has clinical implications as it highlights the importance of implementing both standardized assessments and group interventions specifically targeting anxiety in schizophrenia.

229,Towards a greater understanding of anxiety sensitivity across groups: The construct validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3,"The present study examined the factor structure, invariance properties, reliability, and validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3, Taylor et al., 2007). Participants were recruited from a large, ethnically diverse southwestern university ( n = 3651; 77.8% female; M age = 22.06 years; 28% non-Hispanic White). Findings supported a bifactor structure for the ASI-3, which demonstrated measurement invariance across sex, race/ethnicity, age, and sexual minority status. Furthermore, the ASI-3 demonstrated strong reliability and validity, with the anxiety sensitivity general and specific factors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns) evidencing unique patterns of relations with symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxious arousal, and social anxiety. Clinically, these findings generally support the validity of the ASI-3 in measuring anxiety sensitivity across sex, age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status. Future work is needed to better understand the role anxiety sensitivity plays within specific demographic subgroups, particularly African–Americans, Asian Americans, and sexual minorities.

230,Anger rumination and unjust world beliefs moderate the association between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms,"Several studies have found a positive relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or anxiety. However, relatively little research has investigated factors that might moderate this association. The present study aimed to examine the moderating role of anger rumination, unjust world beliefs and perceived social support in the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and psychiatric symptoms across different victim groups. A total of 1,500 participants (57.9% male, M age = 28.9 years, SD = 8.7) were recruited using an online questionnaire. According to the results, 29.8% of participants reported being bullied online during the past year. Results also indicated that cyberbullying victims but not bully-victims with a tendency to ruminate on past anger episodes and strong unjust world beliefs are more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms. These findings point to the differences between victims and bully-victims in the mechanisms underlying the victimization–psychiatric symptoms association, and highlight the importance of emotion regulation and just world beliefs in preserving and enhancing psychological well-being in those individuals who had been bullied online.

231,Attachment and medically unexplained somatic symptoms: The role of mentalization,"Previous research has found an association between insecure attachment and increased somatization in adults. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. In the present study, we examined whether the association between attachment insecurity and somatization in psychiatric patients diagnosed with medically unexplained somatic symptoms (MUSS) is mediated by mentalization deficits. Attachment security of 58 outpatients diagnosed with MUSS was measured with the Experiences in Social Relationships Questionnaire (ECR). Difficulty with understanding own emotions was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20. In addition, others’ mental state comprehension was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Somatic symptom severity experienced by MUSS patients was related to attachment anxiety and alexithymia. These associations remained significant after controlling for sex, age, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Moreover, alexithymia mediated the association between anxious attachment and severity of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom severity was also related to better RMET performance, although this association was not significant after controlling for sex, age, medication use, and depressive symptoms. Our findings may indicate that individuals with an anxious attachment style have difficulties in clarifying own emotions. This may in turn result in somatic experience of emotional distress and risk for development of MUSS.

232,"Relationship between economic stress factors and stress, anxiety, and depression: Moderating role of social support","The economic crisis had a detrimental impact on the economies of several European countries, namely in Portugal. The literature emphasizes that periods of economic turmoil potentiate the appearance of mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and decrease populations’ well-being. The present study, conducted in Portugal, was performed with a sample of 729 individuals, 33.9% males and 66.1% females, with an average age of 36.99 years old. Its’ aim was to assess the relationship between economic stress factors (economic hardship, financial threat, and financial well-being) and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as to test the moderating effect of social support on this relationship. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships defined. When comparing the results obtained in the models without and with social support as a moderator, statistically significant differences were observed on the relationships between financial threat and depression and between economic hardship and stress, anxiety, and depression. Regarding the association between financial threat and stress and anxiety, the effect of the economic stressor decreased in the presence of social support, but the differences were not statistically significant. The implications of these results are discussed and strategies to foster social support are proposed.

233,Motor function in an animal model with ouabain-induced bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety behavior,"In a clinical setting, anxiety disorder is highly correlated with bipolar I disorder in humans. However, the comorbidity of anxiety behavior and bipolar disorder still remains unclear in an animal model. This study utilized an ouabain-induced animal model to examine anxiety and mania in an open field test. In the present study, 5 µl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or ouabain (10 −5 , 10 −4 , and 10 −3 M) were administered into the left ventricle. The animals’ motor functions and anxiety behaviors were measured for 15 min. The results showed that 10 −3 M ouabain significantly increased the animal's total distance traveled, average speed, and maximum speed compared to the control group. The time spent inside (i.e., how much time rats spent in the center of the square) and the inside-outside times of the central square (i.e., how many times rats ran across the center square) of the higher-concentration groups (10 −4 M and 10 −3 M) were significantly decreased. Therefore, a high concentration of ouabain may induce hyperactivity. The 10 −4 M and 10 −3 M ouabain groups exhibited more anxiety behaviors. The study is the first model to examine comorbid anxiety behaviors and bipolar disorder in an animal model. The study provides some insights for comorbid anxiety and bipolar disorder in clinics.

234,Prevalence and factors associated with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: A community sample of young adult women,"Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) was recently included in DSM-5 as a full diagnostic category. Few studies have investigated PMDD in a community sample of young adults, especially in Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the factors associated with PMDD in a community sample of 727 young adult women between the 18 and 24 years of age in southern Brazil. This was a cross-sectional population-based study. The data were collected from 2012 to 2014. PMDD was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (M.I.N.I. – Plus). The prevalence of PMDD was 17.6%. PMDD was significantly higher among older women, and in women from lower socio-economic status. A trend towards significance was found for women without a current occupation (study or work). The comorbidities significantly associated with PMDD were current major depression disorder, agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, current suicide risk, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and specific phobia. The high prevalence found in the present study should be interpreted considering a retrospective report. However, our data showed that clinicians should be alert for PMDD symptoms, especially among young adult women.

235,Prolonged grief and attachment security: A latent class analysis,"The death of a loved one has been associated with a wide range of mental health outcomes. Attachment theory is one of the primary paradigms for understanding bereavement outcome, yet there is comparatively little examination of the relationship between attachment style and bereavement responses. In this study we use Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups of bereaved individuals based on patterns of prolonged grief (PG) and major depression symptom co-occurrence in 285 bereaved individuals. We then explored the relationship between these subgroups and attachment anxiety and avoidance. Three new subgroups of individuals were identified: one showing high levels of PGD and depression (PGD/depression), one showing high depression (Depression), and one showing few symptoms (Low). Attachment anxiety significantly differentiated between the three groups; the highest levels of attachment anxiety predicted membership of the PGD/depression group, the lowest levels, membership of the Low group. Attachment avoidance was predictive of greater depressive symptoms, with higher levels of attachment avoidance differentiating the two symptom groups (PGD/depression and depression) from the Low symptom group. These findings underscore the relevance of insecure attachment style to the current understanding of PGD.

236,Prevalence of DSM-5 depressive disorders and comorbidity in Spanish early adolescents: Has there been an increase in the last 20 years?,"The aim of the study was to investigate the current prevalence of DSM-5 Depressive Disorders (DD) among Spanish school children and compare it with data obtained 20 years ago from the same place. We assessed comorbidity, severity and sociodemographic related factors. With a double-phase design, a sample of 1514 students participated in the 1st phase and 562 students (175 at risk of depression) were assessed in the 2nd phase with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Kids. The estimated current prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was 1.6%, similar to the 1.5% found 20 years ago. A total of 3.4% were diagnosed with some form of DD (MDD or Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)). No significant differences between genders were found in either of the two periods studied. The rate of depressive symptoms (11.6%) was not significantly different from that of previous data (9.4%). 80% and 71.9% of the children diagnosed with MDD and PDD respectively also had an anxiety disorder. In conclusion, we have not found an increase in depression among Spanish early adolescents. However, the data on the prevalence of DD, the comorbidity, and the impairment all highlight the need to design and implement appropriate preventive interventions in schools.

We used a two-stage procedure to elicit social anxiety symptoms (SAS) to diagnose SAD in 80 people with a schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorder (SZSPD) from an early intervention program. We observed a 28.8% lifetime prevalence of SAD when considering only the SAS elicited using the SCID probes (first stage), and a significant increase to 48.8% after adding the probes from the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (second stage). In conclusion, the LSAS can increase the sensitivity in detecting SAS and hence SAD comorbid to SZSPD.

However, little is known about the associations between anger and the development and progression of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGID). The study aim was to determine the associations between FGID and anger, anxiety, and depression. Participants in this cross-sectional observational study were 109 consecutive patients aged 18–64 years with FGID at Gastroenterology Clinic of Başkent University Hospital. A control group comprised of 96 individuals with no chronic gastrointestinal disorders recruited via snowball sampling. Sociodemographic and clinical information were obtained and participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2. FGID participants scored higher than controls on depression, anxiety, state anger, and anger expression-in. When the FGID group was divided into upper and lower gastrointestinal symptom groups, the lower symptom group showed higher anger expression-out scores than the upper symptom group. Anger may contribute to the etiology and development of FGID. This is the first study to demonstrate a significant psychological difference between individuals with lower and upper FGID. Interdisciplinary collaboration with gastroenterologists and psychiatrists could strengthen FGID evaluation and may improve treatment compliance.

239,Truck attack: Fear of ISIS and reminder of truck attacks in Europe as associated with psychological distress and PTSD symptoms,"Following an ISIS attack, the present study examined the association between psychological distress and severe stress symptoms with vulnerability variables: i.e. Physical proximity to the site of the terror attack, Associative memory of prior events, Danger perception and ISIS anxiety. Using an online survey, 397 adult participants were recruited, Seventy-two hours after an ISIS terror attack, and filled out Psychological distress Patient Health Questionnaire 4 and severe stress symptoms questionnaire as well as physical proximity to the site of the terror attack, associative memory of prior events, danger perception and ISIS anxiety scales. Physical proximity to the site of the terror attack and ISIS anxiety were found to be significantly associated of both psychological distress and severe stress symptoms. Regarding danger perception, only danger perception of terror attacks was associated with both psychological distress and with severe stress symptoms. Lastly, whereas being reminded of the 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack (tapping to association via location) was neither associated with psychological distress nor with severe stress symptom, the reminder of the truck attack in Berlin (tapping into association by recency and similarity) was associated with psychological distress but not with severe stress symptoms.

240,The relationship of discrimination related to sexual orientation and HIV-relevant risk behaviors among men who have sex with men,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for contraction and transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Increased risk of infection has been linked to high risk behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, as well as engaging in unsafe sexual behaviors. Experiences of discrimination related to sexual orientation often experienced in this population predict risky behavior outcomes, but little research has examined the mechanisms implicated in this model. The current study examined the effect of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the relationship between discrimination related to sexual orientation and high-risk behaviors of alcohol use, drug use, using sex to cope with negative emotions, frequency of sex without a condom, and frequency of sex with an HIV + or unknown status partner. Three hundred and eighty-nine MSM were recruited to participate in a survey based study. Results indicated anxiety was maintained a significant indirect effect between discrimination related to sexual orientation and coping behaviors (using sex to cope, alcohol, substance use), but showed no significant indirect associations with risky sexual behavior. Overall, the current study provides novel empirical evidence that discrimination related to sexual orientation is associated with increased anxiety, which in turn, is associated with certain HIV risk behaviors. Importantly, it is possible that alcohol use, drug use, and using sex to cope with negative emotions may be precursors to more risky sexual behavior, such as engaging in anal sex without a condom or having sex with an HIV + or unknown status partner. Clinically, reducing symptoms of anxiety in the context of discrimination related to sexual orientation may help reduce HIV risk behavior among MSM.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of IA among undergraduate medical students and evaluate the relationship of IA with social anxiety, impulsivity, self-esteem, and depression. The study included 392 undergraduate medical students. Evaluations were made with the sociodemographic data form, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The IA group had significantly higher scores on LSAS, BDI, BAI and lower scores on RSES than the control group but the BIS-11 scores were similar among groups. IAT severity was positively correlated with LSAS, BDI, and BAI and negatively with RSES. No correlation was observed between IAT severity and BIS-11. In the hierarchical linear regression analysis, the avoidance domain of social anxiety was the strongest predictor of the severity of IA. The present study suggests that undergraduate medical students with IA exhibit higher social anxiety, lower self-esteem and are more depressed than those without IA, thus, indicating that social anxiety, rather than impulsivity, seemed to play a prominent role in IA psychopathology.

242,"The role of distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty in predicting hoarding symptoms in a clinical sample","Hoarding disorder (HD) is characterized primarily by difficulty discarding possessions, leading to severe clutter and significant distress and impairment. Although promising psychological treatments have emerged, treating HD remains a clinical challenge. A greater understanding of the role of psychological vulnerability factors in predicting hoarding symptoms in a clinical HD sample could further enhance treatments. To investigate the role of proposed individual difference factors (i.e., distress tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty), we administered a diagnostic and self-report battery to 73 individuals diagnosed with HD who were seeking treatment for hoarding at a community clinic. Results indicated that when controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms, only distress tolerance predicted the severity of hoarding symptoms. Furthermore, meditation analyses revealed that the impact of distress tolerance on hoarding severity was partially mediated by hoarding beliefs. These results have important theoretical and clinical implications for HD.

It also investigates the eating behavior characteristics associated with FA and the association between FA and loss of control over specific foods high in sugar, salt and/or fat. We included 128 bariatric surgery candidates and we assessed FA (YFAS 2.0), mood and anxiety disorders, suicidality, eating disorders (current bulimia nervosa and current anorexia nervosa), alcohol and tobacco use disorders (MINI 5.0.0, beck depression inventory, AUDIT, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence) and eating behavior (DEBQ). Prevalence of FA in our sample was 25%. FA was significantly associated with higher prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders and past mood disorders, higher current suicidality but not with eating disorders and alcohol use disorder. FA was significantly associated with higher emotional eating, and with loss of control over consumption of foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt, but not of fruits, vegetables or grain products. Our results provide arguments for considering psychiatric disorders and suicidality in FA and for considering FA as an addictive disorder in obese patients, with many risk factors in common with other addictions.

244,"Schizotypal traits and their relation to rejection sensitivity in the general population: Their mediation by quality of life, agreeableness and neuroticism","Schizotypal traits are a cluster of personality styles suggesting a potential liability for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Interpersonal schizotypal traits include cognitive disorganisation which consists of social anxiety, and introvertive anhedonia which consists of a lack of pleasure in social activities. Rejection sensitivity is evident all along this continuum. This study aimed to determine whether psychosocial quality of life (QOL), neuroticism and agreeableness mediates the relation between schizotypy and rejection sensitivity. Three hundred and eighteen participants from a predominantly University student population completed an online survey measuring schizotypy, rejection sensitivity, quality of life, and the five-factor personality traits. A regression analysis determined the prediction of rejection sensitivity by schizotypy, quality of life, and the five personality traits. Analyses examined the mediation of the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and rejection sensitivity by psychological QOL, social QOL, neuroticism, and agreeableness. Cognitive disorganisation and introvertive anhedonia predicted greater rejection sensitivity, which in turn were mediated by psychological QOL, social QOL, neuroticism, and agreeableness. The findings show that interpersonal schizotypy relates to greater rejection sensitivity. Psychosocial factors that lower one's ability to have positive feelings, trusting relationships, and prosocial behaviour, and personality traits that increase worrying mediate this association.

These beliefs play an important role in influencing their behaviour and outcomes. This study examined the factor structure and correlates of the Illness Perception Questionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH) among patients with mental illness in a multi-ethnic Asian sample. 400 participants with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood or anxiety disorder were recruited from a tertiary psychiatric institution and administered the IPQ-MH. Data on sociodemographic variables were also collected. A multi-factor structure was identified for the Identity, Structure and Cause subscale of the IPQ-MH. Age was consistently associated with a positive perception of illness across all three disorders; women had a more positive perception of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders as compared to men while those of Indian ethnicity had a more negative perception of their mood disorder as compared to those of Chinese ethnicity. Those with lower education had a poorer understanding of their illness among those with mood disorder, and a poorer understanding of their illness and the effectiveness of treatment among those with anxiety disorder. The study identified specific groups which can be targeted through tailored and culturally relevant psychoeducational interventions to enhance their understanding and perception of mental illness.

Therefore, we aimed to test a validity of the frequency criterion in girls with conduct disorder (CD) based on psychopathology and the level of functioning. Mixture modelling analysis revealed that the frequency of at least 8 self-harm behaviours in the previous year differentiated adolescents with CD. Thus, we divided adolescents into three subgroups: group 1: at least 8 self-harm acts; group 2: 1–7 self-harm behaviours and group 3: those who did not injure themselves during the last 12 months. Individuals from group 1 were significantly younger and had earlier age of self-harm onset. There were significant differences between groups 1 and 3 in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-esteem, aggression and the global functioning level. The group 1 scored significantly higher on depressive symptoms compared to the group 2. The group 2 scored significantly higher than the group 3 on the level of hostility.

Another aim was to assess the association between psychopathology and severity of obesity. A total of 170 children from different Health Centers were evaluated (84 girls and 86 boys; aged 8 to 12 years). Childhood psychological problems were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule (K-SADS-R) and by questionnaires (STAIC for anxiety, CDI for depression and ChEAT for disordered eating). Loss of control eating episodes were evaluated through the diagnostic interview. Of the sample, 57.06% of overweight/obese children met a DSM-5 diagnosis, typically an anxiety disorder; and 33.53% of the overweight/obese children presented loss of control eating episodes. We found more pathologic eating attitudes (ChEAT) in children who presented LOC versus children who did not. Finally, the scores obtained in the STAIC correlated positively with z-BMI and a positive association was found between z-BMI and the presence of episodes of LOC. These results highlight the importance of including psychological component in the initial assessment and contribute to the understanding of LOC episodes, which are still underestimated in childhood obesity.

248,Distress tolerance as a mechanism of PTSD symptom change: Evidence for mediation in a treatment-seeking sample,"Low distress tolerance, the perceived or actual inability to tolerate negative emotional states, is a transdiagnostic risk marker associated with greater PTSD symptoms and poorer treatment outcomes. However, the role of distress tolerance in PTSD symptom trajectories has not yet been explored. This study examined the mediating role of distress tolerance in PTSD symptom change among outpatients participating in a trial of computerized interventions for anxiety-related and mood-related risk factors. It was hypothesized that pre- to post-intervention change in distress tolerance would predict PTSD symptoms at three- and six-month follow-up, and mediate the effect of condition on PTSD symptoms above and beyond the effects of a competing mediator, anxiety sensitivity. Although condition differences in distress tolerance change were non-significant, distress tolerance change predicted month-three PTSD symptoms and mediated the direct effect of condition on month-three PTSD symptoms. After accounting for the direct effect of condition on month-six PTSD symptoms, distress tolerance change did not predict month-six PTSD symptoms. Findings suggest distress tolerance does play a longitudinal role in PTSD symptom change, and distress tolerance interventions may benefit certain samples who may otherwise not be able to immediately access, or remain in PTSD treatments.

The sample was predominantly female (83.69%), with a mean age of 22.68 years. The comparison of competing models revealed that the Anhedonia model, consisting of six inter-correlated factors of reexperiencing, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal, provided the best fit. Several factors of the Anhedonia model also showed differential relationships with the external variables of anxiety and depression.

This study sought to examine the association between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use using a cross-sectional sample of young adults aged 17–25 years ( n = 1029). Specifically, we studied whether the relationship is mediated through (i) attachment anxiety, (ii) attachment avoidance, or (iii) both attachment dimensions operating in series with depressive symptoms. Results revealed that a history of childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with more problematic social media use. Both anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions independently mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic use of social media, but in opposing directions. Avoidant attachment was associated with less problematic social media use, whilst anxious attachment was associated with more problematic social media use. Avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms in series accounted for part of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. Anxious attachment and depressive symptoms in series fully mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and problematic social media use. The results suggest that childhood maltreatment may influence social media use directly, but also indirectly. People experiencing depressive symptoms may overuse social media in an attempt to alleviate their distress. However, causality cannot be established with the current design.

Cognitive function was assessed by using immediate/delayed visual reproduction (IVR/DVR) tasks, immediate/delayed logical memory (ILM/DLM) tasks, Stroop test, Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), and continuous performance test (CPT). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Ketamine users performed worse than controls on the IVR, ILM, DLM, Stroop and auditory CPT tests. IVR and DVR, color-naming and color-interference-reading scores were positively correlated with education level. In ketamine users ILM scores were negatively correlated with the negative subscale of PANSS. DLM score was positively correlated with average dose of ketamine use. Word-reading score was positively correlated with education level, and negatively correlated with duration of ketamine use. False hits in auditory CPT was positively correlated with duration of ketamine use. Number of trials to complete the first category and perseverative errors on WCST were positively correlated with the duration between the test and last ketamine use. Chronic ketamine users had cognitive impairments across multiple domains.

252,Comparison of performance-based assessment and real world skill in people with serious mental illness: Ecological validity of the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills,"Valid functional measures are essential for clinical and research efforts that address recovery and community functioning in people with serious mental illness. Although there is a great deal of interest in functional assessment, there is limited research supporting how well current evaluation methods provide a true assessment of real world functioning or naturalistic behavior. To address this gap in the literature, the present study examined the performance of individuals with serious mental illness (i.e., diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum, bipolar disorder, or other depression/anxiety diagnoses and accompanying functional disability) on the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills (TOGSS), a performance-based naturalistic task. We compared TOGSS performance to two dimensions of real world functioning: directly observed real world grocery shopping and ratings of community functioning. Results indicated that the TOGSS was significantly associated with real life grocery shopping, in terms of both shopping accuracy ( r = 0.424) and time ( r = 0.491). Further, self-report and observer-rated methods of assessing real world shopping behaviors were significantly correlated ( r = 0.455). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to directly compare a performance-based naturalistic skill assessment with carefully observed real world performance of that skill in people with serious mental illness. These findings support the feasibility and ecological validity of performance-based naturalistic assessment with the TOGSS.

253,Stress management versus cognitive restructuring in trauma-affected refugees—A pragmatic randomised study,"The aim of this randomised trial was to compare the effectiveness of stress management (SM) versus cognitive restructuring (CR) in trauma-affected refugees. The intention-to-treat sample comprised 126 refugees with PTSD (SM = 62, CR = 64). The treatment consisted of 16 sessions of psychotherapy with manualised SM or CR in addition to 10 sessions with a medical doctor (psychoeducation and pharmacological treatment). The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Ratings), quality of life (WHO-5), functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning, Sheehan Disability Scale), pain (Visual Analogue Scale) and somatisation (Symptom Checklist). There was no difference in the primary outcome between groups. A significant group difference was found on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating with the SM group improving more than the CR group (effect size 0.46) indicating that methods in SM could potentially be helpful in this population.

254,State paranoia and urban cycling,"Consistent with a continuum approach to mental health, a growing body of research has established that paranoia occurs in the general population. The stress-vulnerability model would predict an association between environments high in threat and the presence of state paranoia, even in those with low dispositional trait paranoia. The present research examines whether urban cycling, a naturalistic environment high in interpersonal threat, is associated with state paranoia—operationalised as an explicit perception that other road users intend the agent harm. 323 members of the general population who regularly cycled in London completed measures of state and trait paranoia, anxiety, depression and stress. The majority of the general population sample (70%) reported experiencing state paranoia during urban cycling, and there was no association between state paranoia and trait paranoia. Reported state paranoia was higher during urban cycling than when using the London underground (a lower threat environment) and reported state paranoia on the underground was associated with trait paranoia. The findings are consistent with the stress-vulnerability model of everyday paranoia.

255,Clinical depression and anxiety among ST-elevation myocardial infarction hospitalizations: Results from Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004–2013,"Depression and anxiety are common among patients who have a major cardiovascular event. However, despite their frequency, there is a lack of evidence regarding the relationship between depression and/or anxiety and receiving revascularization in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) hospitalizations. Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the years 2004 to 2013, we assessed whether a clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety decreases the likelihood of revascularization among STEMI hospitalizations. Our central finding is that, paradoxically, the odds of in-hospital mortality were lower among STEMI hospitalizations with a clinical co-diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety as compared to those without. We further discovered that clinical diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety were less prevalent among revascularized as compared to non-revascularized STEMI hospitalizations. However, the percentage of clinical diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety among STEMI hospitalizations increased at a similar rate over a 10-year period irrespective of revascularization status. In conclusion, these results are suggestive of the potentially underdiagnosed mental health issues surrounding major cardiovascular events, and indeed, chronic disease as a whole. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and examine the “depression paradox” among a population of cardiac patients.

256,Oppositional behavior and longitudinal predictions of early adulthood mental health problems in chronic tic disorders,"Chronic tic disorders (TD) are associated with a number of psychological problems such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. ODD is often considered a risk factor for many psychological symptoms and recent work suggests that different ODD dimensions show independent predictions of later psychological problems. This study examined the longitudinal predictions between ODD dimensions of Irritability and Defiance and the most frequent comorbidities in TD from childhood to early adulthood. From an initial sample of 135, parent reports were obtained on 58 participants with TD using standard clinical questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Defiance symptoms decreased from baseline to follow-up whereas Irritability symptoms were more stable over time. In multiple regressions, Irritability in childhood predicted anxiety and OCB in early adulthood while Defiance in childhood predicted ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms in early adulthood. No developmental link was found for depressive symptoms. Results indicate that ODD dimensions are developmentally linked to both internalizing and externalizing adult mental health symptoms in TD.

257,Developing image sets for inducing obsessive-compulsive checking symptoms,"Visual stimuli are often used for obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom provocation in research studies. We tested the induction of anxiety and OC checking symptoms across different types of checking provocation stimuli in three populations: individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), individuals with checking symptoms but without a diagnosis of OCD, and control individuals with neither checking symptoms nor a clinical diagnosis. One set of provocative images depicted objects that are commonly associated with checking anxiety. Another set (‘enhanced provocative images’) depicted similar objects but also included contextual cues suggesting a specific harmful scenario that could occur. As expected, the enhanced provocative images were more effective at inducing anxiety and OC symptoms than the standard provocative images. Future studies requiring checking symptom provocation should therefore consider incorporating similarly suggestive images. Individuals with clinical OCD reported the greatest provocation in response to these images, followed by those with nonclinical checking, followed by control individuals. Thus, these stimuli are able to provoke OC checking symptoms and anxiety differentially across groups, with the intensity of provocation reflecting diagnostic status. All groups demonstrated a similar qualitative pattern of provocation across images. Finally, in all groups, reported anxiety closely tracked intrusive thoughts and checking urges.

258,Sex differences in traumatic events and psychiatric morbidity associated to probable posttraumatic stress disorder among Latino prisoners,"Latinos comprised 17.1% of the U.S. population and 33.1% of US prisoners, yet they are underrepresented in the psychopathology literature. Despite higher rates of trauma among incarcerated individuals than in the general population, most of the previous research in this area focused primarily on women samples, and very few studies examined sex differences in PTSD and traumatic experiences. In addition, there is a need for research assessing traumatic experiences and probable PTSD in men and women Latino inmates to inform culturally competent care and sex sensitive care for this vulnerable and underserved population. Our study examined whether men and women Latino inmates with probable Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), based on the cut off 40 or more symptoms on the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), differed significantly by the number of event types experienced, the type of potentially traumatizing event, and in co-occurring psychiatric conditions. A multi-stage sample design was used to select a probabilistic sample of 1,331 inmates from 26 penal institutions in PR of which 1179 participated in the study. Bivariate associations were calculated for each type of traumatic event and probable PTSD. Mean number of types of potentially traumatizing event experienced was comparable for both sexes (F = 3.83, M = 3.74) yet sex differences were found in the nature of the event. Women with probable PTSD had higher rates of experiencing rape and sexual abuse. Men had higher rates of experiencing combat in war, a life-threatening accident, of witnessing violence, and being threatened with a weapon. Men with significant ADHD symptoms in childhood and with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) during adulthood were almost 5 and 7 times as likely to score above threshold on the DTS whereas women were &gt; 3 times as likely in the presence of ADHD symptoms in childhood or depression during adulthood. This study underscores the need to improve understanding of the clinical manifestations of trauma and co-occurring psychiatric conditions for appropriate sex sensitive interventions targeting Latinos living in prisons.

259,"Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicidal ideation in veterans: Results from the Mind Your Heart study","Veterans with PTSD or depression are at increased risk for suicidal ideation. However, few studies have examined that risk in those with comorbid PTSD and depression, instead focusing on these disorders individually. This study investigates the association of suicidal ideation with comorbid PTSD and depression and examines the role of military and psychosocial covariates. We evaluated 746 veterans using the CAPS to assess PTSD and the PHQ-9 to measure depression and suicidal ideation. Covariates were assessed via validated self-report measures. 49% of veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression endorsed suicidal ideation, making them more likely to do so than those with depression alone (34%), PTSD alone (11%), or neither (2%). In multivariate logistic regression models, this association remained significant after controlling for demographics and symptom severity. Anger, hostility, anxiety, alcohol use, optimism and social support did not explain the elevated risk of suicidal ideation in the comorbid group in fully adjusted models. As suicidal ideation is a known risk factor for suicide attempts and completions, veterans with comorbid PTSD and depression represent a vulnerable group who may need more intensive monitoring and treatment to reduce risk of suicide.

260,"Self-reported nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and sex as self-injury (SASI): Relationship to abuse, risk behaviors, trauma symptoms, self-esteem and attachment","This study focuses on a conceptually unexplored behavior among adolescents who report deliberately using sex as a means of self-injury. In a large high school-based sample ( n = 5743), adolescents who engaged in sex as self-injury (SASI, n = 43) were compared to adolescents who reported direct nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI, n = 933) and those who reported both NSSI and SASI ( n = 82). Results showed that significantly more adolescents with SASI had experience of penetrating sexual abuse, as well as more sexual partners compared to those with NSSI. The SASI group also had higher levels of self-reported trauma symptoms, such as dissociation, posttraumatic stress and sexual concerns compared to those with NSSI, suggesting a distinct relationship between sexual abuse, trauma symptoms and engaging in sex as self-injury. There was no difference between the SASI and NSSI groups regarding experiences of emotional and physical abuse, self-esteem, parental care or overprotection or symptoms of depression, anxiety and anger. Adolescents who engaged in both NSSI + SASI stood out as a more severe and burdened group, with more experience of abuse, risk behaviors and impaired psychosocial health. Adolescents with traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse need to be assessed for SASI and vice versa.

261,"Validation, reliability, and specificity of CliniCom™ Psychiatric Assessment Software","The purpose of this study was to determine the specificity and reproducibility of CliniCom™ Psychiatric Assessment Software to appropriately diagnose five prevalent mental health disorders. This online assessment tool incorporates proprietary algorithms for its propensity assessment. Unlike other questionnaires, which require a survey per specific mental disorder, CliniCom can simultaneously assess multiple mental disorders for an individual. CliniCom was concordant with other commonly used assessment tools in diagnosing five prevalent disorders including: Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Social Phobia. The online tool was overall 78% concordant in diagnosing the same disorder during a test-retest analysis. When subjects exhibited two, three, or four disorders, the tool was less consistent in diagnosing the same set of disorders during the test-retest analysis (53% concordant). However, if evaluated as individual disorders within subjects, the more persistent disorders had a higher rate of concordance: MDD (83.3%), ADHD (81.0%), and OCD (68.4%). This study proposes CliniCom as an online assessment tool that demonstrates specificity in identifying specific psychiatric conditions and shows reproducibility over multiple administrations.

262,Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview (MIDI): Validation of a structured diagnostic clinical interview for impulse control disorders in an enriched community sample,"Background: Disorders of impulsivity are common, functionally impairing, and highly relevant across different clinical and research settings. Few structured clinical interviews for the identification and diagnosis of impulse control disorders exist, and none have been validated in a community sample in terms of psychometric properties. Methods: The Minnesota Impulse control disorders Interview (MIDI v2.0) was administered to an enriched sample of 293 non-treatment seeking adults aged 18–35 years, recruited using media advertisements in two large US cities. In addition to the MIDI, participants undertook extended clinical interview for other mental disorders, the Barratt impulsiveness questionnaire, and the Padua obsessive-compulsive inventory. The psychometric properties of the MIDI were characterized. Results: In logistic regression, the MIDI showed good concurrent validity against the reference measures (versus gambling disorder interview, p &lt; 0.001; Barratt impulsiveness attentional and non-planning scores p &lt; 0.05), and good discriminant validity versus primarily non-impulsive symptoms, including against anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (all p &gt; 0.05). Test re-test reliability was excellent (0.95). Conclusions: The MIDI has good psychometric properties and thus may be a valuable interview tool for clinical and research studies involving impulse control disorders. Further research is needed to better understanding the optimal diagnostic classification and neurobiology of these neglected disorders.

263,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and happiness among adults in the general population,"Despite an increasing focus on the role of mood and emotions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as yet, there has been comparatively little research on positive emotions. To address this research gap, the current study examined the association between ADHD symptoms and happiness using data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. The analytic sample comprised 7274 adults aged 18 and above residing in private households in England. Information was collected on ADHD symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener, while happiness was assessed with a single (3-point) measure. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis and a mediation analysis were performed to examine associations. Greater ADHD symptom severity was associated with higher odds for feeling less happy. Mood instability (percentage mediated 37.1%), anxiety disorder (35.6%) and depression (29.9%) were all important mediators of the association between ADHD and happiness. Given that happiness has been linked to a number of beneficial outcomes, the results of this study highlight the importance of diagnosing ADHD in adults and also of screening for and treating any comorbid psychiatric disorders in these individuals.

264,The moderating role of cognitive biases on the relationship between negative affective states and psychotic-like experiences in non-clinical adults,"Negative emotions and cognitive biases are important factors underlying psychotic symptoms and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs); however, it is not clear whether these factors interact when they influence psychotic phenomena. The aim of our study was to investigate whether psychosis-related cognitive biases moderate the relationship between negative affective states, i.e. anxiety and depression, and psychotic-like experiences. The study sample contains 251 participants who have never been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Anxiety, depression, cognitive biases, and psychotic-like experiences were assessed with self-report questionnaires. A moderation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the study variables. The analyses revealed that the link between anxiety and positive PLEs is moderated by External Attribution bias, whereas the relationship between depression and positive PLEs is moderated by Attention to Threat bias. Attributional bias was also found to moderate the association between depression and negative subclinical symptoms; Jumping to Conclusions bias served as a moderator in the link between anxiety and depression and negative PLEs. Further studies in clinical samples are required to verify the moderating role of individual cognitive biases on the relationship between negative emotional states and full-blown psychotic symptoms.

265,Subjective cognitive function in hoarding disorder,"The aim of the present study was to examine subjective cognitive impairment among adult patients with hoarding disorder (HD). Eighty-three patients with HD and 46 age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) participants received a diagnostic interview and completed measures of subjective cognitive functioning and motivations for saving behavior, as well as measures of hoarding severity, depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. The HD group reported more impairment than did the HC group in domains of memory, distractibility, blunders, memory for names, and inattention. These differences generally remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. In the HD group, the degree of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with severity of saving and acquiring behaviors, although results were attenuated when controlling for comorbid symptoms (overall HD severity, but not saving behavior specifically, remained significantly correlated with cognitive impairment). Subjective cognitive impairment was further associated with a desire to save possessions in order to avoid forgetting, and these results remained significant when controlling for comorbid symptoms. These results comport with current behavioral models of HD that emphasize decision-making deficits, as well as clinician observations suggestive of impaired cognitive function, and complement a growing body of neuropsychological testing studies.

266,Examining predictors of help-seeking behaviours in patients with mood and anxiety symptoms,"Relatively little is known about individual characteristics that factor into the decision to seek help for mood and anxiety symptoms. The current study was undertaken in order to examine factors that predict the likelihood of seeking help for mood and anxiety symptoms amongst a clinical population. Patients ( N = 278) referred to a tertiary care clinic in Toronto, Canada were asked about their help-seeking behaviours (HSB) through initial intake assessments and self-administered questionnaires, including the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Correlates of anxiety and depression were examined to determine whether they could predict HSB amongst individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder with or without comorbid Major Depressive Disorder, as well as Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. Psychiatric diagnoses were then examined to determine whether comorbidity and demographic factors impacted HSB. Results indicated that there were significant differences in anxiety and depression correlating mainly with anxiety sensitivity, as a predictor of HSB, and that there is a complex relationship between disorder type and demographic variables. The implications of these findings and suggested targeted interventions are discussed.

In total, 288 online poker gamblers were recruited. Sociodemographic data, gambling behavior (CPGI), sensation seeking (SSS), depression and anxiety (HADS) were evaluated. Problem online poker gamblers have higher sensation seeking scores (total, thrill and adventure, disinhibition and boredom susceptibility subscores) and depression scores than non-problem online poker gamblers. Being male, with total sensation seeking, disinhibition and depression scores are factors associated with online poker problem gambling. These findings are interesting in terms of harm reduction. For example, because disinhibition could lead to increased time and money spent, protective behavioral strategies like setting time and monetary limits should be encouraged in poker online gamblers.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term treatment effects of cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants (sertraline and mianserin) in trauma-affected refugees. Follow-ups were conducted 6 and 18 months after a randomised controlled clinical trial. The included patients were refugees with war-related traumatic experiences, PTSD and without psychotic disorders. We found a small improvement over time in PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms and level of functioning, but the improvement was not associated with any specific treatment. Personality change after catastrophic experiences and life events influenced the symptom level at all follow-ups while depression at completion of treatment was associated with a steeper decline in symptom load at the follow-ups. In spite of the limited decline in symptom scores and treatment effects immediately after treatment, the condition of the treated trauma-affected refugees was significantly improved 6 and 18 months after treatment although the improvement was small.

269,The role of lifetime anxiety history in the course of bipolar spectrum disorders,"Individuals with bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) frequently meet criteria for comorbid anxiety disorders, and anxiety may be an important factor in the etiology and course of BSDs. The current study examined the association of lifetime anxiety disorders with prospective manic/hypomanic versus major depressive episodes. Participants were 244 young adults (aged 17–26) with milder forms of BSDs (i.e., bipolar-II, cyclothymia, BD-NOS). First, bivariate analyses assessed differences in baseline clinical characteristics between participants with and without DSM-IV anxiety diagnoses. Second, negative binomial regression analyses tested whether lifetime anxiety predicted number of manic/hypomanic or major depressive episodes developed during the study. Third, survival analyses evaluated whether lifetime anxiety predicted time to onset of manic/hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Results indicated that anxiety history was associated with greater illness severity at baseline. Over follow-up, anxiety history predicted fewer manic/hypomanic episodes, but did not predict number of major depressive episodes. Anxiety history also was associated with longer time to onset of manic/hypomanic episodes, but shorter time to onset of depressive episodes. Findings corroborate past studies implicating anxiety disorders as salient influences on the course of BSDs. Moreover, results extend prior research by indicating that anxiety disorders may be linked with reduced manic/hypomanic phases of illness.

270,"Genetic correlations between wellbeing, depression and anxiety symptoms and behavioral responses to the emotional faces task in healthy twins","Currently there is a very limited understanding of how mental wellbeing versus anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with emotion processing behaviour. For the first time, we examined these associations using a behavioural emotion task of positive and negative facial expressions in 1668 healthy adult twins. Linear mixed model results suggested faster reaction times to happy facial expressions was associated with higher wellbeing scores, and slower reaction times with higher depression and anxiety scores. Multivariate twin modelling identified a significant genetic correlation between depression and anxiety symptoms and reaction time to happy facial expressions, in the absence of any significant correlations with wellbeing. We also found a significant negative phenotypic relationship between depression and anxiety symptoms and accuracy for identifying neutral emotions, although the genetic or environment correlations were not significant in the multivariate model. Overall, the phenotypic relationships between speed of identifying happy facial expressions and wellbeing on the one hand, versus depression and anxiety symptoms on the other, were in opposing directions. Twin modelling revealed a small common genetic correlation between response to happy faces and depression and anxiety symptoms alone, suggesting that wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms show largely independent relationships with emotion processing at the behavioral level.

This study retrospectively assesses the subjective effects of first cocaine use in 160 current treatment-seeking cocaine use disorder patients. Subjective effects of first cocaine use were evaluated with an ad-hoc questionnaire used for cannabis effects. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, with resulting factors correlated with clinical variables (α = 0.05). Four factors emerged in the PCA, namely Anxiety (accounting for 21.5% of questionnaire variance), Disinhibition (17.3%), Tachypsychia (16%) and Calmness (13%). Male gender was associated with Disinhibition and Tachypsychia. Cocaine severity factors were associated with Disinhibition, Tachypsychia and Calmness. Opiate, sedative and poppers uses were associated with Anxiety, Tachypsychia and Calmness. The retrospective assessment of the subjective effects of first cocaine use shows significant variability.

272,"Associations of early childhood adversities with mental disorders, psychological functioning, and suitability for psychotherapy in adulthood","Childhood adversities frequently precede adulthood depression and anxiety. Yet, how they impact needed treatment duration, type or focus in these common disorders, is unclear. For developing more individualized and precise interventions, we investigated whether specific early adversities associate with patients’ distinct psychiatric problems, psychological vulnerabilities, and suitability for psychotherapy. A total of 221 depressed and anxious adult outpatients (excluding psychotic, severe personality, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders) referred from community, student, occupational, and private healthcare services filled the Childhood Family Atmosphere Questionnaire (CFAQ). They also filled self-reports on interpersonal behavior and problems, perceived competence, dispositional optimism, sense of coherence, defenses, and psychiatric history. Clinicians assessed the patients’ symptomatology, personality, object relations, cognitive performance, and psychotherapy suitability. Regression analyses were conducted. Childhood adversities predicted both worse current psychological functioning (e.g., interpersonal problems), and better clinician-rated capacities for benefiting from psychotherapy (e.g. self-reflection, capacity for interaction). Parental problems had the most numerous negative associations to psychological functioning. Best capacities for psychotherapy were predicted by recollected family unhappiness. Associations with psychiatric criteria were, however, largely non-significant. In conclusion, for psychosocial treatment planning, patients’ early adversities may indicate both vulnerability and resources. As childhood adversities are frequent among treatment-seekers, further studies examining how early adversities predict psychotherapy outcome are needed.

The objective of this study was to search for clinical and neurophysiologic predictors of therapeutic response with a special focus on the bipolar population. Forty patients (30 bipolar) underwent 20 daily sessions of HF-rTMS. Clinical outcome measures included the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Clinical Global Impression, and the Patient Global Impression. Neurophysiologic measurements included repeated estimation of the motor threshold and cortical silent period. Improvement was obtained in all psychometric scales, with no difference between unipolar and bipolar patients. Longer duration of the illness, higher number of prior hospitalizations, and more disturbed activity were associated with a worse response to rTMS, and somatic anxiety, sleep disorders, and health worries were positive predictors. In bipolar patients, longer disease duration and therapy with mirtazapine, mianserin, trazodone, hydroxyzine, and promethazine were associated with a worse response. Sleep disturbances, higher baseline motor threshold, and longer cortical silent period predicted a better response. In this study, we found several clinical and neurophysiologic predictors of better/worse responses to the standard HF-rTMS protocol. Our preliminary data need to be reproduced.

274,Cerebrospinal fluid FGF23 levels correlate with a measure of impulsivity,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived protein produced mainly by osteocytes and osteoblasts and at low levels in specific parts of the brain. It has been shown to associate with mood regulation. Lithium treatment gives rise to significant elevations of serum FGF23 levels in depressive patients. High peripheral blood FGF23 levels correlated with poor cognitive performance in hemodialysis patients. However, no direct evidence demonstrates a relationship between FGF23 and mood regulation. In this study, we aimed to measure the concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FGF23 and to explore its relationship with a cluster of emotional characteristics. We measured CSF FGF23 levels in 96 male Chinese subjects. All subjects completed the Chinese version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS 11), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). CSF FGF23 levels ranged from 12.8 to 99.3 pg/mL. Negative correlations were found between CSF FGF23 concentrations and BIS non-planning, BIS cognition and BIS total score (all p &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, except for the BIS cognition scores, these correlations became insignificant after Bonferroni correction. No correlations were found between CSF FGF23 concentrations and BDI or SAS scores. These findings suggest that CSF FGF23 levels correlate with a measure of impulsivity.

Participants were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). The concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in patients with major depressive disorder compared to healthy controls. The total score of childhood trauma questionnaire highly statistically significantly correlated with IL-6 levels in patient group. Persons who were physically abused, physically neglected and emotionally abused had higher levels of IL-6. Interleukin 6 as a pro-inflammatory immune marker could be an important developmental mediator linking physical and emotional abuse in early life with the development of depressive disorder in adulthood.

276,"Objective measures of sleep in fibromyalgia syndrome: Relationship to clinical, psychiatric, and immunological variables","We aimed to investigate the changes in the objective and subjective sleep variables during painful episodes of fibromyalgia and post-episode period, and to evaluate the impact of the sleep variables on the current clinical, psychological, and immunologic parameters. Thirty-one consecutive patients who were referred to the Erenköy Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Polyclinic with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia were evaluated before and in the sixth week of the acute pain treatment. The sleep variables were measured by polysomnography, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The clinical and psychiatric assessment of patients was performed by using Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; Patient Health Questionnaire-Somatic, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms; and Visual Analog Scale. Serum pro-inflammatory molecules were measured to evaluate the immunological status. The pain treatment significantly affected subjective sleep variables, psychiatric variables, clinical variables, and IL-6 levels. The subjective sleep parameters, clinical and psychiatric variables, and IL-6 levels were improved with pain treatment in fibromyalgia. The objective sleep variables, IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels were not significantly improved with the pain treatment, and they were not related to clinical presentation of patients with fibromyalgia. Subjective variability of sleep contributes to the clinical presentation, suggesting that the objective structure is trait-specific with IL-1 and TNF-alpha.

277,Social anxiety and risk factors in patients with schizophrenia: Relationship with duration of untreated psychosis,"Social anxiety is commonly reported as a comorbid condition among people with schizophrenia. The aims of this study were to elucidate the associations between demographic/clinical features and social anxiety. A total of 207 outpatients with schizophrenia underwent assessments for social anxiety, psychiatric symptoms, social cognition, cognitive function, social functioning, and quality of life (QOL). To confirm the prediction model for social anxiety, we conducted multiple linear regressions using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) score as an outcome variable and demographic/clinical variables as predictors. Of the 207 patients, 30 (14.5%) met the criteria for social anxiety disorder and 109 (52.7%) had a mean LSAS score higher than 30, suggesting that their social anxiety symptoms had reached a clinical level. Social anxiety was significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and QOL, whereas significant correlations with social cognition and cognitive function were not observed. A multiple regression analysis identified social functioning, gender, age of onset, and duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) as predictors that were most closely associated with the LSAS score. We confirmed that social anxiety symptoms were highly prevalent among outpatients with schizophrenia and were closely associated with social functioning and DUP, rather than social cognitive impairments.

Hofmann, Angela Fang and Daniel N. Brager ( Psychiatry Research , 2015[Aug][30], Vol 228[3], 708-714). This article has been removed: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/ article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the authors and Editor-in-Chief of the journal. It was brought to the authors' attention that there were several significant data analytic errors linked to the data entry and the software program that was used in the published meta-analysis comparing the effect of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo administration on psychiatric symptoms. Correcting these errors changed the main result of this study. The authors greatly apologize to the journal, the reviewers, and readers for the errors in the original article, and would like to thank the readers who brought the errors to their attention. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-27889-001). Clinical trials of intranasal administration of oxytocin for treating psychiatric problems have yielded mixed results. To conduct a quantitative review of placebo-controlled clinical trials of intranasally-administered oxytocin (OT) for psychiatric symptoms, manual and electronic searches using PubMed and PsycINFO were conducted. Of 1828 entries, 16 placebo-controlled studies totaling 330 participants were included in the analysis. The overall placebo-controlled effect size was moderately strong (Hedges' g = 0.67) and robust as suggested by the fail-safe N and funnel plot analysis. OT reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, autism/repetitive behaviors, psychotic symptoms, and general psychopathology. In the combined sample, symptom reduction was moderated by frequency of administration. Publication year and diagnostic category did not moderate the effect of OT on the clinical outcome measures. We conclude that intranasal administration of OT is a potentially useful intervention for reducing psychiatric symptoms. However, more studies are needed to determine the best treatment target and to identify the mechanism of treatment change.

279,"Anxiety sensitivity and cannabis use problems, perceived barriers for quitting, and fear of quitting","Cannabis is among the most widely used psychoactive substances in the United States, and rates of cannabis use and cannabis-related problems are increasing. Anxiety sensitivity, or the fear of aversive interoceptive sensations, may be relevant to better understanding cannabis use problems and other significant cannabis use processes (e.g., beliefs about quitting). Previous research has primarily focused on the global anxiety sensitivity construct; however, anxiety sensitivity lower-order facets (Cognitive Concerns, Physical Concerns, and Social Concerns) tend to be differentially related to substance use processes in non-cannabis specific studies. The current study therefore explored anxiety sensitivity lower-order facets in relation to cannabis use problems, perceived barriers for cannabis cessation, and abstinence phobia (fear of not using cannabis) among a community sample of 203 cannabis-using adults. Results indicated that anxiety sensitivity Cognitive Concerns were significantly associated with each of the dependent measures and these effects were not explained by shared variance with the other lower-order factors or a range of other covariates (e.g., tobacco use). The present findings suggest future work may benefit from focusing on the role of anxiety sensitivity Cognitive Concerns in the maintenance of cannabis use.

280,Screening for panic-related anxiety in emergency department patients with cardiopulmonary complaints: A comparison of two self-report instruments,"The present study examined 1) the accuracy of two self-report measures for detecting panic-related anxiety in emergency department (ED) patients with cardiopulmonary complaints; and 2) whether modified scoring resulted in improved performance. English-speaking adults presenting to the ED of a large public hospital with palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, or difficulty breathing were evaluated for the presence of panic-related anxiety with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) over a one-year period. Patients completed the panic disorder modules of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-PD) and Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ-PD). Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and predictive values were compared for various cut-offs and scoring algorithms using SCID diagnosis of panic attacks (in the absence of panic disorder) or panic disorder as the reference standard. In this sample of 200 participants, the majority had a chief complaint of chest pain and 46.5% met SCID criteria for panic-related anxiety. The PDSQ-PD demonstrated only fair operating characteristics for panic attacks (AUC = 0.57) and good operating characteristics for panic disorder (AUC = 0.79). The PHQ-PD achieved adequate operating characteristics (AUC = 0.66) for panic attacks and good operating characteristics for panic disorder (AUC = 0.76) using a modified scoring algorithm or a single screening question (AUC = 0.72).

281,Effects of adjunctive &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine on depressive symptoms: Modulation by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,"Outcomes in a RCTs of 12 weeks of the clinical efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive treatment on depression and anxiety symptoms and its effects on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. A wide array of measures were made. The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17); the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A); Sheehan Disability Scale; Quality of Life; Clinical Global Impression (CGI); anthropometrics measures; and vital signs and biochemical laboratory. There were no significant differences among the groups regarding demographic, clinical features, use of medication, metabolic syndrome and comorbidities. From baseline to week 12, individuals receiving NAC, versus placebo, had a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms on HDRS17 (p &lt; 0.01) and anxiety symptoms on HAM-A (p = 0.04), but only for individuals with levels of hs-CRP &gt; 3 mg/L at baseline. Individuals receiving NAC with baseline levels of hs-CRP &gt; 3 mg/L, had more significant reduction in uric acid levels compared to individuals with baseline levels of hs-CRP ≤ 3 mg/L on week 12. Participants receiving placebo gained significantly more weight during the 12 weeks for baseline levels of hs-CRP ≤ 3 mg/L and hs-CRP &gt; 3 mg/L, and individuals receiving NAC in both groups did not have significant weight change during the 12 weeks. No individuals were withdrawn from the study because of adverse event. NAC group exhibited significantly greater reduction on hs-CRP levels than placebo group from baseline to week 12.

282,"Close relation of interpersonal sensitivity with negative core beliefs about the self, the central construct of cognitive vulnerability to depression","Interpersonal sensitivity is a personality trait linked with anxious attachment conceptualized in attachment theory. This personality trait is comprised of four components, i.e., interpersonal awareness, separation anxiety, timidity and fragile inner-self, which are measured by the corresponding subscales of the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM). Meanwhile, one study showed that six items of the IPSM tentatively used as negative self-schemas predicted the onset of depression. To clarify if interpersonal sensitivity reflects cognitive vulnerability, we examined the relation of this personality trait with negative core beliefs about the self. The study population consisted of 335 Japanese volunteers. Interpersonal sensitivity was measured by the IPSM, and negative core beliefs about the self were assessed by the negative-self subscale of the Brief Core Schema Scales (BCSS). Multiple regression analysis showed that scores of the four subscales of the IPSM were strongly correlated with those of the negative-self subscale of the BCSS (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, sequential equation modeling demonstrated that the four components of interpersonal sensitivity were strongly predicted by core beliefs of negative-self (P &lt; 0.001). The present study shows that interpersonal sensitivity is closely related to negative core beliefs about the self, suggesting that this personality trait can be regarded as a cognitive vulnerability to depression.

283,An investigation of emotion recognition training to reduce symptoms of social anxiety in adolescence,"This study aimed to examine the effect of emotion recognition training on social anxiety symptoms among adolescents, aged 15–18 years. The study included a screening session, which identified participants who scored above a cut-off on a self-report measure of social anxiety for enrolment into a randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trials ID: NCT02550379). Participants were randomized to an intervention condition designed to increase the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions or a sham intervention control condition, and completed self-report measures of social anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety-related disorders, and depressive symptoms. The intervention group demonstrated a strong shift in the balance point at which they perceived happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions. This increase in positive perception was not associated with any changes in the primary outcome of social anxiety; however, some evidence of improvement in symptomatology was observed on one of a number of secondary outcomes. Those in the intervention group had lower depression symptoms at 2-week follow-up, compared to those in the control group who received the sham intervention training. Potential reasons for why the shift in balance point measurement was not associated with a concurrent shift in symptoms of social anxiety are discussed.

284,Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 secretions in eating disorders: Correlations with psychopathological aspects of the disorders,"Hormonal alterations in Eating Disorders (ED) may result from the biochemical stress of malnutrition/starvation. The correlations between some hormonal impairments, particularly of the somatotropic axis, and the psychopathological aspects of ED are still undefined. We measured the plasma concentrations of the somatotropic hormone (GH) and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in 136 patients with various forms of ED, 65 with restricted Anorexia Nervosa (ANR), 19 with bingeing-purging Anorexia Nervosa (ANBP), 12 with purging-non binging Anorexia Nervosa (ANP), 26 with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), 8 with ED not otherwise specified-anorexic type (EDNOS-AN), 7 with ED not otherwise specified-bulimic type (EDNOS-BN) and in 30 healthy controls. Psychological assessment of patients and controls was performed using two outpatient rating scales, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Significant negative or positive correlations were observed between GH-IGF-1 concentrations and impairments on several EDI-2 subscales (drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, interoceptive awareness, sense of ineffectiveness, interpersonal distrust, maturity fear) and on SCL-90 subitems (depression, hostility, obsessivity compulsivity, anxiety), suggesting a possible hormonal modulatory effect on specific aspects of ED psychopathology.

285,"Childhood adversities, bonding, and personality in social anxiety disorder with alcohol use disorder","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is frequently associated with alcohol use disorders (abuse/dependence). However, there has been little research on the characteristics of this subgroup so far. In the current study we investigated individuals with SAD and comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) with regard to socialization experiences and personality. The sample comprised 410 individuals diagnosed with SAD by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV. 108 participants with comorbid AUD were compared to 302 participants without comorbid AUD concerning traumatic experiences during childhood and adolescence (Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire; ACE), parental bonding (Parental Bonding Instrument; PBI), and personality (Temperament and Character Inventory; TCI). MANCOVA with covariates sex and depression displayed that individuals with SAD plus AUD reported significantly more traumatic events during childhood and adolescence, lower levels of maternal care, as well as lower cooperativeness. Our results highlight that adverse childhood experiences and unfavourable maternal bonding characterize individuals suffering from SAD plus AUD. These experiences might be reflected in a personality-based tendency to distance themselves from others, which corresponds to low scores on the character dimension cooperativeness. A deeper understanding of personality and specific socialization experiences is necessary to develop new treatment options in this clinically challenging subgroup.

287,"Predictors of benzodiazepine use in a transdiagnostic sample of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder patients","We investigated the rates of current and past benzodiazepine (BZD) use in a sample of 102 subjects attending specialized anxiety disorder clinics, including panic disorder (PD; N = 36), social anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 28) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; N = 38) patients. Almost 56% of the entire sample was using BZDs at the moment of the assessment, and 74.5% described having used them at some point during their lifetimes. The duration of psychiatric treatment and a lifetime history of PD, but not any other “transdiagnostic” measure of severity (such as the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, the Social Phobia Inventory, the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-36, and the Beck Inventories) were independent risk factors for current prescription of BZDs. Patients who continued to use BZDs differed from patients who stopped them by being older (both currently and when firstly seen in the clinic), by having a later age at onset of their most significant anxiety disorder, by being more agoraphobic/avoidant, and by believing to be less capable of stopping their BZDs for the fear of not being able to sleep.

288,Gender differences in stress hormone response regulates effects of mindfulness in stress related disorder,"Comments on an article by E.A. Hoge et al. (see record 2017-03827-001). Hoge et al. examined the effect of mindfulness intervention on generalized anxiety disorder by demonstrating change in measured stress biomarkers before and after the intervention. The findings indicated Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program may enhance resilience to stress in generalized anxiety disorder. In this study, Hoge et al. examined stress biomarker linked to stress and inflammation in blood sample for indication of acute and chronic stress. Hoge et al. used ACTH and pro-inflammatory cytokines as a biomarker of stress to determine the effect of mindfulness on stress reduction. Taking previous findings into account, gender wise comparison of the level of biomarkers before and after MBSR intervention would be more expedient rather than overall longitudinal comparison among subjects in the study by Hoge et al. Presenting the results in terms of gender difference would have been more informative given the role of female sex hormone in inhibition of ACTH. Immunological studies as such by Hoge et al. are more edifying on application of mindfulness intervention in wide range of disorders currently.

289,Adult insecure attachment plays a role in hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation in Insomnia Disorder,"Studies show that unhelpful cognitive processes play a role in insomnia, whereas interpersonal factors have been less studied in insomnia. Attachment theory can be used as a cognitive-interpersonal framework for understanding insomnia. Because attachment insecurity (vs security) is related to psychiatric disorders the objective was to study the attachment style in insomnia. To this aim sixty-four subjects with Insomnia Disorder (DSM-5) and 38 good sleepers were evaluate in a cross-sectional study with: Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Differences in means between groups were assessed using t-test or Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon test. Linear/multiple regression analyses were performed. Subjects with insomnia (mean age 47.1 + 13 yrs) presented an insecure attachment style and higher scores in all the scales (ASQ, APS, PSAS, DERS p &lt; 0.0001) than good sleepers (mean age 48.2 + 14 yrs). After taking into account anxiety/depressive symptoms, insecure attachment was related to hyperarousal trait (p = 0.02), pre-sleep hyperarousal (p = 0.04) and emotion dysregulation (p = 0.002). In conclusion subjects with insomnia showed an insecure attachment which was related to hyperarousal trait, pre-sleep hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation. It may intervene in the trajectory of insomnia starting from predisposition to perpetuation. Clinical implications are discussed.

290,Serotonin transporter and behavioral traits,"Comments on an article by A. Talati et al. (see record 2017-24741-033). Talati et al. concluded that “5-HTTLPR predicts higher impulsivity, hostility, and neuroticism, and that impulsivity could serve as a useful independent outcome or intermediary phenotype in genetic studies of anxiety.” In fact, the observation on the relationship between the short polymorphism of 5-HTTLPR and impulsivity is similar to that seen for the monoamine oxidase A polymorphism. These observations suggest an important influence of basic genetic background on behavior. The short polymorphisms of 5-HTTLPR has a lower molecular weight than the long polymorphism, indicating lower molecular function per molecule of 5-HTTLPR. Hence, a higher serotonin level can be expected in individuals with the short polymorphism, and the increased level might be related to agitated behavior. This speculation is concordant with previous publications on the effect of molecular weight and its clinical impact in other polymorphism-related medical disorders.

291,Social anxiety and detection of facial untrustworthiness: Spatio-temporal oculomotor profiles,"Cognitive models posit that social anxiety is associated with biased attention to and interpretation of ambiguous social cues as threatening. We investigated attentional bias (selective early fixation on the eye region) to account for the tendency to distrust ambiguous smiling faces with non-happy eyes (interpretative bias). Eye movements and fixations were recorded while observers viewed video-clips displaying dynamic facial expressions. Low (LSA) and high (HSA) socially anxious undergraduates with clinical levels of anxiety judged expressers’ trustworthiness. Social anxiety was unrelated to trustworthiness ratings for faces with congruent happy eyes and a smile, and for neutral expressions. However, social anxiety was associated with reduced trustworthiness rating for faces with an ambiguous smile, when the eyes slightly changed to neutrality, surprise, fear, or anger. Importantly, HSA observers looked earlier and longer at the eye region, whereas LSA observers preferentially looked at the smiling mouth region. This attentional bias in social anxiety generalizes to all the facial expressions, while the interpretative bias is specific for ambiguous faces. Such biases are adaptive, as they facilitate an early detection of expressive incongruences and the recognition of untrustworthy expressers (e.g., with fake smiles), with no false alarms when judging truly happy or neutral faces.

292,"Alcohol withdrawal hallucinations in the general population, an epidemiological study","Hallucinations are sometimes encountered in the course of alcohol withdrawal; however, both the factors predisposing to alcohol withdrawal hallucinations (AWH) and the implications of AWH with respect to the mechanisms of hallucinations remain unclear. To clarify these issues, we used data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to investigate the demographic correlates, alcohol-use clinical patterns, and psychiatric comorbidities in two groups: drinkers with and without a history of AWH. We estimated the odds ratios for studied factors and used logistic regression analyses to compare the two groups. We found that over 2% of drinkers reported AWH (758 of a sample of 34,533 subjects). Alcohol tolerance and withdrawal seizures were highly associated with AWH, and exposure to alcohol during brain development was associated with a 10-fold increase in AWH compared to exposure during adulthood. African Americans, Native Americans, and unmarried subjects, as well as subjects with lower levels of education and lower levels of income were more likely to experience AWH. Furthermore, those with a history of AWH had higher odds ratios for most psychiatric illnesses than those without such history—yet of anxiety disorders, only panic was associated with AWH. These associations suggest that higher levels of education and of standard of living could protect against AWH; while social isolation, hypervigilance, exposure to alcohol during brain development, and long and severe exposure to alcohol could predispose to AWH.

293,Profile of psychiatric symptoms in methamphetamine users in China: Greater risk of psychiatric symptoms with a longer duration of use,"Chronic methamphetamine (MA) use is associated with psychiatric symptoms. This study explored pattern of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in MA users and their relationship to duration of MA use. A cross-sectional study was conducted among MA users at the Shenzhen Compulsory Drug Detoxification Center from April 2012 to October 2015. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory were used to assess psychiatric symptoms. Among 1277 MA users, 57.6% participants had any type of psychiatric symptoms including depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. A dose-response relationship was found between duration of MA use and risk of psychiatric symptoms. The odds ratios (OR) of depressive symptoms increased with the duration of MA use (1–5 years vs. &lt; 1 year: 1.74 [95% CI, 1.24–2.42]; ≥ 5 years vs. &lt; 1 year: 2.07 [1.19–3.61]), so did the ORs of co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms (1–5 years: 1.74 [1.20–2.51]; ≥ 5 years: 3.09 [1.76–5.40]). Methamphetamine-dependent individuals were four-times more likely to experience any type of psychiatric symptoms than non-dependent users. The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was high in chronic MA users and increased with MA use duration. Early prevention and treatment strategies targeting both MA use and associated psychiatric symptoms are needed.

294,A network analysis of eating disorder symptoms and characteristics in an inpatient sample,"Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by symptoms that reflect disturbed eating habits. Available data on EDs largely reflects a traditional latent variable model, whereby symptoms reflect an underlying entity. The network model is an alternative approach where ED symptoms do not reflect an inferred, unobservable category or dimension, but rather are themselves constitutive of the disorder. In the present study, data from ED patients ( n = 5193) that completed the Eating Disorders Inventory—2 ( EDI-2 ; Garner, 1991) before and after inpatient treatment were used to identify symptoms (i.e., body dissatisfaction) and characteristics (i.e., perfectionism) central to EDs. Results revealed that interoceptive awareness and ineffectiveness, but not body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, were central to the ED network at admission and discharge. Although effect sizes were small, multiple regression analyses revealed that ineffectiveness at admission predicted discharge BMI (over and above interoceptive awareness and BMI at admission) and discharge depression (over and above interoceptive awareness and depression at admission), but not discharge anxiety. These findings suggest that interoceptive awareness and ineffectiveness are central symptoms of EDs that may have implications for treatment outcome. The implications of these findings for conceptualizing the nature and treatment of EDs are discussed.

The aim of this study is to identify and to compare the clinical and socio-demographic profile of SUD outpatients with lifetime suicidal behavior (previous suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts) and to analyze the factors related to it. A retrospective cohort study of 696 addicted patients, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (APA, 2000) were collected from the Addiction Unit of Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Lifetime suicidal ideation in addicted patients is associated with presence of: borderline personality disorder (BPD), depressive disorders, sexual abuse, polydrug abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and motor impulsivity. The factors associated with suicide attempts were: borderline personality disorder, lifetime abuse (whether emotional, physical or sexual), co-occurrent psychotic disorders, polydrug abuse, anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms. We conclude that previous suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts should be considered in the clinical care of addicted patients. Factors related to both suicidal behaviors share similarities and differences according to our findings and need to be deeply explored in the future.

This study aimed to examine metacognitive beliefs as potential predictors of structured activity (measure of social functioning) in those with an At Risk Mental State (ARMS). Regression and correlation analyses were conducted. The sample included 109 young people. Age was found to be positively correlated to structured activity. Metacognitive beliefs concerning uncontrollability and danger of worry were found to negatively predict structured activity. This was after controlling for age, gender, treatment allocation, cognitive schemas, positive symptom severity, social anxiety, and depression. Metacognitive danger items were most important. Age was the only control variable found to be an independent predictor of structured activity in the regression model, despite negative bi-variate relationships with structured activity found across three cognitive schema subscales and social anxiety. This is the first study to find that higher negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger predict lower social functioning in an ARMS sample, and that the perception of thoughts being dangerous was of particular importance. Psychological interventions should consider targeting this metacognitive dimension to increase social functioning. Future longitudinal research is required to strengthen findings in this area.

This disorder has been consistently associated to the joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). In non-clinical samples, this collagen alteration has been also related to an enhanced sensitivity in some sensorial modalities. The main aim of this study is to explore the olfactory functioning in PD in relation to JHS. Sixty patients with PD and sixty healthy controls performed the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (SST) (threshold subtest), and completed the Affective Impact of Odors scale (AIO), the Relational Scale of Olfaction (EROL), and the Odor Awareness Scale (OAS). Clinical symptom rating scales and JHS assessment were also obtained. PD patients showed enhanced odor acuity, greater reactivity to smells and also increased odor awareness compared to the healthy controls. Within the patients group, those suffering from JHS displayed higher functioning in all olfactory domains compared to the non-JHS ones. The JHS and anxiety measures emerged as predictor variables of the olfactory function. The present findings highlight the importance of the olfactory function in PD and underline that both, JHS and anxiety, determine the olfactory characteristics in this disorder.

Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) concentrations were calculated for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MBSR participants had a significantly greater reduction in ACTH AUC compared to control participants. Similarly, the MBSR group had a greater reduction in inflammatory cytokines’ AUC concentrations. We found larger reductions in stress markers for patients with GAD in the MBSR class compared to control; this provides the first combined hormonal and immunological evidence that MBSR may enhance resilience to stress.

299,"Serum levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and oxytocin in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined presentation with and without comorbid conduct disorder","The present study aimed to investigate serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and oxytocin levels of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined presentation and those diagnosed with ADHD combined presentation and coexisting conduct disorder. A total of 74 drug-naive children with ADHD combined presentation alone, 32 children with ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder, and 42 healthy controls were included. The severities of ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms were assessed via parent- and teacher-rated questionnaires. The severity of aggression, anxiety, and depression symptoms of the children were assessed by the self-report inventories. Independent of potential confounders, including age, sex, pubertal stage, and severity of depression and anxiety, serum oxytocin levels of the ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder group were significantly lower than those of both the ADHD combined presentation alone and control groups. There was also a trend for the ADHD combined presentation + conduct disorder group to show lower serum DHEA levels than that of the ADHD combined presentation alone group. However, serum cortisol levels did not show significant alterations among the groups. These findings suggest that oxytocin and DHEA may play a role in the pathophysiology of conduct disorder, at least in the presence of ADHD combined presentation.

300,Clinical predictors of gaming abstinence in help-seeking adult problematic gamers,"Research into the effectiveness of interventions for problematic gaming has been limited by a lack of data concerning the clinical characteristics of voluntary treatment-seekers; the nature and history of their gaming problems; and, their reasons for seeking help. The study aimed to identify variables predictive of short-term commitment to gaming abstinence following initial voluntary contact with an online help service. A total of 186 adult gamers with gaming-related problems were recruited online. Participants completed the DSM-5 Internet gaming disorder (IGD) checklist, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, Internet Gaming Cognition Scale, Gaming Craving Scale, and Gaming Quality of Life Scale. A one-week follow up survey assessed adherence with intended gaming abstinence. Abstainers were less likely to have withdrawal symptoms and less likely to play action shooting games. Participants with mood symptoms (40% of the total) reported significantly more IGD symptoms, stronger maladaptive gaming cognitions (e.g., overvaluing game rewards), more previous occurrences of gaming problems, and poorer quality of life. However, mood symptoms did not predict abstinence from or continuation of gaming. Adults with gaming disorder seeking help to reduce their gaming may benefit initially from strategies that manage withdrawal and psychoeducation about riskier gaming activities.

301,Clinically significant personality traits in individuals at high risk of developing psychosis,"It is still unclear to what extent personality may influence the development of psychosis. We aimed to explore significant personality traits in individuals at high-risk (HR) for psychosis. Personalities of forty HR individuals and a matched sample of 40 healthy volunteers (HVs) were evaluated with the Millon Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III). They were also assessed with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI-II and BAI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0.0). Fisher's exact test was employed to compare frequency of traits. Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used to establish relationships between traits and symptoms, and the effect of age, sex and symptoms on such traits. Most HR individuals (97.5%) had at least one significant trait; 75% had personality disorders, mainly depressive, borderline or schizotypal. Only histrionic and narcissistic traits were more prevalent in HVs. Negative symptoms were related to schizoid and paranoid traits. Depression was more severe with borderline traits. Most HR individuals (67.6%) had more than one DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis, mainly depressive/anxiety disorders. Transition rate was low (5%). Certain personality profiles may not be markers for conversions to psychosis but contribute to high morbidity in HR individuals.

302,Correlates of bullying and its relationship with psychiatric disorders in Lebanese adolescents,"Understanding the contextual determinants of bullying behavior is pivotal for effective interventions. This paper describes the prevalence of bullying, its socio-demographic correlates and factors influencing its relationship with psychiatric disorders among a population-based sample of adolescents from Beirut recruited through a two-stage cluster sampling design. Recruited participants (n = 510) and their parents completed a battery of questionnaires and interviews including the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) and the Peer-Relations Questionnaire (PRQ). We found that around 30% of the adolescent participants were involved in bullying. Younger age, lower family income, lower parental education, receiving private tutoring, having an anxiety disorder and having a disruptive behavior disorder were correlated with being bullied by peers while lower family income, repeating a school-grade, and having a disruptive behavior disorder were associated with bullying others. Several factors including gender, age group, family income, and attending private versus public schools moderated the relationship between bullying behavior and having psychiatric disorders. Our findings thus highlight the complexity of the association between psychiatric disorders and bullying in settings like Lebanon, (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2018
303,"Cyberchondria: Overlap with health anxiety and unique relations with impairment, quality of life, and service utilization","Cyberchondria refers to a clinical phenomenon in which repeated Internet searches regarding medical information result in excessive concerns about physical health. Cyberchondria is positively associated with symptoms of health anxiety, though it remains unclear as to whether cyberchondria poses a unique public burden. The current study replicated previous findings regarding the relationship between cyberchondria and health anxiety, and extended those findings to examine the extent to which health anxiety and cyberchondria may be differentially associated with public health outcomes, including impairment, quality of life, and service utilization. Community participants ( N = 462) recruited via online crowdsourcing completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing cyberchondria, health anxiety, and measures of public health outcomes, including the WHOQOL and SDS. Bifactor latent variable modeling indicated that cyberchondria was closely related to, yet importantly distinct from, health anxiety. Moreover, when accounting for overlap with health anxiety, cyberchondria was associated with increased functional impairment and healthcare utilization. Results provide further support for the identification of cyberchondria as a distinct set of clinical symptoms that may pose a significant public health burden. Future research should determine ways in which to treat and/or prevent symptoms.

304,PTSD and depression in adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir: The payoffs of social support,"Exposure to disasters such as floods predisposes individuals for psychological distress such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Researchers exploring the association between flood-exposure and psychopathology attempt to understand the conditions and mechanisms through which potential benefits may occur. One such potential factor that may contribute to resilience in the face of disaster is social support system. However, there is scarcity of researches concerning the protective effects of social support following floods, in adult samples. Thus, the present study examined the moderating and indirect effects of perceived social support from family and friends in the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression. The study was a cross sectional in nature. Survey data were collected from 87 adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir valley, aged 30–40. High level of family and friends’ support reduced the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression whereas a low level of such support enhanced this association. Results also suggested that family support carried a significant proportion of variance in predicting depression. Given the potential for negative mental health outcomes following natural disasters, efforts to enhance adults’ social support may be especially important.

305,"Emotion regulation’s relationships with depression, anxiety and stress due to imagined smartphone and social media loss","A sample of 359 students participated in a web survey, administered the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) as a pre-test. We subsequently randomly assigned subjects to either 1) a smart phone loss group or 2) social media accounts loss group. We asked them to imagine losing two days’ access to the technology in their respective group, and rate associated symptoms using the DASS-21. Compared to subjects in the smartphone loss group, social media loss subjects evidenced stronger relations between suppressive emotion regulation with depression, anxiety and stress from imagined loss. Controlling for age and gender, social media loss subjects’ increased use of suppression, and decreased use of cognitive reappraisal in emotion regulation, were related to depression, stress and (for suppression only) anxiety due to imagined lost social media. Emotion regulation was not related to psychopathology for subjects in the smartphone loss scenario. Results suggest that emotion dysregulation may be associated with psychopathology from social media loss.

306,The traumatized body: Long-term PTSD and its implications for the orientation towards bodily signals,"Orientation to bodily signals is defined as the way somatic sensations are attended, perceived and interpreted. Research suggests that trauma exposure, particularly the pathological reaction to trauma (i.e., PTSD), is associated with catastrophic and frightful orientation to bodily signals. However, little is known regarding the long-term ramifications of trauma exposure and PTSD for orientation to bodily signals. Less is known regarding which PTSD symptom cluster manifests in the ‘somatic route’ through which orientation to bodily signals is altered. The current study examined the long-term implications of trauma and PTSD trajectories on orientation to bodily signals. Fifty-nine ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) and 44 controls were assessed for PTSD along three time-points (18, 30 and 35 years post-war). Orientation to bodily signals (pain catastrophizing and anxiety sensitivity–physical concerns) was assessed at T3. Participants with a chronic PTSD trajectory had higher pain catastrophizing compared to participants with no PTSD. PTSD symptom severity at T2 and T3 mediated the association between captivity and orientation. Among PTSD symptom clusters, hyperarousal at two time-points and intrusion at three time-point mediated the association between captivity and orientation. These findings allude to the cardinal role of long-term PTSD in the subjective experience of the body following trauma.

307,Body talk: Sex differences in the influence of alexithymia on physical complaints among psychiatric outpatients,"This study investigated the relationship between alexithymia and physical complaints among psychiatric outpatients, and whether sex moderated this relationship. Participants (N = 185) completed measures of physical complaints (bodily symptom burden, pain severity, pain interference), alexithymia, current symptom (depression, anxiety) distress, and somatosensory amplification (i.e., a person's tendency to be bothered by physical sensations). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, controlling for the influence of current psychiatric symptom distress and somatosensory amplification. Findings revealed differential relationships between alexithymia and physical complaints (pain interference) for women and men, in addition to main effects for sex and alexithymia. The findings suggest that the negative influence of alexithymia on bodily-related problems may not be universal.

308,Relationship between childhood trauma and suicide probability in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between childhood trauma with the probability of suicide in obsessive compulsive disorders. Sixty-seven patients who were diagnosed with OCD were included in the study out of the patients who were admitted to Malatya Training and Research Hospital psychiatry outpatient clinic. The research data were collected using Yale Brawn Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Beck Depression (BDS) and Beck Anxiety Scales (BAS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 (CTQ-28), and Suicide Probability Scale (SPS). CTQ was detected as ≥ 35 in 36 of 67 patients who were included in the study. Aggression ( p = 0.003), sexual ( p = 0.007) and religious ( p = 0.023) obsessions and rituelistic ( p = 0.000) compulsions were significantly higher in the group with CTQ ≥ 35. Mild correlation was detected between the SPS score and the scores of CTQ. Correlation remained even when the effect of BAS and BDS scores were excluded. At the end of our study, childhood traumas were found to be associated with obsessive symptoms. In the group with childhood trauma, increased suicide probability was detected independently from depression and anxiety.

309,Public stigma of prolonged grief disorder: An experimental study,"Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), characterized by severe, persistent and disabling grief, is being considered for inclusion in the International Classification of Diseases’ 11 (ICD-11) and a related disorder, Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder (PCBD), is included for further investigation in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). Establishing diagnoses for pathological grief may lead to stigmatization. Additionally, it has been argued that people experiencing severe grief responses after loss of non-family members (i.e., disenfranchised grief) may experience more stigmatizing reactions. Yet, no research to date has investigated this. To fill this gap in knowledge, 379 adults from the general population were randomly allocated to read one of 4 different vignettes of a person with and without a grief disorder diagnosis who had lost a friend or a spouse. After reading the vignettes, we assessed: 1) characteristics ascribed to the person, 2) emotional reactions to the person, and 3) desire for social distance. Notably, people with a diagnosis were attributed relatively more negative characteristics, and elicited more anger, anxiety and pro-social emotions and a stronger desire for social distance. Stigmatization and its negative consequences appear a valid concern to the establishment of pathological grief disorders in diagnostic manuals.

310,27 ways to meet PTSD: Using the PTSD-checklist for DSM-5 to examine PTSD core criteria,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been criticized for including symptoms that substantially overlap with other depression and anxiety disorders. To address this concern, Brewin et al. (2009) reformulated the diagnosis around a core symptom set. Although several studies have examined the utility of the core criteria in predicting diagnostic status, none have done so using a self-report screening instrument. The sample included 617 veterans presenting for outpatient psychological services. As a part of the intake process, veterans completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Veterans meeting core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 22 times more likely to meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD (OR = 22.94; CI [12.76, 41.25]). Further, veterans who met core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 2 times more likely (OR = 2.34; 95.0% CI [1.53, 3.59]) to meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD.

311,Assessing advanced theory of mind and alexithymia in patients suffering from enduring borderline personality disorder,"Findings on the theory of mind (ToM) abilities in borderline personality disorder (BPD) have been inconsistent. Surprisingly, no studies have focused on the complex aspects of ToM while simultaneously measuring alexithymia as well as comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, therefore, our study aimed to fill this gap. 30 female patients with BPD and 38 healthy controls (HCs) completed the Faux Pas Test (FPT) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20). The clinical and intellectual assessment comprised of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis II Disorders (SCID-II), the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale–Revised (CESD-R), and the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Women with BPD scored significantly worse than HCs on overall ToM abilities. After controlling for the intelligence level, depressive symptoms, and state and trait anxiety, both groups presented a similar overall level of alexithymia. No correlation between the FPT and TAS-20 scores was found, suggesting that both constructs might be unrelated in BPD. Because ToM dysfunctions seem not to result from comorbid clinical symptoms, trait anxiety, or intellectual abilities, our study results suggest that ToM deficits might be considered a core feature of BPD.

312,Acculturative stress and mental health among economically disadvantaged spanish-speaking latinos in primary care: The role of anxiety sensitivity,"The present study examined the role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between acculturative stress and mood and anxiety symptoms and disorders among Latinos seeking health services at a primary healthcare facility. Participants included 142 adult Latinos (86.6% female, M age = 39.05 years, SD = 12.46%, and 96.3% reported Spanish as their first language). Results indicated that acculturative stress was indirectly related to the number of mood and anxiety disorders, anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms through anxiety sensitivity. The observed effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by gender, age, marital status, educational status, employment status, years living in the United States, and negative affectivity. Overall, the present findings suggest that there is merit in focusing further scientific attention on the interplay between acculturative stress and anxiety sensitivity to better understand and inform interventions to reduce anxiety/depressive vulnerability among Latinos in primary care.

313,"Self-reported volitional control in adolescents and young adults from a community cohort: Associations with current, past and future mental disorders","Alterations in volitional control have been found for various mental disorders. However, it remains unclear to which degree such alterations vary by type of psychopathology and constitute preceding vulnerabilities or correlates of mental disorders. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed among adolescents and young adults from the community at baseline (age 14–24) and in up to 3 follow-up assessments over 10 years ( n = 2515) using a standardized diagnostic interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI). Self-reported volitional control was assessed at second follow-up (T2) when subjects were aged 17–28 using the German version of the Short Form of the Volitional Components Inventory. Linear regressions adjusted for sex, age and lifetime disorders revealed that anxiety and affective disorders were associated with widespread alterations in self-reported volitional control (lower self regulation, higher self inhibition and volitional inhibition), while substance use disorders were specifically associated with higher volitional inhibition. Logistic regressions adjusted for sex, age and prior lifetime psychopathology revealed that lower self-reported volitional control at T2 predicted incident panic, social phobia and substance use at T3 (follow-up interval M = 4.8 years). Findings point toward at least partly disorder-specific alterations in volitional control in mental disorders, which might be antecedent vulnerability factors and thus useful to guide early recognition and prevention.

314,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with attachment insecurities, dissociation and alexithymia in bipolar disorder","Child maltreatment is a public health issue that is a well-established risk factor for many psychological conditions, including bipolar disorder. The current study is one of the first to investigate associations among child maltreatment, dissociative symptomatology, alexithymia, anxiety, depression, and attachment insecurities. 40 patients with bipolar disorder-I and 40 healthy subjects matched for age, gender, and education participated in the study. The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) were completed by participants. In comparison to control participants, patients with bipolar disorder-I reported significantly more frequent abusive experiences in childhood, higher levels of attachment insecurities, more severe pathological and somatoform dissociation, as well as higher scores on measures of alexithymia, anxiety, depression and psychological stress. Reports of psychopathology among first-degree relatives (OR = 102.169, 95%IC = 4.596–2271.255; P &lt; 0.01) and childhood emotional trauma (OR = 1.032; 95%CI = 0.782–1.363, P = 0.05) significantly contributed to bipolar disorder-I diagnosis. In contrast, absorption was negatively associated with bipolar illness (OR = 0.852; 95% CI = 0.747–0.973, P &lt; 0.05). Our results showed significant associations between childhood trauma exposure and risk of bipolar disorder. Moreover, the results demonstrate that emotional abuse exposure predicts bipolar illness.

It was evaluated if the development of a social contact program in a non-segregated space and respecting criteria of contact hypothesis reduced Self-Stigma and Public Stigma and, increased Self-Esteem. A pre-post intervention design was used with a sample of 47 subjects, 25 with different mental health diagnoses (Psychotic Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and 22 without mental health problems, aged between 15 and 35 years. Five workshops of social contact and creativity were carried out during five months with a 2-h weekly meeting. The results analysis revealed a significant reduction in Self-Stigma for participants with mental health problems and may suggest a slight reduction in Public Stigma as well as a slight increase in the level of Self-Esteem of all participants. These findings suggest that programs of this nature reduce Self-Stigma and facilitate social inclusion in young adults and adolescents with and without mental health problems.

316,Associations between severity of anxiety and clinical and biological features of major affective disorders,"Patients with major affective disorders (MAFD) with comorbid anxiety show a greater functional impairment than those without anxiety. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of anxiety in MAFD, namely bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), and MAFD characteristics and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Recruited were 82 participants with anxiety disoders and 83 without anxiety disoders, including 101 MAFD patients and 51 healthy controls. We used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) to measure severity of anxiety and made the diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and phobias. The HAM-A score is significantly predicted by higher number of depressive episodes, GAD and phobias, childhood trauma, tobacco use disorder, metabolic syndrome and lowered HDL-cholesterol. Increased HAM-A scores are, independently from severity of depression, associated with lowered quality of life, increased disabilities and suicidal ideation. Lithium treatment significantly lowers HAM-A scores. It is concluded that severity of anxiety significantly worsens the phenomenology of MAFD. Therefore, treatments of MAFD should target increased severity of anxiety and its risk factors including low HDL-cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, childhood trauma and tobacco use disorder.

317,Patients with OCD report lower quality of life after controlling for expert-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety,"Background: One to three percent of the adult population suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). Previous studies have also shown that, compared to controls, patients with OCD report a lower QoL. The latter is associated with self-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety. The aim of the present study was to compare the quality of life of OCD patients with that of healthy controls, while introducing expert-rated symptoms of depression and anxiety as covariates. Gender was also taken into account as an additional associated factor. Method: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with OCD (mean age: 32 years; 64% females) and healthy 100 controls (mean age: 31 years; 59% females; no discernible psychiatric disorder) took part in the present cross-sectional study. All participants completed questionnaires covering socio-demographic characteristics and dimensions of QoL. Experts rated participants’ symptoms of OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with OCD reported a lower QoL, and had higher symptoms of depression and anxiety. This pattern was particularly pronounced among female patients with OCD. QoL was lower in patients with OCD, even when controlling for depression and anxiety. Results from binary logistic regressions showed that female gender, low QoL and higher symptoms of OCD, depression and anxiety together predicted status as patient with OCD. Conclusions: Compared to healthy controls, patients with OCD have a poorer quality of life and this is independent of depression or anxiety, and is particularly pronounced among female patients. Thus, treatment of OCD might take into account patients’ comorbidities and gender.

318,"Stress reactivity links childhood trauma exposure to an admixture of depressive, anxiety, and psychosis symptoms","Childhood trauma exposure has been associated with a clinically relevant mixed phenotype of psychopathology composed of depressive, anxiety, and psychosis symptoms, across healthy and clinical samples. Altered stress-reactivity after exposure to childhood trauma may be a plausible underlying mechanism explaining this association. In a general population sample of female twins (T0 = 564; T1 = 483), associations between childhood trauma exposure and symptom profile (no symptoms, isolated symptoms, or a mixed phenotype) on the one hand, and daily life stress reactivity on the other were investigated. Daily life stress reactivity was measured using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), and was defined as negative affect reactivity to minor daily life stressors. Individuals exposed to childhood trauma who reported a mixed phenotype of psychopathology showed a significant increase in emotional reactivity to daily life stress (activity and social stress), compared with trauma-exposed individuals without a mixed phenotype. In the trauma-exposed mixed phenotype group, increased emotional reactivity to event-stress predicted more severe symptoms at ± 14 month follow-up. This study found evidence that may link heightened emotional reactivity to stress in individuals with a trauma history to the risk for later comorbid psychopathology.

319,"Major and minor life events, personality and psychopathology in children with tourette syndrome","Environmental, psychological, and biological interactions underlie many psychopathologies. Tourette's Syndrome (TS) has an obvious biological substrate but environmental factors and personality play substantial roles in its expression. We aimed to study the interrelationships between stressful life events, personality traits, tics, and comorbid disorders in children with TS. To this end, 132 children with TS and 49 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Major life events in the 12-months prior to testing and minor life events in the month prior to testing were retrospectively assessed using the Life Experiences Survey (LES) and the Brief Adolescent Life Events Scale (BALES), respectively. Personality was assessed with the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI). Tics, obsessive compulsive symptoms, attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms, anxiety, depression and aggression were assessed by self-report questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. We found that major life events correlated with the severity of tics expression and complexity, and comorbid psychopathology. Minor life events correlated with more severe symptomatology. High levels of harm avoidance were related to more obsessions, anxiety, and depression whereas high levels of self-directedness were protective. To conclude, TS expression in childhood should be understood as the result of an interaction between biological, personality and environmental factors.

320,Attachment and motivational systems: Relevance of sensitivity to punishment for eating disorder psychopathology,"An altered balance of reward and inhibition systems may explain Eating Disorder (ED) behaviors and could be related to difficulties in socio-emotional processing. According to attachment theory, early interaction with caregivers affects the ability to regulate emotion in adult interpersonal situation. The aim of our study was to investigate if insecure attachment may be related to ED symptomatology through changes in reward and inhibition systems. Seventy-eight people affected by EDs and 45 healthy controls (HC) filled in the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Behavioral Inhibition System-Behavioral Activation System Scale (BIS-BAS) and the Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2) questionnaire. ED people reported significantly higher scores than HC in EDI-2 scores, all dimensions of insecure attachment style and sensitivity to punishment (BIS score). In ED patients, ASQ anxiety scores correlated with almost all EDI-2 subscores and sensitivity to punishment. The association between anxious attachment style and ED symptomatology (drive to thinness and body dissatisfaction) was totally mediated by an indirect effect of sensitivity to punishment. These findings suggest, for the first time, increased sensitivity to punishment as a pathway that may explain the relationship between anxious attachment and ED symptomatology highlighting the relevance to target social experiences as an important psychotherapeutic focus.

A total of 1102 college students from two local universities participated in the study; their average age was 20.46 ± 1.13 years. The participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Early Maladaptive Schemas Scale (EMSs), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Later psychological distress had a significant positive correlation with childhood EMSs, and almost all of the variables measuring childhood maltreatment had a significant positive correlation with EMSs. Structural equation modeling and mediation analyses were conducted based on Bootstrap estimations; the mediation analyses demonstrated the utility of EMSs as the mechanism through which childhood maltreatment has an indirect effect on later psychological distress. Moreover, the study found that emotional abuse had the strongest overall effect of all five types of child maltreatment on later psychological distress, followed in order of magnitude by emotional neglect, physical neglect, sexual abuse, and physical abuse.

Mean composite cognitive insight scores from participants (N = 60) (2.97 ± 2.649) were in the lower range as compared to published literature. Cognitive insight scores as well as self-reflectiveness subscale scores, but not self-certainty scores, correlated significantly with the QLS scores p &lt; 0.001. Results suggest that better cognitive insight, especially self-reflectiveness, may be linked to better quality of life. Self-reflectiveness could be a useful construct to address in psychotherapy to improve rehabilitation.

323,"The interplay between trait anxiety, cognitive biases and attentional control in healthy individuals with psychotic-like experiences","Although both anxiety and cognitive biases contribute to psychosis, it is still unclear whether these factors interact in their influence on psychotic symptoms. The aim of the study was to examine the interactions between trait anxiety, cognitive biases and delusion-like experiences (PLEs) in a non-clinical sample; the moderational role of attentional control on this relationship was also considered in the study. Two subgroups of participants, 92 individuals (M = 24.76; SD = 6.33) with heightened (HA) trait anxiety and 78 individuals (M = 23.09; SD = 5.66) with lowered (LA) trait anxiety took part in the study. Anxiety, cognitive biases and attentional control were measured using self-report questionnaires. Regression analyses and moderation analyses were performed. External attribution bias predicted psychotic-like experiences in both groups, whereas attention to threat bias and belief inflexibility predicted PLEs within LA group. Further moderation analyses revealed that in LA group attention to threat bias increases PLEs only among individuals with a high and moderate ability to focus attention. The results indicated that trait anxiety is an important factor influencing the relationship between cognitive biases and PLEs, and that the ability to voluntarily focus attention is a significant moderator of the linkage between attention to threat bias and delusion-like experiences among low-anxious healthy individuals.

324,Is the first cut really the deepest? Frequency and recency of nonsuicidal self-injury in relation to psychopathology and dysregulation,"Research on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has moved beyond examination of factors that associate with the mere presence or absence of the behavior, and into more nuanced examination of which discrete features of NSSI behavior relate to pathology. This study examined two features of NSSI, frequency of occurrence and recency, as cross-sectional predictors of psychopathology in a large community sample of adults with a history of NSSI ( N = 315). Results of 2 × 2 factorial ANOVAs testing the interactive effects of NSSI frequency (clinical, subclinical) and recency (current, past) revealed that current NSSI was consistently associated with poorer emotional and behavioral health (e.g., greater symptoms of depression, panic, and anxiety, worse emotion regulation, greater alcohol misuse). Results for NSSI frequency were more variable, though preliminary evidence suggested significant interactions of current NSSI and clinical frequency on emotion dysregulation, general anxiety, and panic. Possible clinical and empirical implications of the NSSI disorder frequency criteria proposed in DSM-5 are discussed.

325,Adverse life events and the onset of anxiety disorders,"This study tested the hypothesis that adverse events are associated with increased risk of onset of anxiety disorders. Data from Waves 1 (N = 43,093; 2001–2002) and 2 (N = 34,653; 2004–2005) of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were used to assess whether adverse events at baseline are associated with increased risk of anxiety disorder onset over three years of follow up. Sixty-six percent (SE: 1.0) of respondents with an anxiety disorder in the intervening period between Waves 1 and 2 had experienced an adverse life event in the year prior to the Wave 1 interview. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics, adverse life events at baseline were associated with anxiety disorder onset within the three-year follow up period. The pattern of association between adverse events and anxiety disorder onset was similar across sub-types, and injury, illness or death of family or close friends consistently had the strongest association with anxiety disorder onset. These findings suggest that adverse life events play a role in the onset of anxiety disorders.

326,Responsibility beliefs and persecutory delusions,"Recent research implicates cognitive processes traditionally linked to anxiety disorders in the maintenance of paranoia. Responsibility beliefs have traditionally been associated with OCD, and recent research suggests they may be transdiagnostic. The present study reports the first data on responsibility beliefs in individuals with persecutory delusions. 30 people with persecutory delusions completed measures of psychotic symptoms and responsibility beliefs. Participants were also asked to identify who they held responsible for their persecution. Quantitative data on responsibility beliefs were compared with 29 matched non-clinical control participants, and with published data from patients with OCD and anxiety disorders. People with persecutory delusions identified a number of different entities responsible for harm. The persecutory delusions group had higher responsibility beliefs than those with OCD, anxiety disorders and nonclinical controls. The results suggest that responsibility beliefs are a facet of the phenomenology of persecutory beliefs. Cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis might usefully draw from OCD interventions and focus on responsibility beliefs, perhaps especially in Bad Me paranoia.

327,Psychological burden and caregiver-reported non-adherence to psychotropic medications among patients with schizophrenia,"The study examined the association between psychological distress, caregiving burden and caregiver-reported medication adherence in 444 informal family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. Participants were assessed on the Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale, Zarit Burden Interview and the Medication Adherence Report Scale. Caregivers reported a non-adherence rate of 54.5% among patients with schizophrenia. Poor adherence to antipsychotics was significantly associated with caregiver burden (p &lt; 0.01) and experience of anxiety (p &lt; 0.0001). The burden of caregiving should be considered during the assessment of adherence. The findings suggest a need for culturally appropriate interventions that improve antipsychotic adherence of outpatients with schizophrenia with specific attention to the burden of the caregiver.

328,Heart rate variability associated with posttraumatic stress disorder in victims’ families of sewol ferry disaster,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is caused by a major traumatic event, has been associated with autonomic nervous function. However, there have been few explorations of measuring biological stress in the victims’ family members who have been indirectly exposed to the disaster. Therefore, this longitudinal study examined the heart rate variability (HRV) of the family members of victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. We recruited 112 family members of victims 18 months after the disaster. Sixty-seven participants were revisited at the 30 months postdisaster time point. HRV and psychiatric symptoms including PTSD, depression and anxiety were evaluated at each time point. Participants with PTSD had a higher low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF:HF ratio) than those without PTSD. Logistic regression analysis showed that the LF:HF ratio at 18 months postdisaster was associated with a PTSD diagnosis at 30 months postdisaster. These results suggest that disrupted autonomic nervous system functioning for longer than a year after trauma exposure contributes to predicting PTSD vulnerability. Our finding may contribute to understand neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying secondary traumatic stress. Future studies will be needed to clarify the interaction between autonomic regulation and trauma exposure.

329,Impaired central coherence in patients with anorexia nervosa,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of central coherence in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). 22 female patients with AN (median age = 31.50 (QD = 8.13) years) and 33 female healthy controls (HC) (median age = 28.00 (QD = 8.50) years) participated in the study. Their central coherence was assessed with the Rey Complex Figure Task (RCFT). Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form JYZ. The results showed that AN patients’ Central Coherence Index and accuracy scores in copy, 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks of the RCFT were significantly lower than those of HC. Moreover, the significant differences in Central Coherence Index score in copy task and accuracy scores in 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks remained when the effects of depression, anxiety and starvation were eliminated statistically. These findings may explain some characteristics of AN patients such as focusing on local rather than global picture in their perception of body or life.

330,Group metacognitive therapy vs. Mindfulness meditation therapy in a transdiagnostic patient sample: A randomised feasibility trial,"Two transdiagnostic therapies for treating psychological disorder are Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). These two approaches have yet to be compared and therefore the current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a study of group MCT and MBSR in treating anxiety and depression. A feasibility trial with 40 participants (aged 19–56) was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either eight weeks of group MCT or MBSR. The primary outcome was feasibility which included recruitment rates, retention and treatment acceptability. The primary symptom outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score, which provided an overall measure of distress. Both treatments were found to be acceptable with low attrition and similar ratings of acceptability. Changes in outcomes were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effect models. Preliminary analyses revealed that MCT was more effective in treating anxiety and depression in comparison to MBSR, and in reducing both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Reliable improvement rates favoured MCT at post-treatment and 6-month follow up. Both treatments appeared to be feasible and acceptable in treating transdiagnostic samples; however, a larger, definitive trial is required. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

331,Markers of DNA/RNA damage from oxidation as predictors of a registry-based diagnosis of psychiatric illness in type 2 diabetic patients,"Oxidative stress is a potential biological mediator of the higher rates of psychiatric illness (PI) observed after the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We investigated validated urinary markers of systemic DNA/RNA damage from oxidation (8-oxodG/8-oxoGuo respectively) as predictors of incident PI in a cohort of 1381 newly diagnosed T2DM patients, who were followed prospectively for a total of 19 years after diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnoses were from Danish national registries. Patients were examined at the time of diagnosis and at a 6-year follow-up. At baseline, 8-oxodG was slightly lower in PI vs. non-PI patients, while at 6-year follow-up, 8-oxoGuo was significantly higher in PI patients. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found that higher levels of 8-oxodG at 6-year follow-up significantly predicted lower incidence of PI after the adjustment for confounders. In a subgroup analysis, this association was most predominant in minor PIs (unipolar depression and anxiety) compared to major PIs such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These observations indicate that higher levels of systemic oxidative stress are not associated with a higher risk of PI after T2DM onset. Only PI patients treated in hospital care were included in the registries, and the conclusion thus only applies to these individuals.

81,Disparities in the management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with psychiatric disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background The high cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality reported for patients with psychiatric disorders may possibly be due to a poorer management of CV risk factors (CVRFs). However, these healthcare disparities remain poorly understood. In this paper, studies comparing the management of smoking, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, in patients with and without depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar or personality disorder, were reviewed. Methods Prospective studies comparing rates of screening, diagnosis, treatment and control of CVRFs were searched in PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, Scopus and Web of Science (inception to January 2017). The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria were used. Studies were assessed for quality. Wherever possible, meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the findings. Results Twenty studies, out of the 18 333 references initially identified, were included. Most studies were heterogeneous in design. Two areas permitted meta-analyses: the pooled odds ratio for quitting smoking for those with depression was 0.64 (0.49–0.80) p &lt; 0.001; the pooled difference of glycated haemoglobin for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression was 0.18 (0.06–0.31) p = 0.005. Individual studies showed associations between: schizophrenia and lower probability of having smoking habit recorded; schizoid personality disorder and higher probability of remaining non-smokers after quitting; anxiety and poorer control of type I diabetes; depression, anxiety or schizophrenia and lower probability of having a diagnosis of hypertension; schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and lower use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. Conclusions A proactive clinical management, together with further studies, are needed to reduce the CV morbidity and mortality of patients with psychiatric disorders.",2132689319.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
82,Social anxiety in the eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Social anxiety disorder is one of the most common comorbid conditions in eating disorders (EDs). The aim of the current review and meta-analysis is to provide a qualitative summary of what is known about social anxiety (SA) in EDs, as well as to compare levels of SA in those with EDs and healthy controls. Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies using self-report measures of SA in ED populations. In total, 38 studies were identified, 12 of which were included in the meta-analyses. For both anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa, there were significant differences between ED groups and HCs, with medium to large effect sizes. Findings from the qualitative review indicate that levels of SA are similar across the ED diagnoses, and SA improves with treatment in AN. In addition, high levels of SA are associated with more severe ED psychopathology, but not body mass index. These findings add to the wider literature on socio-emotional functioning in EDs, and may have implications for treatment strategies.",2170362042.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
83,Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive profile in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies,"Background The accurate clinical characterisation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this study was to compare the neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive profile of MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) with Alzheimer's disease MCI (MCI-AD). Methods Participants were ⩾60 years old with MCI. Each had a thorough clinical and neuropsychological assessment and 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single photon emission computed tomography FP-CIT SPECT). MCI-LB was diagnosed if two or more diagnostic features of dementia with Lewy bodies were present (visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, motor parkinsonism, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder or positive FP-CIT SPECT). A Lewy body Neuropsychiatric Supportive Symptom Count (LBNSSC) was calculated based on the presence or absence of the supportive neuropsychiatric symptoms defined by the 2017 DLB diagnostic criteria: non-visual hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, depression and apathy. Results MCI-LB ( n = 41) had a higher LBNSSC than MCI-AD ( n = 24; 1.8 ± 1.1 v. 0.7 ± 0.9, p = 0.001). 67% of MCI-LB had two or more of those symptoms, compared with 16% of MCI-AD (Likelihood ratio = 4.2, p &lt; 0.001). MCI-LB subjects scored lower on tests of attention, visuospatial function and verbal fluency. However, cognitive test scores alone did not accurately differentiate MCI-LB from MCI-AD. Conclusions MCI-LB is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms and a cognitive profile similar to established DLB. This supports the concept of identifying MCI-LB based on the presence of core diagnostic features of DLB and abnormal FP-CIT SPECT imaging. The presence of supportive neuropsychiatric clinical features identified in the 2017 DLB diagnostic criteria was helpful in differentiating between MCI-LB and MCI-AD.",2101228360.0, Journal Article,2018
84,The impact of schizophrenia and mood disorder risk alleles on emotional problems: investigating change from childhood to middle age,"Background Previous studies find that both schizophrenia and mood disorder risk alleles contribute to adult depression and anxiety. Emotional problems (depression or anxiety) begin in childhood and show strong continuities into adult life; this suggests that symptoms are the manifestation of the same underlying liability across different ages. However, other findings suggest that there are developmental differences in the etiology of emotional problems at different ages. To our knowledge, no study has prospectively examined the impact of psychiatric risk alleles on emotional problems at different ages in the same individuals. Methods Data were analyzed using regression-based analyses in a prospective, population-based UK cohort (the National Child Development Study). Schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD) polygenic risk scores (PRS) were derived from published Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association studies. Emotional problems were assessed prospectively at six time points from age 7 to 42 years. Results Schizophrenia PRS were associated with emotional problems from childhood [age 7, OR 1.09 (1.03–1.15), p = 0.003] to mid-life [age 42, OR 1.10 (1.05–1.17), p &lt; 0.001], while MDD PRS were associated with emotional problems only in adulthood [age 42, OR 1.06 (1.00–1.11), p = 0.034; age 7, OR 1.03 (0.98–1.09), p = 0.228]. Conclusions Our prospective investigation suggests that early (childhood) emotional problems in the general population share genetic risk with schizophrenia, while later (adult) emotional problems also share genetic risk with MDD. The results suggest that the genetic architecture of depression/anxiety is not static across development.",2099396884.0, Journal Article,2018
85,Attention bias modification augments cognitive–behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial,"Background Cognitive–behavioral group therapy (CBGT) is a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, since many patients remain symptomatic post-treatment, there is a need for augmenting procedures. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the potential augmentation effect of attention bias modification (ABM) for CBGT. Methods Fifty patients with SAD from three therapy groups were randomized to receive an 18-week standard CBGT with either ABM designed to shift attention away from threat (CBGT + ABM), or a placebo protocol not designed to modify threat-related attention (CBGT + placebo). Therapy groups took place in a large mental health center. Clinician and self-report measures of social anxiety and depression were acquired pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Attention bias was assessed at pre- and post-treatment. Results Patients randomized to the CBGT + ABM group, relative to those randomized to the CBGT + placebo group, showed greater reductions in clinician-rated SAD symptoms post-treatment, with effects maintained at 3-month follow-up. Group differences were not evident for self-report or attention-bias measures, with similar reductions in both groups. Finally, reduction in attention bias did not mediate the association between group and reduction in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Structured Interview (LSAS) scores. Conclusions This is the first RCT to examine the possible augmenting effect of ABM added to group-based cognitive–behavioral therapy for adult SAD. Training patients’ attention away from threat might augment the treatment response to standard CBGT in SAD, a possibility that could be further evaluated in large-scale RCTs.",2099396805.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
86,The effects of psychotherapy for depression on anxiety symptoms: a meta-analysis,"Background More than half of patients who present with depressive disorders also have elevated comorbid anxiety symptoms. Given the high comorbidity between these disorders, it is important to understand the extent that psychotherapies for depression additionally ameliorate symptoms of anxiety. Methods Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, PSYCinfo, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials. Included studies were randomized controlled trials that compared psychotherapy compared with a control condition for the treatment of adults with a primary diagnosis or elevated symptoms of depression and that examined the effects of treatment on anxiety outcomes. Acute phase depression and anxiety (continuous measure) outcomes were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated by subtracting the average post-treatment scores of the psychotherapy group from the average post-treatment scores of the comparison group divided by the pooled standard deviation. Results Fifty-two studies of varying quality met the inclusion criteria. Pooled effect sizes showed that anxiety outcomes were significantly lower in the psychotherapy conditions than in control conditions at post-treatment [ g = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44–0.60; NNT (numbers-needed-to-treat) = 3.50]. Moderate heterogeneity was observed ( I 2 = 55%, 95% CI 40–66). Bivariate metaregression analysis revealed a significant association between depression and anxiety effect sizes at post-treatment Longer-term follow-ups of up to 14 months post-baseline showed indications for a small lasting effect of psychotherapy on anxiety outcomes ( g = 0.27). Conclusions This meta-analysis provides evidence that psychotherapy aimed at depression can also reduce anxiety symptoms in relation to control conditions.",2099396239.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
87,Preschool psychiatric disorders: homotypic and heterotypic continuity through middle childhood and early adolescence,"Background Many preschool-age children meet criteria for psychiatric disorders, and rates approach those observed in later childhood and adolescence. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research examining the outcomes of preschool diagnoses. Methods Families with a 3-year-old child ( N = 559) were recruited from the community. Primary caregivers were interviewed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment when children were 3 years old ( n = 541), and, along with children, using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version when children were 9 and 12 years old. Results Rates of disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) decreased from preschool to middle childhood and early adolescence, whereas rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increased. Rates of any psychiatric disorder and depression increased from preschool to early adolescence only. Preschoolers with a diagnosis were over twice as likely to have a diagnosis during later periods. Homotypic continuity was present for anxiety disorders from preschool to middle childhood, for ADHD from preschool to early adolescence, and for DBD through both later time points. There was heterotypic continuity between preschool anxiety and early adolescent depression, and between preschool ADHD and early adolescent DBD. Dimensional symptom scores showed homotypic continuity for all diagnostic categories and showed a number of heterotypic associations as well. Conclusions Results provide moderate support for the predictive validity of psychiatric disorders in preschoolers. Psychopathology in preschool is a significant risk factor for future psychiatric disorders during middle childhood and early adolescence.",2099396139.0, Journal Article,2018
88,Executive function and other cognitive deficits are distal risk factors of generalized anxiety disorder 9 years later,"Objective The cognitive model (Hirsch &amp; Mathews, 2012) and attentional control theory (Eysenck &amp; Derakshan, 2011) postulate that compromised executive function (EF) and other cognitive constructs are negatively linked to increased excessive and uncontrollable worry, the core symptom of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the prospective link between neuropsychological constructs and GAD are not well understood. Methods A nationally representative sample of 2605 community-dwelling adults whose average age was 55.20 ( s.d. = 11.41, range 33–84; 56.31% females) participated at baseline and 9-year follow-up. Baseline neuropsychological function and symptoms were measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone and Composite International Diagnostic Interview – Short Form. Multivariate Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were conducted with 11 baseline covariates entered simultaneously: age, gender, years of formal education, perceived control, hypertension/diabetes, body mass index, exercise status, as well as GAD severity, panic disorder severity, and depression severity. Those with baseline GAD were also removed. Results Lower Time 1 composite global cognition z -score independently predicted higher Time 2 GAD severity and diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40–0.89, p = 0.01]. Poor inhibition, set-shifting, working memory (WM) updating, inductive reasoning, and global cognition sequentially forecasted heightened GAD. However, processing speed, verbal WM, verbal fluency, and episodic memory did not predict future GAD. Conclusion Global cognition, inductive reasoning, inhibition, set-shifting, and WM updating EF impairments may be distal risk factors for elevated GAD nearly a decade later.",2082020049.0, Journal Article,2018
89,Social anxiety disorder: looking back and moving forward,"Fifty years have passed since social anxiety disorder (SAD) was first differentiated from other phobias. In the years since research has largely aligned with the zeitgeist of categorical classificatory frameworks, and has spanned identifying causes, maintenance factors and innovative interventions. Despite significant advances in the field, the capacity to conceptualise SAD as an independent entity is limited given the heterogeneity and dimensionality of diagnostic criteria, high rates of comorbidity, and non-specificity of aetiological mechanisms, maintaining factors and approaches to treatment. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative was developed in an effort to overcome the inherent limitations posed by descriptive diagnostic systems – particularly in terms of reliability and validity – and in doing so seeks to facilitate research into underlying pathophysiological and behavioural mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. The RDoC framework is furnished with a ‘matrix’, which in essence corresponds to a set of research principles that attempt to reconcile neuroscience and psychopathology. This review outlines a rationale for integrating SAD research with the RDoC approach, and offers examples of how future studies may wish to frame hypotheses and design experiments as the field moves towards classifying dimensions of psychopathology through a mechanistic understanding of underlying neurobiological and behavioural processes.",2082019922.0, Journal Article,2018
90,Reduced cortical thickness and increased gyrification in generalized anxiety disorder: a 3 T MRI study,"Background Although the study of the neuroanatomical correlates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is gaining increasing interest, up to now the cortical anatomy of GAD patients has been poorly investigated and still no data on cortical gyrification are available. The aim of the present study is to quantitatively examine the cortical morphology in patients with GAD compared with healthy controls (HC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the gyrification patterns in GAD. Methods A total of 31 GAD patients and 31 HC underwent 3 T structural MRI. For each subject, cortical surface area (CSA), cortical thickness (CT), gray matter volume (GMV), and local gyrification index (LGI) were estimated in 19 regions of interest using the Freesurfer software. These parameters were then compared between the two groups using General Linear Model designs. Results Compared with HC, GAD patients showed: (1) reduced CT in right caudal middle frontal gyrus ( p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), (2) hyper-gyrification in right fusiform, inferior temporal, superior parietal and supramarginal gyri and in left supramarginal and superior frontal gyri ( p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). No significant alterations in CSA and GMV were observed. Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis of a neuroanatomical basis for GAD, highlighting a possible key role of the right hemisphere. The alterations of CT and gyrification in GAD suggest a neurodevelopmental origin of the disorder. Further studies on GAD are needed to understand the evolution of the cerebral morphology with age and during the clinical course of the illness.",2082019560.0, Journal Article,2018
91,Ethnic density effects for adult mental health: systematic review and meta-analysis of international studies,"Background Despite increased ethnic diversity in more economically developed countries it is unclear whether residential concentration of ethnic minority people (ethnic density) is detrimental or protective for mental health. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis covering the international literature, assessing ethnic density associations with mental health outcomes. Methods We systematically searched Medline, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science from inception to 31 March 2016. We obtained additional data from study authors. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis taking into account clustering of estimates within datasets. Meta-regression assessed heterogeneity in studies due to ethnicity, country, generation, and area-level deprivation. Our main exposure was ethnic density, defined as the residential concentration of own racial/ethnic minority group. Outcomes included depression, anxiety and the common mental disorders (CMD), suicide, suicidality, psychotic experiences, and psychosis. Results We included 41 studies in the review, with meta-analysis of 12 studies. In the meta-analyses, we found a large reduction in relative odds of psychotic experiences [odds ratio (OR) 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76–0.89)] and suicidal ideation [OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.79–0.98)] for each 10 percentage-point increase in own ethnic density. For CMD, depression, and anxiety, associations were indicative of protective effects of own ethnic density; however, results were not statistically significant. Findings from narrative review were consistent with those of the meta-analysis. Conclusions The findings support consistent protective ethnic density associations across countries and racial/ethnic minority populations as well as mental health outcomes. This may suggest the importance of the social environment in patterning detrimental mental health outcomes in marginalized and excluded population groups.",2082019491.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
92,Neurocognitive dysfunctioning and the impact of comorbid depression and anxiety in patients with somatic symptom and related disorders: a cross-sectional clinical study,"Background The prevalence and severity of neurocognitive dysfunctioning of patients with somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRD) is unknown. Furthermore, the influence of comorbid depression and anxiety has not been evaluated. This study examines neurocognitive dysfunctioning of patients with SSRD and explores if comorbid depression and anxiety is associated with specific neurocognitive dysfunctioning. Methods Cross-sectional study with consecutive patients suffering from SSRD visiting an outpatient specialty mental health care Centre of Excellence for SSRD. Extensive neuropsychological assessment and assessment of depression and anxiety symptom levels using the Patient-Health-Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire-7 were performed at intake. Multivariate analysis was performed. Results The study sample consisted of 201 SSRD patients, with a mean age of 43 years (Standard deviation = 13) years; 37.8% were male. Neurocognitive dysfunction in the domains information processing speed, sustained and divided attention, working memory, verbal and visual memory were reported, compared with normative data. Comorbid depression and anxiety occurred frequently within the sample (75.1% and 65.7%, respectively). Neurocognitive dysfunctioning was worse in patients suffering from comorbid depression [multivariate F (7,161) = 2.839, p = 0.008] but not in patients with comorbid anxiety. Conclusions Poor neurocognitive performance of patients with SSRD is common and worsens in case of comorbid depression. This may explain treatment dropout of patients with SSRD from neurocognitive behavioral therapy. Research on novel interventions is needed targeting neurocognitive functioning of patients with SSRD, particularly those with comorbid depression.",2076702998.0, Journal Article,2018
93,"Polygenic prediction of the phenome, across ancestry, in emerging adulthood","Background Identifying genetic relationships between complex traits in emerging adulthood can provide useful etiological insights into risk for psychopathology. College-age individuals are under-represented in genomic analyses thus far, and the majority of work has focused on the clinical disorder or cognitive abilities rather than normal-range behavioral outcomes. Methods This study examined a sample of emerging adults 18–22 years of age ( N = 5947) to construct an atlas of polygenic risk for 33 traits predicting relevant phenotypic outcomes. Twenty-eight hypotheses were tested based on the previous literature on samples of European ancestry, and the availability of rich assessment data allowed for polygenic predictions across 55 psychological and medical phenotypes. Results Polygenic risk for schizophrenia (SZ) in emerging adults predicted anxiety, depression, nicotine use, trauma, and family history of psychological disorders. Polygenic risk for neuroticism predicted anxiety, depression, phobia, panic, neuroticism, and was correlated with polygenic risk for cardiovascular disease. Conclusions These results demonstrate the extensive impact of genetic risk for SZ, neuroticism, and major depression on a range of health outcomes in early adulthood. Minimal cross-ancestry replication of these phenomic patterns of polygenic influence underscores the need for more genome-wide association studies of non-European populations.",2076701162.0, Journal Article,2018
94,"Minority stressors, rumination, and psychological distress in monozygotic twins discordant for sexual minority status","Background Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals report higher levels of depression and anxiety than heterosexual people. Genetic factors may be a ‘common cause’ of sexual minority status and psychological distress. Alternatively, these may be correlated because of non-genetic environmental factors (e.g. minority stressors). This study investigated minority stressors and distress in monozygotic twins discordant for sexual minority status. This design provides a test of the role of non-shared environmental factors while minimizing differences due to genetics. Methods Thirty-eight twin pairs in which one was heterosexual and the other was LGB completed a survey. Differences between twin pairs in minority stressors, rumination, psychological distress, and gender non-conformity were examined. Associations between these variables were also tested. Results Although there were no significant group differences for distress, LGB twins had higher rumination, a vulnerability factor for distress, than heterosexual co-twins. LGB twins also had higher scores than heterosexual co-twins on expectations of rejection, active concealment, self-stigma, prejudice events, childhood gender non-conformity, and lower scores on sexual orientation disclosure. Differences between twin pairs in rumination were positively associated with differences in acceptance concerns and self-stigma. Finally, self-stigma was positively associated with rumination in the full sample of heterosexual co-twins and microaggressions were positively associated with rumination when looking at exclusively heterosexual co-twins. Conclusions These results support environmental factors as a causal explanation for disparities in rumination between LGB and heterosexual individuals. These factors likely include minority stressors. Rumination may also be associated with minority stressors in heterosexual MZ co-twins of LGB individuals.",2057225064.0, Journal Article,2018
95,Stepped care in primary care – guided self-help and face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy for common mental disorders: a randomized controlled trial,"Background Common mental disorders (CMD) cause large suffering and high societal costs. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can effectively treat CMD, but access to treatment is insufficient. Guided self-help (GSH) CBT, has shown effects comparable with face-to-face CBT. However, not all patients respond to GSH, and stepping up non-responders to face-to-face CBT, could yield larger response rates. The aim was to test a stepped care model for CMD in primary care by first evaluating the effects of GSH-CBT and secondly, for non-responders, evaluating the additional effect of face-to-face CBT. Methods Consecutive patients ( N = 396) with a principal disorder of depression, anxiety, insomnia, adjustment or exhaustion disorder were included. In Step I, all patients received GSH-CBT. In Step II, non-responders were randomized to face-to-face CBT or continued GSH. The primary outcome was remission status, defined as a score below a pre-established cutoff on a validated disorder-specific scale. Results After GSH-CBT in Step I, 40% of patients were in remission. After Step II, 39% of patients following face-to-face CBT were in remission compared with 19% of patients after continued GSH ( p = 0.004). Using this stepped care model required less than six therapy sessions per patient and led to an overall remission rate of 63%. Conclusions Stepped care can be effective and resource-efficient to treat CMD in primary care, leading to high remission rates with limited therapist resources. Face-to-face CBT speeded up recovery compared with continued GSH. At follow-ups after 6 and 12 months, remission rates were similar in the two groups.",2057225005.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
96,Sex similarities and differences in risk factors for recurrence of major depression,"Background Major depression (MD) occurs about twice as often in women as in men, but it is unclear whether sex differences subsist after disease onset. This study aims to elucidate potential sex differences in rates and risk factors for MD recurrence, in order to improve prediction of course of illness and understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Methods We used prospective data from a general population sample ( n = 653) that experienced a recent episode of MD. A diverse set of potential risk factors for recurrence of MD was analyzed using Cox models subject to elastic net regularization for males and females separately. Accuracy of the prediction models was tested in same-sex and opposite-sex test data. Additionally, interactions between sex and each of the risk factors were investigated to identify potential sex differences. Results Recurrence rates and the impact of most risk factors were similar for men and women. For both sexes, prediction models were highly multifactorial including risk factors such as comorbid anxiety, early traumas, and family history. Some subtle sex differences were detected: for men, prediction models included more risk factors concerning characteristics of the depressive episode and family history of MD and generalized anxiety, whereas for women, models included more risk factors concerning early and recent adverse life events and socioeconomic problems. Conclusions No prominent sex differences in risk factors for recurrence of MD were found, potentially indicating similar disease maintaining mechanisms for both sexes. Course of MD is a multifactorial phenomenon for both males and females.",2057224608.0, Journal Article,2018
97,Clinical predictors of conversion to bipolar disorder in a prospective longitudinal familial high-risk sample: focus on depressive features,"Background Identifying clinical features that predict conversion to bipolar disorder (BD) in those at high familial risk (HR) would assist in identifying a more focused population for early intervention. Method In total 287 participants aged 12–30 (163 HR with a first-degree relative with BD and 124 controls (CONs)) were followed annually for a median of 5 years. We used the baseline presence of DSM-IV depressive, anxiety, behavioural and substance use disorders, as well as a constellation of specific depressive symptoms (as identified by the Probabilistic Approach to Bipolar Depression) to predict the subsequent development of hypo/manic episodes. Results At baseline, HR participants were significantly more likely to report ⩾4 Probabilistic features (40.4%) when depressed than CONs (6.7%; p &lt; .05). Nineteen HR subjects later developed either threshold ( n = 8; 4.9%) or subthreshold ( n = 11; 6.7%) hypo/mania. The presence of ⩾4 Probabilistic features was associated with a seven-fold increase in the risk of ‘conversion’ to threshold BD (hazard ratio = 6.9, p &lt; .05) above and beyond the fourteen-fold increase in risk related to major depressive episodes (MDEs) per se (hazard ratio = 13.9, p &lt; .05). Individual depressive features predicting conversion were psychomotor retardation and ⩾5 MDEs. Behavioural disorders only predicted conversion to subthreshold BD (hazard ratio = 5.23, p &lt; .01), while anxiety and substance disorders did not predict either threshold or subthreshold hypo/mania. Conclusions This study suggests that specific depressive characteristics substantially increase the risk of young people at familial risk of BD going on to develop future hypo/manic episodes and may identify a more targeted HR population for the development of early intervention programs.",2057150179.0, Journal Article,2018
98,Is cognitive-behavioural therapy more effective than relaxation therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders? A meta-analysis,"Background It is not clear whether relaxation therapies are more or less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety. The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of relaxation techniques compared to cognitive and behavioural therapies in reducing anxiety symptoms, and whether they have comparable efficacy across disorders. Method We conducted a meta-analysis of 50 studies (2801 patients) comparing relaxation training with cognitive and behavioural treatments of anxiety. Results The overall effect size (ES) across all anxiety outcomes, with only one combined ES in each study, was g = -0.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.41 to -0.13], favouring cognitive and behavioural therapies (number needed to treat = 6.61). However, no significant difference between relaxation and cognitive and behavioural therapies was found for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobias (considering social anxiety and specific phobias separately). Heterogeneity was moderate ( I 2 = 52; 95% CI = 33-65). The ES was significantly associated with age ( p &lt; 0.001), hours of cognitive and/or behavioural therapy ( p = 0.015), quality of intervention ( p = 0.007), relaxation treatment format ( p &lt; 0.001) and type of disorder ( p = 0.008), explaining an 82% of variance. Conclusions Relaxation seems to be less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and it might also be less effective at 1-year follow-up for panic, but there is no evidence that it is less effective for other anxiety disorders.",2052744357.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
99,"Socio-economic variations in the mental health treatment gap for people with anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders: results from the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) surveys","Background The treatment gap between the number of people with mental disorders and the number treated represents a major public health challenge. We examine this gap by socio-economic status (SES; indicated by family income and respondent education) and service sector in a cross-national analysis of community epidemiological survey data. Methods Data come from 16 753 respondents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders from community surveys in 25 countries in the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative. DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and treatment of these disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results Only 13.7% of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0% in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8% in high-income countries received treatment. Highest-SES respondents were somewhat more likely to receive treatment, but this was true mostly for specialty mental health treatment, where the association was positive with education (highest treatment among respondents with the highest education and a weak association of education with treatment among other respondents) but non-monotonic with income (somewhat lower treatment rates among middle-income respondents and equivalent among those with high and low incomes). Conclusions The modest, but nonetheless stronger, an association of education than income with treatment raises questions about a financial barriers interpretation of the inverse association of SES with treatment, although future within-country analyses that consider contextual factors might document other important specifications. While beyond the scope of this report, such an expanded analysis could have important implications for designing interventions aimed at increasing mental disorder treatment among socio-economically disadvantaged people.",2052744165.0, Journal Article,2018
100,Effects of between-person differences and within-person changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression on older age cognitive performance,"Background Anxiety and depression are both important correlates of cognitive function. However, longitudinal studies investigating how they covary with cognition within the same individual are scarce. We aimed to simultaneously estimate associations of between-person differences and within-person variability in anxiety and depression with cognitive performance in a sample of non-demented older people. Methods Participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 study, a population-based narrow-age sample (mean age at wave 1 = 79 years, n = 535), were examined on five occasions across 13 years. Anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and cognitive performance was assessed with tests of reasoning, logical memory, and letter fluency. Data were analyzed using two-level linear mixed-effects models with within-person centering. Results Divergent patterns were observed for anxiety and depression. For anxiety, between-person differences were more influential; people who scored higher on HADS anxiety relative to other same-aged individuals demonstrated poorer cognitive performance on average. For depression, on the other hand, time-varying within-person differences were more important; scoring higher than usual on HADS depression was associated with poorer cognitive performance relative to the average level for that participant. Adjusting for gender, childhood mental ability, emotional stability, and disease burden attenuated these associations. Conclusions The results from this study highlight the importance of addressing both between- and within-person effects of negative mood and suggest that anxiety and depression affect cognitive function in different ways. The current findings have implications for assessment and treatment of older age cognitive deficits.",2039103223.0, Journal Article,2018
101,Trait and facet-level predictors of first-onset depressive and anxiety disorders in a community sample of adolescent girls,"Background Individual differences in neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are associated with, and may predict onset of, internalizing disorders. These general traits can be parsed into facets, but there is a surprising paucity of research on facet risk for internalizing disorders. We examined general traits and facets of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness in predicting first onsets of depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods A community sample of 550 adolescent females completed general and facet-level personality measures and diagnostic interviews. Interviews were re-administered 18 months later. Results First onsets of depressive disorders were predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. Facets predicting first onset of depression included depressivity (neuroticism facet) and lower positive emotionality and sociability (extraversion facets). First onsets of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were predicted by neuroticism, and particularly the facet of anxiousness. First onsets of social phobia were predicted at the facet level by anxiousness. First onsets of specific phobia were predicted by neuroticism, low conscientiousness, and all neuroticism facets. In multivariate analyses, first onsets of depression were uniquely predicted by depressivity, and onsets of GAD and social phobia were uniquely predicted by anxiousness over and above the general trait of neuroticism. Conclusions General traits predict first onsets of depressive and anxiety disorders. In addition, more specific associations are evident at the facet level. Facets can refine our understanding of the links between personality and psychopathology risk, and provide finer-grained targets for personality-informed interventions.",2039101370.0, Journal Article,2018
102,Metabolic and inflammatory markers: associations with individual depressive symptoms,"Background Literature has shown that obesity, metabolic syndrome and inflammation are associated with depression, however, evidence suggests that these associations are specific to atypical depression. Which of the atypical symptoms are driving associations with obesity-related outcomes and inflammation is unknown. We evaluated associations between individual symptoms of depression (both atypical and non-atypical) and body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome components and inflammatory markers. Methods We included 808 persons with a current diagnosis of depression participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (67% female, mean age 41.6 years). Depressive symptoms were derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses adjusting for sex, age, educational level, depression severity, current smoking, physical activity, anti-inflammatory medication use, and statin use were performed. Results Increased appetite was positively associated with BMI, number of metabolic syndrome components, waist circumference, C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor- [...] . Decreased appetite was negatively associated with BMI and waist circumference. Psychomotor retardation was positively associated with BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and insomnia with number of metabolic syndrome components. Conclusion Increased appetite - in the context of a depressive episode - was the only symptom that was associated with both metabolic as well as inflammatory markers, and could be a key feature of an immuno-metabolic form of depression. This immuno-metabolic depression should be considered in clinical trials evaluating effectiveness of compounds targeting metabolic and inflammatory pathways or lifestyle interventions.",2024699338.0, Journal Article,2018

104,"Adverse life events, psychiatric history, and biological predictors of postpartum depression in an ethnically diverse sample of postpartum women","Background Race, psychiatric history, and adverse life events have all been independently associated with postpartum depression (PPD). However, the role these play together in Black and Latina women remains inadequately studied. Therefore, we performed a case-control study of PPD, including comprehensive assessments of symptoms and biomarkers, while examining the effects of genetic ancestry. Methods We recruited our sample (549 cases, 968 controls) at 6 weeks postpartum from obstetrical clinics in North Carolina. PPD status was determined using the MINI-plus. Psychiatric history was extracted from medical records. Participants were administered self-report instruments to assess depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and adverse life events. Levels of estradiol, progesterone, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, oxytocin, and allopregnanalone were assayed. Principal components from genotype data were used to estimate genetic ancestry and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of PPD. Results This population was racially diverse (68% Black, 13% Latina, 18% European). Genetic ancestry was not a predictor of PPD. Case status was predicted by a history of major depression ( p = 4.01E-14), lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis ( p = 1.25E-34), and adverse life events ( p = 6.06E-06). There were no significant differences between groups in any hormones or neurosteroids. Conclusions Psychiatric history and multiple exposures to adverse life events were significant predictors of PPD in a population of minority and low-income women. Genetic ancestry and hormone levels were not predictive of case status. Increased genetic vulnerability in conjunction with risk factors may predict the onset of PPD, whereas genetic ancestry does not appear predictive.",2024699232.0, Journal Article,2018
105,Specific amygdala response to masked fearful faces in post-traumatic stress relative to other anxiety disorders,"Background Altered amygdala activation to fear-related stimuli has been proposed to be a potential neural correlate of heightened threat sensitivity in anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, the role of stimulus awareness and disorder specificity remains widely unclear. Here we investigated amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious fearful faces in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC). Methods During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging participants ( n = 120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted with briefly presented fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a backward masking paradigm. The design allowed for the analysis of trial-by-trial face detection performance and amygdala responses to fearful v. neutral faces. Results All participants exhibited increased amygdala activation to fearful v. neutral faces during conscious trials. Specifically during unconscious face processing, the PTSD, compared with all other groups, showed higher right basolateral (BLA) amygdala activity to fearful v. neutral faces. Conclusions The present study shows that BLA amygdala hyperactivity during unconscious, but not conscious, processing of fearful faces differentiates PTSD from the investigated disorders. This finding suggests an automatic and specific neural hyper-responsivity to general fear cues in PTSD and supports the idea of categorical differences between PTSD and other anxiety-related disorders.",2024698299.0, Journal Article,2018
106,Leukocyte telomere length and personality: associations with the Big Five and Type D personality traits,"Backgrounds Accelerated cellular ageing, which can be examined by telomere length (TL), may be an overarching mechanism underlying the association between personality and adverse health outcomes. This 6-year longitudinal study examined the relation between personality and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) across time among adults with a wide age-range. Methods Data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used and included patients with a depression and/or anxiety disorder and healthy controls. Overall, 2936 persons (18-65 years, 66% female) had data on LTL at baseline and 1883 persons had LTL at 6-year follow-up. The Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and Type D personality were assessed. Results Neuroticism was negatively ( B = -2.11, p = 0.03) and agreeableness was positively ( B = 3.84, p = 0.03) related to LTL measured across two time points, which became just non-significant after adjusting for somatic health, lifestyle factors, and recent life stress ( B = -1.99, p = 0.06; and B = 3.01, p = 0.10). Type D personality was negatively ( B = -50.16, p &lt; 0.01) related to LTL across two time points, which still remained statistically significant after full adjustment ( B = -47.37, p = 0.01). Associations did not differ by age, gender, and current psychiatric status. Conclusions The Big Five traits high neuroticism and low agreeableness, and Type D personality were associated with shorter LTL measured across a 6-year period. Associations with the Big Five traits became non-significant after controlling for somatic health, lifestyle factors, and recent life stress, yet similar trends were observed. Type D personality remained independently associated with shorter LTL after full adjustment.",2013170119.0, Journal Article,2018
107,Maternal immune and affiliative biomarkers and sensitive parenting mediate the effects of chronic early trauma on child anxiety,"Background Chronic early trauma alters children's stress reactivity and increases the prevalence of anxiety disorders; yet the neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this effect are not fully clear. Animal studies indicate that the mother's physiology and behavior mediate offspring stress in a system-specific manner, but few studies tested this external-regulatory maternal role in human children exposed to chronic stress. Methods We followed a unique cohort of children exposed to continuous wartime trauma ( N = 177; exposed; N = 101, controls; N = 76). At 10 years, maternal and child's salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) and oxytocin (OT), biomarkers of the immune and affiliation systems, were assayed, maternal and child relational behaviors observed, mother and child underwent psychiatric diagnosis, and child anxiety symptoms assessed. Results War-exposed mothers had higher s-IgA, lower OT, more anxiety symptoms, and their parenting was characterized by reduced sensitivity. Exposed children showed higher s-IgA, more anxiety disorders and post traumatic stress disorder, and more anxiety symptoms. Path analysis model defined three pathways by which maternal physiology and behavior impacted child anxiety; (a) increasing maternal s-IgA, which led to increased child s-IgA, augmenting child anxiety; (b) reducing maternal OT, which linked with diminished child OT and social repertoire; and (c) increasing maternal anxiety, which directly impacted child anxiety. Conclusions Our findings, the first to measure immune and affiliation biomarkers in mothers and children, detail their unique and joint effects on children's anxiety in response to stress; highlight the relations between chronic stress, immune activation, and anxiety in children; and describe how processes of biobehavioral synchrony shape children's long-term adaptation.",2013166942.0, Journal Article,2018
108,Altered functional connectivity of the subthalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background The assessment of inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) has allowed for the description of the putative mechanism of action of treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Nevertheless, the possible FC alterations of other clinically-effective DBS targets have not been explored. Here we evaluated the FC patterns of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in patients with OCD, as well as their association with symptom severity. Methods Eighty-six patients with OCD and 104 healthy participants were recruited. A resting-state image was acquired for each participant and a seed-based analysis focused on our two regions of interest was performed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8). Between-group differences in FC patterns were assessed with two-sample t test models, while the association between symptom severity and FC patterns was assessed with multiple regression analyses. Results In comparison with controls, patients with OCD showed: (1) increased FC between the left STN and the right pre-motor cortex, (2) decreased FC between the right STN and the lenticular nuclei, and (3) increased FC between the left BNST and the right frontopolar cortex. Multiple regression analyses revealed a negative association between clinical severity and FC between the right STN and lenticular nucleus. Conclusions This study provides a neurobiological framework to understand the mechanism of action of DBS on the STN and the BNST, which seems to involve brain circuits related with motor response inhibition and anxiety control, respectively.",2013165202.0, Journal Article,2018
109,Directed threat imagery in generalized anxiety disorder,"Background Worrying has been suggested to prevent emotional and elaborative processing of fears. In cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients are exposed to their fears during the method of directed threat imagery by inducing emotional reactivity. However, studies investigating neural correlates of directed threat imagery and emotional reactivity in GAD patients are lacking. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed at delineating neural correlates of directed threat imagery in GAD patients. Method Nineteen GAD patients and 19 healthy controls (HC) were exposed to narrative scripts of either disorder-related or neutral content and were encouraged to imagine it as vividly as possible. Results Rating results showed that GAD patients experienced disorder-related scripts as more anxiety inducing and arousing than HC. These results were also reflected in fMRI data: Disorder-related v. neutral scripts elicited elevated activity in the amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the thalamus as well as reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in GAD patients relative to HC. Conclusion The present study presents the first behavioral and neural evidence for emotional reactivity during directed threat imagery in GAD. The brain activity pattern suggests an involvement of a fear processing network as a neural correlate of initial exposure during directed imagery in CBT in GAD.",2013644936.0, Journal Article,2018
110,"The prevalence, age-of-onset and the correlates of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in the Tianjin Mental Health Survey (TJMHS)","Background To effectively shape mental healthcare policy in modern-day China, up-to-date epidemiological data on mental disorders is needed. The objective was to estimate the prevalence, age-of-onset (AOO) and sociodemographic correlates of mental disorders in a representative household sample of the general population (age [egs] 18) in the Tianjin Municipality in China. Methods Data came from the Tianjin Mental health Survey (TJMHS), which was conducted between July 2011 and March 2012 using a two-phase design. 11 748 individuals were screened with an expanded version of the General Health Questionnaire and 4438 subjects were selected for a diagnostic interview by a psychiatrist, using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - fourth edition (SCID). Results The lifetime and 1-month prevalence of any mental disorder were 23.6% and 12.8%, respectively. Mood disorders (lifetime: 9.3%; 1-month: 3.9%), anxiety disorders (lifetime: 4.5% 1-month: 3.1%) and substance-use disorders (lifetime: 8.8%; 1-month: 3.5%) were most prevalent. The median AOO ranged from 25 years [interquartile range (IQR): 23-32] for substance-use disorders to 36 years (IQR: 24-50) for mood disorders. Not being married, non-immigrant status (i.e. local 'Hukou'), being a farmer, having &lt;6 years of education and male gender were associated with a higher lifetime prevalence of any mental disorder. Conclusion Results from the current survey indicate that mental disorders are steadily reported more commonly in rapidly-developing urban China. Several interesting sociodemographic correlates were observed (e.g. male gender and non-immigrant status) that warrant further investigation and could be used to profile persons in need of preventive intervention.",1985648594.0, Journal Article,2018

[...]to DSM5 retaining the distinction between schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the concept of PSD takes one step forward towards a true spectrum approach, analogous to autism spectrum in DSM5. [...]we do conclude that psychotic experiences, similar to any other subtle expression of psychopathology domains (e.g. autism, anxiety, depression, and cognition), provide an invaluable source of information to leverage our efforts in gaining insight into early psychopathology and mastering the disease phenotype in the research setting, as evidenced by abundant research.

112,"Altered interoceptive activation before, during, and after aversive breathing load in women remitted from anorexia nervosa","Background The neural mechanisms of anorexia nervosa (AN), a severe and chronic psychiatric illness, are still poorly understood. Altered body state processing, or interoception, has been documented in AN, and disturbances in aversive interoception may contribute to distorted body perception, extreme dietary restriction, and anxiety. As prior data implicate a potential mismatch between interoceptive expectation and experience in AN, we examined whether AN is associated with altered brain activation before, during, and after an unpleasant interoceptive state change. Methods Adult women remitted from AN (RAN; n = 17) and healthy control women (CW; n = 25) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an inspiratory breathing load paradigm. Results During stimulus anticipation, the RAN group, relative to CW, showed reduced activation in right mid-insula. In contrast, during the aversive breathing load, the RAN group showed increased activation compared with CW in striatum and cingulate and prefrontal cortices (PFC). The RAN group also showed increased activation in PFC, bilateral insula, striatum, and amygdala after stimulus offset. Time course analyses indicated that RAN responses in interoceptive processing regions during breathing load increased more steeply than those of CW. Exploratory analyses revealed that hyperactivation after breathing load was associated with markers of past AN severity. Conclusions Anticipatory deactivation with a subsequent exaggerated brain response during and after an aversive body state may contribute to difficulty predicting and adapting to internal state fluctuation. Because eating changes our interoceptive state, restriction may be one method of avoiding aversive, unpredictable internal change in AN.",1976627473.0, Journal Article,2018
113,Symptoms of depression in a large healthy population cohort are related to subjective memory complaints and memory performance in negative contexts,"Background Decades of research have investigated the impact of clinical depression on memory, which has revealed biases and in some cases impairments. However, little is understood about the effects of subclinical symptoms of depression on memory performance in the general population. Methods Here we report the effects of symptoms of depression on memory problems in a large population-derived cohort ( N = 2544), 87% of whom reported at least one symptom of depression. Specifically, we investigate the impact of depressive symptoms on subjective memory complaints, objective memory performance on a standard neuropsychological task and, in a subsample ( n = 288), objective memory in affective contexts. Results There was a dissociation between subjective and objective memory performance, with depressive symptoms showing a robust relationship with self-reports of memory complaints, even after adjusting for age, sex, general cognitive ability and symptoms of anxiety, but not with performance on the standardised measure of verbal memory. Contrary to our expectations, hippocampal volume (assessed in a subsample, n = 592) did not account for significant variance in subjective memory, objective memory or depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, depressive symptoms were related to poorer memory for pictures presented in negative contexts, even after adjusting for memory for pictures in neutral contexts. Conclusions Thus the symptoms of depression, associated with subjective memory complaints, appear better assessed by memory performance in affective contexts, rather than standardised memory measures. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the impact of depressive symptoms on memory functioning in the general population.",1976618322.0, Journal Article,2018
114,"Impact of dysfunctional maternal personality traits on risk of offspring depression, anxiety and self-harm at age 18 years: a population-based longitudinal study","Background The impact of underlying parental psychological vulnerability on the future mental health of offspring is not fully understood. Using a prospective cohort design, we investigated the association between dysfunctional parental personality traits and risks of offspring self-harm, depression and anxiety. Methods The association between dysfunctional parental personality traits (monotony avoidance, impulsivity, anger, suspicion, and detachment), measured in both mothers and fathers when offspring were age 9 years, and risk of offspring depression, anxiety and self-harm at age 18 years, was investigated in a population-based cohort (ALSPAC) from over 8000 parents and children. Results Higher levels of dysfunctional maternal, but not paternal, personality traits were associated with an increased risk of self-harm, depression, and anxiety in offspring. Maternal associations were best explained by the accumulation of dysfunctional traits. Associations were strongest for offspring depression: Offspring of mothers with three or more dysfunctional personality traits were 2.27 (1.45-3.54, p &lt; 0.001) times as likely to be depressed, compared with offspring of mothers with no dysfunctional personality traits, independently of maternal depression and other variables. Conclusions The accumulation of dysfunctional maternal personality traits is associated with the risk of self-harm, depression, anxiety in offspring independently of maternal depression and other confounding variables. The absence of associations for equivalent paternal traits makes a genetic explanation for the findings unlikely. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Mothers with high levels of dysfunctional personality traits may benefit from additional support to reduce the risk of adverse psychological outcomes occurring in their offspring.",1976617507.0, Journal Article,2018
115,Subclinical levels of anxiety but not depression are associated with planning performance in a large population-based sample,"Background Major depression and anxiety disorders are known to negatively influence cognitive performance. Moreover, there is evidence for greater cognitive decline in older adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Except for clinical studies, complex executive planning functions and subclinical levels of anxiety have not been examined in a population-based sample with a broad age range. Methods Planning performance was assessed using the Tower of London task in a population-based sample of 4240 participants aged 40-80 years from the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) and related to self-reported anxiety and depression by means of multiple linear regression analysis. Results Higher anxiety ratings were associated with lower planning performance ( [...] = -0.20; p &lt; 0.0001) independent of age ( [...] = 0.03; p = 0.47). When directly comparing the predictive value of depression and anxiety on cognition, only anxiety attained significance ( [...] = -0.19; p = 0.0047), whereas depression did not ( [...] = -0.01; p = 0.71). Conclusions Subclinical levels of anxiety but not of depression showed negative associations with cognitive functioning independent of age. Our results demonstrate that associations observed in clinical groups might differ from those in population-based samples, also with regard to the trajectory across the life span. Further studies are needed to uncover causal interrelations of anxiety and cognition, which have been proposed in the literature, in order to develop interventions aimed at reducing this negative affective state and to improve executive functioning.",1976617502.0, Journal Article,2018
