543,The role of anxiety and perspective-taking strategy on affective empathic responses,"Empathy is an important pro-social behaviour critical to a positive client-therapist relationship. Therapist anxiety has been linked to reduced ability to empathise and lower client satisfaction with therapy. However, the nature of the relationship between anxiety and empathy is currently unclear. The current study investigated the effect of experimentally-induced anxiety on empathic responses elicited during three different perspective-taking tasks. Perspective-taking was manipulated within-subjects with all participants (N = 52) completing imagine-self, imagine-other and objective conditions. A threat of shock manipulation was used to vary anxiety between-subjects. Participants in the threat of shock condition reported higher levels of anxiety during the experiment and lower levels of empathy-related distress for the targets than participants in the control condition. Perspective-taking was associated with higher levels of empathy-related distress and concern compared to the objective condition. The present results suggest that perspective-taking can to a large extent mitigate the influence of heightened anxiety on an individual's ability to empathise.

544,A feasibility study of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for emotional dysfunction following psychosis,"The experience of psychosis can lead to depression, anxiety and fear. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) facilitates individuals to accept difficult mental experiences and behave in ways that are consistent with personally held values. This study was a single (rater) blind pilot randomised controlled trial of ACT for emotional dysfunction following psychosis. Twenty-seven participants with psychosis were randomised to either: ten sessions of ACT plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills and Working Alliance Inventory were used. Individuals were assessed at baseline and 3 months post-baseline. The individuals randomised to receive ACT found the intervention acceptable. A significantly greater proportion of the ACT group changed from being depressed at time of entry into the study to not being depressed at follow-up. The ACT group showed a significantly greater increase in mindfulness skills and reduction in negative symptoms. Results indicated that individuals randomised to ACT had significantly fewer crisis contacts over the study. Changes in mindfulness skills correlated positively with changes in depression. ACT appears to offer promise in reducing negative symptoms, depression and crisis contacts in psychosis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",903908886.0, Feature,2011
545,Perseverative thought: A robust predictor of response to emotional challenge in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently co-occur, yet the reasons for their comorbidity remain poorly understood. In the present experiment, we tested whether a tendency to engage in negative, repetitive thinking constitutes a common risk process for the two disorders. A mixed sample of adults with comorbid GAD-MDD (n = 50), GAD only (n = 35), MDD only (n = 34), or no lifetime psychopathology (n = 35) was administered noncontingent failure and success feedback on consecutive performance tasks. Perseverative thought (PT), measured by negative thought intrusions during a baseline period of focused breathing, emerged as a powerful prospective predictor of responses to this experimental challenge. Participants reporting more frequent negative thought intrusions at baseline, irrespective of thought content or diagnostic status, exhibited a stronger negative response to failure that persisted even after subsequent success. Higher PT over the course of the experiment was associated with later behavioral avoidance, with negative affect and other traits closely linked to anxiety and depression, and with the presence and severity of GAD and MDD. These findings provide evidence for a broadly-defined PT trait that is shared by GAD and MDD and contributes to adverse outcomes in these disorders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",903905646.0, Feature,2011
546,"Comorbid social anxiety disorder in clients with depressive disorders: Predicting changes in depressive symptoms, therapeutic relationships, and focus of attention in group treatment","The current study examined whether depressed outpatients with comorbid SAD respond differently to a cognitive-behavioral group intervention and if so, how and why. Using growth curve modeling, we found evidence that depressed clients with comorbid SAD had rapid improvement in depressive symptoms over the course of treatment and generally did not differ from those without comorbidity in developing close therapeutic relationships and modifying the direction of attentional focus away from the self. Non-linear effects demonstrated that rates of change in depressive symptoms, relationship variables, and focus of attention, were most rapid early in treatment. In contrast to hypotheses, trajectories of change in therapeutic relationships and attentional focus did not mediate the effect of SAD on treatment improvement in depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that comorbid SAD does not have a detrimental effect on the course of depression treatment and group-based treatments can be as beneficial for depressed individuals with comorbid SAD. It may be that group-based treatments for depression provide explicit opportunity for emotional processing in social situations (i.e., exposure) and hence mimic efficacious therapies for SAD.

547,An open trial of a brief transdiagnostic internet treatment for anxiety and depression,"The present study evaluated the efficacy of a brief version of an internet-administered transdiagnostic CBT protocol, the Wellbeing Program (Titov et al., 2011), designed to treat three anxiety disorders and major depression within the same program. This brief version included the same core CBT skills as the original, but condensed the materials from 8 to 5 online lessons, reduced the duration of treatment from 10 to 8 weeks and did not include an online forum. Thirty-two individuals with a principal diagnosis of major depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia received CBT-based online educational lessons, homework assignments, weekly contact from a clinical psychologist and automated emails. Eighty-one percent of participants completed the lessons within the 8 week program. Post-treatment and 3-month follow-up data were collected from 28/32 and 31/32 participants respectively. Participants improved significantly on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales - 21 Item, Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 Item, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item scales, with corresponding within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) at follow-up of 1.05, .73, and .95, respectively. Participants rated the procedure as highly acceptable with gains of a similar magnitude as those found for the original program, but less time was spent per participant by the clinician in the present trial (mean = 44.61 min, SD = 34.45) compared to the original program (mean = 84.76 min, SD = 50.37). These results provide additional support for the efficacy of transdiagnostic iCBT in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders and indicate that a brief version may be of benefit.

548,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy versus Tinnitus Retraining Therapy in the treatment of tinnitus: A randomised controlled trial,"The study compared the effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) with Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) on tinnitus impact in a randomised controlled trial. Sixty-four normal hearing subjects with tinnitus were randomised to one of the active treatments or a wait-list control (WLC). The ACT treatment consisted of 10 weekly 60 min sessions. The TRT treatment consisted of one 150 min session, one 30 min follow-up and continued daily use of wearable sound generators for a recommended period of at least 8 h/day for 18 months. Assessments were made at baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months and 18 months. At 10 weeks, results showed a superior effect of ACT in comparison with the WLC regarding tinnitus impact (Cohen's d = 1.04), problems with sleep and anxiety. The results were mediated by tinnitus acceptance. A comparison between the active treatments, including all assessment points, revealed significant differences in favour of ACT regarding tinnitus impact (Cohen's d = 0.75) and problems with sleep. At 6 months, reliable improvement on the main outcome measure was found for 54.5% in the ACT condition and 20% in the TRT condition. The results suggest that ACT can reduce tinnitus distress and impact in a group of normal hearing tinnitus patients. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",919971741.0, Journal Article,2011
549,Negative post-event processing and decreased self-appraisals of performance following social stress in childhood social anxiety: An experimental study,"Cognitive models of social phobia (SP) assume that following social evaluative stress, individuals with SP engage into dysfunctional post-event processing (PEP), a detailed negative review of the past event. While previous research has already shown, that children with high levels of social fears suffer from more frequent negative PEP, it remains unclear how stable PEP is across time in this age group and whether it leads to degraded self-appraisals of performance. Therefore in the present study we exposed a group of high (HSA) and low socially anxious children (LSA; both n = 20), aged 10-12 years, to a social evaluative situation and assessed negative and positive PEP as well as self-rated performance at 2.5 h and one week after the task. Our results revealed that HSA children reported more negative PEP than LSA children, independent of levels of depression. Moreover, negative PEP was related to measures of social anxiety and performance ratings within the tasks. Only the performance ratings in HSA children worsened over the course of the following week and were related to more negative PEP. Thus, these results speak for the high clinical relevance dysfunctional PEP may have for the maintenance of social fears already in childhood.

550,The effects of safety behaviors on health anxiety: An experimental investigation,"The present study examined the extent to which safety behaviors exacerbate symptoms of hypochondriasis (severe health anxiety). Participants were randomized into a safety behavior (n = 30) or control condition (n = 30). After a baseline period, participants in the safety behavior condition spent one week actively engaging in a clinically representative array of health-related safety behaviors on a daily basis, followed by a second week-long baseline period. Participants in the control condition monitored their normal use of safety behaviors. Compared to control participants, those in the safety behavior condition reported significantly greater increases in health anxiety, hypochondriacal beliefs, contamination fear, and avoidant responses to health-related behavioral tasks after the safety behavior manipulation. In contrast, general anxiety symptoms did not significantly differ between the two groups as a function of the manipulation. Mediational analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the frequency of health-related thoughts mediated the effects of the experimental manipulation on health anxiety. These findings suggest that safety behaviors are associated with increases in health anxiety, perhaps by fostering catastrophic thoughts about health. The implications of these findings for the conceptualization of hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",919970921.0, Journal Article,2011
551,Latent growth curve analysis of fear during a speech task before and after treatment for social phobia,"Models of social phobia highlight the importance of anticipatory anxiety in the experience of fear during a social situation. Anticipatory anxiety has been shown to be highly correlated with performance anxiety for a variety of social situations. A few studies show that average ratings of anxiety during the anticipation and performance phases of a social situation decline following treatment. Evidence also suggests that the point of confrontation with the feared stimulus is the peak level of fear. No study to date has evaluated the pattern of anxious responding across the anticipation, confrontation, and performance phases before and after treatment, which is the focus of the current study. Socially phobic individuals (N = 51) completed a behavioral avoidance task before and after two types of manualized cognitive behavioral therapy, and gave ratings of fear during the anticipation and performance phases. Results from latent growth curve analysis were the same for the two treatments and suggested that before treatment, anxiety sharply increased during the anticipation phase, was highly elevated at the confrontation, and gradually increased during the performance phase. After treatment, anxiety increased during the anticipation phase, although at a much slower rate than at pretreatment, peaked at confrontation, and declined during the performance phase. The findings suggest that anticipatory experiences are critical to the experience of fear for public speaking and should be incorporated into exposures.

552,Group cognitive-behavioral therapy for hoarding disorder: An open trial,"Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to be a promising treatment approach for hoarding disorder, treatment to date has been quite labor intensive. The goal of this study, therefore, was to assess the potential effectiveness of group CBT for hoarding, without home visits by the clinician. Forty-five individuals with hoarding disorder enrolled in either a 16 or 20 session program of group CBT; 30 (67%) completed treatment. Using mixed-effects models to account for missing data, we report data from 35 (78%) participants who provided enough data for analysis. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in hoarding symptoms, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety, and quality of life. Improvements in hoarding symptoms were comparable to two published clinical trials on individual CBT for hoarding disorder. Results of this study suggest that group CBT for hoarding, without home discarding sessions by the clinician, may be an effective treatment option with the potential advantage of increasing treatment access by reducing clinician burden and cost of treatment.

553,Cost-effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy vs. cognitive behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent and associated with a substantial societal economic burden, primarily due to high costs of productivity loss. Cognitive behavior group therapy (CBGT) is an effective treatment for SAD and the most established in clinical practice. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has demonstrated efficacy in several trials in recent years. No study has however investigated the cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to CBGT from a societal perspective, i.e. an analysis where both direct and indirect costs are included. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to CBGT from a societal perspective using a prospective design. We conducted a randomized controlled trial where participants with SAD were randomized to ICBT (n = 64) or CBGT (n = 62). Economic data were assessed at pre-treatment, immediately following treatment and six months after treatment. Results showed that the gross total costs were significantly reduced at six-month follow-up, compared to pre-treatment in both treatment conditions. As both treatments were equivalent in reducing social anxiety and gross total costs, ICBT was more cost-effective due to lower intervention costs. We conclude that ICBT can be more cost-effective than CBGT in the treatment of SAD and that both treatments reduce societal costs for SAD. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",919969558.0, Journal Article,2011
554,Attentional control in OCD and GAD: Specificity and associations with core cognitive symptoms,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are both defined by excessive negatively-valenced cognitions. Although obsessional thoughts are considered essential to OCD and perseverative worry is considered essential to GAD, these excessive cognitions have been found to co-occur in both disorders. Accordingly, a common diathesis may influence the emergence of excessive thoughts in both disorders. The present study examined deficits in attentional control as a cognitive vulnerability that may contribute to both obsessional thought and perseverative worry. Patients with OCD (n = 30), GAD (n = 29), and non-clinical controls (NCC; n = 29) completed measures of obsessional thoughts, perseverative worry, and attentional control. Deficits in self-reported attentional control were found in both OCD and GAD relative to the NCC. However, attentional control was only related to excessive cognition in the GAD patient group, where deficits were associated with increased perseverative worry. Mediational modeling suggested that trait anxiety mediated the relationship between attentional control and perseverative worry in GAD. Implications of these findings for conceptualizing the role of attentional control in the genesis of excessive cognitions in OCD and GAD are discussed.

562,Inferred threat and safety: Symbolic generalization of human avoidance learning,"Symbolic generalization of avoidance may underlie the aetiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate inferred threat-avoidance and safety (non-avoidance) behaviours that occur in the presence of stimuli indirectly related to learned threat and safety cues. A laboratory experiment was conducted involving two symbolic stimulus equivalence relations consisting of three physically dissimilar stimuli (avoidance cues: AV1-AV2-AV3 and neutral cues: N1-N2-N3). During avoidance learning involving aversive images and sounds, a key-press avoidance response was trained for one member of one of the relations (AV2) and non-avoidance for another (N2). Inferred threat and safety behaviour and ratings of the likelihood of aversive events were tested with presentations of all remaining stimuli. Findings showed a significantly high percentage of avoidance to both the learned and inferred threat cues and less avoidance to both the learned and inferred safety cues. Ratings in the absence of avoidance were high during training and testing to threat cues and low to safety cues and were generally lower in the presence of avoidance. Implications for associative and behavioural accounts of avoidance, and modern therapies for anxiety disorders are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",914791013.0, Journal Article,2011
563,Impact of anticipatory processing versus distraction on multiple indices of anxiety in socially anxious individuals,"In models of social phobia, anticipatory processing before a social-evaluative event is a key maintaining factor for the disorder. This study investigated the impact of anticipatory processing versus distraction before a social-evaluative task on affective (self-reported anxiety), psychophysiological (skin conductance), cognitive (self-reported maladaptive self-beliefs) and behavioural (in-situation performance) responses of participants. High and low socially anxious undergraduates were randomly allocated to either an anticipatory processing or distraction condition, and then completed an impromptu speech task. Relative to distraction, anticipatory processing increased self-reported anxiety in all participants, and increased skin conductance and the strength of conditional and high standard beliefs in the high (but not low) socially anxious participants. Unconditional beliefs were not affected. For high socially anxious individuals, anticipatory processing was also indirectly associated with poorer speech performance by increasing self-reported anxiety. Anticipatory processing appears to have multiple adverse effects in socially anxious individuals. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",914790950.0, Journal Article,2011
564,"Social anxiety and the effects of negative self-imagery on emotion, cognition, and post-event processing","Numerous studies have shown that social phobia patients experience negative self-impressions or images during social situations. Clark and Wells (1995) posited that such negative self-images are involved in the maintenance of social phobia. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of negative self-imagery on cognition and emotion during and following a brief social situation. Specifically, high and low socially anxious participants (N = 77) were instructed to hold either a negative or control self-image as they engaged in a brief speech. Participants then rated their anxiety, performance, cognitions, and focus of attention. Twenty-four hours later, they returned to the laboratory and completed questionnaires assessing the amount of post-event processing (PEP) they engaged in. The results showed that, irrespective of the level of social anxiety or depressive symptoms, participants that held the negative self-image experienced higher levels of anxiety, were more self-focused, experienced more negative thoughts, rated their anxiety as more visible, appraised their performance more negatively, and engaged in more negative and less positive PEP than participants that held the control self-image. Collectively the results indicate that negative imagery is causally involved in the maintenance of social phobia, as well as in the generation of social anxiety among non-anxious individuals.

565,Differential effects of safety behaviour subtypes in social anxiety disorder,"Clinical observations indicate that individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) use a variety of safety behaviours; however, virtually no research has examined the functional effect of different safety-seeking strategies. Accordingly, we conducted two studies to address this issue. Study 1 measured global patterns of safety behaviour use in a large analogue sample. Factor analysis revealed two primary safety behaviour categories, avoidance and impression management. Study 2 assessed situational use of safety behaviours during a controlled social interaction in a clinical sample of 93 patients with Generalised SAD. Factor analysis again revealed support for avoidance and impression-management subtypes. Notably, the two types of safety behaviours were associated with different social outcomes. Avoidance safety behaviours were associated with higher state anxiety during the interaction and negative reactions from participants' interaction partners. Impression-management strategies appeared to impede corrections in negative predictions about subsequent interactions. These findings suggest that it may be beneficial to consider the unique effects of different safety-seeking strategies when assessing and treating SAD.

566,The effects of familiarity on thought-action fusion,"The present study examined whether beliefs about the importance of thoughts (i.e., thought-action fusion; TAF) are related to the target subject of the negative thought. One hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomly assigned to imagine either a beloved relative or a stranger being diagnosed with cancer and provided in vivo ratings of anxiety, likelihood, moral wrongness, urge to neutralize, and how upsetting the event would be if it occurred. Results indicated that thinking of a relative being diagnosed with cancer provoked more distress, urges to neutralize, and higher estimates of likelihood, as well greater use of mental neutralizing behaviors, compared to thinking of a stranger. Contrary to our prediction, the groups did not differ in their ratings of the moral wrongness. These findings broadly support the assertion that the more personally significant a negative intrusive thought, the more it will provoke distress and urges to neutralize. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive model of obsessions and clinical implications are addressed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",914790405.0, Journal Article,2011
567,Cognitive-behavioral therapy for geriatric compulsive hoarding,"This investigation examined response to a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol for compulsive hoarding (Steketee & Frost, 2007) in a sample of 12 adults over age 65. All participants were cognitively intact, not engaging in any other psychotherapy, and had compulsive hoarding as their primary problem. All received 26 sessions of individual CBT over the course of 17 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the Savings Inventory-Revised and UCLA Hoarding Severity Scale, which were administered at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Other outcomes included Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores, depression, anxiety, disability, and clutter image ratings. Results demonstrated statistically significant changes on hoarding severity and depression. However, only three of the twelve participants were classified as treatment responders at post-treatment, and their gains were not maintained at 6-month follow-up. CGI, anxiety, disability, and clutter ratings were unchanged at post-treatment and follow-up. No participants dropped out, but homework compliance was variable and correlated with decreases in hoarding severity. Findings suggest that older adults with compulsive hoarding may require an enhanced or alternative treatment. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",914790328.0, Journal Article,2011
568,Mood stability versus mood instability in bipolar disorder: A possible role for emotional mental imagery,"A cognitive model of bipolar disorder suggests that mental imagery acts as an emotional amplifier of mood and may be heightened in bipolar disorder. First, we tested whether patients with bipolar disorder would score higher on mental imagery measures than a matched healthy control group. Second, we examined differences in imagery between patients divided into groups according to their level of mood stability. Mood ratings over approximately 6-months, made using a mobile phone messaging system, were used to divide patients into stable or unstable groups. Clinician decisions of mood stability were corroborated with statistical analysis. Results showed (I) compared to healthy controls, patients with bipolar disorder had significantly higher scores for general mental imagery use, more vivid imagery of future events, higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and more extreme imagery-based interpretation bias; (II) compared to patients with stable mood, patients with unstable mood had higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and this correlated highly with their current levels of anxiety and depression. The findings were consistent with predictions. Further investigation of imagery in bipolar disorder appears warranted as it may highlight processes that contribute to mood instability with relevance for cognitive behaviour therapy.

569,Training children to approach or avoid novel animals: Effects on self-reported attitudes and fear beliefs and information-seeking behaviors,"We examined the effects of training to approach or avoid novel animals on fear-related responses in children. Ninety-nine primary school children (9-12 years old) were instructed to repeatedly move a manikin toward or away from pictures of novel animals. The training produced more positive self-reported attitudes for the animal that was repeatedly approached and more negative attitudes for the animal that was repeatedly avoided. After the training, children reported more fear of the avoided animal than of the approached animal. Interestingly, children showed a training-congruent confirmation bias effect on an information-seeking task. That is, they displayed a tendency to seek more positive information about the approached animal, whereas they were inclined to search for more negative information about the avoided animal. No significant training effects were observed on implicit attitudes. The finding that a simple approach-avoidance training influences children's fear-related responses and leads to biased information-seeking behaviors lends support to general theories of fear acquisition in children as well as to models that try to explain the intergenerational transmission of anxiety.

570,Mood stability versus mood instability in bipolar disorder: A possible role for emotional mental imagery,"A cognitive model of bipolar disorder suggests that mental imagery acts as an emotional amplifier of mood and may be heightened in bipolar disorder. First, we tested whether patients with bipolar disorder would score higher on mental imagery measures than a matched healthy control group. Second, we examined differences in imagery between patients divided into groups according to their level of mood stability. Mood ratings over approximately 6-months, made using a mobile phone messaging system, were used to divide patients into stable or unstable groups. Clinician decisions of mood stability were corroborated with statistical analysis. Results showed (I) compared to healthy controls, patients with bipolar disorder had significantly higher scores for general mental imagery use, more vivid imagery of future events, higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and more extreme imagery-based interpretation bias; (II) compared to patients with stable mood, patients with unstable mood had higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and this correlated highly with their current levels of anxiety and depression. The findings were consistent with predictions. Further investigation of imagery in bipolar disorder appears warranted as it may highlight processes that contribute to mood instability with relevance for cognitive behaviour therapy.

571,Training children to approach or avoid novel animals: Effects on self-reported attitudes and fear beliefs and information-seeking behaviors,"We examined the effects of training to approach or avoid novel animals on fear-related responses in children. Ninety-nine primary school children (9-12 years old) were instructed to repeatedly move a manikin toward or away from pictures of novel animals. The training produced more positive self-reported attitudes for the animal that was repeatedly approached and more negative attitudes for the animal that was repeatedly avoided. After the training, children reported more fear of the avoided animal than of the approached animal. Interestingly, children showed a training-congruent confirmation bias effect on an information-seeking task. That is, they displayed a tendency to seek more positive information about the approached animal, whereas they were inclined to search for more negative information about the avoided animal. No significant training effects were observed on implicit attitudes. The finding that a simple approach-avoidance training influences children's fear-related responses and leads to biased information-seeking behaviors lends support to general theories of fear acquisition in children as well as to models that try to explain the intergenerational transmission of anxiety.

572,Differential effects of safety behaviour subtypes in social anxiety disorder,"Clinical observations indicate that individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) use a variety of safety behaviours; however, virtually no research has examined the functional effect of different safety-seeking strategies. Accordingly, we conducted two studies to address this issue. Study 1 measured global patterns of safety behaviour use in a large analogue sample. Factor analysis revealed two primary safety behaviour categories, avoidance and impression management. Study 2 assessed situational use of safety behaviours during a controlled social interaction in a clinical sample of 93 patients with Generalised SAD. Factor analysis again revealed support for avoidance and impression-management subtypes. Notably, the two types of safety behaviours were associated with different social outcomes. Avoidance safety behaviours were associated with higher state anxiety during the interaction and negative reactions from participants' interaction partners. Impression-management strategies appeared to impede corrections in negative predictions about subsequent interactions. These findings suggest that it may be beneficial to consider the unique effects of different safety-seeking strategies when assessing and treating SAD.

573,Cognitive-behavioral therapy for geriatric compulsive hoarding,"This investigation examined response to a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol for compulsive hoarding (Steketee &amp; Frost, 2007) in a sample of 12 adults over age 65. All participants were cognitively intact, not engaging in any other psychotherapy, and had compulsive hoarding as their primary problem. All received 26 sessions of individual CBT over the course of 17 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the Savings Inventory-Revised and UCLA Hoarding Severity Scale, which were administered at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Other outcomes included Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores, depression, anxiety, disability, and clutter image ratings. Results demonstrated statistically significant changes on hoarding severity and depression. However, only three of the twelve participants were classified as treatment responders at post-treatment, and their gains were not maintained at 6-month follow-up. CGI, anxiety, disability, and clutter ratings were unchanged at post-treatment and follow-up. No participants dropped out, but homework compliance was variable and correlated with decreases in hoarding severity. Findings suggest that older adults with compulsive hoarding may require an enhanced or alternative treatment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",893749198.0, Feature,2011
574,Impact of anticipatory processing versus distraction on multiple indices of anxiety in socially anxious individuals,"In models of social phobia, anticipatory processing before a social-evaluative event is a key maintaining factor for the disorder. This study investigated the impact of anticipatory processing versus distraction before a social-evaluative task on affective (self-reported anxiety), psychophysiological (skin conductance), cognitive (self-reported maladaptive self-beliefs) and behavioural (in-situation performance) responses of participants. High and low socially anxious undergraduates were randomly allocated to either an anticipatory processing or distraction condition, and then completed an impromptu speech task. Relative to distraction, anticipatory processing increased self-reported anxiety in all participants, and increased skin conductance and the strength of conditional and high standard beliefs in the high (but not low) socially anxious participants. Unconditional beliefs were not affected. For high socially anxious individuals, anticipatory processing was also indirectly associated with poorer speech performance by increasing self-reported anxiety. Anticipatory processing appears to have multiple adverse effects in socially anxious individuals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",893749195.0, Feature,2011
575,The effects of familiarity on thought-action fusion,"The present study examined whether beliefs about the importance of thoughts (i.e., thought-action fusion; TAF) are related to the target subject of the negative thought. One hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomly assigned to imagine either a beloved relative or a stranger being diagnosed with cancer and provided in vivo ratings of anxiety, likelihood, moral wrongness, urge to neutralize, and how upsetting the event would be if it occurred. Results indicated that thinking of a relative being diagnosed with cancer provoked more distress, urges to neutralize, and higher estimates of likelihood, as well greater use of mental neutralizing behaviors, compared to thinking of a stranger. Contrary to our prediction, the groups did not differ in their ratings of the moral wrongness. These findings broadly support the assertion that the more personally significant a negative intrusive thought, the more it will provoke distress and urges to neutralize. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive model of obsessions and clinical implications are addressed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",893749193.0, Feature,2011
576,Inferred threat and safety: Symbolic generalization of human avoidance learning,"Symbolic generalization of avoidance may underlie the aetiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate inferred threat-avoidance and safety (non-avoidance) behaviours that occur in the presence of stimuli indirectly related to learned threat and safety cues. A laboratory experiment was conducted involving two symbolic stimulus equivalence relations consisting of three physically dissimilar stimuli (avoidance cues: AV1-AV2-AV3 and neutral cues: N1-N2-N3). During avoidance learning involving aversive images and sounds, a key-press avoidance response was trained for one member of one of the relations (AV2) and non-avoidance for another (N2). Inferred threat and safety behaviour and ratings of the likelihood of aversive events were tested with presentations of all remaining stimuli. Findings showed a significantly high percentage of avoidance to both the learned and inferred threat cues and less avoidance to both the learned and inferred safety cues. Ratings in the absence of avoidance were high during training and testing to threat cues and low to safety cues and were generally lower in the presence of avoidance. Implications for associative and behavioural accounts of avoidance, and modern therapies for anxiety disorders are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",893749172.0, Feature,2011
577,"Social anxiety and the effects of negative self-imagery on emotion, cognition, and post-event processing","Numerous studies have shown that social phobia patients experience negative self-impressions or images during social situations. Clark and Wells (1995) posited that such negative self-images are involved in the maintenance of social phobia. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of negative self-imagery on cognition and emotion during and following a brief social situation. Specifically, high and low socially anxious participants (N = 77) were instructed to hold either a negative or control self-image as they engaged in a brief speech. Participants then rated their anxiety, performance, cognitions, and focus of attention. Twenty-four hours later, they returned to the laboratory and completed questionnaires assessing the amount of post-event processing (PEP) they engaged in. The results showed that, irrespective of the level of social anxiety or depressive symptoms, participants that held the negative self-image experienced higher levels of anxiety, were more self-focused, experienced more negative thoughts, rated their anxiety as more visible, appraised their performance more negatively, and engaged in more negative and less positive PEP than participants that held the control self-image. Collectively the results indicate that negative imagery is causally involved in the maintenance of social phobia, as well as in the generation of social anxiety among non-anxious individuals.

578,Emotion dysregulation and adolescent psychopathology: A prospective study,"Emotion regulation deficits have been consistently linked to psychopathology in cross-sectional studies. However, the direction of the relationship between emotion regulation and psychopathology is unclear. This study examined the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between emotion regulation deficits and psychopathology in adolescents. Emotion dysregulation and symptomatology (depression, anxiety, aggressive behavior, and eating pathology) were assessed in a large, diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065) at two time points separated by seven months. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of psychopathology. The three distinct emotion processes examined here (emotional understanding, dysregulated expression of sadness and anger, and ruminative responses to distress) formed a unitary latent emotion dysregulation factor. Emotion dysregulation predicted increases in anxiety symptoms, aggressive behavior, and eating pathology after controlling for baseline symptoms but did not predict depressive symptoms. In contrast, none of the four types of psychopathology predicted increases in emotion dysregulation after controlling for baseline emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation appears to be an important transdiagnostic factor that increases risk for a wide range of psychopathology outcomes in adolescence. These results suggest targets for preventive interventions during this developmental period of risk.",883072455.0, Feature,2011

580,Transdiagnostic internet treatment for anxiety and depression: A randomised controlled trial,"Disorder-specific cognitive behavioural therapy programs delivered over the internet (iCBT) with clinician guidance are effective at treating specific anxiety disorders and depression. The present study examined the efficacy of a transdiagnostic iCBT protocol to treat three anxiety disorders and/or depression within the same program (the Wellbeing Program). Seventy-seven individuals with a principal diagnosis of major depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and/or social phobia were randomly assigned to a Treatment or Waitlist Control group. Treatment consisted of CBT-based online educational lessons and homework assignments, weekly email or telephone contact from a clinical psychologist, access to a moderated online discussion forum, and automated emails. Eighty one percent of Treatment group participants completed all 8 lessons within the 10 week program. Post-treatment data were collected from 34/37 Treatment group and 35/37 Control group participants, and 3-month follow-up data were collected from 32/37 Treatment group participants. Relative to Controls, Treatment group participants reported significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression as measured by the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 item, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 item scales, with corresponding between-groups effect sizes (Cohen's d) at post treatment of.56,.58, and.52, respectively. The clinician spent a mean time of 84.76 min (SD = 50.37) per person over the program. Participants rated the procedure as highly acceptable, and gains were sustained at follow-up. These results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of transdiagnostic iCBT in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",896166750.0, Journal Article,2011
581,Retrieval properties of negative vs. positive mental images and autobiographical memories in social anxiety: Outcomes with a new measure,"High (n = 41) and low (n = 39) socially anxious (SA) participants completed the Waterloo Images and Memories Interview (WIMI), a new assessment tool that measures the accessibility and properties of mental images and associated autobiographical memories that individuals may experience across both anxiety-provoking (negative) and non-anxiety-provoking (positive) social situations. Results indicated that both high and low SA individuals experience negative images and associated autobiographical memories in anxiety-provoking social situations, but the rates of endorsement of such images and memories among high SA participants were substantially lower than those reported in recent studies. Moreover, whereas low SA individuals were capable of accessing a relatively balanced array of both negative and positive self-representations that were rich in episodic detail, high SA individuals retrieved a higher, more unbalanced ratio of negative-to-positive images and memories, as well as impoverished positive images that were significantly degraded in episodic detail. Finally, negative images influenced the two groups differently, with high SA individuals experiencing more negative emotional and cognitive consequences associated with bringing such images to mind. These results are discussed in relation to theoretical models of learning and memory within the context of contemporary cognitive behavioral models of social anxiety.

We used a single-target implicit association test to measure threat-related automatic associations to social cues. Results showed that indeed in high socially anxious adolescents' social cues automatically elicited relatively strong threat-related associations. Supporting the relevance of differentiating between automatic and more explicit measures, both automatic and explicit associations were independently associated with adolescents' level of self-reported social anxiety. The present pattern of findings is not only consistent with the view that automatic and more deliberate threat-related associations are both involved in the etiology of social-anxiety symptoms, but also suggest that both types of associations are proper targets for early intervention programs.

Evidence suggests that visceral anxiety may be implicated in IBS onset and severity. Thus, cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) that targets visceral anxiety may alleviate IBS symptoms. Methods: The current study examined the efficacy of a CBT protocol for the treatment of IBS which directly targeted visceral sensations. Participants (N = 110) were randomized to receive 10 sessions of either: (a) CBT with interoceptive exposure (IE) to visceral sensations; (b) stress management (SM); or (c) an attention control (AC), and were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up sessions. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, the IE group outperformed AC on several indices of outcome, and outperformed SM in some domains. No differences were observed between SM and AC. The results suggest that IE may be a particularly efficacious treatment for IBS. Conclusions: Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed. CBT with interoceptive exposure (IE) was investigated for the treatment of IBS. IE was compared to stress management (SM) and attention control (AC). IE outperformed AC on several indices of outcome.

According to evolutionary and interpersonal theories, we construed the interpersonal world using the social rank and the affiliation psychological systems. Two studies assessed measures of social rank, affiliation, social anxiety and depression among a population of treatment-seeking individuals with SAD. In study 1, individuals with SAD without major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 42) were compared to healthy controls (n = 47). In study 2, individuals with SAD and MDD (n = 45) were compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders and MDD (n = 31). Results indicated that SAD was related to perceiving oneself as having low social rank, being inferior, and behaving submissively, as well as to low perceived intimacy and closeness among peer relations, friendships and romantic relations. SAD was distinctly associated with these perceptions above and beyond the symptomatic (study 1) and the syndrome-level (study 2) effects of depression. These findings were further supported by a path analysis of the SAD participants from both studies.

592,A case series of attention modification in clinically anxious youths,"Research in the last fifteen years suggests that anxious individuals selectively attend towards threatening information. Attention modification interventions for internalizing adults have been developed to target cognition at this basic level; these programs have demonstrated initial efficacy in attention bias and anxiety symptom reduction. To date, there have been no published studies of attention modification in youths with clinical levels of anxiety. The current case series examined the initial efficacy of a four-week (12 sessions) attention modification program (AMP) designed to train attention away from threat in 16 children and adolescents (ages 10 to 17) diagnosed with DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Overall, youths experienced a significant decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms, and 12 of 16 youths no longer met criteria for any anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment. AMP was feasible with youths, and all youths and parents deemed the program acceptable. These findings provide support for further research on the use of cognitive bias modification interventions with clinically anxious youths.

Sexuality is a primary source of positive experiences. We theorized that people with elevated social anxiety would have relatively less satisfying sexual experiences compared to those who were not anxious.

The relationship between social anxiety and the amount of sexual contact differed between men and women -- it was negative for women and negligible for men. Being in a close, intimate relationship enhanced the feelings of connectedness during sexual episodes for only individuals low in social anxiety. Depressive symptoms were negatively related to the amount of sexual contact, and the pleasure and feelings of connectedness experienced when sexually intimate. Controlling for depressive symptoms did not meaningfully change the social anxiety effects on daily sexuality.

597,A case series of attention modification in clinically anxious youths,"Research in the last fifteen years suggests that anxious individuals selectively attend towards threatening information. Attention modification interventions for internalizing adults have been developed to target cognition at this basic level; these programs have demonstrated initial efficacy in attention bias and anxiety symptom reduction. To date, there have been no published studies of attention modification in youths with clinical levels of anxiety. The current case series examined the initial efficacy of a four-week (12 sessions) attention modification program (AMP) designed to train attention away from threat in 16 children and adolescents (ages 10 to 17) diagnosed with DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Overall, youths experienced a significant decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms, and 12 of 16 youths no longer met criteria for any anxiety diagnosis at post-treatment. AMP was feasible with youths, and all youths and parents deemed the program acceptable. These findings provide support for further research on the use of cognitive bias modification interventions with clinically anxious youths. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",869148561.0, Feature,2011
598,Mindfulness-based stress reduction for patients with anxiety disorders: Evaluation in a randomized controlled trial,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for patients with heterogeneous anxiety disorders. Seventy-six self-referred patients were randomized to MBSR or a waiting-list control condition. Eight participants did not complete the eight-week MBSR intervention. Treatment completers improved significantly on all outcome measures compared to controls. The completer sample showed medium to large effect sizes on measures of anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.55-0.97), and a large effect size for symptoms of depression (Cohen's d = 0.97). Intention-to-treat analyses yielded effect sizes in the small to moderate range (Cohen's d = 0.32-0.76). Gains were maintained at six months follow-up. The percentage of participants reaching recovered status was highest for symptom measures of depression and anxiety, and lower for worry and trait anxiety. Mediation analyses indicated that mindfulness fully mediated changes in acute anxiety symptoms, and partially mediated changes in worry and trait anxiety. However, the present study did not find evidence of temporal precedence for the proposed mediator. In the absence of true mediation and an active control condition, it cannot be ruled out that results are due to non-specific aspects of treatment. Despite these and other limitations, we conclude that MBSR is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders and related symptomatology. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",870996108.0, Journal Article,2011
599,Culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) for Latino women with treatment-resistant PTSD: A pilot study comparing CA-CBT to applied muscle relaxation,"We examined the therapeutic efficacy of a culturally adapted form of CBT (CA-CBT) for PTSD as compared to applied muscle relaxation (AMR) for female Latino patients with treatment-resistant PTSD. Participants were randomized to receive either CA-CBT (n = 12) or AMR (n = 12), and were assessed before treatment, after treatment, and at a 12-week follow-up. The treatments were manualized and delivered in the form of group therapy across 14 weekly sessions. Assessments included a measure of PTSD, anxiety, culturally relevant idioms of distress (nervios and ataque de nervios), and emotion regulation ability. Patients receiving CA-CBT improved significantly more than in the AMR condition. Effect size estimates showed very large reductions in PTSD symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment in the CA-CBT group (Cohen's d = 2.6) but only modest improvements in the AMR group (0.8). These results suggest that CA-CBT can be beneficial for previously treatment-resistant PTSD in Latino women. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",870995865.0, Journal Article,2011
600,Cascading effects: The influence of attention bias to threat on the interpretation of ambiguous information,"Both attention bias to threat and negative interpretive bias have been implicated in the emergence and maintenance of anxiety disorders. However, relations between attention and interpretive biases remain poorly understood. The current study experimentally manipulated attention bias to threat and examined the effects of attention training on the way ambiguous information was interpreted. Results suggest that the preferential allocation of attention towards threat affects the manner in which ambiguous information is interpreted. Individuals trained to attend to threat were more likely than individuals in a placebo training group to interpret ambiguous information in a threat-related manner. These data suggest that perturbations in the initial stages of information processing associated with anxiety may lead to a cascade of subsequent processing biases.

601,Processes of change in psychological flexibility in an interdisciplinary group-based treatment for chronic pain based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,"There are now numerous studies of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for chronic pain. These studies provide growing support for the efficacy and effectiveness of ACT in this context as well as for the role of ACT-specific therapeutic processes, particularly those underlying psychological flexibility. The purpose of the present study was to continue to build on this work with a broader focus on these processes, including acceptance of pain, general psychological acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based action. Participants included 168 patients who completed an ACT-based treatment for chronic pain and a three-month follow-up. Following treatment and at follow-up, participants reported significantly reduced levels of depression, pain-related anxiety, physical and psychosocial disability, medical visits, and pain intensity in comparison to the start of treatment. They also showed significant increases in each of the processes of psychological flexibility. Most uncontrolled effect sizes were medium or large at the follow-up. In correlation analyses changes in the four processes measures generally were significantly related to changes in the measures of depression, anxiety, and disability. In regression analyses the combined processes were related to changes in outcomes above and beyond change in pain intensity. Although in some ways preliminary, these results specifically support the unique role of general psychological acceptance in relation to improvements achieved by treatment participants. The current study clarifies potential processes of change in treatment for chronic pain, particularly those aiming to enhance psychological flexibility.

606,Clarifying boundaries of binge eating disorder and psychiatric comorbidity: A latent structure analysis,"Binge eating disorder (BED) presents with substantial psychiatric comorbidity. This latent structure analysis sought to delineate boundaries of BED given its comorbidity with affective and anxiety disorders. A population-based sample of 151 women with BED, 102 women with affective or anxiety disorders, and 259 women without psychiatric disorders was assessed with clinical interviews and self-report-questionnaires. Taxometric analyses were conducted using DSM-IV criteria of BED and of affective and anxiety disorders. The results showed a taxonic structure of BED and of affective and anxiety disorders. Both taxa co-occurred at an above-chance level, but also presented independently with twice- as-large probabilities. Within the BED taxon, diagnostic co-occurrence indicated greater general psychopathology, lower social adaptation, and greater premorbid exposure to parental mood and substance disorder, but not greater eating disorder psychopathology. Eating disorder psychopathology discriminated individuals in the BED taxon from individuals in the affective and anxiety disorders taxon. Diagnostic criteria of BED were more indicative of the BED taxon than were criteria of affective and anxiety disorders. The results show that at the latent level, BED was co-occurring with, yet distinct from, affective and anxiety disorders and was not characterized by an underlying affective or anxiety disorder.

607,Rumination as a transdiagnostic factor in depression and anxiety,"The high rate of comorbidity among mental disorders has driven a search for factors associated with the development of multiple types of psychopathology, referred to as transdiagnostic factors. Rumination is involved in the etiology and maintenance of major depression, and recent evidence implicates rumination in the development of anxiety. The extent to which rumination is a transdiagnostic factor that accounts for the co-occurrence of symptoms of depression and anxiety, however, has not previously been examined. We investigated whether rumination explained the concurrent and prospective associations between symptoms of depression and anxiety in two longitudinal studies: one of adolescents (N = 1065) and one of adults (N = 1317). Rumination was a full mediator of the concurrent association between symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents (z = 6.7, p < .001) and was a partial mediator of this association in adults (z = 5.6, p < .001). In prospective analyses in the adolescent sample, baseline depressive symptoms predicted increases in anxiety, and rumination fully mediated this association (z = 5.26, p < .001). In adults, baseline depression predicted increases in anxiety and baseline anxiety predicted increases in depression; rumination fully mediated both of these associations (z = 235, p = .019 and z = 5.10, p < .001, respectively). These findings highlight the importance of targeting rumination in transdiagnostic treatment approaches for emotional disorders. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",870995556.0, Journal Article,2011

We investigated differences in heartbeat perception as a proxy of interoception in 48 individuals high and low in social anxiety at baseline and while anticipating a public speech. Results revealed lower error scores for high fearful participants both at baseline and during speech anticipation. Speech anticipation improved heartbeat perception in both groups only marginally. Eight of nine accurate perceivers as determined using a criterion of maximum difference between actual and counted beats were high socially anxious. Higher interoceptive accuracy might increase the risk of misinterpreting physical symptoms as visible signs of anxiety which then trigger negative evaluation by others. Treatment should take into account that in socially anxious individuals perceived physical arousal is likely to be accurate rather than false alarm.

While clients may not be able to accurately report their motivation, ambivalence about change may nonetheless be expressed in actual therapy sessions as opposition to the direction set by the therapist (i.e., resistance). In the context of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder, the present study compared the ability of observed in-session resistance in CBT session 1 and two self-report measures of motivation for changing anxiety (the Change Questionnaire & the Client Motivational for Therapy Scale) to (1) predict client and therapist rated homework compliance (2) predict post-CBT and one-year post-treatment worry reduction, and (3) differentiate those who received motivational interviewing prior to CBT from those who received no pre-treatment. Observed in-session resistance performed very well on each index, compared to the performance of self-reported motivation which was inconsistent and weaker relative to observed resistance. These findings strongly support both clinician sensitivity to moments of client resistance in actual therapy sessions as early as session 1, and the inclusion of observational process measures in CBT research.

The current study used multilevel modeling to determine if PEP decreased as a result of treatment and if PEP limits treatment response for two types of cognitive behavioral treatments, a group-based cognitive behavioral intervention and individually based virtual reality exposure. These hypotheses were evaluated using 91 participants diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. The findings suggested that PEP decreased as a result of treatment, and that social anxiety symptoms for individuals reporting greater levels of PEP improved at a slower rate than those with lower levels of PEP. Further research is needed to understand why PEP attenuates response to treatment. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",862592084.0, Journal Article,2011

616,A feasibility study of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for emotional dysfunction following psychosis,"The experience of psychosis can lead to depression, anxiety and fear. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) facilitates individuals to accept difficult mental experiences and behave in ways that are consistent with personally held values. This study was a single (rater) blind pilot randomised controlled trial of ACT for emotional dysfunction following psychosis. Twenty-seven participants with psychosis were randomised to either: ten sessions of ACT plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills and Working Alliance Inventory were used. Individuals were assessed at baseline and 3 months post-baseline. The individuals randomised to receive ACT found the intervention acceptable. A significantly greater proportion of the ACT group changed from being depressed at time of entry into the study to not being depressed at follow-up. The ACT group showed a significantly greater increase in mindfulness skills and reduction in negative symptoms. Results indicated that individuals randomised to ACT had significantly fewer crisis contacts over the study. Changes in mindfulness skills correlated positively with changes in depression. ACT appears to offer promise in reducing negative symptoms, depression and crisis contacts in psychosis. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",925742381.0, Journal Article,2011
617,Perseverative thought: A robust predictor of response to emotional challenge in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently co-occur, yet the reasons for their comorbidity remain poorly understood. In the present experiment, we tested whether a tendency to engage in negative, repetitive thinking constitutes a common risk process for the two disorders. A mixed sample of adults with comorbid GAD-MDD (n = 50), GAD only (n = 35), MDD only (n = 34), or no lifetime psychopathology (n = 35) was administered noncontingent failure and success feedback on consecutive performance tasks. Perseverative thought (PT), measured by negative thought intrusions during a baseline period of focused breathing, emerged as a powerful prospective predictor of responses to this experimental challenge. Participants reporting more frequent negative thought intrusions at baseline, irrespective of thought content or diagnostic status, exhibited a stronger negative response to failure that persisted even after subsequent success. Higher PT over the course of the experiment was associated with later behavioral avoidance, with negative affect and other traits closely linked to anxiety and depression, and with the presence and severity of GAD and MDD. These findings provide evidence for a broadly-defined PT trait that is shared by GAD and MDD and contributes to adverse outcomes in these disorders.

618,The role of anxiety and perspective-taking strategy on affective empathic responses,"Empathy is an important pro-social behaviour critical to a positive client-therapist relationship. Therapist anxiety has been linked to reduced ability to empathise and lower client satisfaction with therapy. However, the nature of the relationship between anxiety and empathy is currently unclear. The current study investigated the effect of experimentally-induced anxiety on empathic responses elicited during three different perspective-taking tasks. Perspective-taking was manipulated within-subjects with all participants (N = 52) completing imagine-self, imagine-other and objective conditions. A threat of shock manipulation was used to vary anxiety between-subjects. Participants in the threat of shock condition reported higher levels of anxiety during the experiment and lower levels of empathy-related distress for the targets than participants in the control condition. Perspective-taking was associated with higher levels of empathy-related distress and concern compared to the objective condition. The present results suggest that perspective-taking can to a large extent mitigate the influence of heightened anxiety on an individual's ability to empathise.

619,"Comorbid social anxiety disorder in clients with depressive disorders: Predicting changes in depressive symptoms, therapeutic relationships, and focus of attention in group treatment","The current study examined whether depressed outpatients with comorbid SAD respond differently to a cognitive-behavioral group intervention and if so, how and why. Using growth curve modeling, we found evidence that depressed clients with comorbid SAD had rapid improvement in depressive symptoms over the course of treatment and generally did not differ from those without comorbidity in developing close therapeutic relationships and modifying the direction of attentional focus away from the self. Non-linear effects demonstrated that rates of change in depressive symptoms, relationship variables, and focus of attention, were most rapid early in treatment. In contrast to hypotheses, trajectories of change in therapeutic relationships and attentional focus did not mediate the effect of SAD on treatment improvement in depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that comorbid SAD does not have a detrimental effect on the course of depression treatment and group-based treatments can be as beneficial for depressed individuals with comorbid SAD. It may be that group-based treatments for depression provide explicit opportunity for emotional processing in social situations (i.e., exposure) and hence mimic efficacious therapies for SAD.

620,An open trial of a brief transdiagnostic internet treatment for anxiety and depression,"The present study evaluated the efficacy of a brief version of an internet-administered transdiagnostic CBT protocol, the Wellbeing Program (Titov et al., 2011), designed to treat three anxiety disorders and major depression within the same program. This brief version included the same core CBT skills as the original, but condensed the materials from 8 to 5 online lessons, reduced the duration of treatment from 10 to 8 weeks and did not include an online forum. Thirty-two individuals with a principal diagnosis of major depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia received CBT-based online educational lessons, homework assignments, weekly contact from a clinical psychologist and automated emails. Eighty-one percent of participants completed the lessons within the 8 week program. Post-treatment and 3-month follow-up data were collected from 28/32 and 31/32 participants respectively. Participants improved significantly on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales -- 21 Item, Patient Health Questionnaire -- 9 Item, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder -- 7 Item scales, with corresponding within-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) at follow-up of 1.05, .73, and .95, respectively. Participants rated the procedure as highly acceptable with gains of a similar magnitude as those found for the original program, but less time was spent per participant by the clinician in the present trial (mean = 44.61 min, SD = 34.45) compared to the original program (mean = 84.76 min, SD = 50.37). These results provide additional support for the efficacy of transdiagnostic iCBT in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders and indicate that a brief version may be of benefit.

621,The effectiveness of dialectical behaviour therapy in routine public mental health settings: An Australian controlled trial,"Randomised controlled studies in research environments have demonstrated dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) to be more efficacious than treatment as usual in reducing suicidal behaviour in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of DBT in the treatment of BPD within routine clinical settings. This study examines the clinical and cost effectiveness of providing DBT over treatment as usual in a routine Australian public mental health service. Forty-three adult patients with BPD were provided with outpatient DBT for six months with patient outcomes compared to those obtained from patients in a wait list group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) from the same service. After six months of treatment the DBT group showed significantly greater reductions in suicidal/non-suicidal self-injury, emergency department visits, psychiatric admissions and bed days. Self-report measures were administered to a reduced sample of patients. With this group, DBT patients demonstrated significantly improved depression, anxiety and general symptom severity scores compared to TAU at six months. Average treatment costs were significantly lower for those patients in DBT than those receiving TAU. Therapists who received intensive DBT training were shown to produce significantly greater improvements in patients' suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury than therapists who received only 4 day basic training. Further clinical improvements were achieved in patients offered an additional six months of DBT. This study demonstrates that providing DBT to patients within routine public mental health settings can be both clinically effective and cost effective.

622,Long-term follow-up of internet-delivered exposure and mindfulness based treatment for irritable bowel syndrome,"We conducted a follow-up of a previously reported study of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for IBS, based on exposure and mindfulness exercises (Ljotsson et al. (2010). Internet-delivered exposure and mindfulness based therapy for irritable bowel syndrome - a randomized controlled trial. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 48, 531-539). Seventy-five participants from the original sample of 85 (88%) reported follow-up data at 15-18 months (mean 16.4 months) after completing treatment. The follow-up sample included participants from both the original study's treatment group and waiting list after it had been crossed over to treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that treatment gains were maintained on all outcome measures, including IBS symptoms, quality of life, and anxiety related to gastrointestinal symptoms, with mainly large effect sizes (within-group Cohen's d = 0.78-1.11). A total of fifty participants (59% of the total original sample; 52% of the original treatment group participants and 65% of the original waiting list participants) reported adequate relief of symptoms. Improvements at follow-up were more pronounced for the participants that had completed the full treatment and maintenance of improvement did not seem to be dependent on further treatment seeking. This study suggests that internet-delivered CBT based on exposure and mindfulness has long-term beneficial effects for IBS-patients. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]",855900499.0, Journal Article,2011
623,"Maternal depressive history, teen 5HTTLPR genotype, and the processing of emotional faces: Exploring mechanisms of risk","Variations in the serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR) and biased processing of face-emotion displays both have been implicated in the transmission of depression risk, but little is known about developmental influences on these relationships. Within a community sample of adolescents, we examine whether 5HTTLPR genotype moderates the link between maternal depressive history and errors in face-emotion labeling. When controlling for current levels of depression and anxiety among youth, a two-way interaction between maternal depressive history and 5HTTLPR genotype was detected. Specifically, adolescents whose mothers reported a depressive history and who had a low expressing genotype made more errors in classifying emotional faces when compared with adolescents with an intermediate or high expressing genotype, with or without maternal depression history. These findings highlight the complex manner in which maternal depression and genetic risk may interact to predict individual differences in social information processing.

The ACT intervention is aimed at increasing the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions and living a mindful and value-based life. Method: Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to the ACT intervention (n = 49) or to a waiting list (n = 44). The mean age of the participants was 49 years. The majority of the participants was female and of Dutch origin. All the participants completed measures before and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS), alcohol use and acceptance (AAQ-II). Results: The ACT intervention led to statistically significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (Cohen's d = .60). These reductions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Also significant reductions in anxiety and fatigue were observed. Moreover, mediational analysis showed that the improvement of acceptance during the intervention mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive symptomatology at follow-up. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an early intervention based on ACT, aimed at increasing acceptance, is effective in reducing depressive symptomatology.

625,"Individually-tailored, Internet-based treatment for anxiety disorders: A randomized controlled trial","Previous studies on Internet-based treatment with minimal to moderate therapist guidance have shown promising results for a number of specific diagnoses. The aim of this study was to test a new approach to Internet treatment that involves tailoring the treatment according to the patient's unique characteristics and comorbidities. A total of 54 participants, regardless of specific anxiety diagnosis, were included after an in-person, semi-structured diagnostic interview and randomized to a 10 week treatment program or to a control group. Treatment consisted of a number of individually-prescribed modules in conjunction with online therapist guidance. Significant results were found for all dependent measures both immediately following treatment and at 1 and 2 year intervals. Mean between-group effect size including measures of anxiety, depression and quality of life was Cohen's d = 0.69 at post-treatment, while the mean within-group effect size was d = 1.15 at post-treatment and d = 1.13 and d = 1.04 at 1 and 2 year follow-up respectively. The tentative conclusion drawn from these results is that tailoring the Internet-based therapy can be a feasible approach in the treatment of anxiety in a homogeneous population.

628,The effectiveness of dialectical behaviour therapy in routine public mental health settings: An Australian controlled trial,"Randomised controlled studies in research environments have demonstrated dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) to be more efficacious than treatment as usual in reducing suicidal behaviour in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of DBT in the treatment of BPD within routine clinical settings. This study examines the clinical and cost effectiveness of providing DBT over treatment as usual in a routine Australian public mental health service. Forty-three adult patients with BPD were provided with outpatient DBT for six months with patient outcomes compared to those obtained from patients in a wait list group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) from the same service. After six months of treatment the DBT group showed significantly greater reductions in suicidal/non-suicidal self-injury, emergency department visits, psychiatric admissions and bed days. Self-report measures were administered to a reduced sample of patients. With this group, DBT patients demonstrated significantly improved depression, anxiety and general symptom severity scores compared to TAU at six months. Average treatment costs were significantly lower for those patients in DBT than those receiving TAU. Therapists who received intensive DBT training were shown to produce significantly greater improvements in patients' suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury than therapists who received only 4 day basic training. Further clinical improvements were achieved in patients offered an additional six months of DBT. This study demonstrates that providing DBT to patients within routine public mental health settings can be both clinically effective and cost effective.

629,Long-term follow-up of internet-delivered exposure and mindfulness based treatment for irritable bowel syndrome,"We conducted a follow-up of a previously reported study of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for IBS, based on exposure and mindfulness exercises (Ljotsson et al. (2010). Internet-delivered exposure and mindfulness based therapy for irritable bowel syndrome - a randomized controlled trial. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 48, 531 - 539). Seventy-five participants from the original sample of 85 (88%) reported follow-up data at 15 - 18 months (mean 16.4 months) after completing treatment. The follow-up sample included participants from both the original study's treatment group and waiting list after it had been crossed over to treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that treatment gains were maintained on all outcome measures, including IBS symptoms, quality of life, and anxiety related to gastrointestinal symptoms, with mainly large effect sizes (within-group Cohen's d = 0.78 - 1.11). A total of fifty participants (59% of the total original sample; 52% of the original treatment group participants and 65% of the original waiting list participants) reported adequate relief of symptoms. Improvements at follow-up were more pronounced for the participants that had completed the full treatment and maintenance of improvement did not seem to be dependent on further treatment seeking. This study suggests that internet-delivered CBT based on exposure and mindfulness has long-term beneficial effects for IBS-patients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",848411327.0, Feature,2011
630,"Maternal depressive history, teen 5HTTLPR genotype, and the processing of emotional faces: Exploring mechanisms of risk","Variations in the serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR) and biased processing of face-emotion displays both have been implicated in the transmission of depression risk, but little is known about developmental influences on these relationships. Within a community sample of adolescents, we examine whether 5HTTLPR genotype moderates the link between maternal depressive history and errors in face-emotion labeling. When controlling for current levels of depression and anxiety among youth, a two-way interaction between maternal depressive history and 5HTTLPR genotype was detected. Specifically, adolescents whose mothers reported a depressive history and who had a low expressing genotype made more errors in classifying emotional faces when compared with adolescents with an intermediate or high expressing genotype, with or without maternal depression history. These findings highlight the complex manner in which maternal depression and genetic risk may interact to predict individual differences in social information processing.

660,"Prevalence and risk factors of major depressive disorder in HIV/AIDS as seen in semi-urban Entebbe district, Uganda","Background: Not much is known about the risk factors of major depressive disorder (MDD) in HIV/AIDS in the African socio-cultural context. Therefore a study was undertaken to examine the prevalence and risk factors of MDD in HIV/AIDS in semi-urban Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 618 respondents attending two HIV clinics in Uganda. Results: Prevalence of MDD was 8.1%. Factors associated with MDD at univariate analysis only were female gender, family history of mental illness, negative coping style, alcohol dependency disorder, food insecurity and stress; not associated with MDD were social support, neurocognitive impairment, CD4 counts and BMI. Factors independently associated with MDD were psychosocial impairment, adverse life events, post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and life-time attempted suicide. Conclusion: Psychological and social factors were the main risk factors of MDD among ambulatory HIV positive persons with no evidence for the role of the neurotoxic effects of HIV. Treatment approaches for MDD in this patient group should be modeled on those used among non-HIV groups.

661,Efficacy of exposure versus cognitive therapy in anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for a wide range of psychological disorders. There is a continued controversy about whether challenging maladaptive thoughts rather than use of behavioural interventions alone is associated with the greatest efficacy. However little is known about the relative efficacy of various components of CBT. This review aims to compare the relative efficacy of Cognitive Therapy (CT) versus Exposure (E) for a range of anxiety disorders using the most clinically relevant outcome measures and estimating the summary relative efficacy by combining the studies in a meta-analysis. Methods: Psych INFO, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the first available year to May 2010. All randomised controlled studies comparing the efficacy of exposure with cognitive therapy were included. Odds ratios (OR) or standardised means' differences (Hedges' g) for the most clinically relevant primary outcomes were calculated. Outcomes of the studies were grouped according to specific disorders and were combined in meta-analyses exploring short-term and long-term outcomes. Results: 20 Randomised Controlled Trials with (n = 1,308) directly comparing the efficacy of CT and E in anxiety disorders were included in the meta-analysis. No statistically significant difference in the relative efficacy of CT and E was revealed in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and in Panic Disorder (PD). There was a statistically significant difference favouring CT versus E in Social Phobia both in the short-term (Z = 3.72, p = 0.0002) and the long-term (Z = 3.28, p = 0.001) outcomes. Conclusions: On the basis of extant literature, there appears to be no evidence of differential efficacy between cognitive therapy and exposure in PD, PTSD and OCD and strong evidence of superior efficacy of cognitive therapy in social phobia (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1634755040.0," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2011
662,Seasonality in depressive and anxiety symptoms among primary care patients and in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders; Results from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety,"Background: Little is known about seasonality of specific depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms in different patient populations. This study aims to assess seasonal variation of depressive and anxiety symptoms in a primary care population and across participants who were classified in diagnostic groups 1) healthy controls 2) patients with a major depressive disorder, 3) patients with any anxiety disorder and 4) patients with a major depression and any anxiety disorder. Methods: Data were used from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). First, in 5549 patients from the NESDA primary care recruitment population the Kessler-10 screening questionnaire was used and data were analyzed across season in a multilevel linear model. Second, in 1090 subjects classified into four groups according to psychiatric status according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, overall depressive symptoms and atypical versus melancholic features were assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms. Anxiety and fear were assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Fear questionnaire. Symptom levels across season were analyzed in a linear regression model. Results: In the primary care population the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms did not show a seasonal pattern. In the diagnostic groups healthy controls and patients with any anxiety disorder, but not patients with a major depressive disorder, showed a small rise in depressive symptoms in winter. Atypical and melancholic symptoms were both elevated in winter. No seasonal pattern for anxiety symptoms was found. There was a small gender related seasonal effect for fear symptoms. Conclusions: Seasonal differences in severity or type of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as measured with a general screening instrument and symptom questionnaires, were absent or small in effect size in a primary care population and in patient populations with a major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

663,Healthcare utilization and costs in patients beginning pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder: A retrospective cohort study,"Background: Patterns of healthcare utilization and costs in patients beginning pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have not been well characterized. Methods: Using a large US health insurance database, we identified all patients with evidence of GAD (ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 300.02) who initiated pharmacotherapy with medications commonly used to treat GAD (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], venlafaxine, benzodiazepines) between 1/1/2003 and 12/31/2007. We examined healthcare utilization and costs over the 12-month periods preceding and following date of initial receipt of such therapy (""pretreatment” and “follow-up”, respectively). Patients with incomplete data were excluded. Results: A total of 10,275 patients met all study inclusion criteria. Forty-eight percent of patients received SSRIs; 34%, benzodiazepines; and 6%, venlafaxine. SSRIs and venlafaxine were about three times more likely to be used on a long-term basis (&gt; 90 days) than benzodiazepines (p &lt; 0.01). In general, levels of healthcare utilization were higher during follow-up than pretreatment. Mean (SD) total healthcare costs increased from $4812 ($10,006) during pretreatment to $7182 ($22,041) during follow-up (p &lt; 0.01); costs of GAD-related pharmacotherapy during followup were $420 ($485). Conclusions: More than one-half of patients initiating pharmacotherapy for GAD receive either SSRIs or venlafaxine. Levels of healthcare utilization and costs are greater in the year following initiation of therapy than in the immediately preceding one.

664,General and specific components of depression and anxiety in an adolescent population,"Background: Depressive and anxiety symptoms often co-occur resulting in a debate about common and distinct features of depression and anxiety. Methods: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a bifactor modelling approach were used to separate a general distress continuum from more specific sub-domains of depression and anxiety in an adolescent community sample (n = 1159, age 14). The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale were used. Results: A three-factor confirmatory factor analysis is reported which identified a) mood and social-cognitive symptoms of depression, b) worrying symptoms, and c) somatic and information-processing symptoms as distinct yet closely related constructs. Subsequent bifactor modelling supported a general distress factor which accounted for the communality of the depression and anxiety items. Specific factors for hopelessness-suicidal thoughts and restlessness-fatigue indicated distinct psychopathological constructs which account for unique information over and above the general distress factor. The general distress factor and the hopelessness-suicidal factor were more severe in females but the restlessness-fatigue factor worse in males. Measurement precision of the general distress factor was higher and spanned a wider range of the population than any of the three first-order factors. Conclusions: The general distress factor provides the most reliable target for epidemiological analysis but specific factors may help to refine valid phenotype dimensions for aetiological research and assist in prognostic modelling of future psychiatric episodes.

665,"A randomized, controlled clinical trial: The effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on generalized anxiety disorder among Chinese community patients: Protocol for a randomized trial","Background: Research suggests that an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program may be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders. Our objective is to compare the clinical effectiveness of the MBCT program with a psycho-education programme and usual care in reducing anxiety symptoms in people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: A three armed randomized, controlled clinical trial including 9-month post-treatment follow-up is proposed. Participants screened positive using the Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for general anxiety disorder will be recruited from community-based clinics. 228 participants will be randomly allocated to the MBCT program plus usual care, psycho-education program plus usual care or the usual care group. Validated Chinese version of instruments measuring anxiety and worry symptoms, depression, quality of life and health service utilization will be used. Our primary end point is the change of anxiety and worry score (Beck Anxiety Inventory and Penn State Worry Scale) from baseline to the end of intervention. For primary analyses, treatment outcomes will be assessed by ANCOVA, with change in anxiety score as the baseline variable, while the baseline anxiety score and other baseline characteristics that significantly differ between groups will serve as covariates. Conclusions: This is a first randomized controlled trial that compare the effectiveness of MBCT with an active control, findings will advance current knowledge in the management of GAD and the way that group intervention can be delivered and inform future research.

666,The Generalised Anxiety Stigma Scale (GASS): Psychometric properties in a community sample,"Background: Although there is substantial concern about negative attitudes to mental illness, little is known about the stigma associated with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or its measurement. The aim of this study was to develop a multi-item measure of Generalised Anxiety Disorder stigma (the GASS). Methods: Stigma items were developed from a thematic analysis of web-based text about the stigma associated with GAD. Six hundred and seventeen members of the public completed a survey comprising the resulting 20 stigma items and measures designed to evaluate construct validity. Follow-up data were collected for a subset of the participants (n = 212). Results: The factor structure comprised two components: Personal Stigma (views about Generalised Anxiety Disorder); and Perceived Stigma (views about the beliefs of most others in the community). There was evidence of good construct validity and reliability for each of the Generalised Anxiety Stigma Scale (GASS) subscales. Conclusions: The GASS is a promising brief measure of the stigma associated with Generalised Anxiety Disorder.

667,Report of depressive symptoms on waiting list and mortality after liver and kidney transplantation: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Little research has explored pre-transplantation psychological factors as predictors of outcome after liver or kidney transplantation. Our objective is to determine whether report of depressive symptoms on waiting list predicts outcome of liver and kidney transplantation. Methods: Patients on waiting list for liver or kidney transplantation were classified for report or non-report of depressive symptoms on waiting list. 339 were transplanted 6 months later on average, and followed prospectively. The main outcome measures were graft failure and mortality 18 months post-transplantation. Results: Among the 339 patients, 51.6% reported depressive symptoms on waiting list, 16.5% had a graft failure and 7.4% died post-transplantation. Report of depressive symptoms on waiting list predicted a 3 to 4-fold decreased risk of graft failure and mortality 18-months post-transplantation, independently from age, gender, current cigarette smoking, anxiety symptoms, main primary diagnosis, UNOS score, number of comorbid diagnoses and history of transplantation. Data were consistent for liver and kidney transplantations. Other baseline predictive factors were: for graft failure, the main primary diagnosis and a shorter length since this diagnosis, and for mortality, older age, male gender and the main primary diagnosis. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of the association between report of depressive symptoms on waiting list and decreased risk of graft failure and mortality after transplantation.

668,Outcomes for depression and anxiety in primary care and details of treatment: A naturalistic longitudinal study,"Background: There is little evidence as to whether or not guideline concordant care in general practice results in better clinical outcomes for people with anxiety and depression. This study aims to determine possible associations between guideline concordant care and clinical outcomes in general practice patients with depression and anxiety, and identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with clinical improvement. Methods: This study forms part of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Results: 721 patients with a current (6-month recency) anxiety or depressive disorder participated. While patients who received guideline concordant care (N = 281) suffered from more severe symptoms than patients who received non-guideline concordant care (N = 440), both groups showed equal improvement in their depressive or anxiety symptoms after 12 months. Patients who (still) had moderate or severe symptoms at follow-up, were more often unemployed, had smaller personal networks and more severe depressive symptoms at baseline than patients with mild symptoms at follow-up. The particular type of treatment followed made no difference to clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The added value of guideline concordant care could not be demonstrated in this study. Symptom severity, employment status, social support and comorbidity of anxiety and depression all play a role in poor clinical outcomes.

669,Sub-threshold depression and antidepressants use in a community sample: Searching anxiety and finding bipolar disorder,"Background: To determine the use of antidepressants (ADs) in people with sub-threshold depression (SD); the lifetime prevalence of mania and hypomania in SD and the link between ADs use, bipolarity and anxiety disorders in SD. Methods: Study design: community survey. Study population: samples randomly drawn, after stratification from the adult population of municipal records. Sample size: 4999 people from seven areas within six Italian regions. Tools: Questionnaire on psychotropic drug consumption, prescription; Structured Clinical Interview NP for DSM-IV modified (ANTAS); Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ); Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). SD definition: HAM-D &gt; 10 without lifetime diagnosis of Depressive Episode (DE). Results: SD point prevalence is 5.0%. The lifetime prevalence of mania and hypomania episodes in SD is 7.3%. Benzodiazepines (BDZ) consumption in SD is 24.1%, followed by ADs (19.7%). In SD, positive for MDQ and comorbidity with Panic Disorder (PD) or Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD) are associated with ADs use, whereas the association between a positive MDQ and ADs use, without a diagnosis of PD or GAD, is not significant. Only in people with DE the well-being (SF-12) is higher among those using first-line antidepressants compared to those not using any medication. In people with SD no significant differences were found in terms of SF-12 score according to drug use. Conclusions: This study suggests caution in prescribing ADs to people with SD. In people with concomitant anxiety disorders and SD, it should be mandatory to perform a well-designed assessment and evaluate the presence of previous manic or hypomanic symptoms prior to prescribing ADs.

670,The relaxation exercise and social support trial-resst: Study protocol for a randomized community based trial,"Background: Studies suggests a possible link between vaginal discharge and common mental distress, as well as highlight the implications of the subjective burden of disease and its link with mental health. Methods/Design: This is a community-based intervention trial that aims to evaluate the impact of a psycho-social intervention on medically unexplained vaginal discharge (MUVD) in a group of married, low-income Lebanese women, aged 18-49, and suffering from low to moderate levels of anxiety and/or depression. The intervention consisted of 12 sessions of structured social support, problem solving techniques, group discussions and trainer-supervised relaxation exercises (twice per week over six weeks). Women were recruited from Hey el Selloum, a southern disadvantaged suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, during an open recruitment campaign. The primary outcome was self-reported MUVD, upon ruling out reproductive tract infections (RTIs), through lab analysis. Anxiety and/or depression symptoms were the secondary outcomes for this trial. These were assessed using an Arabic validated version of the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25). Assessments were done at baseline and six months using face-to face interviews, pelvic examinations and laboratory tests. Women were randomized into either intervention or control group. Intent to treat analysis will be used. Discussion: The results will indicate whether the proposed psychosocial intervention was effective in reducing MUVD (possibly mediated by common mental distress).

671,Meta-review of the effectiveness of computerised CBT in treating depression,"Background: Several computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) packages are now available to treat mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety. These have been usually been reviewed alongside cCBT for a wide range of psychological problems. Here, we single out the results of these reviews for the most common mental disorder, mild to moderate depression. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the quality of existing reviews and to enable reliable comparisons of alternative computer packages for the same patient group. Methods: A thorough search and analysis of reviews of efficacy of cCBT published between 1999 and February 2011. Results: The search yielded twelve systematic reviews from ten studies covering depression. Their methodology is appraised and selected findings are presented here. Conclusions: The meta-review supports the efficacy of cCBT for treatment of depression; however there is limited information on different approaches, whose relative cost-effectiveness remains to be demonstrated. Suggestions are made for future studies in the field.

672,Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with asthma,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized as a common disorder not only in children, but also in the adult population. Similarly, asthma also has a substantial prevalence among adults. Previous studies concerning a potential relationship between ADHD and asthma have not presented consistent results. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 594 adult patients diagnosed with ADHD, compared with 719 persons from the general population. Information was collected between 1997 and 2005 using auto-questionnaires rating past and present symptoms of ADHD, co-morbid conditions, including asthma, and work status. Results: The prevalence of asthma was significantly higher in the ADHD patient group compared to the controls, 24.4% vs. 11.3% respectively (OR=2.54, 95% CI 1.89-3.44), and controls with asthma scored higher on ratings of both past and present symptoms of ADHD. Female ADHD patients had a significantly higher prevalence of asthma compared to male ADHD patients (30.9% vs. 18.2%, OR=2.01, CI 1.36-2.95), but in controls a slight female preponderance was not statistically significant. In both ADHD patients and controls, having asthma was associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms of mood- and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: The present findings point to a co-morbidity of ADHD and asthma, and these patients may represent a clinical and biological subgroup of adult patients with ADHD.

673,Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder: A pilot study,"Background: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is widely regarded as an effective treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), but access to CBT therapists is limited. Internet-based CBT (ICBT) with therapist support is a way to increase access to CBT but has not been developed or tested for OCD. The aim of this study was to evaluate ICBT for OCD. Method: An open trial where patients (N = 23) received a 15-week ICBT program with therapist support consisting of psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring and exposure with response prevention. The primary outcome was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), which was assessed by a psychiatrist before and immediately after treatment. Secondary outcomes were self-rated measures of OCD symptoms, depressive symptoms, general functioning, anxiety and quality of life. All assessments were made at baseline and post-treatment. Results: All participants completed the primary outcome measure at all assessment points. There were reductions in OCD symptoms with a large within-group effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.56). At post-treatment, 61% of participants had a clinically significant improvement and 43% no longer fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of OCD. The treatment also resulted in statistically significant improvements in self-rated OCD symptoms, general functioning and depression. Conclusions: ICBT with therapist support reduces OCD symptoms, depressive symptoms and improves general functioning. Randomized trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this new treatment format.

674,Early effect of NEURAPAS &lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; balance on current source density (CSD) of human EEG,"Psychiatric patients often suffer from stress, anxiety and depression. Various plant extracts are known to fight stress (valerian), anxiety (passion flower) or depression (St. John’s wort). NEURAPAS ® balance is a mixture of these three extracts and has been designed to cover this complex of psychiatric conditions. The study was initiated to quantitatively assess the effect of this combination on brain electric activity. Method: Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) current source density (CSD) recording from 16 healthy male and female human volunteers (average age 49 years) was used in a randomized, placebo-controlled cross over study. Recordings were performed 0. 5, 1. 5, 3 and 4 hours after administration of the preparations under the conditions of 6 min eyes open and 5 min d2 concentration test, mathematical calculation test and memory test, respectively. All variables (electric power within 6 frequency ranges at 17 electrode positions) were fed into a linear discriminant analysis (eyes open condition). In the presence of mental load these variables were used to construct brain maps of frequency changes. Results: Under the condition of mental load, centro-parietal spectral power remained statistically significantly lower within alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 frequencies in the presence of verum in comparison to placebo. Discriminant analysis revealed a difference to placebo 3 and 4 hours after intake of 6 tablets of NEURAPAS ® balance. Data location within the polydimensional space was projected into the area of the effects of sedative and anti-depressive reference drugs tested earlier under identical conditions. Results appeared closer to the effects of fluoxetine than to St. John’s wort. Conclusions: Analysis of the neurophysiological changes following the intake of NEURAPAS ® balance revealed a similarity of frequency changes to those of calming and anti-depressive drugs on the EEG without impairment of cognition.

675,Substance abuse and psychiatric co-morbidity as predictors of premature mortality in Swedish drug abusers a prospective longitudinal study 1970 - 2006,"Background: Few longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades. Methods: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing risks Cox regression analysis. Results: Of 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 patients (36.4%) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of non drug related death. Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death.

676,Exercise augmentation compared to usual care for post traumatic stress disorder: A randomised controlled trial (the REAP study: Randomised Exercise Augmentation for PTSD),"Background: The physical wellbeing of people with mental health conditions can often be overlooked in order to treat the primary mental health condition as a priority. Exercise however, can potentially improve both the primary psychiatric condition as well as physical measures that indicate risk of other conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports the role of exercise as an important component of treatment for depression and anxiety, yet no randomised controlled trials (RCT’s) have been conducted to evaluate the use of exercise in the treatment of people with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This RCT will investigate the effects of structured, progressive exercise on PTSD symptoms, functional ability, body composition, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and medication usage. Methods and design: Eighty participants with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnosis of PTSD will be recruited. Participants will have no contraindications to exercise and will be cognitively able to provide consent to participate in the study. The primary outcome measures will be PTSD symptoms, measured through the PTSD Checklist Civilian (PCL-C) scale. Secondary outcome measures will assess depression and anxiety, mobility and strength, body composition, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and medication usage. All outcomes will be assessed by a health or exercise professional masked to group allocation at baseline and 12 weeks after randomisation. The intervention will be a 12 week individualised program, primarily involving resistance exercises with the use of exercise bands. A walking component will also be incorporated. Participants will complete one supervised session per week, and will be asked to perform at least two other non-supervised exercise sessions per week. Both intervention and control groups will receive all usual non-exercise interventions including psychotherapy, pharmaceutical interventions and group therapy. Discussion: This study will determine the effect of an individualised and progressive exercise intervention on PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, mobility and strength, body composition, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and medication usage among people with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD.

677,Risk of malnutrition is associated with mental health symptoms in community living elderly men and women: The Tromsø Study,"Background: Little research has been done on the relationship between malnutrition and mental health in community living elderly individuals. In the present study, we aimed to assess the associations between mental health (particularly anxiety and depression) and both the risk of malnutrition and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) in a large sample of elderly men and women from Tromsø, Norway. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, with 1558 men and 1553 women aged 65 to 87 years, the risk of malnutrition was assessed by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (’MUST’), and mental health was measured by the Symptoms Check List 10 (SCL-10). BMI was categorised into six groups (&lt; 20.0, 20.0-22.4, 22.5-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, ≥ 30.0 kg/m2). Results: The risk of malnutrition (combining medium and high risk) was found in 5.6% of the men and 8.6% of the women. Significant mental health symptoms were reported by 3.9% of the men and 9.1% of the women. In a model adjusted for age, marital status, smoking and education, significant mental health symptoms (SCL-10 score ≥ 1.85) were positively associated with the risk of malnutrition (odds ratio 3.9 [95% CI 1.7-8.6] in men and 2.5 [95% CI 1.3-4.9] in women), the association was positive also for subthreshold mental health symptoms. For individuals with BMI &lt; 20.0 the adjusted odds ratio for significant mental health symptoms was 2.0 [95% CI 1.0-4.0]. Conclusions: Impaired mental health was strongly associated with the risk of malnutrition in community living elderly men and women and this association was also significant for subthreshold mental health symptoms.

678,The elderly in the psychiatric emergency service (PES); a descriptive study,"Background: The impact of an aging population on the psychiatric emergency service (PES) has not been fully ascertained. Cognitive dysfunctions aside, many DSM-IV disorders may have a lower prevalence in the elderly, who appear to be underrepresented in the PES. We therefore attempted to more precisely assess their patterns of PES use and their clinical and demographic characteristics. Methods: Close to 30,000 visits to a general hospital PES (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) were acquired between 1990 and 2004 and pooled with over 17,000 visits acquired using the same methodology at three other services in Quebec between 2002 and 2004. Results: The median age of PES patients increased over time. However, the proportion of yearly visits attributable to the elderly (compared to those under 65) showed no consistent increase during the observation period. The pattern of return visits (two to three, four to ten, eleven or more) did not differ from that of patients under 65, although the latter made a greater number of total return visits per patient. The elderly were more often women (62%), widowed (28%), came to the PES accompanied (42%) and reported « illness » as an important stressor (29%). About 39% were referred for depression or anxiety. They were less violent (10%) upon their arrival. Affective disorders predominated in the diagnostic profile, they were less co-morbid and more likely admitted than patients under 65. Conclusion: Although no proportional increase in PES use over time was found the elderly do possess distinct characteristics potentially useful in PES resource planning so as to better serve this increasingly important segment of the general population.

679,Profiles of family-focused adverse experiences through childhood and early adolescence: The ROOTS project a community investigation of adolescent mental health,"Background: Adverse family experiences in early life are associated with subsequent psychopathology. This study adds to the growing body of work exploring the nature and associations between adverse experiences over the childhood years. Methods: Primary carers of 1143 randomly recruited 14-year olds in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, UK were interviewed using the Cambridge Early Experiences Interview (CAMEEI) to assess family-focused adversities. Adversities were recorded retrospectively in three time periods (early and later childhood and early adolescence). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) grouped individuals into adversity classes for each time period and longitudinally. Adolescents were interviewed to generate lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses using the K-SADS-PL. The associations between adversity class and diagnoses were explored. Results: LCA generated a 4-class model for each time period and longitudinally. In early childhood 69% were allocated to a low adversity class; a moderate adversity class (19%) showed elevated rates of family loss, mild or moderate family discord, financial difficulties, maternal psychiatric illness and higher risk for paternal atypical parenting; a severe class (6%) experienced higher rates on all indicators and almost exclusively accounted for incidents of child abuse; a fourth class, characterised by atypical parenting from both parents, accounted for the remaining 7%. Class membership was fairly stable (~ 55%) over time with escape from any adversity by 14 years being uncommon. Compared to those in the low class, the odds ratio for reported psychopathology in adolescents in the severe class ranged from 8 for disruptive behaviour disorders through to 4.8 for depressions and 2.0 for anxiety disorders. Only in the low adversity class did significantly more females than males report psychopathology. Conclusions: Family adversities in the early years occur as multiple rather than single experiences. Although some children escape adversity, for many this negative family environment persists over the first 15 years of life. Different profiles of family risk may be associated with specific mental disorders in young people. Sex differences in psychopathologies may be most pronounced in those exposed to low levels of family adversities.

680,"CHAMP: Cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety in medical patients, a randomised controlled trial","Background: Abnormal health anxiety, also called hypochondriasis, has been successfully treated by cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in patients recruited from primary care, but only one pilot trial has been carried out among those attending secondary medical clinics where health anxiety is likely to be more common and have a greater impact on services. The CHAMP study extends this work to examine both the clinical and cost effectiveness of CBT in this population. Method/Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms and equal randomization of 466 eligible patients (assuming a 20% drop-out) to an active treatment group of 5-10 sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy and to a control group. The aim at baseline, after completion of all assessments but before randomization, was to give a standard simple explanation of the nature of health anxiety for all participants. Subsequently the control group was to receive whatever care might usually be available in the clinics, which is normally a combination of clinical assessment, appropriate tests and reassurance. Those allocated to the active treatment group were planned to receive between 5 and 10 sessions of an adapted form of cognitive behaviour therapy based on the Salkovskis/Warwick model, in which a set of treatment strategies are chosen aimed at helping patients understand the factors that drive and maintain health anxiety. The therapy was planned to be given by graduate research workers, nurses or other health professionals trained for this intervention whom would also have their competence assessed independently during the course of treatment. The primary outcome is reduction in health anxiety symptoms after one year and the main secondary outcome is the cost of care after two years. Discussion: This represents the first trial of adapted cognitive behaviour therapy in health anxiety that is large enough to test not only the clinical benefits of treatment but also whether the cost of treatment is offset by savings from reduced use of other health services in comparison to the control group.

681,A cross-sectional study of patients with and without substance use disorders in Community Mental Health Centres,"Background: Epidemiological studies have consistently established high comorbidity between psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders (SUD). This comorbidity is even more prominent when psychiatric populations are studied. Previous studies have focused on inpatient populations dominated by psychotic disorders, whereas this paper presents findings on patients in Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) where affective and anxiety disorders are most prominent. The purpose of this study is to compare patients in CMHCs with and without SUD in regard to differences in socio-demographic characteristics, level of morbidity, prevalence of different diagnostic categories, health services provided and the level of improvement in psychiatric symptoms. Methods: As part of the evaluation of the National Plan for Mental Health, all patients seen in eight CMHCs during a 4-week period in 2007 were studied (n=2154). The CMHCs were located in rural and urban areas of Norway. The patients were diagnosed according to the ICD-10 diagnoses and assessed with the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales, the Alcohol Use Scale and the Drug Use Scale. Results: Patients with SUD in CMHCs are more frequently male, single and living alone, have more severe morbidity, less anxiety and mood disorders, less outpatient treatment and less improvement in regard to recovery from psychological symptoms compared to patients with no SUD. Conclusion: CMHCs need to implement systematic screening and diagnostic procedures in order to detect the special needs of these patients and improve their treatment.

682,Benzodiazepine use and misuse among patients in a methadone program,"Background: Benzodiazepines (BZD) misuse is a serious public health problem, especially among opiate-dependent patients with anxiety enrolled in methadone program because it puts patients at higher risk of life-threatening multiple drug overdoses. Both elevated anxiety and BZD misuse increase the risk for ex-addicts to relapse. However, there is no recent study to assess how serious the problem is and what factors are associated with BZD misuse. This study estimates the prevalence of BZD misuse in a methadone program, and provides information on the characteristics of BZD users compared to non-users. Methods: An anonymous survey was carried out at a methadone program in Baltimore, MD, and all patients were invited to participate through group meetings and fliers around the clinic on a voluntary basis. Of the 205 returned questionnaires, 194 were complete and entered into final data analysis. Those who completed the questionnaire were offered a $5 gift card as an appreciation. Results: 47% of the respondents had a history of BZD use, and 39.8% used BZD without a prescription. Half of the BZD users (54%) started using BZD after entering the methadone program, and 61% of previous BZD users reported increased or resumed use after entering methadone program. Compared to the non-users, BZD users were more likely to be White, have prescribed medication for mental problems, have preexistent anxiety problems before opiate use, and had anxiety problems before entering methadone program. They reported more mental health problems in the past month, and had higher scores in anxiety state, depression and perceived stress (p&lt;.05). Conclusions: Important information on epidemiology of BZD misuse among methadone-maintenance patients suggests that most methadone programs do not address co-occurring anxiety problems, and methadone treatment may trigger onset or worsening of BZD misuse. Further study is needed to explore how to curb misuse and abuse of BZD in the addiction population, and provide effective treatments targeting simultaneously addiction symptoms, anxiety disorders and BZD misuse.

683,"Onset of efficacy and tolerability following the initiation dosing of long-acting paliperidone palmitate: Post-hoc analyses of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial","Background: Paliperidone palmitate is a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic for the acute and maintenance treatment of adults with schizophrenia. The recommended initiation dosing regimen is 234 mg on Day 1 and 156 mg on Day 8 via intramuscular (deltoid) injection; followed by 39 to 234 mg once-monthly thereafter (deltoid or gluteal). These post-hoc analyses addressed two commonly encountered clinical issues regarding the initiation dosing: the time to onset of efficacy and the associated tolerability. Methods: In a 13-week double-blind trial, 652 subjects with schizophrenia were randomized to paliperidone palmitate 39, 156, or 234 mg (corresponding to 25, 100, or 150 mg equivalents of paliperidone, respectively) or placebo (NCT#00590577). Subjects randomized to paliperidone palmitate received 234 mg on Day 1, followed by their randomized fixed dose on Day 8, and monthly thereafter, with no oral antipsychotic supplementation. The onset of efficacy was defined as the first timepoint where the paliperidone palmitate group showed significant improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score compared to placebo (Analysis of Covariance [ANCOVA] models and Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] methodology without adjusting for multiplicity) using data from the Days 4, 8, 22, and 36 assessments. Adverse event (AE) rates and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) versus placebo were determined. Results: Paliperidone palmitate 234 mg on Day 1 was associated with greater improvement than placebo on Least Squares (LS) mean PANSS total score at Day 8 (p = 0.037). After the Day 8 injection of 156 mg, there was continued PANSS improvement at Day 22 (p ≤ 0.007 vs. placebo) and Day 36 (p &lt; 0.001). Taken together with results in the 39 mg and 234 mg Day 8 arms, these findings suggest a trend towards a dose-dependent response. During Days 1 to 7, AEs reported in ≥2% of paliperidone palmitate subjects (234 mg) and a greater proportion of paliperidone palmitate than placebo subjects were: agitation (3.2% vs. 1.3%; RR 2.52 [95% CI 0.583, 10.904]), headache (4.0% vs. 3.8%; RR 1.06 [95% CI 0.433, 2.619]), and injection site pain (6.7% vs. 3.8%; RR 1.79 [95% CI 0.764, 4.208]). Days 8 to 36 AEs meeting the same criteria in the 156 mg Day 8 arm were: anxiety (3.1% vs. 2.5%; RR 1.24 [95% CI 0.340, 4.542]), psychotic disorder (2.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 1.99 [95% CI 0.369, 10.699]), dizziness (2.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 1.99 [95% CI 0.369, 10.699]), and injection site pain (2.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 1.99 [95% CI 0.369, 10.699]). Corresponding Days 8 to 36 AEs in the 39 mg Day 8 group were: agitation (4.5% vs. 4.4%; RR 1.03 [95% CI 0.371, 2.874]), anxiety (3.9% vs. 2.5%; RR 1.55 [95% CI 0.446, 5.381]), and psychotic disorder (2.6% vs. 1.3%; RR 2.07 [95% CI 0.384, 11.110]) while in the 234 mg Day 8 group it was anxiety (3.1% vs. 2.5%, RR 1.25 [95% CI 0.342, 4.570]). Conclusions: Significantly greater symptom improvement was observed by Day 8 with paliperidone palmitate (234 mg on Day 1) compared to placebo; this effect was maintained after the 156 mg Day 8 injection, with a trend towards a dose-dependent response. No unexpected tolerability findings were noted in the first week or month after the initiation dosing.

684,Alertness and visuospatial attention in clinical depression,"Background: Cognitive deficits are a substantial burden in clinical depression. The present study considered dysfunction in the right-hemispheric attention network in depression, examining alertness and visuospatial attention. Methods: Three computerized visuospatial attention tests and an alertness test were administered to 16 depressive patients and 16 matched healthy controls. Results: Although no significant group effect was observed, alertness predicted reduced visuospatial performance in the left hemifield. Furthermore, sad mood showed a trend towards predicting left visual field omissions. Conclusions: Decreased alertness may lead to lower left hemifield visuospatial attention; this mechanism may be responsible for a spatial bias to the right side in depression, even though treatment of depression and anxiety may reduce this cognitive deficit.

685,Perceived discrimination is associated with severity of positive and depression/anxiety symptoms in immigrants with psychosis: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Immigration status is a significant risk factor for psychotic disorders, and a number of studies have reported more severe positive and affective symptoms among immigrant and ethnic minority groups. We investigated if perceived discrimination was associated with the severity of these symptoms among immigrants in Norway with psychotic disorders. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of 90 immigrant patients (66% first-generation, 68% from Asia/Africa) in treatment for psychotic disorders were assessed for DSM-IV diagnoses with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-I, sections A-E) and for present symptom severity by The Structured Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (SCI-PANSS). Perceived discrimination was assessed by a self-report questionnaire developed for the Immigrant Youth in Cultural Transition Study. Results: Perceived discrimination correlated with positive psychotic (r = 0.264, p &lt; 0.05) and depression/anxiety symptoms (r = 0.282, p &lt; 0.01), but not negative, cognitive, or excitement symptoms. Perceived discrimination also functioned as a partial mediator for symptom severity in African immigrants. Multiple linear regression analyses controlling for possible confounders revealed that perceived discrimination explained approximately 10% of the variance in positive and depression/anxiety symptoms in the statistical model. Conclusions: Among immigrants with psychotic disorders, visible minority status was associated with perceived discrimination and with more severe positive and depression/anxiety symptoms. These results suggest that context-specific stressful environmental factors influence specific symptom patterns and severity. This has important implications for preventive strategies and treatment of this vulnerable patient group.

686,Profile of subjective quality of life and its correlates in a nation-wide sample of high school students in an Arab setting using the WHOQOL-Bref,"Background: The upsurge of interest in the quality of life (QOL) of children is in line with the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stressed the child's right to adequate circumstances for physical, mental, and social development. The study's objectives were to: (i) highlight how satisfied Kuwaiti high school students were with life circumstances as in the WHOQOL-Bref; (ii) assess the prevalence of at risk status for impaired QOL and establish the QOL domain normative values; and (iii) examine the relationship of QOL with personal, parental, and socio-environmental factors. Method: A nation-wide sample of students in senior classes in government high schools (N = 4467, 48.6% boys; aged 14-23 years) completed questionnaires that included the WHOQOL-Bref. Results: Using Cummins' norm of 70% - 80%, we found that, as a group, they barely achieved the well-being threshold score for physical health (70%), social relations (72.8%), environment (70.8%) and general facet (70.2%), but not for psychological health (61.9%). These scores were lower than those reported from other countries. Using the recommended cut-off of &lt;1 SD of population mean, the prevalence of at risk status for impaired QOL was 12.9% - 18.8% (population age-adjusted: 15.9% - 21.1%). In all domains, boys had significantly higher QOL than girls, mediated by anxiety/depression; while the younger ones had significantly higher QOL ( p &lt; 0.001), mediated by difficulty with studies and social relations. Although poorer QOL was significantly associated with parental divorce and father's low socio-economic status, the most important predictors of poorer QOL were perception of poor emotional relationship between the parents, poor self-esteem and difficulty with studies. Conclusion: Poorer QOL seemed to reflect a circumstance of social disadvantage and poor psychosocial well-being in which girls fared worse than boys. The findings indicate that programs that address parental harmony and school programs that promote study-friendly atmospheres could help to improve psychosocial well-being. The application of QOL as a school population health measure may facilitate risk assessment and the tracking of health status.

687,Functional impairment related to painful physical symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorder with or without comorbid major depressive disorder: Post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most frequent anxiety disorder in primary care patients. It is known that painful physical symptoms (PPS) are associated with GAD, regardless the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). However the specific role of such symptoms in patients' functional impairment is not well understood. The objective of the present study is to assess functional impairment related to the presence of PPS in patients with GAD. Methods: This is a post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study. Functioning, in the presence (overall pain score &gt;30; Visual Analog Scale) or absence of PPS, was assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) in three groups of patients; 1) GAD and comorbid MDD (GAD+MDD+), 2) GAD without comorbid MDD (GAD+MDD-), 3) controls (GAD-MDD-). ANCOVA models were used. Results: Of those patients with GAD+MDD+ (n = 559), 436 (78.0%) had PPS, compared with GAD+MDD-(249 of 422, 59%) and controls (95 of 336, 28.3%). Functioning worsened in both GAD groups in presence of PPS (SDS least squares mean total score: 16.1 vs. 9.8, p &lt; 0.0001, GAD+MDD+; 14.3 vs. 8.2, p &lt; 0.0001, GAD+MDD-). The presence of PPS was significantly associated with less productivity. Conclusions: Functional impairment related to the presence of PPS was relevant. Clinical implications should be considered.

688,Relation between therapeutic response and side effects induced by methylphenidate as observed by parents and teachers of children with ADHD,"Background: The desired (therapeutic) and undesired (side) effects of methylphenidate might have underlying correlations. The aim of this study was to explore the strength and the possible sources of these correlations. Methods: One hundred and fifty-seven children with ADHD (6-12 years) were administered placebo and methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg in a divided b.i.d. dose), each for a one-week period, in a double-blind, crossover trial. Therapeutic response was assessed using the Conners' Global Index for parents (CGI-Parents) and teachers (CGI-Teachers), while side effects were assessed using the Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale (SERS). Results: The side effect profile as assessed by the SERS was similar to that of previous studies with insomnia, decreased appetite, and headaches showing significant treatment effects (p &lt; 0.005). These ""somatic/physical"" side effects did not correlate with CGI-Parents or CGI-Teachers. However, the side effects of ""irritability"", ""proneness to crying"", and ""anxiousness"" showed significant relationships with CGI-Parents. These ""mood/anxiety"" side effects showed no significant correlations with the CGI-Teachers. Conclusion: The greater ""mood/anxiety"" side effects on methylphenidate and placebo, the less the parents observe improvement of their children while treated with methylphenidate. This suggests that the correlations between ""mood/anxiety"" side effects and poor response to treatment may be driven by observer effects rather than biological commonalities between therapeutic and side effects of methylphenidate.

689,Typology of adults diagnosed with mental disorders based on socio-demographics and clinical and service use characteristics,"Background: Mental disorder is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Its cost and negative impact on productivity are substantial. Consequently, improving mental health-care system efficiency—especially service utilisation—is a priority. Few studies have explored the use of services by specific subgroups of persons with mental disorder; a better understanding of these individuals is key to improving service planning. This study develops a typology of individuals, diagnosed with mental disorder in a 12-month period, based on their individual characteristics and use of services within a Canadian urban catchment area of 258,000 persons served by a psychiatric hospital. Methods: From among the 2,443 people who took part in the survey, 406 (17%) experienced at least one episode of mental disorder (as per the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)) in the 12 months pre-interview. These individuals were selected for cluster analysis. Results: Analysis yielded four user clusters: people who experienced mainly anxiety disorder; depressive disorder; alcohol and/or drug disorder; and multiple mental and dependence disorder. Two clusters were more closely associated with females and anxiety or depressive disorders. In the two other clusters, males were over-represented compared with the sample as a whole, namely, substance abuses with or without concomitant mental disorder. Clusters with the greatest number of mental disorders per subject used a greater number of mental health-care services. Conversely, clusters associated exclusively with dependence disorders used few services. Conclusion: The study found considerable heterogeneity among socio-demographic characteristics, number of disorders, and number of health-care services used by individuals with mental or dependence disorders. Cluster analysis revealed important differences in service use with regard to gender and age. It reinforces the relevance of developing targeted programs for subgroups of individuals with mental and/or dependence disorders. Strategies aimed at changing low service users’ attitude (youths and males) or instituting specialised programs for that particular clientele should be promoted. Finally, as concomitant disorders are frequent among individuals with mental disorder, psychological services and/or addiction programs must be prioritised as components of integrated services when planning treatment.

This study aims to examine the effectiveness of brief multifamily psychoeducation designed to alleviate their psychosocial burden. Methods: Thirty-two relatives of patients with major depressive disorder participated in an open study testing the effectiveness of brief multifamily psychoeducation. The intervention consisted of four sessions over the course of 6 weeks. Outcome measures focused on emotional distress, care burden and Expressed Emotion (EE). Results: The emotional distress, care burden and EE of the family all showed statistically significant improvements from baseline to after the family intervention. The proportion of relatives scoring 9 or more on K6, which indicates possible depressive or anxiety disorder, decreased from sixteen relatives (50.0%) at baseline, to only 3 relatives (9.3%) after the intervention. Conclusions: This study suggests that brief multifamily psychoeducation is a useful intervention to reduce the psychosocial burden of the relatives of patients with depressive disorder. Further evaluation of family psychoeducation for relatives of patients with depressive disorder is warranted.

691,The influence of psychiatric screening in healthy populations selection: A new study and meta-analysis of functional 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 polymorphisms and anxiety-related personality traits,"Background: A genetic liability for anxiety-related personality traits in healthy subjects has been associated with the functional serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), although the data are somewhat conflicting. Moreover, only one study has investigated the functional significance of the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 haplotypes in relation to anxiety traits in healthy subjects. We tested whether the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 haplotypes are linked to Harm Avoidance (HA) using an association study (STUDY I) and a metaanalytic approach (STUDY II). Methods: STUDY I: A total of 287 unrelated Italian volunteers were screened for DSM-IV Axis I disorders and genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 (A/G) polymorphisms. Different functional haplotype combinations were also analyzed. STUDY II: A total of 44 studies were chosen for a meta-analysis of the putative association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety-related personality traits. Results: STUDY I: In the whole sample of 287 volunteers, we found that the SS genotype and S’S’ haplotypes were associated with higher scores on HA. However, because the screening assessed by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) showed the presence of 55 volunteers affected by depression or anxiety disorders, we analyzed the two groups (""disordered” and “healthy”) separately. The data obtained did indeed confirm that in the “healthy” group, the significant effects of the SS genotype and S’S’ haplotypes were lost, but they remained in the “disordered” group. STUDY II: The results of the 5-HTTLPR meta-analysis with anxiety-related traits in the whole sample confirmed the association of the SS genotype with higher anxiety-related traits scores in Caucasoids; however, when we analyzed only those studies that used structured psychiatric screening, no association was found. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the relevance to perform analyses on personality traits only in DSM-IV axis I disorder-free subjects. Furthermore, we did not find an association between functional serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and anxiety traits in healthy subjects screened through a structured psychiatric interview.

692,Treatment of alcohol dependence with low-dose topiramate: An open-label controlled study,"Background: GABAergic anticonvulsants have been recommended for the treatment of alcohol dependence and the prevention of relapse. Several studies have demonstrated topiramate’s efficacy in improving drinking behaviour and maintaining abstinence. The objective of the present open-label controlled study was to assess efficacy and tolerability of low-dose topiramate as adjunctive treatment in alcohol dependence during the immediate postdetoxification period and during a 16-week follow-up period after alcohol withdrawal. Methods: Following a 7-10 day inpatient alcohol detoxification protocol, 90 patients were assigned to receive either topiramate (up to 75 mg per day) in addition to psychotherapeutic treatment (n = 30) or psychotherapy alone (n = 60). Symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as craving, were monitored for 4-6 weeks immediately following detoxification on an inpatient basis. Thereafter, both groups were followed as outpatients at a weekly basis for another 4 months in order to monitor their course and abstinence from alcohol. Results: A marked improvement in depressive (p &lt; 0.01), anxiety (p &lt; 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive drinking symptoms (p &lt; 0.01) was observed over the consecutive assessments in both study groups. However, individuals on topiramate fared better than controls (p &lt; 0.01) during inpatient treatment. Moreover, during the 4-month follow up period, relapse rate was lower among patients who received topiramate (66.7%) compared to those who received no adjunctive treatment (85.5%), (p = 0.043). Time to relapse in the topiramate augmentation group was significantly longer compared to the control group (log rank test, p = 0.008). Thus, median duration of abstinence was 4 weeks for the non-medicated group whereas it reached 10 weeks for the topiramate group. No serious side effects of topiramate were recorded throughout the study. Conclusions: Low-dose topiramate as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic treatment is well tolerated and effective in reducing alcohol craving, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety, present during the early phase of alcohol withdrawal. Furthermore, topiramate considerably helps to abstain from drinking during the first 16-week postdetoxification period.

693,"Depression, anxiety, and history of substance abuse among Norwegian inmates in preventive detention: Reasons to worry?","Background: Inmates on preventive detention are a small and select group sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment. Mood disorders and substance abuse are risk factors for inmate violence and recidivism, so the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse was examined in this cohort using psychometric tests. Methods: Completion of self-report questionnaires was followed by face-to-face clinical interviews with 26 of the 56 male inmates on preventive detention in Norway’s Ila Prison. Substance abuse histories and information about the type of psychiatric treatment received were compiled. To assess anxiety and depression, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Clinical Anxiety Scale (CAS), and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were used. Results: Scores on the MADRS revealed that 46.1% of inmates had symptoms of mild depression. The HADS depression subscale showed that 19.2% scored above the cut-off for depression ( κ = 0.57). The CAS anxiety score was above the cut-off for 30.7% of the subjects, while 34.6% also scored above the cut-off on the HADS anxiety subscale ( κ = 0.61). Almost 70% of all these inmates, and more than 80% of those convicted of sex crimes, had a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse. Conclusions: Mild anxiety and depression was found frequently among inmates on preventive detention. Likewise, the majority of the inmates had a history of alcohol and drug abuse. Mood disorders and substance abuse may enhance recidivism, so rehabilitation programs should be tailored to address these problems.

694,"A telephone- and text-message based telemedical care concept for patients with mental health disorders - study protocol for a randomized, controlled study design","Background: As in other countries worldwide, the prevalence of mental disorders in Germany is high. Although numerically a dense network of in- and outpatient psychiatric health services exists, the availability in rural and remote regions is insufficient. In rural regions, telemedical concepts can be a chance to unburden and complement the existing healthcare system. Telemedical concepts consisting of video or telephone consulting show first positive results, but there are only a few studies with a randomized controlled design. To improve the treatment of patients with mental disorders in rural regions, we developed a telemedical care concept based on telephone contacts and text-messages. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the telemedical interventions on psychopathological outcomes, e.g. anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatisation. Secondary objective of the study is the analysis of intervention effects on the frequency of medical contacts with healthcare services. Furthermore, the frequency of patients’ crises and the frequency and kind of interventions, initiated by the project nurses will be evaluated. We will also evaluate the acceptance of the telemedical care concept by the patients. Methods/Design: In this paper we describe a three-armed, randomized, controlled study. All participants are recruited from psychiatric day hospitals. The inclusion criteria are a specialist-diagnosed depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder or a somatoform disorder and eligibility to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are ongoing outpatient psychotherapy, planned interval treatment at the day clinic and expected recurrent suicidality and self-injuring behaviour. The interventions consist of regular patient-individual telephone consultations or telephone consultations with complementing text-messages on the patients’ mobile phone. The interventions will be conducted during a time period of 6 months.

695,"Association of depression with treatment outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study from Karachi, Pakistan","Background: To assess the associations of depression with glycemic control and compliance to self-care activities in adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary-care hospital in Karachi (Aga Khan University Hospital). Equal numbers of depressed and non-depressed patients were consecutively recruited from the diabetic clinic. Information on demographic and clinical characteristics was collected in face-to-face interviews and from medical records. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure depression. Associations of depressed status (HADS = 8) with poor glycemic control (Hemoglobin A1c level = 7%) and compliance to self-care activities were assessed by logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 286 patients were included in this study with a male-female ratio of 1.2:1. Mean age was 52 years and in 64.7% of them, the duration of diabetes was more than 3 years. Depressed patients were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.88; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.07-3.31), had a family history of diabetes (OR = 2.64; 95%CI = 1.26-5.55), and poor glycemic control (OR = 5.57; 95%CI = 2.88-10.76) compared with non-depressed patients. Depression was also associated with low compliance to self-care activities such as taking dose as advised (OR = 0.32; 95%CI = 0.14-0.73), dietary restrictions (OR = 0.45; 95%CI = 0.26-0.79) and foot care (OR = 0.38; 95%CI = 0.18-0.83).

696,Palperidone ER and oral risperidone in patients with schizophrenia: A comparitive database analysis,"Background: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone extended-release (ER) with risperidone immediate-release using propensity score methodology. Methods: Six double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, short-term clinical trials for acute schizophrenia with availability of individual patient-level data were identified (3 per compound). Propensity score pairwise matching was used to balance observed covariates between the paliperidone ER and risperidone patient populations. Scores were generated using logistic regression models, with age, body mass index, race, sex, baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and baseline Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI-S) score as factors. The dosage range of paliperidone ER (6-12 mg/day) was compared with 2 risperidone dosage ranges: 2-4 and 4-6 mg/day. The primary efficacy measure was change in PANSS total score at week 6 end point. Tolerability end points included adverse event (AE) reports and weight. AEs with rates ≥5% and with a ≥2% difference between paliperidone ER and risperidone were identified. Results: Completion rates for placebo-treated subjects in paliperidone ER trials (n = 95) and risperidone trials (n = 122) groups were 36.8% and 51.6%, respectively; end point changes on PANSS total scores were similar (p = 0.768). Completion rates for subjects receiving paliperidone ER 6-12 mg/day (n = 179), risperidone 2-4 mg/day (n = 113) or risperidone 4-6 mg/day (n = 129) were 64.8%, 54.0% and 66.7%, respectively (placebo-adjusted rates: paliperidone ER vs risperidone 2-4 mg/day, p = 0.005; paliperidone ER vs risperidone 4-6 mg/day, p = 0.159). PANSS total score improvement with paliperidone ER was greater than with risperidone 2-4 mg/day (difference in mean change score, -6.7; p &lt; 0.05) and similar to risperidone 4-6 mg/day (0.2; p = 0.927). Placebo-adjusted AEs more common with paliperidone ER were insomnia, sinus tachycardia and tachycardia; more common with risperidone were somnolence, restlessness, nausea, anxiety, salivary hypersecretion, akathisia, dizziness and nasal congestion. Weight changes with paliperidone ER and risperidone were similar (paliperidone ER vs risperidone 2-4 mg/day, p = 0.489; paliperidone ER vs risperidone 4-6 mg/day, p = 0.236). Conclusions: This indirect database analysis suggested that paliperidone ER 6-12 mg/day may be more efficacious than risperidone 2-4 mg/day and as efficacious as risperidone 4-6 mg/day. The AE-adjusted incidence rates suggest differences between treatments that may be relevant for individual patients. Additional randomized, direct, head-to- head clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

697,Effectiveness of an intercultural module added to the treatment guidelines for Moroccan and Turkish patients with depressive and anxiety disorders,"Background: Since the sixties of the last century, many people from Morocco and Turkey have migrated into the Netherlands. In the last decade, Moroccan and Turkish patients have found their way to organizations for mental health care. However, they often drop out of treatment. Problems in the communication with therapists and different expectations regarding treatment seem to be causal factors for the early drop-out of therapy. In the Netherlands as in other countries courses have been developed for training cultural competence of therapists. Yet, up to now, the effectiveness of increased cultural competence of therapists in reducing drop-out of treatment has not been studied. Methods/Design: A randomized clinical trial was started in January 2010. Moroccan and Turkish adult patients who are referred to our outpatient clinics for mood and anxiety disorders are randomly assigned to mental health workers who are trained in a cultural module and to those who are not. The therapists have been trained in the Cultural Formulation and in techniques bridging the (cultural) gap between them and their Moroccan and Turkish patients. The target number of participants is 150 patients, 75 for each group. Drop-out of treatment is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures are no-show and patients’ perspective of care. Discussion: The study will give an answer to the question whether increasing cultural competence of therapists reduces drop-out of treatment in Moroccan and Turkish outpatients with depressive and anxiety disorders.

698,Multifamily group psychoeducation and cognitive remediation for first-episode psychosis: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Multifamily group psychoeducation (MFG) has been shown to reduce relapse rates among individuals with first-episode psychosis. However, given the cognitive demands associated with participating in this intervention (e.g., learning and applying a structured problem-solving activity), the cognitive deficits that accompany psychotic disorders may limit the ability of certain individuals to benefit from this intervention. Thus, the goal of this study is to examine whether individuals with first-episode psychosis who participate simultaneously in MFG and cognitive remediation—an intervention shown to improve cognitive functioning among individuals with psychotic disorders—will be less likely to experience a relapse than individuals who participate in MFG alone. Methods/Design: Forty individuals with first-episode psychosis and their caregiving relative will be recruited to participate in this study. Individuals with first-episode psychosis will be randomized to one of two conditions: (i) MFG with concurrent participation in cognitive remediation or (ii) MFG alone. The primary outcome for this study is relapse of psychotic symptoms. We will also examine secondary outcomes among both individuals with first-episode psychosis (i.e., social and vocational functioning, health-related quality of life, service utilization, independent living status, and cognitive functioning) and their caregiving relatives (i.e., caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression) Discussion: Cognitive remediation offers the possibility of ameliorating a specific deficit (i.e., deficits in cognitive functioning) that often accompanies psychotic symptoms and may restrict the magnitude of the clinical benefits derived from MFG.

833,A test for the implementation–maintenance model of reappraisal,"Reappraisal has been defined as a conscious, deliberate change in the way an emotional stimulus is interpreted, initiated in order to change its emotion-eliciting character (Gross, 2002). Reappraisal can be used to down-regulate negative emotions, including anxiety (reviewed in Kalisch, 2009). There is currently a strong interest in identifying the cognitive processes and neural substrates that mediate reappraisal. We have recently proposed a model (termed implementation–maintenance model or IMMO) that conceptualizes reappraisal as a temporally extended, dynamic, and multi-componential process (Kalisch, 2009). A key tenet of IMMO is that reappraisal episodes are marked by an early phase of implementation that may comprise strategy selection and retrieval of reappraisal material into working memory, and a later phase of maintenance that may comprise working memory and performance monitoring processes. These should be supported by dissociable neural networks. We here show, using a detachment-from-threat paradigm and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging, that reappraisal-related brain activity shifts from left posterior to right anterior parts of the lateral frontal cortex during the course of a reappraisal episode. Our data provide first empirical evidence for the existence of two separable reappraisal stages. Implications for further model development are discussed.

Referee efficacy is defined as the extent to which referees believe they have the capacity to perform successfully in their job. Referee efficacy beliefs are hypothesized to be influenced by mastery experiences, referee knowledge/education, support from significant others, physical/mental preparedness, environmental comfort, and perceived anxiety. In turn, referee efficacy beliefs are hypothesized to influence referee performance, referee stress, athlete rule violations, athlete satisfaction, and co-referee satisfaction.

835,Anger and the speed of full-body approach and avoidance reactions,"The notion that anger is linked to approach motivation received support from behavioral studies, which measured various motor responses to angering stimuli. However, none of these studies examined full-body motions which characterize many if not most everyday instances of anger. The authors incorporate a novel behavioral motor task that tests motivational direction by measuring the reaction times (RTs) of stepping forward and backward in response to the words “toward” and “away.” The results show that, relative to anxiety and control conditions, anger induction resulted in a steeper approach–avoidance RT gradient which was shifted in favor of approach.

546,Health anxiety and attentional bias: The time course of vigilance and avoidance in light of pictorial illness information,"Cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety stress the importance of selective attention not only towards internal but also towards external health threat related stimuli. Yet, little is known about the time course of this attentional bias. The current study investigates threat related attentional bias in participants with varying degrees of health anxiety. Attentional bias was assessed using a visual dot-probe task with health-threat and neutral pictures at two exposure durations, 175 ms and 500 ms. A baseline condition was added to the dot-probe task to dissociate indices of vigilance towards threat and difficulties to disengage from threat. Substantial positive correlations of health anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and absorption with difficulties to disengage from threat were detected at 500 ms exposure time. At an early stage (i.e., at 175 ms exposure time), we found significant positive correlations of health anxiety and absorption with orientation towards threat. Results suggest a vigilance avoidance pattern of selective attention associated with pictorial illness related stimuli in health anxiety.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety symptoms and older adults’ ability to regulate emotional experiences. A total of 167 community dwelling older adults completed self-report measures of affect and were asked to report how often they use specific emotion regulation strategies. Consistent with previous theories older adults experiencing increasing levels of anxiety reported greater difficulties in regulating emotional responses. Present results provide support for previous findings demonstrating that experiencing anxiety symptoms affects the ability to regulate emotional experiences. Current findings are likely to be informative in terms of understanding emotion dysregulation in older adults at risk of experiencing clinical symptoms of anxiety.

548,Examination of the convergent validity of looming vulnerability in the anxiety disorders,"The looming vulnerability model proposes that individuals with anxiety generate dynamic mental scenarios of threats as intensifying and approaching faster than they can cope or respond. In addition to the looming cognitive style posing a general cognitive vulnerability for anxiety, the looming vulnerability model posits that different anxiety disorders can be distinguished based on the specific content of their looming vulnerability themes. The current study examined whether different anxiety disorders have distinct looming vulnerability content along the lines of disorder-specific themes. A treatment-seeking sample of individuals with DSM-IV anxiety disorders ( N = 172) completed measures of looming vulnerability prior to treatment initiation. Consistent with the looming vulnerability model, the results indicated that individuals with social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder reported significantly greater disorder-specific looming content compared to non-disorder specific looming content. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder reported the same level of looming social threat as those with social phobia. The results suggest that different anxiety disorders can be distinguished by the specific content of looming vulnerability themes and provide empirical support for the convergent validity of the Looming Vulnerability Scale.

549,"Hoarding behaviors among nonclinical elderly adults: Correlations with hoarding cognitions, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and measures of general psychopathology","This study examines correlates of hoarding behaviors among nonclinical elderly adults, focusing upon hoarding cognitions, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and measures of general psychopathology. Two hundred and sixty-nine adults aged 56–93 years ( M = 72.49 years) completed the Saving Inventory-Revised, Savings Cognitions Inventory-Revised, Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory. Our geriatric sample evidenced significantly greater severity of hoarding behaviors than did a younger community sample (24–72 years; M = 44.4 years; Frost, Steketee, &amp; Grishman, 2004). Within our sample, moderate correlations were found between hoarding behaviors and hoarding cognitions; however, controlling for obsessive–compulsive and depressive symptoms resulted in reduced-magnitude associations. As well, relationships between obsessive–compulsive symptoms and both hoarding behaviors and hoarding cognitions were generally strong, with most relationships diminishing after controlling for depressive symptoms. Associations between hoarding symptoms and symptoms of social anxiety, general worry, and depression were generally moderate. A significant regression model showed depressive symptoms explaining the most unique variance in hoarding behaviors. Findings confirm a relatively greater severity of hoarding behaviors in older adults (as compared to younger adults) and suggest that related psychopathology plays a critical role in hoarding expression among older adults. As well, the current study contributes to the ongoing investigation of the diagnostic categorization of compulsive hoarding.

550,Combined medication and cognitive therapy for generalized anxiety disorder,"The current study assessed efficacy of combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and venlafaxine XR compared to venlafaxine XR alone in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) within settings where medication is typically offered as the treatment for this disorder. Patients with DSM-IV—diagnosed GAD who were recently enrolled in a long-term venlafaxine XR study were randomly offered ( n = 77), or not offered ( n = 40), the option of adding 12 sessions of CBT. Of those offered CBT, 33% ( n = 26) accepted and attended at least one treatment session. There were no differences between the combined treatment group and the medication only group on primary or secondary efficacy measures in any of the sample comparisons. Many patients who present in medical/psychopharmacology settings seeking treatment for GAD decline the opportunity to receive adjunctive treatment. Of those that receive CBT, there appears to be no additional benefit of combined treatment compared to venlafaxine XR alone.

Prospectively collected data from 2210 mother/offspring pairs of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) birth cohort was used to test for associations between birth weight z-score and four major groupings of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Birth weight z-score was linearly and inversely associated with lifetime diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorders at 21 years, with those falling within the smallest birth weight quintile group at almost two-fold increased odds (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.10, 3.52) of being diagnosed with the disorder compared to those falling within the largest group. The association remained when subsequent analysis restricted the sample to those exposed to trauma. This is the first study in which birth weight has been found to be associated with post-traumatic stress disorders in adults.

552,A meta-analytic review on the prevention of symptoms of anxiety in children and adolescents,"Anxiety disorders are the most frequent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and have adverse effects on their psychosocial functioning. An increasing number of studies are aimed at its prevention. This meta-analysis included 65 studies on anxiety prevention. We found small but significant effects on anxiety at posttest (symptoms: g = .22, diagnosis: g = .23; SD units) and follow-up (symptoms: g = .19, diagnosis: g = .32). Intervention effects at posttest varied by type of prevention: Indicated/selective prevention programs showed lager effect sizes than universal programs. At follow-up, smaller effects were found in samples with higher percentages of girls and stronger effect size for programs focusing primarily on anxiety prevention. We conclude: Anxiety prevention programs produce effects size of practical relevance. More efforts are needed for assessing the long-term program effects on the risk for developing anxiety disorders and for improving long-term prevention effects on girls.

553,Prospective mental imagery in patients with major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders,"Prospective negative cognitions are suggested to play an important role in maintaining anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about positive prospective mental imagery. This study investigated differences in prospective mental imagery among 27 patients with anxiety disorders, 24 patients with MDD, and 32 control participants. Measures of both deliberately generated and intrusive imagery were completed. Results indicated that both patients with anxiety disorders and those with MDD provided poorer vividness ratings for deliberately generated prospective positive scenarios compared to the control group. Patients with anxiety disorders showed a greater ability to vividly generate imagery for prospective negative scenarios than both patients with MDD and control participants. Finally, both clinical groups reported greater levels of intrusive prospective imagery of personally-relevant events as compared to the control group. The current findings underline the necessity to target prospective positive mental imagery in treating MDD and anxiety disorders.

554,How does attention training work in social phobia: Disengagement from threat or re-engagement to non-threat?,"Social phobics exhibit an attentional bias for threat in probe detection paradigms. Attention training, whereby probes always replace non-threat in a display presenting both threat and non-threat, reduces attentional bias for threat and social anxiety. However, it remains unclear whether therapeutic benefits result from learning to disengage attention from threat or learning to orient attention towards non-threat. In this experiment, social phobics were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions: (1) disengagement from threat, (2) engagement towards non-threat, (3) disengagement from threat and re-engagement towards non-threat, and (4) a control condition. Effects were examined on subjective and behavioral responses to a subsequent stressor. Data revealed that training to disengage from threat reduces behavioral indices of anxiety. Engagement towards non-threat faces did not have effects in itself. These results support that the difficulty in disengaging attention from threat is a critical process in maintenance of the disorder.

555,The role of depression in perceived parenting style among patients with anxiety disorders,"Despite a long tradition of research on the relationship between parenting style and anxiety disorders, few studies have taken the effect of comorbid depression into account. This study investigated perceived parenting in 504 outpatients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia or obsessive–compulsive disorder, and in 210 psychology students. The anxiety group reported both parents as less caring and their fathers as more controlling than did the student group. However, these between-group differences disappeared when taking self-reported depressive symptoms into consideration. Also no differences in parental style were found between the three diagnostic anxiety groups, when depressive symptoms were taken into account. Self-reported depressive symptoms were more consistently associated with negatively perceived parenting style than with self-reported anxiety symptoms in both the anxiety group and the student group. Results do not support theories of parental control as a specific risk factor for anxiety disorders, but they are in accordance with prior findings showing an association between depression and perceived lack of parental care.

556,"Anxiety, social skills, friendship quality, and peer victimization: An integrated model","This cross-sectional study investigated whether anxiety and social functioning interact in their prediction of peer victimization. A structural equation model linking anxiety, social skills, and friendship quality to victimization was tested separately for children with anxiety disorders and normal comparison children to explore whether the processes involved in victimization differ for these groups. Participants were 8–14 year old children: 55 (34 boys, 21 girls) diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 85 (37 boys, 48 girls) normal comparison children. The final models for both groups yielded two independent pathways to victimization: (a) anxiety independently predicted being victimized; and (b) poor social skills predicted lower friendship quality, which in turn, placed a child at risk for victimization. These findings have important implications for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders and for school-based anti-bullying interventions, but replication with larger samples is indicated.

557,Assessing excessive reassurance seeking in the anxiety disorders,"Reassurance seeking has long been hypothesized to be a key factor in the maintenance of anxiety within contemporary cognitive-behavioral approaches to the conceptualization and treatment of anxiety disorders. However, empirical studies have lagged due to the absence of a reliable and valid measure of reassurance seeking. The present study sought to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a theoretically derived measure of reassurance seeking in treatment-seeking participants with DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) social phobia ( n = 116), generalized anxiety disorder ( n = 75), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia ( n = 50), and obsessive compulsive disorder ( n = 42). Participants ( N = 283) completed the Reassurance Seeking Scale (RSS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. An exploratory factor analysis resulted in a coherent three factor solution reflecting the need to seek excessive reassurance regarding: (1) uncertainty about decisions, (2) attachment and the security of relationships, and (3) perceived general threat and anxiety. The RSS was found to possess good internal consistency and was moderately correlated with measures of anxiety, stress, and depression. The psychometric properties of the RSS appear promising for the promotion of programmatic research on reassurance seeking and its treatment in the anxiety disorders.

558,Cognitive processing and acrophobia: Validating the heights interpretation questionnaire,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(1) of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2012-00507-016). The authors regret errors in the original paper due to the mean of the HIQ calculated incorrectly (specifically, the average item score was multiplied by 18 to create the total, instead of by 16). Additionally, the statistics reported in Table 4 are incorrect (due to an incorrect version of the predictor variable being used): Please note that the errors do not change any of the conclusions drawn in the original paper (e.g., all results that were significant in the paper remain significant with these errors corrected). The corrections are also present in this erratum.] Three studies were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of a new scale: the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). This scale was designed to measure height fear-relevant interpretation bias to help assess the relationship between biased interpretations and acrophobia symptoms. Studies 1 ( N = 553) and 2 ( N = 308) established the scale’s factor structure and convergent and discriminant validity among two large undergraduate samples. Study 3 ( N = 48) evaluated the predictive validity of the HIQ by examining how well the scale predicted subjective distress and avoidance on actual heights. Factor analysis resulted in four distinct factors, and results suggest that each of the factors, along with the full HIQ, have good reliability and validity. Additionally, the scale predicts subjective distress and avoidance on heights beyond self-reported acrophobia symptoms. Overall, the HIQ shows promise as a new tool to investigate cognitive processing biases in acrophobia.

559,School refusal and anxiety in adolescence: Non-randomized trial of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy,"The main objectives were to evaluate efficacy and acceptability of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-based school refusal in adolescence. Twenty school-refusing adolescents meeting DSM-IV anxiety disorder criteria participated in a non-randomized trial, together with parents and school staff. Outcome was assessed at post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. Treated adolescents showed significant and maintained improvements across primary outcome variables (school attendance; school-related fear; anxiety), with medium to large effect sizes. Half of the adolescents were free of any anxiety disorder at follow-up. Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy). The treatment was rated as acceptable by adolescents, parents, and school staff, which may help explain the very low attrition rate. Social anxiety disorder was the most common disorder among adolescents still meeting anxiety disorder criteria at follow-up. Treatment modifications to improve efficacy for school-refusing adolescents presenting with social anxiety disorder are suggested.

560,Testing a cognitive model of generalized anxiety disorder in the eating disorders,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common comorbid disorders found in individuals with eating disorders. Despite this, little is known of shared vulnerability factors between the two disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine the four main components of a cognitive model for GAD in the eating disorders. One hundred and sixty-two females took part. Three groups were formed comprising of 19 participants with an eating disorder and GAD, 70 with an eating disorder without GAD and 73 healthy controls. All completed self-report questionnaires that measured eating attitudes, levels of GAD, intolerance of uncertainty, positive beliefs about worry, negative problem orientation, and cognitive avoidance. Participants with an eating disorder and GAD scored the highest on all four components when compared to healthy individuals and on most components when compared to those with an eating disorder. Participants with an eating disorder without GAD scored higher on all components compared to healthy controls. Findings extend our understanding of shared vulnerability factors between the eating disorders and GAD.

561,Attention training in socially anxious children: A multiple baseline design analysis,"Current evidence has established an association between anxiety and attentional threat biases. Emerging research suggests these attentional biases may play a causal role in anxiety development. Clinical researchers have begun to develop treatments specifically designed to address these attentional processes. As such, Attention training (ATT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety in adults. The current study represents an early attempt to implement ATT to treat social anxiety disorder (SOC) in children. Two boys meeting criteria for DSM-IV SOC participated in the study, along with their parents. Both boys received 10, 10-min sessions of ATT. A multiple-baseline design was used. Following treatment, both boys evidenced reductions in social anxiety. The current study provides preliminary evidence regarding the utility of ATT for treatment of childhood SOC. Future research is needed to further examine the use of this treatment strategy with youth and to explore the mechanisms of change.

562,Pathways to change in one-session exposure with and without cognitive intervention: An exploratory study in spider phobia,"It is well established that exposure therapy is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. It is less clear, however, which mechanisms are crucial in explaining its success. In previous studies, cognitive change has been identified as a mediating variable. Several theorists have argued that the addition of cognitive interventions will, therefore, result in enhanced treatment effects. We tested this hypothesis by examining cognitive mediation of treatment in a purely behavioral versus a cognitive–behavioral exposure format. Thirty-one spider phobics were randomly assigned to either behavioral exposure or to exposure as a test for maladaptive cognitions (i.e., behavioral experiments). Both treatment formats showed large treatment effects and strong cognitive mediation of these effects. This indicates that, even when cognitions are not explicitly targeted, exposure effects are cognitively mediated. This challenges the idea that cognitions have to be explicitly challenged to elicit cognitive change in exposure treatment.

563,Rejection sensitivity mediates the relationship between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns,"The goal of this study was to examine the role of rejection sensitivity in the relationship between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns. To test our hypothesis that rejection sensitivity mediates the link between social anxiety and body dysmorphic concerns, we administered self-report questionnaires to 209 student volunteers. Consistent with our prediction, rejection sensitivity partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety symptoms and body dysmorphic concerns. The implications of the overlap between these constructs are discussed.

564,Alterations of the attentional networks in patients with anxiety disorders,"Cognitive theories of emotion try to explain how anxious people attend to the world. Despite the increase in empirical research in this field, the specific or general attentional impairments of patients with anxiety disorder is not well defined. We decided to investigate the relationship between pathological anxiety and attentional mechanisms from the broader perspective of the attentional networks. In our study, patients with anxiety disorders and control participants carried out a task to assess efficiency of three attentional networks: orienting, alerting, and executive control. The main result was that anxiety disorders are related to both reduced effectiveness of the executive control network and difficulties in disengaging attention from invalid cues, even when using emotionally neutral information. This relationship between these attentional networks and anxiety may in part explain the problems in the day-to-day functioning of these patients.

565,Anger suppression after imagined rejection among individuals with social anxiety,"Individuals experiencing high levels of social anxiety report frequent and intense anger. Yet, little is known about how they manage this emotion. Despite general tendencies towards anger suppression, subsets of individuals with social anxiety regulate anger through outward expression. In this study, we investigated rejection as an antecedent to anger, examined how and when individuals with high social anxiety suppress anger, and evaluated experiential avoidance (EA) as a moderator of the relationship between social anxiety and anger suppression. 170 undergraduate students described their responses to everyday social situations that were designed to elicit anger; several situations reflected instances of social rejection. Our results suggest that rejection was a potent source of anger for most people and that social anxiety predicted both anger and EA in response to imagined rejection. In addition, as evidence of a moderation model, individuals with low social anxiety and low EA reported the least anger suppression; no significant differences were found for individuals with high social anxiety. We discuss the implications for understanding the interface of social anxiety and anger.

566,Objective sleep patterns and severity of symptoms in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder: A pilot investigation,"Sleep disturbances are common among youth with anxiety disorders, yet objective assessments of sleep in children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have been the focus of scant research. We therefore compared a small group of non-medicated, non-depressed children with primary OCD (ages 7–11 years) to matched healthy controls using home-based actigraphy during a 7-day prospective assessment. Validated parent and child sleep measures also were collected, and associations among objective sleep variables and severity of obsessions and compulsions were examined. We found significantly fragmented sleep patterns in the OCD group compared to controls including reduced total sleep time (TST) and longer wake periods after sleep onset. Severity of compulsions showed a significant negative correlation with TST. These preliminary findings indicate the presence of sleep abnormalities in pre-pubescent OCD patients with potential implications for future examinations of early developmental processes and features of the disorder.

567,Reliability and validity of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder features,"The reliability of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) features has been shown to be moderate, based on research utilizing the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV), a semi-structured diagnostic interview. This may be a function of the criteria for the diagnosis of GAD, which have undergone much revision since its first inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . The reliability and validity of disorder feature ratings were examined in a diverse sample of patients who presented for assessment and treatment of excessive worry, generalized anxiety, or tension at an anxiety specialty clinic and who met criteria for a principal diagnosis of GAD ( N = 129). Internal consistency of the ratings of excessiveness of worry, uncontrollability of worry, and the associated symptom cluster was moderate to low and varied by disorder feature. Inter-rater reliability for all features of GAD and severity of the disorder varied between good and poor. Additional findings showed that the GAD features, as measured using the ADIS-IV module, have modest to strong convergent validity, varying by feature, and poor discriminant validity when tested against measures of social anxiety. Potential reasons for rater disagreement are discussed. Results are also considered in terms of how they may inform the evolving criteria for GAD in DSM - V .

568,Termination of washing compulsions: A problem of internal reference criteria or ‘not just right’ experience?,"Recent research suggests that obsessive–compulsive washers are more likely than individuals without washing compulsions to use conscious, internal reference criteria when deciding when to terminate compulsions (Wahl, Salkovskis, &amp; Cotter, 2008). An alternative view is that they possess tendencies towards non-cognitive, automatic ‘not just right’ experiences (NJREs) that influence compulsion duration. The current study sought to investigate the latter explanation using valid behavioral tasks. Non-clinical participants ( N = 133) completed self-report measures, immersed their hands in a dirt mixture, and afterwards were allowed to wash their hands. Additionally, a subset of participants completed an in vivo assessment of NJRE using a pile of clutter. Total number and intensity of NJREs were predictive of hand-washing duration. Additionally, affective response to the clutter was uniquely predictive of hand-washing duration when controlling for pre-wash anxiety. These results suggest that internal reference criteria as well as NJREs may influence compulsive washing, though the former may be a consequence of the latter.

569,Does engagement with exposure yield better outcomes? Components of presence as a predictor of treatment response for virtual reality exposure therapy for social phobia,"Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of anxiety disorders, including social phobia. Presence, or the level of connection an individual feels with the virtual environment, is widely discussed as a critical construct both for the experience of anxiety within a virtual environment and for a successful response to VRE. Two published studies show that whereas generalized presence relates to fear ratings during VRE, it does not relate to treatment response. However, presence has been conceptualized as multidimensional, with three primary factors (spatial presence, involvement, and realness). These factors can be linked to other research on the facilitation of fear during exposure, inhibitors of treatment response (e.g., distraction), and more recent theoretical discussions of the mechanisms of exposure therapy, such as Bouton’s description of expectancy violation. As such, one or more of these components of presence may be more strongly associated with the experience of fear during VRE and treatment response than the overarching construct. The current study ( N = 41) evaluated relations between three theorized components of presence, fear ratings during VRE, and treatment response for VRE for social phobia. Results suggest that total presence and realness subscale scores were related to in-session peak fear ratings. However, only scores on the involvement subscale significantly predicted treatment response. Implications of these findings are discussed.

570,Clinical implications of risk aversion: An online study of risk-avoidance and treatment utilization in pathological anxiety,"Previous research suggests that the pervasive tendency to avoid perceived risks (i.e., the safety bias) may be implicated in the maintenance of pathological anxiety. These studies have not explored, however, the potential clinical implications of such a bias, such as the influence of risk aversion on treatment seeking. The aim of this study was to investigate how risk-avoidance is related to willingness to seek treatment in an online sample of clinically anxious individuals with social phobia (SP), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Healthy control participants ( n = 117) and those endorsing criteria for one or more anxiety disorder(s) ( n = 92; SP, n = 33; OCD, n = 19; GAD, n = 40) were recruited from various online sources. Respondents completed an online survey comprised of a validated diagnostic interview, self-report measures assessing for symptom severity, risk-taking across various domains, a generalized index of risk-taking and treatment utilization. Consistent with hypotheses, SP and GAD individuals reported significantly more risk-avoidance when compared to non-clinical controls. Furthermore, willingness to seek treatment was found to be positively associated with social risk-taking and generalized risk-taking orientation in clinically anxious individuals who had never sought treatment. These results suggest that certain individual cognitive factors may contribute to the decision to seek treatment and may provide an interesting avenue of future investigation for increasing service utilization and treatment seeking in anxious populations.

571,Addressing revisions to the &lt;i&gt;Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale&lt;/i&gt;: Measuring fear of negative evaluation across anxiety and mood disorders,"The fear of negative evaluation (FNE) represents a fundamental component of social anxiety and social anxiety disorder (SAD) within modern cognitive-behavioral models (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Rapee &amp; Heimberg, 1997). As such, access to comprehensive psychometrics for measures of FNE is an important component of thorough clinical and research efforts. Among the most popular measures of FNE have been variations of the 12-item Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale (Leary, 1983). There are currently three versions of the BFNE based on two psychometric studies (i.e., two 8-item variants and a 12-item variant). There is still substantial debate regarding which of the three alternatives should be used by researchers and clinicians. Normative data for each of the three alternatives are not available across samples of individuals with diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders; moreover, there has been no comparative assessment of responses for such samples. The present investigation was to provide more definitive recommendations about the three alternatives, to provide normative clinical data, and to explore differences in FNE endorsement across anxiety and mood disorders. Clinical participants included 381 individuals (60% women; age M = 35.61, SD = 12.49) from an established anxiety treatment and research center. Diagnoses included those with a principal diagnosis of SAD (32%), those with a diagnosis of SAD as an additional disorder (24%), those without a diagnosis of SAD (41%), and those with features of SAD (3%). Results of descriptive analyses, factor analyses, analysis of variance, and receiver operating curves demonstrated that the 12-item variant of the BFNE was inferior or comparable to the two 8-item variants. FNE scores were consistently higher among all participants with a diagnosis of SAD (either principal or additional) relative to all other diagnostic groups ( p &lt; .05). Accordingly, the current evidence, as well as parsimony and previous research, supports the utility of the 8-item variant that includes only the original straightforwardly worded items from the BFNE. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.

572,Parental educational practices in relation to children's anxiety disorder-related behavior,"Schoolchildren reported their parents’ use of aversive control and positive reinforcement contingencies in their educational interventions, as well as parental non-responsiveness to their requests for educational assistance. They also reported their own levels of six dimensions of anxiety disorder-related phenomena. Both parental use of aversive control and non-responsiveness were directly related to overall levels of child anxiety disorder-related behavior; these correlations were more robust than those observed in previous investigations of more diffuse dimensions of parenting style and trait anxiety. Panic disorder/agoraphobia and Generalized anxiety disorder were the dimensions most strongly correlated with both parental aversive control and non-responsiveness, while Compulsive behavior was uniquely uncorrelated with parental non-responsiveness and uniquely correlated with parental use of positive reinforcement contingencies. Differences in the magnitudes of correlations between anxiety disorder-related dimensions and parental educational practices are interpreted in terms of the probable differential effectiveness of their constituent behaviors in terminating parent-mediated negative reinforcers.

573,Self reported attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale: Factor structure and relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression,"The Attentional Control Scale (ACS) is a self-report questionnaire that has been developed to measure individual differences in attentional control. Despite its fairly widespread use, little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in adult samples. In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 ( n = 361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. Confirmatory factor analysis in sample 2 ( n = 367) showed a reasonable fit of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale significant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for. These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in anxiety and depression.

However, no study has examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS in an African American sample. The current study examined the LSAS characteristics in 97 African Americans diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the original LSAS subscales showed excellent internal consistency and temporal stability. Similar to previous reports, fear and avoidance subscales were so highly correlated that they yielded redundant information. Confirmatory factor analyses for three previously proposed models failed to demonstrate an excellent fit to our data. However, a four-factor model showed minimally acceptable fit. Overall, the LSAS performed similarly in our African American sample as in previous European American samples. Exploratory factor analyses are warranted to determine whether a better factor structure exists for African Americans.

575,Psychometric properties of a Dutch version of the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire—Child Version (OBQ-CV),"To improve research in cognitive theories of childhood OCD, a child version of the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-CV) has been developed (Coles et al., 2010). In the present study, psychometric properties of the Dutch OBQ-CV were examined in a community sample ( N = 547; 8–18 years) and an OCD sample ( N = 67; 8–18 years). Results revealed good internal consistency and adequate retest reliability (retest interval 7–21 weeks and 6–12 weeks, respectively). Children with OCD reported more beliefs than non-clinical children. Obsessive beliefs were related to self-reported OCD symptoms, but not to clinician-rated OCD severity. Beliefs were also related to anxiety and depression. This is the first study examining the factor structure of the OBQ-CV. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed best fit for four factors representing Perfectionism/Certainty, Importance/Control of Thoughts, Responsibility, and Threat, and a higher-order factor. This is in line with results from adult samples. These results support the reliability and validity of the Dutch OBQ-CV.

Children rapidly learned to select outcomes of ambiguous situations which were congruent with their assigned modification condition. Following positive modification, children's threat interpretation biases significantly decreased, while threat biases increased (non-significantly) after negative modification. Bias modification effects also varied as a function of age with children appearing particularly vulnerable to acquiring biases about stimuli that were congruent with the normative fears for their age group. Weak age-related modification-congruent effects on younger but not older children's anxiety vulnerability in response to a behavioral task were also observed. However, no consistent effects of bias modification on avoidance behavior were found.

577,A preliminary investigation of developmentally sensitive items for the assessment of social anxiety in late life,"The current study aimed to examine the salience of anxiety-provoking social situations for older adults. A list of potentially anxiety-provoking situations was developed from a review of existing measures of social anxiety. In addition to items derived from existing measures, the investigators generated items thought to be particularly relevant for older adults. One hundred and four older adults were asked, “Please check all situations where you might feel uncomfortable, nervous, scared, worried, embarrassed, or anxious.” Participants were also prompted to record any additional situations in which they experienced anxiety. Older adults endorsed items not included on typical measures of social anxiety at high rates. Exploratory analyses of the effects of gender on item endorsement were examined and significant differences were found for several items. The authors discuss these findings and their implications for the assessment of late-life social anxiety.

578,Eye tracking and physiological reactivity to threatening stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder,"This study tested the vigilance-avoidance model of anxiety and attention bias in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study used eye tracking technology to record initial fixations, pupil dilation, fixation time and concurrent skin conductance response to examine initial orienting towards threat stimuli and subsequent fixations. Twenty-one traumatized participants (11 diagnosed with PTSD and 10 trauma-exposed participants without PTSD) viewed 32 stimuli (with four words in each quadrant). Sixteen trials contained a trauma-relevant word in one quadrant and 16 had four neutral words. PTSD patients reported significantly greater number of initial fixations to trauma words, and a greater number of skin conductance responses to initial threat fixations. There were no significant differences in subsequent fixations to trauma words between groups. Although this study provides evidence of attentional bias towards threat that is accompanied by specific autonomic arousal, it does not indicate subsequent avoidance of threat stimuli in PTSD.

The study aimed to investigate prevalence of anxiety disorders in remitted bipolar subjects and their influence on the illness severity. Bipolar subjects with anxiety disorders were younger, had earlier age at onset of illness, and were overrepresented by female subjects and those with earlier onset illness compared to those without anxiety disorder. The study demonstrated that (1) anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in bipolar subjects, (2) individual anxiety disorders, particularly SP and PD seem to have an effect on illness severity, (3) bipolar subjects with comorbid anxiety tend to have a poorer course and are less responsive to treatment, and (4) anxiety tends to be associated with an earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder (BPD) and results in a more complicated and severe disease course.

580,What happens in session &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; stay in session: Changes within exposures predict subsequent improvement and dropout,"Previous exposure therapy research has suggested potential differences in emotional processing at different points in treatment (Hayes, Hope, &amp; Heimberg, 2008). For example, indicators of emotional processing may be more related to outcome during the later exposure sessions than during the initial session. This is consistent with a growing body of psychotherapy research highlighting the importance of timing and change processes across therapy. The current study examined whether the learning-but-not-benefiting hypothesis is observed in a group based intervention for clients with a range of anxiety disorders. It was hypothesized that activation and within session habituation during later, but not the initial exposure session, would be related to outcome, whereas activation and within session habituation during the first session would be related to dropout status. Results revealed that lower activation and less habituation during the first exposure was associated with increased treatment discontinuation. Second, lower peak and, to a lesser extent greater activation and habituation, during exposures were generally associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of examining the complexities and timing of the exposure process.

581,Corrigendum to “Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder”,"Reports an error in ""Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder"" by Shannon L. Coleman, Ashley S. Pieterefesa, Robert M. Holaway, Meredith E. Coles and Richard G. Heimberg ( Journal of Anxiety Disorders , 2011[Mar], Vol 25[2], 293-301). In the original article, Ashley S. Pietrefesa's name was spelled incorrectly. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-01965-012). In addition to the central role of compulsive behaviors in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), recent data have documented the presence of compulsive behaviors in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, there is a lack of information about potential similarities and differences with regard to the quality, or content, of checking associated with worry and obsessions. The two studies presented herein are an initial step towards gathering this information. Findings of Study 1, from a large unselected undergraduate sample, showed that symptoms of OCD and GAD were both significantly associated with checking behaviors. However, while OCD symptoms were associated with checking related to both objects and interpersonal situations, GAD symptoms were only significantly associated with interpersonal checking. Findings of Study 2, using a separate sample, suggest links between interpersonal checking and features characteristic of GAD, namely emotion regulation difficulties, and between object checking and a cognitive feature of OCD, namely thought-action fusion. In summary, the current studies add to a growing body of literature suggesting that checking may be important in numerous forms of psychopathology, while also suggesting that the nature and function of checking may differ for various symptom profiles.

582,A meta-analysis of anxiety symptom prevention with cognitive-behavioral interventions,"This meta-analysis assessed efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions in preventing anxiety symptoms. A systematic review identified 15 independent pretest–posttest randomized or quasi-randomized efficacy trials for analysis. At posttest, intervention groups demonstrated significantly greater symptom reduction compared to control groups resulting in weighted mean effect sizes (Hedges’ g ) of 0.25 for general anxiety, 0.24 for disorder-specific symptoms, and 0.22 for depression after the removal of outliers. These effects appeared to diminish over 6- and 12-month follow-up. Exploratory moderator analyses indicated that individually administered media interventions were more effective than human-administered group interventions at preventing general anxiety and depression symptoms. Implications of current findings are discussed with attention to existing gaps in the literature.

583,Psychometric properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in Brazilian children and adolescents,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in a large community sample of Brazilian children and adolescents. A total of 2410 students completed the 41-item Brazilian-Portuguese version of the SCARED. The one-factor and the five-factor structure of the SCARED fit this sample well. However, the five-factor model had a significantly better fit than the one-factor model and an adequate fit for age and gender subgroups. Anxiety symptoms in Brazilian youth were reported at a moderate-high level as compared to other studies. Females were found to score significantly higher on the total score and on all of the subscales as compared to the males. The total score and each of the five factors for both children and adolescents showed good internal consistency, test–retest and construct validity. According to our findings the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the SCARED is a reliable and valid instrument to assess anxiety in Brazilian children and adolescents.

584,Preliminary factor and psychometric analysis of the Motivation for Fear (MOTIF) survey,"To address the call for evidence-based functional assessments, this study determined the factor structure and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, convergent and discriminant validity) of the Motivation for Fear (MOTIF) survey, a newly created, 24-item functional measure of fear and anxiety. Participants were 1277 college students (ages 18–35 years; 74.7% female). A separate questionnaire verified presence of anxiety symptoms, resulting in 583 participants. Exploratory factory analysis, scree plot, parallel analysis, and oblique rotation, were used. Results converged on a 4-factor simple structure solution with 18 items. The functions (distress, attention/comfort-seeking, tangible, and escape) explained 43% of the variance and internal consistency was above .70 for distress and attention/comfort-seeking. The distress and attention/comfort-seeking functions demonstrated clear reliability and support was found for discriminant and convergent construct validity of the MOTIF. Evidence was lacking regarding functional convergent validity, however. Implications for the findings and potential for clinical use are discussed.

585,"Unexpected arousal, anxiety sensitivity, and their interaction on CO₂-induced panic: Further evidence for the context-sensitivity vulnerability model","The present experiment tested several predictions derived from the context-sensitivity vulnerability model of panic. Participants ( N = 79) scoring either high or low in anxiety sensitivity (AS) and with no history of unexpected panic were randomly assigned to one of two instructional sets: expected arousal (EA) or expected relaxation (ER). All participants were administered inhalation of room air and 35% CO₂ in a counterbalanced order. Consistent with theoretical predictions, High-AS participants who received ER instructions showed greater emotional responding compared to High-AS participants who received EA instructions, while instructional set did not affect responding among Low-AS participants. Panic attacks were observed in 52% of the High-AS-ER group compared to 17%, 5%, and 5% in the High-AS-EA, Low-AS-ER, and Low-AS-EA groups respectively. These findings are consistent with the theory's assertion that dispositional tendencies, such as anxiety sensitivity potentiate the panicogenic effects of threat-relevant context variables.

586,Social anxiety and alcohol problems: The roles of perceived descriptive and injunctive peer norms,"Although people with higher social anxiety (HSA) appear particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related problems it remains unclear why people with HSA experience such problems. One possibility is that HSA people's drinking behavior is influenced by their beliefs about others’ drinking (i.e., descriptive norms) and/or others’ approval of drinking (i.e., injunctive norms). The current study investigated the relationship between social anxiety, alcohol-related problems, drinking frequency and quantity, and descriptive and injunctive norms. The sample consisted of current drinkers with clinically elevated social anxiety (HSA; n = 86) or lower social anxiety (LSA; n = 86). Injunctive norms moderated the relationship between social anxiety group status and alcohol-related problems such that HSA participants with higher injunctive norms reported the most alcohol-related problems. Descriptive norms moderated the relationship between social anxiety and drinking quantity such that among participants with higher descriptive norms, LSA participants drank more than HSA participants.

587,More reasons to be straightforward: Findings and norms for two scales relevant to social anxiety,"The validity of both the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale has been well-supported, yet the scales have a small number of reverse-scored items that may detract from the validity of their total scores. The current study investigates two characteristics of participants that may be associated with compromised validity of these items: higher age and lower levels of education. In community and clinical samples, the validity of each scale's reverse-scored items was moderated by age, years of education, or both. The straightforward items did not show this pattern. To encourage the use of the straightforward items of these scales, we provide normative data from the same samples as well as two large student samples. We contend that although response bias can be a substantial problem, the reverse-scored questions of these scales do not solve that problem and instead decrease overall validity.

588,Anorexia nervosa and generalized anxiety disorder: Further explorations of the relation between anxiety and body mass index,"We explore comorbidity of anorexia nervosa (AN) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and their relation with body mass index (BMI) and evaluate the presence of fasting and excessive exercise which both have anxiolytic and weight loss effects. All participants were female: 32 with AN only, 607 with GAD only, 22 with AN and GAD (AN+GAD), and 5424 with no history of AN or GAD (referent) from the Swedish Twin study of Adults: Genes and Environment (STAGE). Lowest adult BMI differed significantly ( p &lt; .001) and was lower in those with AN+GAD than those with AN only ( p &lt; .029). Those with AN+GAD were most likely to endorse fasting and excessive exercise, followed by women with AN only, women with GAD only, and the referent. Comorbid AN and GAD may be a particularly pernicious presentation influencing both BMI and proclivity to engage in behaviors such as fasting and exercise that serve both weight loss and anxiolytic goals.

589,CBT for childhood anxiety and substance use at 7.4-year follow-up: A reassessment controlling for known predictors,"A previous report suggested that successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety reduced substance use problems at 7.4-year follow-up, but that report did not include predictors of: (a) substance use disorder (SUD; e.g., attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder symptoms, negative life events, family substance abuse, additional treatment), or (b) treatment outcome (e.g., severity of internalizing pathology, age). Analyses incorporating these factors tested previously reported findings in 72 participants (ages 15–22 at follow-up; 84% of the 7.4-year follow-up sample), using parent and youth diagnostic interviews and report measures. The majority of previously reported associations between less successful treatment and later substance use problems remained significant after controlling for known predictors of SUD and treatment outcome. Our findings bolster previous conclusions that effective CBT for child anxiety may have ameliorative effects on the target disorder and later substance use problems.

590,"Traits and cognitions of perfectionism and their relation with coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in Japanese musicians","Research has shown that 2 major facets of perfectionism can be differentiated: perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. In order to investigate how these different facets of perfectionism are related to coping, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety in musicians, we asked 275 professional and amateur Japanese musicians to complete measures of perfectionism traits, perfectionism cognitions, coping style, effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. While both facets of perfectionism showed a similar pattern of correlation with coping measures, they were differently associated with effort, achievement, and performance anxiety. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed the incremental validity of perfectionism cognitions in explaining variance in performance anxiety above the variance explained by other variables, such as trait perfectionism. These findings demonstrate that perfectionism in musicians has both positive and negative elements.

591,Fear factors: Cross validation of specific phobia domains in a community-based sample of African American adults,"The current study attempted a cross-validation of specific phobia domains in a community-based sample of African American adults based on a previous model of phobia domains in a college student sample of African Americans. Subjects were 100 African American community-dwelling adults who completed the Fear Survey Schedule-Second Edition (FSS-II). Domains of fear were created using a similar procedure as the original, college sample of African American adults. A model including all of the phobia domains from the FSS-II was initially tested and resulted in poor model fit. Cross-validation was subsequently attempted through examining the original factor pattern of specific phobia domains from the college sample (Chapman, Kertz, Zurlage, &amp; Woodruff-Borden, 2008). Data from the current, community based sample of African American adults provided poor fit to this model. The trimmed model for the current sample included the animal and social anxiety factors as in the original model. The natural environment-type specific phobia factor did not provide adequate fit for the community-based sample of African Americans. Results indicated that although different factor loading patterns of fear may exist among community-based African Americans as compared to African American college students, both animal and social fears are nearly identical in both groups, indicating a possible cultural homogeneity for phobias in African Americans. Potential explanations of these findings and future directions are discussed.

592,The role of anxiety sensitivity in sleep disturbance in panic disorder,"Previous research has demonstrated that individuals with panic disorder (PD) report significant sleep disturbances, although the mechanism of this disturbance is not clear. Patients with PD tend to report abnormally high levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS). Because higher AS involves increases in attention and fearfulness about anxiety and associated physical sensations, which in turn may cause excessive psychological and physiologic arousal, we hypothesized that amongst individuals with PD, higher AS would be associated with sleep disruption, particularly in the form of increased sleep latency. As expected, PD was associated with poorer sleep as measured by the Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) compared to controls and AS was significantly associated with longer sleep latency. Our data suggest that sleep disturbance, and in particular sleep latency, in PD may be partly due to high levels of AS, which can be targeted with cognitive-behavioral therapeutic strategies.

593,Childhood trauma and current psychological functioning in adults with social anxiety disorder,"Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that early childhood trauma contributes to the development of this disorder. However, surprisingly little is known about the link between different forms of childhood trauma and adult clinical symptoms in SAD. This study (1) compared levels of childhood trauma in adults with generalized SAD versus healthy controls (HCs), and (2) examined the relationship between specific types of childhood trauma and adult clinical symptoms in SAD. Participants were 102 individuals with generalized SAD and 30 HCs who completed measures of childhood trauma, social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Compared to HCs, individuals with SAD reported greater childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Within the SAD group, childhood emotional abuse and neglect, but not sexual abuse, physical abuse, or physical neglect, were associated with the severity of social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

594,A prospective examination of predictors of post-event processing following videotaped exposures in group cognitive behavioural therapy for individuals with social phobia,"Following social events, individuals with social phobia engage in post-event processing (PEP), namely a post-mortem detailed analysis of a social situation. This study aimed to examine cognitive and symptom correlates of PEP, as well as stability of PEP, in the context of videotaped exposures that occurred during treatment at sessions four and eight. Before treatment, 75 individuals with DSM-IV diagnosed social phobia completed measures of social anxiety, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events. They rated their peak anxiety during the taped exposure. Then, they completed a measure of PEP one week after each videotaped exposure exercise. Results revealed that baseline social anxiety symptoms, state anxiety during the videotaping, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events were all positively associated with PEP for the first taped exposure. Regression analyses demonstrated that unique predictors of PEP over and above baseline social anxiety were state social anxiety during the exposure, and anxious coping-focused rumination. This was largely replicated in the second taped exposure. In addition, PEP following two videotaped exposures separated by four weeks showed a moderate-to-large positive correlation. These findings highlight symptom and cognitive correlates of PEP, and underscore importance of state anxiety in social situations, as well as general anxiety focused rumination in social phobia.

595,Status of body dysmorphic disorder in Argentina,"Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has received recent attention, it remains misunderstood and under-studied. The Argentine population seeks out plastic surgery at a disproportionate rate and exhibits high rates of preoccupation with bodily dissatisfaction, yet BDD is unrecognized and research is limited. The current study describes the prevalence, quality of life, and presentation style of BDD in depressed adolescents, as depression is the most common symptom for which adolescents seek treatment in Argentina. Twenty-five depressed adolescents and 85 non-depressed students were initially assessed for depression and BDD and subdivided depending on BDD status. Participants were assessed on various constructs including obsessions and compulsions, overvalued ideas, and overall level of impairment. A 2×2 factorial design was employed, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data. Significant main effects were observed for all dependent measures (BDI, OVIS, YBOCS, and Sheehan Disability Scale) for depressed vs. non-depressed participants and BDD status; significant interactions were observed between independent variables for all dependent measures. Depressed adolescents had significantly higher scores on the YBOCS-BDD, OVIS, BDI, and the Sheehan Disability Scale compared to non-depressed participants; furthermore, individuals reporting BDD symptoms reported significantly higher scores on the YBOCS-BDD, OVIS, BDI, and Sheehan Disability Scale. Significant interactions are discussed according to BDD status and depression on dependent measures. Patients with BDD have poor quality of life and present with anxiety and depression, yet it still remains underdiagnosed.

Pre-trauma adjustment data, collected in the six months prior to the shooting, was examined along with two-month post-shooting data in a sample of 298 female students enrolled at the university at the time of the shootings. Linear regression analyses revealed consistent predictive roles for world assumptions pertaining to control and self-worth as well as family support. In addition, for those more severely exposed to the shooting, greater belief in a lack of control over outcomes appeared to increase vulnerability for post-trauma physiological and emotional anxiety symptoms. Implications of the results for research and intervention following mass trauma are discussed.

597,The temporal course of anxiety sensitivity in outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders: Relationships with behavioral inhibition and depression,"The present study evaluated the temporal course of three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (AS; concerns over physical symptoms, mental incapacitation, and social embarrassment) and their relationships with behavioral inhibition (BI) and depression (DEP) in 606 outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders. A semi-structured interview and self-report questionnaires were administered on three occasions over a two-year period. All three constructs decreased over the study period and AS temporally functioned more similar to DEP than BI. Cross-sectional and temporal correlations supported the discriminant validity of AS from BI. As expected, initial levels of BI predicted less improvement in all AS dimensions. In contrast, higher initial levels of mental incapacitation AS were associated with greater improvement in DEP. Our results are discussed in regard to the measurement of AS in clinical samples, conceptualizations of AS as a lower-order vulnerability, and prognostic implications of directional paths between BI and AS and AS and DEP.

While good psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS had been documented in Western cultural contexts (e.g., Australia), no systematic psychometric evaluation of the Chinese-translated SCAS and PSCAS has been published. In this study, psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS were examined with respect to four criteria: (a) factor structure, (b) descriptive statistics, (c) convergent validity with an anxiety cognition measure, and (d) internal consistency. Psychometric properties of SCAS and PSCAS for a Chinese community sample were found to be highly comparable with those published on Australian samples, thus providing a solid conceptual foundation for use of the Chinese version of SCAS and PSCAS.

599,The factor structure of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and the Social Phobia Scale,"The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) are two compendium measures that have become some of the most popular self-report scales of social anxiety. Despite their popularity, it remains unclear whether it is necessary to maintain two separate scales of social anxiety. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the factor analytic structure of both measures to determine the factorial validity of each scale. For this purpose, we administered both scales to 577 patients at the beginning of outpatient treatment. Analyzing both scales simultaneously, a CFA with two correlated factors showed a better fit to the data than a single factor model. An additional EFA with an oblique rotation on all 40 items using the WLSMV estimator further supported the two factor solution. These results suggest that the SIAS and SPS measure similar, but not identical facets of social anxiety. Thus, our findings provide support to retain the SIAS and SPS as two separate scales.

600,The Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version survey form does not demonstrate adequate psychometric properties in american youth with pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder,"The psychometric properties of the Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (LOI-CV Survey Form) and the Short Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version Survey Form (Short LOI-CV Survey Form) were examined in a clinical sample of 50 children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The internal consistency of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms were acceptable and poor, respectively (α = .79 and .65). The LOI-CV Survey Form was significantly and moderately correlated with child-rated OCD-related impairment, but was not significantly correlated with any other measures of OCD symptom frequency or severity, OCD-related impairment, global symptom severity, child reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent reports of children's obsessive-compulsive, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Modest support for the cognitive-behavioral treatment sensitivity of the LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d = 0.98) but not the Short LOI-CV Survey Form (Cohen's d = 0.09) was demonstrated. Diagnostic sensitivity was poor for the LOI-CV Survey Form at both pre- (0.14) and post-treatment (0.06). Overall, these results suggest that the psychometric properties of the LOI-CV and Short LOI-CV Survey Forms are not adequate for use as a screening instrument or in assessing symptom severity in pediatric OCD.

601,Factors contributing to anxious driving behavior: The role of stress history and accident severity,"Although fear and travel avoidance among anxious drivers are well documented, relatively little is known about the behavior of anxious individuals who continue to drive. Previous research has identified three broad domains of anxious driving behavior: exaggerated safety/caution behaviors, anxiety-based performance deficits, and hostile/aggressive driving behaviors. In an effort to explicate factors associated with the development of anxious driving behavior, associations with objective accident severity, accident-related distress, and life stress history were explored among individuals reporting accident involvement ( N = 317). Interactive effects of accident distress and self-reported stress history were noted across all three domains of anxious driving behavior. Examination of these effects indicates unique associations between accident distress and anxious behavior only in those reporting more severe life stress. Consistent with contemporary models of anxiety, these data suggest stress history may serve as a general vulnerability factor for development of anxious driving behavior following accident involvement.

The invariance of the factor structure across these samples has not been examined in the 14-item version of the SHAI. In the current study, the SHAI was completed by a community sample with no serious medical conditions ( n = 232) and a medical sample with multiple sclerosis ( n = 245). Factor analysis implied the same two-factor solution for both samples, with the two factors labelled: (1) Thought Intrusion, and (2) Fear of Illness.

This review analyses the discovery of this drug, which was filled with chance events, and numerous chemical and clinical errors of approach. Chlordiazepoxide, initially called methaminodiazepoxide, was patented in 1958 and introduced in clinical treatment in 1960 under the brand name Librium ® . The benzodiazepines became the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, provided truly effective treatment for “minor forms” (neuroses) of mental disorders for the first time, increased the quality of scientific methodology in clinical research, and enabled the development of new etiopathogenic theories for anxiety disorders, especially after the discovery in 1977 of their high-affinity receptor complex.

604,The relations between social anxiety and social intelligence: A latent variable analysis,"Social anxiety has been associated with biases in cognitive processing and deficits in social performances. Yet, it remains unclear if these variations may be partly attributable to deficits in fundamental social abilities: for example, social intelligence (SI). Using the Magdeburg Test of Social Intelligence (MTSI) as an objective and performance based SI measure, we examined the relationship between social anxiety and SI in a general population sample ( N = 110) using Structural Equation Modeling. Dimensions of social anxiety as postulated by Clark and Wells (1995) and facets of SI (social understanding, social memory, and social perception), were negatively correlated. Use of safety-behavior in particular was related to deficits in social understanding ( r = −0.25; p &lt; 0.05) and social perception and memory ( r = −0.24; p &lt; 0.05). Results suggest small to medium sized relationships between specific facets of social anxiety and certain domains of SI. Therapeutic implications for socially anxious individuals concerning SI are discussed.

605,Posttraumatic stress symptoms and postpartum depression in couples after childbirth: The role of partner support and attachment,"Aim: The roles of partner attachment and perceptions of partner support were explored in relation to symptoms of posttraumatic stress and postpartum depression in couples within the first three postnatal months. Methods: Participants ( n = 372) were recruited within the first seven days postpartum, and completed questionnaire measures of trait anxiety, symptoms of acute posttraumatic stress, and perceptions of partner support. Postal questionnaires were completed at six weeks and three months, assessing attachment, perception of partner support, symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and postpartum depression. Two hundred and twelve couples completed all time-points. Results: Results indicated that symptoms were significantly related within couples. Men's acute trauma symptoms predicted their partner's subsequent symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Less secure attachment and dissatisfaction with partner support were associated with higher levels of postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress. Conclusions: Men's and women's responses following childbirth appear to be strongly interlinked; services should target both members of the dyad.

606,The Multi-Dimensional Blood/Injury Phobia Inventory: Its psychometric properties and relationship with disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity,"The Multi-Dimensional Blood Phobia Inventory (MBPI; Wenzel &amp; Holt, 2003) is the only instrument available that assesses both disgust and anxiety for blood-phobic stimuli. As inflated levels of disgust propensity (i.e., tendency to experience disgust more readily) are often observed in blood phobia, the MBPI appears a promising instrument for disgust research. First, we examined its psychometric properties. Next, it was examined whether disgust sensitivity (i.e., considering experiencing disgust as something horrid) had added predictive value compared to disgust propensity in blood phobia. Therefore, students and university employees ( N = 616) completed the MBPI, indices on blood phobia, disgust propensity and sensitivity. The MBPI proved to be reliable and valid. Further, it correlated moderately to high with disgust propensity and sensitivity. Additionally, disgust propensity and sensitivity were both significant predictors for blood phobia. In conclusion, the MBPI appears a valuable addition to the currently available arsenal of indices to investigate blood phobia.

Individuals seeking treatment for GSAD were randomly assigned to either the integrated interpersonal cognitive-behavioral group treatment (ICBT) or a wait list condition (WL). Results revealed that the interpersonal techniques were readily implemented by the majority of patients. ICBT produced significant increases in frequency of social approach behaviors and relationship satisfaction, in addition to GSAD symptom reductions comparable to other group CBT regimens. The current research highlights the feasibility and potential benefit of incorporating strategies based on relational and circumplex theories into cognitive-behavioral regimens for GSAD.

Respondents with both PTSD and partial PTSD most commonly reported unexpected death of someone close, serious illness or injury to someone close, and sexual assault as their worst stressful experiences. PTSD and partial PTSD were associated with elevated lifetime rates of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and suicide attempts. Respondents with partial PTSD generally had intermediate odds of comorbid Axis I disorders and psychosocial impairment relative to trauma controls and full PTSD.

609,Mother–child disagreement in reports of child anxiety: Effects of child age and maternal anxiety,"The present study examined effects of maternal anxiety, child age, and their interaction on mother–child anxiety reporting disagreement while taking into account the direction of each informant's report relative to the other. Participants were 41 dyads of mothers and clinically anxious children aged 7–13. A hierarchical regression revealed a significant interaction between maternal anxiety and child age ( β = .30, p &lt; .05). A graph of this interaction indicated that when maternal anxiety is high and the child is older, maternal report of anxiety is relatively higher, and when maternal anxiety is high and the child is younger, child report of anxiety is relatively higher. When maternal anxiety is low, the reporting discrepancy is relatively stable across age. Results may help explain previous mixed findings regarding effects of age and maternal anxiety on reporting discrepancies. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.

610,Measuring social anxiety related interpersonal constraint with the flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma,"Data from self-report and observational studies make it clear that problematic social anxiety confers interpersonal constraint that may contribute to the interpersonal dysfunction reported by individuals with social anxiety disorder. Direct observation of interpersonal behavior in established relationships is rare and difficult to obtain for practical reasons. We tested a flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma computer task to examine whether it might capture interpersonal constraint related to social anxiety. Our first study suggested that, at least for men, the task directly captures social anxiety's constraint on responses to friendly giving. Our second study more strongly supported the assertion that the task directly assesses interpersonal constraint. The data support a model in which social anxiety directly confers trait-like tendencies toward interpersonal constraint and indirectly constrains behavior in specific interactions. These studies provide further evidence that constrained responses to positive social behaviors are characteristic of people with problematic social anxiety and may be particularly important to dysfunctions in the close relationships of these individuals.

611,The temporal precedence of metacognition in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms in the context of life-stress: A prospective study,"According to the metacognitive theory of psychological disorder, metacognitions are vulnerability factors in predicting development of psychological symptoms. The present study investigated metacognitive factors and life stress in a prospective test of their proposed temporal precedence in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms. Participants were 172 students and adults recruited in Ankara and Bolu, Turkey. Two separate sets of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. In these analyses, Time 2 anxiety or depression was regressed on the main and interaction effects of metacognition and stress after controlling for baseline symptom levels measured at Time 1, age, and gender. Results revealed that negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry significantly predicted residual change in both anxiety and depression after controlling for the negative effect of stressful life events. Furthermore, lack of cognitive confidence interacted with daily hassles to predict the change in anxiety, when the baseline level of anxiety and other individual differences were controlled. Our results support the metacognitive theory of psychopathology.

612,An evidence-based causal model of panic disorder,"Recently, Fava and Morton (2009) described what they termed a ‘causal model’ of panic disorder (Causal modeling of panic disorder theories, Clinical Psychology Review , 29 , 623–637). We examined several critical tenets of this proposed model, and offer significant revisions. Our revised causal model includes elements that have received empirical support, and exclude those with known limitations in explaining the etiology and treatment of panic disorder. Chief among these revisions are (1) an increased emphasis on anxiety sensitivity, (2) elimination of the more general psychodynamic conceptualization in favor of empirically supported findings regarding early attachment, and (3) placing biological and psychophysiological reactions as outcomes of false alarm threat, rather than causal mechanisms of panic.

613,Testing a developmental model of anxiety with the Parental Facilitation of Mastery Scale,"Parents who are not overly protective and who encourage children to take on challenging experiences may help children develop an enhanced sense of control, thereby reducing the risk for subsequent anxiety. We developed the Parental Facilitation of Mastery Scale (PFMS) to assess parenting behaviors that may promote mastery experiences in childhood. Undergraduates and their biological siblings were recruited to complete the PFMS as well as other measures of parenting behaviors, perceived control, and anxiety. A factor analysis of the PFMS revealed two components representing parental overprotection and parental challenge. These two factors demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. We therefore used this measure to test a model in which perceived control mediated the relationship between parenting behaviors and anxiety. The hypothesized model demonstrated good fit, suggesting that the PFMS may be a useful tool for measuring parental behaviors that promote a sense of mastery and ultimately buffer against anxiety in adulthood.

614,Perceived burden in spouses of National Guard/Reserve service members deployed during Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom,"Spouses of combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience elevated psychological distress. Recent research indicates that spouses’ perceptions of burden may be one mechanism of such distress, but there are several gaps in this literature. No research has examined perceived burden in relation to symptoms other than PTSD or subclinical levels of psychological distress, and very little research has focused on characteristics of spouses that may be related to their perceptions of burden. The current study examined these variables in 130 spouses of reserve component troops deployed during Operations Enduring/Iraqi Freedom. Spouses’ burden was positively associated with symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in service members, regardless of clinical severity. Moreover, burden fully mediated the relation between each type of symptom and spouses’ own psychological distress. Furthermore, levels of burden were significantly related to spouses’ neuroticism, avoidant coping, and self-efficacy, but only avoidant coping remained a significant predictor of burden when accounting for service members’ distress. These results suggest that a broad range of service members’ symptoms are related to spouses’ burden and distress, and although individual characteristics of spouses may be related to their perceptions of burden, service members’ symptoms play a primary role.

615,The prevalence and clinical implications of self-medication among individuals with anxiety disorders,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is more likely to occur among individuals with rather than without an anxiety disorder. Self-medication theory (SMT) holds that drinking behavior is negatively reinforced when alcohol temporarily reduces anxiety and that the resulting escalation of drinking increases the risk for AD. We set out to empirically scrutinize SMT using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) dataset. We found that only a minority (about 20%) of anxiety disordered individuals endorsed drinking to control anxiety symptoms. This minority drank more alcohol, had a higher cross-sectional rate of AD, and was at higher risk for developing new AD over four years compared to anxiety disordered non-self-medicators and individuals with no anxiety disorder. Consistent with SMT, increased prospective risk for AD among self-medicators is partially mediated by an increased level of alcohol use. Understanding the processes that promote and inhibit self-medication should be a priority for anxiety disorder researchers.

616,Social anxiety and discomfort with friendly giving,"Individuals higher in social anxiety report more impaired friendship quality, which past research suggests may stem from constrained warmth. We examined three motivations for constrained warmth in friendships and determined how these motivations related to social anxiety and friendship impairment. To do so, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Favor Scale (FS), which measures an individual's response to friendly giving. Results indicated that the FS has three subscales: negative reactions to favors (NEG), positive reactions to favors (POS), and expectation of tit-for-tat behavior (E-TFT). Structural equation modeling demonstrated that social anxiety related directly to NEG, and indirectly to POS and E-TFT through NEG. POS related directly to friendship quality, indicating that friendships may be impaired in social anxiety disorder due to the cumulative effects of responding negatively to friendly behavior.

617,The moderational role of anxiety sensitivity in flight phobia,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is the tendency to interpret anxiety-related bodily sensations in a threatening way. Previous research in a subclinical population identified AS as a vulnerability factor in flight phobia: AS moderates the relationship between somatic sensations and flight anxiety. The present study aimed at gaining further evidence for the moderational role of AS in a large clinical population with flight phobia. The data were obtained from 103 participants: 54 flight phobic participants and 49 controls. Just before taking a flight participants were asked to complete the Anxiety Sensitivity Index and to report their level of anxiety and bodily sensations. Results showed that AS moderates the relationship between somatic sensations and flight phobia: somatic sensations significantly predicted flight anxiety in subjects with higher AS scores, while this was not the case for subjects scoring lower on AS. Present findings implicate that treatment protocols should be supplemented by interventions specifically aimed at reducing AS, especially for individuals high in AS.

618,A community study of generalized anxiety disorder with vs. without health anxiety in Hong Kong,"Background: Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by multiple worries, anxiety about one's health is absent in the DSM-IV description of the illness. Method: A random community-based telephone survey ( N = 2005) that covered DSM-IV symptoms of GAD, two core symptoms of major depression, Rome-III criteria of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and help-seeking behavior was conducted. Results: The 1-year prevalence of 3-month GAD was 5.4%. Among affected individuals, 78.9% reported worry about personal health while 21.1% did not. The former subgroup was significantly older, had higher mean numbers of associated anxiety symptoms and worries, more likely to have worry about finances and sought professional help than the latter subgroup. The two subgroups had similar sex distribution, core depressive symptoms, IBS, distress and SDS impairment profiles. Conclusion: Health anxiety is common in GAD. Some but not all illness severity indicators differed between GAD with and without health anxiety.

619,Differential activity of subgenual cingulate and brainstem in panic disorder and PTSD,"Most functional neuroimaging studies of panic disorder (PD) have focused on the resting state, and have explored PD in relation to healthy controls rather than in relation to other anxiety disorders. Here, PD patients, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, and healthy control subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging utilizing an instructed fear conditioning paradigm incorporating both Threat and Safe conditions. Relative to PTSD and control subjects, PD patients demonstrated significantly less activation to the Threat condition and increased activity to the Safe condition in the subgenual cingulate, ventral striatum and extended amygdala, as well as in midbrain periaquaeductal grey, suggesting abnormal reactivity in this key region for fear expression. PTSD subjects failed to show the temporal pattern of activity decrease found in control subjects.

620,Do beliefs about the utility of worry facilitate worry?,"Various theoretical models have pointed out the role of positive beliefs in the worry process (Dugas, Gagnon, Ladouceur, &amp; Freeston, 1998; Wells, 1995). Two studies were conducted to search for experimental support for this possibility. After trait worry was controlled, a persuasion procedure was used to induce diverse beliefs about worry (positive, negative, or neutral). It was hypothesized that participants persuaded of the usefulness of worry would be more worried and more anxious after listening to a worrisome message. In the first study, 90 participants (62 females and 28 males) were exposed to a novel worrisome message, and in the second study, 60 participants (34 females and 26 males) were exposed to a more personally relevant worry. Results indicate that persuasion about the utility of worry does not trigger worry, and when prior positive beliefs about worry were controlled, they do not correlate with the change in anxiety after worrisome induction.

621,Associations between parental posttraumatic stress disorder and both offspring internalizing problems and parental aggression within the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication,"Data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication were used to evaluate links between parental posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and elevated (1) offspring internalizing problems and (2) parental physical aggression toward children. We extended prior tests via the use of an independent nationally representative sample and by examining specific associations between these outcomes and PTSD above and beyond variance accounted for by several theoretically relevant demographic factors and PTSD-related comorbidity. As hypothesized, offspring anxiety and depression was elevated among parents with PTSD compared to those without the condition. Parents with PTSD also were more likely to endorse the use of both moderate (e.g., pushing) and severe (e.g., hitting with a fist) physical aggression with their children. These findings advance work in the area by suggesting that there is a unique relation between PTSD and these outcomes, which sets the stage for research to elucidate factors uniquely introduced by PTSD.

622,Content and correlates of checking related to symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 25(5) of Journal of Anxiety Disorders (see record 2011-09732-018). In the original article, Ashley S. Pietrefesa's name was spelled incorrectly. The correction is given in the erratum.] In addition to the central role of compulsive behaviors in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), recent data have documented the presence of compulsive behaviors in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, there is a lack of information about potential similarities and differences with regard to the quality, or content, of checking associated with worry and obsessions. The two studies presented herein are an initial step towards gathering this information. Findings of Study 1, from a large unselected undergraduate sample, showed that symptoms of OCD and GAD were both significantly associated with checking behaviors. However, while OCD symptoms were associated with checking related to both objects and interpersonal situations, GAD symptoms were only significantly associated with interpersonal checking. Findings of Study 2, using a separate sample, suggest links between interpersonal checking and features characteristic of GAD, namely emotion regulation difficulties, and between object checking and a cognitive feature of OCD, namely thought-action fusion. In summary, the current studies add to a growing body of literature suggesting that checking may be important in numerous forms of psychopathology, while also suggesting that the nature and function of checking may differ for various symptom profiles.

623,Overcoming barriers to disseminating exposure therapies for anxiety disorders: A pilot randomized controlled trial of training methods,"The present study evaluated methods for training mental health providers ( N = 46) in exposure therapies (ETs) for anxiety disorders. A pilot randomized controlled trial compared: (1) an interactive, multimedia online training (ET OLT), (2) the ET OLT plus a brief Motivational Interviewing-based intervention (ET OLT + MI), and (3) a placebo control OLT. Assessments were completed at baseline, post-training, and one-week following training. Both ET OLT and ET OLT + MI received high satisfaction ratings and were comparably effective at increasing knowledge of ETs as well as clinicians' overt efforts to learn and use the treatment. ET OLT + MI was the most effective method for improving clinicians' attitudes toward ETs. Results indicate that OLT is effective for disseminating knowledge about ETs to clinicians, and suggest that supplementing OLT with a brief MI-based intervention may be a promising direction to address potential attitudinal barriers to adopting these highly efficacious treatments.

624,The temporal relationship between anxiety disorders and urinary incontinence among community-dwelling adults,"Objective: The purpose of this paper was to carefully examine the temporal relationships between anxiety disorders and urinary incontinence among community-dwelling adults. Method: In all, 1071 persons aged 30 and over were the continuing participants in a population-based longitudinal study of community-dwelling adults. Participants were classified as incontinent if any uncontrolled urine loss within the 12 months prior to the interview was reported. Condition-specific functional loss secondary to urinary incontinence was further assessed based on a series of questions relating directly to participants’ inability to engage in certain activities due to their urinary incontinence. Anxiety disorders were assessed with standardized interviews keyed to the diagnostic criteria. Results: In multivariate models that controlled for potentially influential characteristics the association between urinary incontinence with condition-specific functional loss and newly-incident anxiety disorders was statistically significant (adjusted relative odds (RO) = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.05, 6.20]). Conclusions: Urinary incontinence with condition-specific functional loss predicted onset of newly-incident anxiety disorders among community-dwelling adults.

625,Dental anxiety in relation to neuroticism and pain sensitivity. A twin study,"Predisposing personality traits as well as heightened pain sensitivity and fear of pain have been hypothesized as central factors in the development of dental anxiety. The aim of the study was to estimate the heritability of dental anxiety, and to investigate the genetic and environmental sources of covariance between dental anxiety on one hand, and pain sensitivity and the neuroticism trait on the other. A sample comprising 188 twins, aged 23–35 years (53 monozygotic and 39 dizygotic twin pairs, and 4 single twins whose co-twin did not participate), was included in the study. Measures of dental anxiety and personality were obtained using Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale and the NEO Personality Inventory Revised, respectively. Heat pain and cold pressor pain sensitivity were assessed using standard pain testing procedures. Bivariate Cholesky models were employed to decompose the correlations between phenotypes into genetic and environmental factors. Using models with common additive genetic (A) and individual-specific environmental (E) factors, moderate heritability (i.e., .41) for dental anxiety was demonstrated. Virtually all of the phenotypic correlation between neuroticism and dental anxiety could be accounted for by A. Furthermore, a substantial part of the variance in dental anxiety was due to specific genetic and individual environmental influences unrelated to neuroticism. The phenotypic correlations between dental anxiety and the pain sensitivity indices were close to zero. Thus, while neuroticism and dental anxiety share a sizeable proportion of genetic (but not environmental) risk factors, the results also suggest that these two attributes are distinct entities with overlapping, but not identical, etiologies.

626,"The relationship between perceived discrimination and Generalized Anxiety Disorder among African Americans, Afro Caribbeans, and non-Hispanic Whites","The present study examined the relationship between frequency of race based and non-race based discrimination experiences and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in a sample of 3570 African Americans, 1438 Afro Caribbeans, and 891 non-Hispanic Whites from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). Because GAD and the experience of racial discrimination are both associated with symptoms of worry and tension, we expected race based discrimination to predict GAD prevalence for African Americans, but not other groups. We did not expect non-race based discrimination to predict GAD. Results showed that while more frequent experiences of non-race based discrimination predicted GAD for all groups, experiencing race based discrimination was associated with significantly higher odds of endorsing lifetime GAD for African Americans only. Results are interpreted in light of the different contexts that these three ethnic groups represent relative to their history within the United States as well as their present day circumstances.

627,The prevalence of dental anxiety across previous distressing experiences,"Aims: To compare the prevalence of high dental anxiety across a variety of past distressing experiences with a previously reported Dutch sample. Method: University students from the UK ( N = 1024) completed an online survey containing; the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, and the Level of Exposure-Dental Experiences Questionnaire (LOE-DEQ). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated to assess the association of self-reported distressing experiences and dental anxiety. Results: The percentage of respondents with high dental anxiety (HDA) (total MDAS score ≥ 19) was 11.2%. Significant prevalence of HDA across several distressing experiences was shown in both UK and Dutch samples notably: extreme helplessness during dental treatment, lack of understanding of the dentist and extreme embarrassment during dental treatment. There were little or no effects of non-dental trauma, with the exception of sexual abuse in the UK sample. Conclusions: Trauma from various past experiences may be implicated in an increased risk of high dental anxiety.

A total of 2558 adolescents from five European countries (Germany = 495; Cyprus = 611; UK = 469; Sweden = 484; Italy = 499), ages 12–17 years, participated in the study. In addition to the SCAS, all participants completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a measure of general difficulties and positive attributes. The internal consistency and validity (convergent and discriminant) of the SCAS were excellent. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis provided strong support for the generalizability of a 6-factor inter-correlated model across five European countries. Adolescents in the UK had significantly higher anxiety levels than adolescents in four other European countries. Our findings suggest that the SCAS is suitable for assessing anxiety disorder symptoms in adolescents in Germany, the UK, Cyprus, Sweden, and in Italy.

630,Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression,"Mindfulness has received considerable attention as a correlate of psychological well-being and potential mechanism for the success of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Despite a common emphasis of mindfulness, at least in name, among MBIs, mindfulness proves difficult to assess, warranting consideration of other common components. Self-compassion, an important construct that relates to many of the theoretical and practical components of MBIs, may be an important predictor of psychological health. The present study compared ability of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) to predict anxiety, depression, worry, and quality of life in a large community sample seeking self-help for anxious distress ( N = 504). Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that self-compassion is a robust predictor of symptom severity and quality of life, accounting for as much as ten times more unique variance in the dependent variables than mindfulness. Of particular predictive utility are the self-judgment and isolation subscales of the SCS. These findings suggest that self-compassion is a robust and important predictor of psychological health that may be an important component of MBIs for anxiety and depression.

631,Age of onset of social anxiety disorder in depressed outpatients,"Onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) often precedes that of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with this comorbidity pattern. The current study examined the association between three SAD onset groups (childhood, adolescent, adulthood) and clinical characteristics of 412 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with MDD and SAD based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Childhood and adolescent SAD onset groups were more likely to report an onset of MDD prior to age 18 and have made at least one prior suicide attempt compared to the adulthood onset group. The childhood SAD onset group also was more likely to have chronic MDD, poorer past social functioning, and an increased hazard of MDD onset compared to the adulthood onset group. Findings suggest that patients with an onset of SAD in childhood or adolescence may be particularly at risk for a more severe and chronic course of depressive illness.

Participants were recruited through several online resources for PSP and related conditions to complete a web-based survey assessing the functional and topographical phenomenology, physical and psychosocial impact, treatment utilization, and associated psychopathology of PSP. A total of 1663 participants consented, of whom 760 were over 18 and met study criteria for PSP. Results showed considerable heterogeneity in picking methods, body sites, and function (e.g., regulation of emotional, sensory, and cognitive states). Participants generally reported moderate psychosocial and physical impact from picking and tended to perceive available treatment as poor in quality. Severity of associated symptoms of psychopathology (depression, anxiety, and stress) was comparable to severity levels found in previous samples of persons with trichotillomania and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Severity of PSP was a statistically significant predictor of overall impairment after controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that PSP is a significant public health concern in need of further rigorous investigation.

633,The role of meta-cognition and parenting in adolescent worry,"In the meta-cognitive model of worry, positive, and negative beliefs about worry interact to make worry problematic. These beliefs have been found to be associated with anxiety in adolescents, but it is unknown whether they are associated with worry. Furthermore, it may be via cognitive mechanisms such as these, or directly through behavior, that parents influence their child's worry. The current study aimed to explore whether adolescent meta-cognition and parenting behaviors and meta-cognitions were associated with adolescent worry. Results indicated that meta-cognitions were specifically associated with worry in adolescents, but there was little evidence that parenting was. Parental worry on the other hand was associated with both parent and child reported parenting. It is concluded that the meta-cognitive model of worry may be relevant in adolescents, but that further research is required to explore how parents influence adolescent worry.

634,Hoarding among patients seeking treatment for anxiety disorders,"The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of hoarding symptoms among individuals presenting for treatment of anxiety symptoms. Participants included 130 adults who were seeking treatment at an outpatient anxiety disorders clinic between January 2004 and February 2006. During their initial assessment, participants (31 with panic disorder, 15 specific phobia, 27 social phobia, 36 obsessive-compulsive disorder, 21 generalized anxiety disorder, mean age 37 years, 57% female, 88% White) completed the Saving Inventory-Revised, a self-report measure of hoarding symptoms, and several measures of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment. Approximately 12–25% of anxious patients reported significant hoarding symptoms. Patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder were more likely to report significant hoarding symptoms than were those with panic disorder or specific phobia. Hoarding symptoms were positively correlated with trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment. These findings suggest that hoarding symptoms may be associated with anxiety disorders other than obsessive-compulsive disorder. The findings further suggest that hoarding symptoms may be underreported by anxious populations since typical intake assessments do not include specific questions about hoarding and individuals with hoarding symptoms may be unlikely to spontaneously report them.

635,Revisiting the latent structure of the anxiety sensitivity construct: More evidence of dimensionality,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) was initially conceptualized as existing along a continuum; however, emerging evidence from taxometric analyses is mixed as to whether the latent structure of AS is dimensional or taxonic. The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the latent structure of AS in an effort to clarify the contrasting findings reported in the literature. To do so, we examined the latent structure of AS in two large independent samples unselected with regard to AS level (comprising undergraduate respondents and/or community residents). MAXEIG and MAMBAC analyses were performed with indicator sets drawn from distinct self-report measures of AS within either sample. MAXEIG and MAMBAC, as well as comparison analyses utilizing simulated taxonic and dimensional datasets, yielded converging evidence that AS has a dimensional latent structure. Implications of these finding for the conceptualization and measurement of AS are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.

636,A population-based study on phobic fears and &lt;i&gt;DSM-IV&lt;/i&gt; specific phobia in 70-year olds,"This population-based study reports on the prevalence and characteristics of specific phobia (SP) and phobic fears in an elderly population. A representative population sample of Swedish 70-year-olds without dementia ( N =558) was examined using semi-structured interviews. Phobic fears included fear of animals, natural environment, specific situations, blood-injection-injury and ‘other’. Mental disorders, including SP, were diagnosed according to DSM-IV . Phobic fears (71.0% vs. 37.9%) and SP (13.8% vs. 4.5%) were more common in women than in men. Among those with phobic fears, more than 80% reported onset before age 21. Of those with SP, 35.7% had another DSM-IV diagnosis compared to 8.5% of those reporting no fear. Fear of specific situations and ‘other’ fears were related to SP and other anxiety disorders. SP was related to lower global functioning. We conclude that specific phobia in the elderly should receive attention from health professionals as it is common and associated with a decrease in global functioning.

637,A multidimensional anxiety assessment of adolescents after Typhoon Morakot-associated mudslides,"The aims of this study were to examine the factor structure, reliability and validity of the Taiwanese version of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-T) in a group of adolescents in mountainous regions worst affected by Typhoon Morakot-associated mudslides. In total, 271 adolescents in grades 7–9 completed the MASC-T and the Chinese version of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (C-IES-R). They also received a diagnostic interview to determine whether they had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We examined adequacy of the original four-factor structure of the MASC-T using confirmatory factor analysis, as well as its internal reliability, discriminant and predictive validities for PTSD, and convergent validity with the C-IES-R. Results support adequacy of the four-factor structure and internal reliability of the MASC-T in adolescents affected by Typhoon Morakot. Scores for the total MASC-T and subscales significantly discriminated adolescents with PTSD from those without PTSD. However, levels of predictive values for PTSD and the convergent validity with the C-IES-R differed among the MASC-T subscales and the total scale. The physical symptoms and harm avoidance subscales had the highest and lowest predictive accuracies for presence of PTSD, respectively. The MASC-T combined with diagnostic interviews for PTSD and self-report measures for assessing PTSD-specific symptoms can be used to evaluate a broad range of anxiety symptoms.

638,The Driving Behavior Survey: Scale construction and validation,"Although long recognized in the clinical literature, problematic behavior characteristic of anxious drivers has received little empirical attention. The current research details development of a measure of anxious driving behavior conducted across three studies. Factor analytic techniques identified three dimensions of maladaptive behaviors across three college samples: anxiety-based performance deficits, exaggerated safety/caution behavior, and anxiety-related hostile/aggressive behavior. Performance deficits evidenced convergent associations with perceived driving skill and were broadly related to driving fear. Safety/caution behaviors demonstrated convergence with overt travel avoidance, although this relationship was inconsistent across studies. Safety/caution scores were associated specifically with accident-and social-related driving fears. Hostile/aggressive behaviors evidenced convergent relationships with driving anger and were associated specifically with accident-related fear. Internal consistencies were adequate, although some test–retest reliabilities were marginal in the unselected college sample. These data provide preliminary evidence for utility of the measure for both research and clinical practice.

639,Achieving certainty about the structure of intolerance of uncertainty in a treatment-seeking sample with anxiety and depression,"Evidence is accumulating that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be a transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression. However, psychometric studies of the most commonly used measure of IU have typically used undergraduate students, and the factor structure has been highly inconsistent. Previous studies have also tended to focus on one diagnostic subgroup or related symptom, thereby limiting transdiagnostic comparisons. The first aim of this study was to test the latent structure of a commonly used measure of IU in a treatment-seeking sample with anxiety and depression ( n =463). The second aim was to examine psychometric properties of the best fitting solution, including internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare the goodness of fit of five models previously found with undergraduate and community samples. A two-factor solution, comprising of prospective anxiety and inhibitory anxiety, was the best fitting model. The total scale and subscales demonstrated excellent internal reliability. Convergent validity was demonstrated by the scales correlating with symptoms associated with five anxiety disorders and depression, as well as neuroticism, distress and disability. IU explained unique variance in all symptom measures, even after controlling for neuroticism and other symptom measures. Evidence of discriminant validity was also found for each IU subscale. Findings support reliability and validity of the two-factor solution, and are consistent with IU being a transdiagnostic maintaining factor.

640,Disgust and the development of posttraumatic stress among soldiers deployed to afghanistan,"Although the DSM-IV recognizes that events can traumatize by evoking horror, not just fear, the role of disgust in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has received little research attention. In a study of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, we examined whether reports of peritraumatic disgust and trait disgust vulnerability factors (disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity) predict PTSD-symptoms, independently of peritraumatic fear, neuroticism, and anxiety sensitivity. Participants ( N = 174) enrolled in this study before deployment, and were retested around 6 months ( N = 138; 79%) and, again, 15 months ( N = 107; 62%) after returning home. The results showed that (1) greater peritraumatic disgust and fear independently predicted PTSD-symptom severity at 6 months, (2) greater disgust propensity predicted more peritraumatic disgust, but not PTSD-symptom severity, and (3) disgust sensitivity moderated the relationship between peritraumatic disgust and PTSD-symptom severity. Implications of these findings for broadening the affective vulnerabilities that may contribute to PTSD will be discussed.

641,Social anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms: The impact of distressing social events,"Recent evidence supports the notion that relatively common social events, such as public humiliation and teasing, may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD; Erwin et al., 2006; McCabe et al., 2010). In addition, individuals with SAD often report event-specific hallmark symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTSS; e.g., intrusive memories, avoidance, hyperarousal) following significant negative social events. Although intriguing, there is a paucity of research data to date exploring the relationships between negative social events, social anxiety, and PTSS. The present study (1) assessed endorsement rates of negative social events; (2) compared patterns of social anxiety and PTSS reporting among persons reporting negative social events relative to persons reporting the Criterion A1 events associated with posttraumatic stress disorder; and (3) evaluated the interrelationships between social anxiety and PTSS, and common constructs including fear of negative evaluation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression. Participants included community members ( n = 601; 74% women; M age = 25.8, SD = 9.8) who endorsed experiencing a significantly negative social event. Approximately 55% of all participants reported experiencing a negative social event, with one-third of those indicating it was worse than the Criterion A events they had experienced. Participants reporting negative social events scored higher on measures of social anxiety and PTSS than those reporting only Criterion A events. Trauma symptoms only predicted social anxiety symptoms for participants who reported a negative social event. Comprehensive results and directions for future research are discussed.

268,Brief Behavioral Activation and Problem-Solving Therapy for Depressed Breast Cancer Patients: Randomized Trial,"Major depression is the most common psychiatric disorder among breast cancer patients and is associated with substantial impairment. Although some research has explored the utility of psychotherapy with breast cancer patients, only 2 small trials have investigated the potential benefits of behavior therapy among patients with well-diagnosed depression. In a primarily Caucasian, well-educated sample of women (age = 55.4 years, SD = 11.9) diagnosed with breast cancer and major depression (n = 80), this study was a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of 8 sessions of behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) compared to problem-solving therapy. Primary outcome measures assessed depression, environmental reward, anxiety, quality of life, social support, and medical outcomes. Across both treatments, results revealed strong treatment integrity, excellent patient satisfaction with treatment protocols, and low patient attrition (19%). Intent-to-treat analyses suggested both treatments were efficacious, with both evidencing significant pre-post treatment gains across all outcome measures. Across both treatments, gains were associated with strong effect sizes, and based on response and remission criteria, a reliable change index, and numbers-needed-to-treat analyses, approximately 3/4 of patients exhibited clinically significant improvement. No significant group differences were found at posttreatment. Treatment gains were maintained at 12-month follow-up, with some support for stronger maintenance of gains in the BATD group. BATD and problem-solving interventions represent practical interventions that may improve psychological outcomes and quality of life among depressed breast cancer patients.

269,Remission After Acute Treatment in Children and Adolescents With Anxiety Disorders: Findings From the CAMS,"To report on remission rates in anxious youth who participated in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). The CAMS, a multisite clinical trial, randomized 488 children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years; 79% Caucasian; 50% female) with separation, social, and/or generalized anxiety disorder to a 12-week treatment of sertraline (SRT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO). The primary definition of remission was loss of all study-entry anxiety disorder diagnoses; additional definitions of remission were used. All outcomes were rated by independent evaluators blind to treatment assignment. Predictors of remission were also examined. Remission rates after 12 weeks of treatment ranged from 46% to 68% for COMB, 34% to 46% for SRT, 20% to 46% for CBT, and 15% to 27% for PBO. Rates of remission (i.e., achieving a nearly symptom-free state) were significantly lower than rates of response (i.e., achieving a clinically meaningful improvement relative to baseline) for the entire sample. Youth who received COMB had significantly higher rates of remission compared to all other treatment groups. Both monotherapies had higher remission rates compared to PBO, but rates were not different from each other. Predictors of remission were younger age, nonminority status, lower baseline anxiety severity, absence of other internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression), and absence of social phobia. For the majority of children, some symptoms of anxiety persisted, even among those showing improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, suggesting a need to augment or extend current treatments for some children.",911196467.0, Feature,2011

272,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Online Versus Clinic-Based CBT for Adolescent Anxiety,"The study examined the relative efficacy of online (NET) versus clinic (CLIN) delivery of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescents. Participants included 115 clinically anxious adolescents aged 12 to 18 years and their parent(s). Adolescents were randomly assigned to NET, CLIN, or wait list control (WLC) conditions. The treatment groups received equivalent CBT content. Clinical diagnostic interviews and questionnaire assessments were completed 12 weeks after baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Assessment at 12 weeks post-baseline showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety diagnoses and anxiety symptoms for both NET and CLIN conditions compared with the WLC. These improvements were maintained or further enhanced for both conditions, with minimal differences between them, at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Seventy-eight percent of adolescents in the NET group (completer sample) no longer met criteria for the principal anxiety diagnosis at 12-month follow-up compared with 80.6% in the CLIN group. Ratings of treatment credibility from both parents and adolescents were high for NET and equivalent to CLIN. Satisfaction ratings by adolescents were equivalent for NET and CLIN conditions, whereas parents indicated slightly higher satisfaction ratings for the CLIN format. Online delivery of CBT, with minimal therapist support, is equally efficacious as clinic-based, face-to-face therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders among adolescents. This approach offers a credible alternative to clinic-based therapy, with benefits of reduced therapist time and greater accessibility for families who have difficulty accessing clinic-based CBT.",903212623.0, Feature,2011
273,Effects of Transference Work in the Context of Therapeutic Alliance and Quality of Object Relations,"Transference interpretation is considered as a core active ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy. In common clinical theory, it is maintained that more mature relationships, as well as a strong therapeutic alliance, may be prerequisites for successful transference work. In this study, the interaction between quality of object relations, transference interpretation, and alliance is estimated. One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to 1 year of weekly sessions of dynamic psychotherapy with transference interpretation or to the same type and duration of treatment, but without the use of transference interpretation. Quality of Object Relations (QOR)-lifelong pattern was evaluated before treatment (P. Hoglend, 1994). The Working Alliance Inventory (A. O. Horvath &amp; L. S. Greenberg, 1989; T. J. Tracey &amp; A. M. Kokotovic, 1989) was rated in Session 7. The primary outcome variable was the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (P. Hoglend et al., 2000), measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1 year after treatment termination. A significant Treatment Group x Quality of Object Relations x Alliance interaction was present, indicating that alliance had a significantly different impact on effects of transference interpretation, depending on the level of QOR. The impact of transference interpretation on psychodynamic functioning was more positive within the context of a weak therapeutic alliance for patients with low quality of object relations. For patients with more mature object relations and high alliance, the authors observed a negative effect of transference work. The specific effects of transference work was influenced by the interaction of object relations and alliance, but in the direct opposite direction of what is generally maintained in mainstream clinical theory.",903212282.0, Feature,2011
274,Marriage as a Risk Factor for Internalizing Disorders: Clarifying Scope and Specificity,"Marital discord has been linked to both depression and anxiety; however, our understanding of how marriage contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms is limited in scope and lacking specificity. First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The purpose of the present study was to address these 2 issues and, more generally, to develop a comprehensive and refined framework within which to understand the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms. Questionnaire and interview data were collected from 102 husbands and wives 5 times over the first 7 years of marriage. Results indicated that marital discord during the transition into marriage was associated with the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms for husbands but not for wives. Further, both global marital dissatisfaction and an imbalance of power and control put husbands at significant risk for symptoms over the first 7 years of marriage, whereas low levels of emotional intimacy put wives at significant risk. Results exemplify the need to routinely consider intimate relationship processes in etiological models of depression and anxiety and to identify specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders.",903208721.0, Feature,2011

278,Predictors of Response to an Attention Modification Program in Generalized Social Phobia,"At least 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have supported the efficacy of computerized attention modification programs (AMPs) in reducing symptoms of anxiety in patients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. In this study we examined patient characteristics that predicted response to AMP in a large sample of individuals diagnosed with generalized social phobia. The sample comprised 112 individuals seeking treatment for generalized social phobia who completed a randomized clinical trial comparing AMP (n = 55) with a placebo condition (i.e., attention control condition; n = 57). We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social threat, social interpretation bias). Results revealed that ethnicity predicted treatment response across both conditions: Participants who self-identified as non-Caucasian displayed better overall response than did Caucasians. The only prescriptive variable to emerge was attentional bias for social threat at preassessment. Participants in the AMP group who exhibited larger attentional bias scores displayed significantly greater reductions in clinician-rated social anxiety symptoms than did their counterparts in the attention control condition. These results suggest that AMP may be targeted to individuals most likely to benefit from these programs.",887792057.0, Feature,2011

Parents with a history of MDD and their 9- to 15-year-old children were randomly assigned to a FGCB intervention or a written information comparison condition. Children's internalizing, externalizing, anxiety/depression, and depressive symptoms; episodes of MDD and other psychiatric diagnoses; and parents' depressive symptoms and episodes of MDD were assessed at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Children in the FGCB condition were significantly lower in self-reports of anxiety/depression and internalizing symptoms at 18 months and were significantly lower in self-reports of externalizing symptoms at 18 and 24 months. Rates of MDD were significantly lower for children in the FGCB intervention over the 24-month follow-up (odds ratio = 2.91). Marginal effects were found for parents' symptoms of depression at 18 and 24 months but not for episodes of MDD.

Nevertheless, an understanding of its mechanisms and particularly the role of therapist-guided exposure is lacking. This study was aimed to evaluate whether therapist-guided exposure in situ is associated with more pervasive and long-lasting effects than therapist-prescribed exposure in situ. A multicenter randomized controlled trial, in which 369 PD/AG patients were treated and followed up for 6 months. Patients were randomized to 2 manual-based variants of CBT (T+/T-) or a wait-list control group (WL; n = 68) and were treated twice weekly for 12 sessions. CBT variants were identical in content, structure, and length, except for implementation of exposure in situ: In the T+ variant (n = 163), therapists planned and supervised exposure in situ exercises outside the therapy room; in the T- group (n = 138), therapists planned and discussed patients' in situ exposure exercises but did not accompany them. Primary outcome measures were (a) Hamilton Anxiety Scale, (b) Clinical Global Impression, (c) number of panic attacks, and (d) agoraphobic avoidance (Mobility Inventory). For T+ and T- compared with WL, all outcome measures improved significantly with large effect sizes from baseline to post (range = -0.5 to -2.5) and from post to follow-up (range = -0.02 to -1.0). T+ improved more than T- on the Clinical Global Impression and Mobility Inventory at post and follow-up and had greater reduction in panic attacks during the follow-up period. Reduction in agoraphobic avoidance accelerated after exposure was introduced. A dose-response relation was found for Time x Frequency of Exposure and reduction in agoraphobic avoidance. Therapist-guided exposure is more effective for agoraphobic avoidance, overall functioning, and panic attacks in the follow-up period than is CBT without therapist-guided exposure. Therapist-guided exposure promotes additional therapeutic improvement -- possibly mediated by increased physical engagement in feared situations -- beyond the effects of a CBT treatment in which exposure is simply instructed.",887102386.0, Feature,2011
285,Long-Term Effects of a Personality-Targeted Intervention to Reduce Alcohol Use in Adolescents,"To examine the long-term effects of a personality-targeted intervention on drinking quantity and frequency (QF), problem drinking, and personality-specific motivations for alcohol use in early adolescence. A randomized control trial was carried out with 364 adolescents (median age 14) recruited from 13 secondary schools with elevated scores in Hopelessness, Anxiety-Sensitivity (AS), Impulsivity, and Sensation-Seeking. Participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality risk factors. The effects of the intervention on quantity/frequency (QF) of alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking, problem drinking, and motives were examined at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postintervention. Intent-to-treat repeated measures analyses revealed a significant overall intervention effect in reducing problem drinking symptoms, and a Time x Intervention effect on drinking QF and binge drinking frequency. Relative to the control group, the intervention group showed significantly reduced drinking and binge drinking levels at 6 months postintervention and reduced problem drinking symptoms for the full 24-month follow-up period (Cohen's d = 0.33). A significant Time x Intervention x Personality interaction was demonstrated for coping and enhancement drinking motives. In addition to an overall effect of intervention on coping motives, the AS group who received that intervention reported fewer coping motives compared with the AS control group at 12 and 24 months postintervention. This study provides further evidence showing that personality-targeted interventions reduce drinking behavior in adolescents in the short term. Novel findings were that the interventions were shown to produced long-term effects on drinking problems and personality-specific effects on drinking motives.",887102272.0, Feature,2011

288,Cancer Patients With Major Depressive Disorder: Testing a Biobehavioral/Cognitive Behavior Intervention,"In this Phase II trial, we evaluated a novel psychological treatment for depressed patients coping with the stresses of cancer. Effectiveness of a combined biobehavioral intervention (BBI) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) was studied. Participants were 36 cancer survivors (mean age = 49 years; 88% Caucasian; 92% female) diagnosed with major depressive disorder. A single group pre-post design was used. Treatment consisted of up to 20 individual 75-min combined BBI/CBT sessions. Outcomes were change in interviewer (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Williams, 1988) and self-rated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory -- Second Edition; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) as well as change in cancer relevant symptoms (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [Hann et al., 1998] and Brief Pain Questionnaire [Daut, Cleeland, &amp; Flanery, 1983]) and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form - 36; Ware et al., 1995). Mixed-effects modeling, a reliability change index, and generalized linear models were used. All analyses were intent-to-treat. Depressive symptoms significantly improved. In addition, 19 of 21 study completers met criteria for remission. Significant improvements were also noted in fatigue and mental health quality of life. Both concurrent anxiety disorders and high levels of cancer stress (Impact of Events Scale; Horowitz, Wilner, &amp; Alvarez, 1979) were each associated with beginning and concluding treatment with greater depressive symptoms. CBT components were successfully incorporated into a previously efficacious intervention for reducing cancer stress.

289,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder With Integrated Techniques From Emotion-Focused and Interpersonal Therapies,"Recent models suggest that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms may be maintained by emotional processing avoidance and interpersonal problems. This is the first randomized controlled trial to test directly whether cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) could be augmented with the addition of a module targeting interpersonal problems and emotional processing. Eighty-three primarily White participants (mean age = 37) with a principle diagnosis of GAD were recruited from the community. Participants were assigned randomly to CBT plus supportive listening (n = 40) or to CBT plus interpersonal and emotional processing therapy (n = 43) within a study using an additive design. Doctoral-level psychologists with full-time private practices treated participants in an outpatient clinic.

MLH and child dyads (N = 80 dyads) were recruited and randomized to intervention or control; the intervention group had 3 individual sessions and 1 follow-up phone call. The sessions focused on preparing MLHs for disclosure through behavioral exercises using Derlega's model (V. J. Derlega, B. A. Winstead, K. Greene, J. Serovich, &amp; W. N.

Both MLHs and their child were assessed across multiple time points (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months) regarding disclosure of HIV status, and specific outcome variables (i.e., relationship context, mother's health, child's mental health, and family outcomes). MLHs in the intervention group were 6 times more likely to disclose their HIV status than those in the control group (OR = 6.33, 95% CI [1.64, 24.45]), with 33% disclosing in the intervention group compared with 7.3% in the control group. MLHs in the intervention group showed increases in disclosure self-efficacy across time, increased communication with their child, and improvement in emotional functioning.

294,Making Self-Help More Helpful: A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Impact of Augmenting Self-Help Materials With Implementation Intentions on Promoting the Effective Self-Management of Anxiety Symptoms,"Objective: The effectiveness of self-help materials may be constrained by failures to undertake recommended exercises or to deploy the techniques that one has learned at the critical moment. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether augmenting self-help materials with if-then plans (or implementation intentions) could overcome these problems and enhance the self-management of anxiety symptoms. Method: At baseline, participants who reported anxiety symptoms completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were then randomized via a computer program to standard self-help (n = 86), augmented self-help (n = 90), or no-intervention (n = 86) conditions. Eight weeks later, 95% (n = 249) of the participants completed the HADS and STAI again. Results: Findings showed a significant reduction in anxiety in the augmented self-help condition compared with both the standard self-help and no-intervention conditions (caseness rates on the HADS at follow-up were 21%, 49%, and 44%, respectively). Mediation analyses indicated that the benefits of augmented self-help materials were explained by improved detection of anxiety-related triggers and greater experienced benefits of the self-help techniques. Conclusions: These findings suggest that implementation intentions offer a valuable supplement to self-help materials that can enhance their impact on outcomes.

295,Gender Differences in Emotional Risk for Self- and Other-Directed Violence Among Externalizing Adults,"Objective: Women and men generally differ in how frequently they engage in other- and self-directed physical violence and may show distinct emotional risk factors for engagement in these high-impact behaviors. To inform this area, we investigated gender differences in the relationship of emotional tendencies (i.e., anger, hostility, and anhedonic depression) that may represent risk for other-directed violence (i.e., physical fighting, attacking others unprovoked) and self-directed violence (i.e., self-injury, suicide attempts). Method: The ethnically diverse sample consisted of 372 adults (252 men and 120 women age 18-55) with a history of criminal convictions. Facets of emotional risk assessed with the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Warren, 2000) and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (Watson et al., 1995) were entered simultaneously as explanatory variables in regression analyses to investigate their unique contributions to other- and self-directed physical violence in men and women. Results: Analyses revealed that anhedonic depressive tendencies negatively predicted other-directed violence and positively predicted self-directed violence in men and women, consistent with a model of depression in which aggression is turned inward (Henriksson et al., 1993). Gender differences, however, emerged for the differential contributions of anger and hostility to other- and self-directed violence. Trait anger (i.e., difficulty controlling one's temper) was associated with other-directed violence selectively in men, whereas trait hostility (i.e., suspiciousness and alienation) was associated with self- and other-directed violence among women. Conclusions: The divergent findings for trait anger and hostility underscore the need to examine gender-specific risk factors for physical violence to avoid excluding potentially useful clinical features of these mental health outcomes.

0,Twenty-year follow-up of adults traumatized during childhood in Armenia,"Background: Most children who experience trauma recover and display resilience; however, there are few long-term follow-up studies of traumatized children and fewer still have examined factors that may lead to resilience. This study is a 20-year follow-up of adults who experienced an earthquake as children. Methods: Nineteen of 25 adults who experienced the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 and participated in the initial study approximately two years later (Time 1) were reinterviewed in 2008 (Time 2). Forty-four Armenian adults aged 22–37 who had not experienced the earthquake comprised the comparison group. All participants at Time 2 were administered the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) and the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (RI) and also received a clinical interview. Results: The earthquake group had clinically elevated SCL-90-R GSI, PSDI, PST and subscale scores for all but one subscale and had significantly more subscale clinical elevations than the comparison group. All earthquake survivors at Time 2 scored from 1 to 46 on the RI with 4 having probable PTSD. No comparison subjects had experienced an A1 trauma. Limitations: The small number of subjects in this follow-up, our inability to follow the comparison group in the original study and the measures used at the two time points limits the applicability of the results. Conclusions: Most of the earthquake survivors experienced anxiety disorders at follow-up but not high levels of PTSD or depression. Clinical interviews identified resilient factors that may have helped these subjects maintain functional and adaptive capacities despite clinical elevations on the SCL-90.

1,Subjective recognition of adverse events with antidepressant in people with depression: A prospective study,"Background: While it has been reported that physicians may under-recognize adverse effects of antidepressants thoroughly in clinical settings, subjective bias in recognition of adverse effects (AEs) with antidepressants has not been specifically investigated. Methods: Four-hundred ninety-three participants with depressive disorders (ICD-10) were assessed for the severity of 20 common AEs and their inferred causal relationship with antidepressants, together with the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (QIDS). These assessments occurred twice at the 1st visit (when they were antidepressant free) and 2nd visit (10days after the initiation of antidepressants). ‘Possible AEs’ and ‘under-recognized AEs’ were defined as ‘events with exacerbation in the severity’ and ‘events with negative causal attribution to antidepressants’ at the time of the 2nd visit, respectively. Results: Three-hundred sixty-three participants (73.6%) experienced ≥1 under-recognized AEs. Flu like symptoms (96.5% of participants who experienced possible AEs), sexual dysfunction (94.2%), blurred vision (93.4%), anxiety/tension (91.1%) and sweating (89.2%) were found to be prevalent as under-recognized AEs. Participants with under-recognized AEs had less improvement in the QIDS than those without (27.1% vs. 11.1% decrease, p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: It is intrinsically challenging to exactly differentiate between antidepressant AEs and symptoms of depression. And the severity of depression, that of AEs and causal relationship between AEs and antidepressants were assessed not by objective but subjective scales. Conclusions: An overall trend to under-recognize AEs of antidepressants was found and people with a lesser degree of early improvement tend to understate the causality, which has an implication in interpreting voluntarily expression of AEs.

2,Correlations between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and clinical symptoms in medicated patients with major depression,"Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the nerve growth factor family and plays a critical role in growth, differentiation, maintenance and synaptic plasticity of neuronal systems. Previous studies have demonstrated lower serum BDNF concentrations in major depressive disorder (MDD), with concentrations negatively correlating with the severity of the disease. However, few investigations have examined the relationship between serum BDNF and detailed clinical symptoms. The aim of present study was to clarify the magnitudes of the relationships between various depressive symptom and serum BDNF. Methods: Serum BDNF concentrations were evaluated from 109 inpatients with MDD and 163 healthy controls. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D), and symptoms were categorized into four groups: “anxiety somatization”; “cognitive disturbance”; “retardation”; and “sleep disturbance”. Results: Serum BDNF concentration was significantly lower in patients with MDD compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). We identified significant negative correlations between serum BDNF concentration and both total score (R = − 0.19, p = 0.044) and “anxiety somatization” sub-score (R = − 0.32, p = 0.001) from the HAM-D in patients with MDD. Limitations: All patients in the present study were on antidepressant medications. Conclusions: These results suggest that serum BDNF level may offer a biological marker for anxiety symptoms in medicated patients with MDD.

3,Symptomatic subsyndromal depression in hospitalized hypertensive patients,"Background: Clinicians generally agree on the association between depression and hypertension. Less clear is if the nature of the link is direct or indirect and if this should be considered confined only to syndromal forms or if it concerns also subsyndromal affective presentations. This study investigated the nature of the association between hypertension and subsyndromal depression in hospitalized hypertensive patients. Methods: 196 hypertensive and 96 non hypertensive inpatients underwent a SCID interview, to exclude patients positive for any Axis I or Axis II diagnosis. Symptomatic Subsyndromal Depression (SSD) was identified according to criteria proposed by Judd. Psychopathological assessment was performed with Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Clinical assessments included blood pressure measurement, evaluation of general health conditions and screening cardiovascular risk factors (smoke, alcohol, body weight, sedentary life style). Results: Hypertensives met more frequently criteria for SSD. They also scored higher on ASI and SCL-90. However, those with more severe physical conditions, if compared with more healthy patients, did not show increased psychopathological severity. Similarly, psychopathological symptom severity did not differ among hypertensives positive for other cardiovascular risk factors, commonly more frequent among depressed subjects. Limitations: Further analyses are needed to explore the potential advantage obtained on blood pressure control by treating SSD. Conclusions: Hospitalized hypertensives, more frequently satisfied criteria for Symptomatic Subsyndromal Depression. These milder affective forms are probably directly linked to the presence of hypertension, rather than being indirectly associated to physical impairment or to higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors.

4,Electroretinographic assessment in major depressed patients receiving duloxetine: Might differences between responders and non-responders indicate a differential biological background?,"Introduction: Despite intense research efforts, still too little is known about the biological determinants of depression, thus soliciting diverse study approaches. Among others, the electroretinography (ERG) has been proposed even as a putative proxy (retinal) measurement of central dopaminergic activity for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) both in drug-naïve patients and subjects receiving antidepressant treatments. Nonetheless, current evidences are merely preliminary, essentially considering just older classes of antidepressants, thus requiring confirmation studies even with newer agents as duloxetine. Method: Twenty MDD subjects and 20 matched controls received duloxetine 60 mg/day for 12weeks, being monitored both by standard ERG recording and by administration of the Hamilton scales for Depression and Anxiety and the Young Mania Rating Scale at baseline and week 12 (end of the study). Results: ERG mean rod b-wave amplitude significantly reduced from baseline to week 12 in those depressed subjects achieving final response ( p = .024), decreasing from the highest rank values to the ones, substantially unmodified, seen among non-responders and controls. Limitations: Small sample size and lack of multiple assessments. Conclusions: At least some MDD patients responding to duloxetine might exhibit a peculiar ERG pattern, hypothetically indicating a specific biological background. If confirmed by larger-sampled studies, these results might shed further light in the understanding of the biological determinants of different subtypes of depression, ideally showing alternative patters of response upon different treatment interventions.

5,A comorbid anxiety disorder does not result in an excess risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder,"Background: Several studies have demonstrated increased mortality associated with depression and with anxiety. Mortality due to comorbidity of two mental disorders may be even more increased. Therefore, we investigated the mortality among patients with depression, with anxiety and with both diagnoses. Methods: By linking the longitudinal Psychiatric Case Register Middle-Netherlands, which contains all patients of psychiatric services in the Utrecht region, to the death register of Statistics Netherlands, hazard ratio's of death were estimated overall and for different categories of death causes separately. Results: We found an increased risk of death among patients with an anxiety disorder (N = 6919): HR = 1.45 (95%CI: 1.25–1.69), and among patients with a depression (N = 14,778): HR = 1.83, (95%CI: 1.72–1.95), compared to controls (N = 103,824). The hazard ratios among both disorders combined (N = 4260) were similar to those with only a depression: HR = 1.91, (95% CI: 1.64–2.23). Among patients with a depression, mortality across all important disease-related categories of death causes (neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases) and due to suicide was increased, without an excess mortality in case of comorbid anxiety. Limitations: The presented data are restricted to broad categories of patients in specialist services. No data on behavioral or intermediate factors were available. Conclusions: Although anxiety is associated with an increased risk of death, the presence of anxiety as comorbid disorder does not give an additional increase in the risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder. The increased mortality among patients with depression is not restricted to suicide and cardiovascular diseases, but associated with a broad range of death causes.

6,Prevalence and correlates of major depressive episode in pregnant and postpartum women in the United States,"Background: Little is known about the prevalence and comorbidity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) during pregnancy in the general population. This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of depression in women during pregnancy and postpartum in the United States. Method: Data were drawn from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43,093 adults aged 18 years and older residing in households in the United States of whom 14,549 were women 18 to 50 years old with known past-year pregnancy status. Diagnoses of depression and other mood, anxiety, and drug disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule—DSM-IV version. Results: The overall prevalence of MDE during pregnancy was 12.4%. Among pregnant and postpartum women, depression was associated with younger age, ethnicity other than Latino, being widowed, divorced, separated or never married, traumatic events within the past 12 months and pregnancy complication. Strong associations were found between MDE during pregnancy and postpartum and nearly all 12-month psychiatric disorders. Past-year depressed pregnant and postpartum women were more likely than nondepressed pregnant women to use substances (including alcohol, illicit drugs and cigarettes). Past-year pregnant and postpartum women were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for depression than nonpregnant women although not after adjusting for background sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: These results indicate that depression during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with a large range of psychiatric disorders. The high frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, the elevated use of any substances and the high rate of unmet needs should be kept in mind when considering the management of depression during pregnancy and postpartum.

7,Use of auxiliary psychiatric treatment during a 5-year follow-up among patients receiving short- or long-term psychotherapy,"Background: The need for treatment is, despite of its obvious usefulness, a scarcely used measure of effectiveness in psychotherapy trials. This study considers changes in the need for auxiliary psychiatric treatment after starting short- and long-term psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Methods: Altogether 326 psychiatric outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to solution-focused therapy (SFT), short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (SPP), or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LPP) while 41 self-selected patients were allocated to psychoanalysis (PA). The patients were followed for 5 years from start of treatment. Outcome measures were use of auxiliary psychotherapy, psychotropic medication, and hospitalization for mental reasons. Results: About 60% of the patients used auxiliary treatment during the follow-up. It was most common in the short-term therapy groups and its incidence was highest during the first year after the start of therapy. The average numbers of all therapy sessions among patients starting the therapy were 60, 70, 240, and 670 in SFT, SPP, LPP, and PA, respectively, whereas the corresponding average numbers of study therapy sessions alone were 10, 19, 232, and 646. Over 50% of the patients receiving short-term therapy received on average 4–6 times more therapy sessions than initially assigned. Limitations: Post-randomization withdrawal was uneven. Conclusions: Auxiliary treatment is usual among patients receiving short- and long-term therapies, and apparently becomes common shortly after the start of treatment. Auxiliary treatment can be used as an outcome measure indicating the need for treatment, should be monitored clinically and considered when interpreting the results of effectiveness studies.

8,Flourishing or floundering? Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression among a population-based sample of adult cancer survivors 6 months after diagnosis,"Objective: To describe the prevalence of anxiety, depression and comorbid anxiety–depression among adult cancer survivors six months following diagnosis, and identify the individual, disease, health behaviour, psychological and social factors associated with psychological morbidity. Methods: A population-based sample of adult cancer survivors was recruited from two state-based cancer registries in Australia. Data for 1323 survivors were obtained by self-report questionnaire and linkage with registry data. Anxiety and depression were assessed by the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The prevalence of psychological morbidity was 28% (95% CI: 23%–33%). Specifically, 24% (95% CI: 19%–29%) of survivors were identified as cases on anxiety (irrespective of depression), 14% (95% CI: 9%–19%) as cases on depression (irrespective of anxiety) and 10% (95% CI: 5%–15%) as cases on comorbid anxiety–depression. In addition to mental health history prior to cancer, modifiable health behaviours (physical activity, smoking status), psychological (helplessness–hopelessness, anxious preoccupation coping) and social (low positive social interaction) characteristics were stronger indicators of psychological morbidity than survivors' individual or disease characteristics. Limitations: Psychological morbidity was assessed by self-report screening instrument rather than clinical interview. The extent to which psychological morbidity is age-related versus cancer-related cannot be determined without a gender- and age-matched control group. Conclusion: Although lower than previously reported, psychological morbidity is prevalent six months after a cancer diagnosis and emphasises the need for routine psychosocial assessment throughout the cancer trajectory to identify those at increased risk or in need of immediate intervention. Physical activity, smoking cessation and coping skills training interventions warrant further exploration.

9,Anxiety symptom presentations in Han Chinese and Euro-Canadian outpatients: Is distress always somatized in China?,"Background: Cultural variations in the relative emphasis on somatic versus psychological symptoms of distress are a common topic in cultural psychopathology. The most well-known example involves people of Chinese heritage, who are found to emphasize somatic symptoms in presenting depression as compared with people of Western European heritage. It remains unknown whether a similar cultural difference is found for anxiety disorders. Methods: Euro-Canadian ( n =79) and Han Chinese ( n =154) psychiatric outpatients with clinically significant concerns about both depression and anxiety were selected from a larger data set based on their responses to a structured interview. They also completed two self-report questionnaires assessing somatization of depression and anxiety. Results: As expected, Chinese participants reported a greater tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of depression, as compared to the Euro-Canadians. Contrary to expectations, the tendency to emphasize somatic symptoms of anxiety was higher among the Euro-Canadians as compared to the Chinese participants. Limitations: Characteristics of our participants limit the generalizability of our findings. The current study is preliminary and requires replication. Conclusions: Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the results suggest that the popular notion of ‘Chinese somatization’ should not be over-generalized. Our findings also imply that there may be important differences in the cultural understanding of depression and anxiety in both Chinese and ‘Western’ contexts. Future studies should seek to unpack potential cultural explanations for why Euro-Canadian outpatients may emphasize somatic symptoms in the presentation of anxiety to a greater degree than Chinese outpatients.

10,Psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression and their relation to timing of onset: The Hamamatsu Birth Cohort (HBC) Study,"Background: The time frame for postpartum depression (PPD) defined in the literature differs among studies — either 4 weeks or 3 months after childbirth. To address potential difference in PPD in relation to onset of the illness, we investigated risk factors for early- and late-onset PPD using a representative birth cohort in Japan. Methods: We evaluated 675 women who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for two to three times within 3months after childbirth. Mothers with an onset of PPD (≥9 points on EPDS) within 4weeks after childbirth were classified as having early-onset PPD, and those with PPD that occurred during the period of the 5th to 12th week after childbirth were classified as having late-onset PPD. We adopted multinomial logistic regression to investigate risk factors associated with each of early- and late-onset PPD, whilst simultaneously allowing for all risk factors a priori selected in the model. Results: The period prevalence of early- and late-onset PPD was 11% and 4%, respectively. Primiparity was associated only with early-onset PPD (OR = 2 .6, 95% CI 1.5–4.4). Younger (&lt;25 years: OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.2–11.2) and advanced age (≥35 years: OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.8) of the participating women was significantly associated only with late-onset PPD. Lack of emotional support and a history of depression/anxiety appeared to increase risk both for early- and late-onset PPD. Limitations: Moderate sample size and diagnosis of PPD without use of structured interviews may limit generalisability of the findings. Conclusion: The finding that risk sets for early- and late-onset PPD differ suggests that these two types may have different aetiology.

11,A comparison of the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with recurrent major depressive disorder with and without dysthymia,"Background: The relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia, a form of chronic depression, is complex. The two conditions are highly comorbid and it is unclear whether they are two separate disease entities. We investigated the extent to which patients with dysthymia superimposed on major depression can be distinguished from those with recurrent MDD. Methods: We examined the clinical features in 1970 Han Chinese women with MDD (DSM-IV) between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between clinical features of MDD and dysthymia and between dysthymia and disorders comorbid with major depression. Results: The 354 cases with dysthymia had more severe MDD than those without, with more episodes of MDD and greater co-morbidity for anxiety disorders. Patients with dysthymia had higher neuroticism scores and were more likely to have a family history of MDD. They were also more likely to have suffered serious life events. Limitations: Results were obtained in a clinically ascertained sample of Chinese women and may not generalize to community-acquired samples or to other populations. It is not possible to determine whether the associations represent causal relationships. Conclusions: The additional diagnosis of dysthymia in Chinese women with recurrent MDD defines a meaningful and potentially important subtype. We conclude that in some circumstances it is possible to distinguish double depression from recurrent MDD.

12,"The relationship between neuroticism, major depressive disorder and comorbid disorders in Chinese women","Objective: The personality trait of neuroticism is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), but this relationship has not been demonstrated in clinical samples from Asia. Methods: We examined a large-scale clinical study of Chinese Han women with recurrent major depression and community-acquired controls. Results: Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the risk for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to the comorbidity of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the onset and severity of MDD. Our findings largely replicate those obtained in clinical populations in Europe and US but differ in two ways: we did not find a relationship between melancholia and neuroticism; we found lower mean scores for neuroticism (3.6 in our community control sample). Limitations: Our findings do not apply to MDD in community-acquired samples and may be limited to Han Chinese women. It is not possible to determine whether the association between neuroticism and MDD reflects a causal relationship. Conclusions: Neuroticism acts as a risk factor for MDD in Chinese women, as it does in the West and may particularly predispose to comorbidity with anxiety disorders. Cultural factors may have an important effect on its measurement.

13,Age at onset of major depressive disorder in Han Chinese women: Relationship with clinical features and family history,"Background: Individuals with early-onset depression may be a clinically distinct group with particular symptom patterns, illness course, comorbidity and family history. This question has not been previously investigated in a Han Chinese population. Methods: We examined the clinical features of 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models was used to determine the association between age at onset (AAO) with continuous, binary and discrete characteristic clinical features of MDD. Results: Earlier AAO was associated with more suicidal ideation and attempts and higher neuroticism, but fewer sleep, appetite and weight changes. Patients with an earlier AAO were more likely to suffer a chronic course (longer illness duration, more MDD episodes and longer index episode), increased rates of MDD in their parents and a lower likelihood of marriage. They tend to have higher comorbidity with anxiety disorders (general anxiety disorder, social phobia and agoraphobia) and dysthymia. Conclusions: Early AAO in MDD may be an index of a more severe, highly comorbid and familial disorder. Our findings indicate that the features of MDD in China are similar to those reported elsewhere in the world.

14,Validation of the Brazilian brief version of the temperament auto-questionnaire TEMPS-A: The brief TEMPS-Rio de Janeiro,"Background: Over the last thirty years, Akiskal and collaborators have described and developed operationalized diagnostic criteria for five types of affective temperaments - cyclothymic, irritable, hyperthymic, depressive, and anxious. A 110-item, yes-or-no questionnaire, the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego (TEMPS-A), was specifically developed for measuring temperamental variation. The TEMPS-A was translated into more than 25 languages and cross-culturally valid versions are now available in Italian, French, German, Japanese, Turkish, Arabic, Polish, Hungarian, Spanish and Portuguese. Recent studies in the US and in Europe, however, have suggested that shorter versions of TEMPS-A can be just as efficient as the full ones while potentially enhancing the compliance of respondents. The main objective of the present study was to validate a brief Brazilian Portuguese version of TEMPS-A (brief TEMPS-Rio de Janeiro). Methods: Our main sample consisted of 997 undergraduate students (female=72.6%) from seven different universities located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An additional group of 167 healthy senior citizens (women=83.8%) was recruited in senior community centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All participants were asked to complete the 110-item, Brazilian translation of the full version of the TEMPS-A. Results: An exploratory factor analysis (PCA type 2, Varimax rotation) vying for a five-factor solution yielded mixed results, with cyclothymic traits, physical symptoms of anxiety and preoccupation with the well-being of a family member loading together on the first factor. When a forced six-factor solution was attempted, cyclothymic, irritable, hyperthymic, and depressive were delineated as predicted by the theory. The original generalized anxious temperament was split into two sharply delimited components, a ""worrying"" subscale and an abbreviated anxious subscale, which included physical symptoms of anxiety and concerns with the well-being of relatives. Based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, we proposed that the abridged anxious subscale, which includes physical symptoms of anxiety, represents the ""true"" generalized anxious temperament, while the ""worrying"" subscale corresponds to the ""general distress factor"". The internal consistency of the six subscales thus identified was generally good, ranging from 0.67 (anxious subscale) to 0.81 (worrying subscale), with cyclothymic, irritable, depressive, and hyperthymic subscales exhibiting intermediate values (0.74, 0.74, 0.72, and 0.7, respectively). Limitations: The present study was based on a non-clinical sample that does not reflect accurately the characteristics of the Brazilian population. The relative uniformity of the sample in terms of age and education precluded a more in-depth analysis of the influence of these highly relevant factors. Further, we did not assess convergent, divergent or test-retest validity. Conclusions: We believe that the brief Brazilian version of the TEMPS-A auto-questionnaire will provide Brazilian researchers and clinicians with a psychometrically sound instrument and thus contribute toward the creation of a worldwide research network dedicated to the investigation of affective temperaments.

15,Impact of stressful life events on the course of panic disorder in adults,"Background: Panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/PDA) is a prevalent anxiety disorder, associated with impairment in quality of life and functionality, as well as increased healthcare utilization. Extant research shows a relationship between stressful life events (SLEs) and the onset of panic attacks in adults who ultimately develop PD/PDA. However, limited attention has been paid to how SLEs might affect the severity of panic symptoms in individuals with PD/PDA. In this study, we examined the relationship between SLEs and panic symptom severity in adults with PD/PDA. Methods: Four hundred-eighteen adults with PD/PDA from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP), a long-term prospective longitudinal observational multicenter study of adults with a current or past history of anxiety disorders were included in this study. We examined occurrence of SLEs and their impact on panic symptom severity 12-weeks pre- and post-SLE. Results: A time-slope effect showed that participants had worsened panic symptoms over the course of the 12-weeks after family/friends/household and work SLEs. That is, their symptoms worsened progressively after the event, rather than immediately thereafter (i.e., significant symptom change within the same week of the event). Limitations: The sample may not be representative of the general population. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into how SLEs affect panic symptoms in adults with PD/PDA in that household-related SLEs, such as serious family arguments, and work-related SLEs, such as being fired, put some adults at risk for worsened panic symptoms within 12-weeks of the event.

16,Prevalence and risk factors for recurrence of depression five years after short term psychodynamic therapy,"Background: Follow-up research concerning the efficacy of treatment for depression is scarce and varies widely in clinical and methodological terms. Aim was to conduct a five-year followup study of recurrence of depression after short supportive Psychodynamic Treatment (PDT) alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Methods: Patients who had been treated five years previously for major depressive disorder in a randomised control trial comparing short supportive PDT alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, were traced. Patients who completed treatment were included. Recurrent episodes in the past five years were identified using CIDI. Severity of symptoms after five years was measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and sub-scales Depression, Anxiety and Somatisation of the self-report Symptom Checklist 90. Results: 52 (37%) patients of the original sample were localised. 42% had suffered from one or more recurrences during the follow-up period. There was no significant difference between the group who had received psychotherapy and the group who had received combined therapy during the acute phase. Young women and patients with more residual depressive symptoms and less somatic symptoms directly after treatment, were more at risk for recurrence. Limitations : Relatively small study population. Furthermore it was not known if patients received other treatment during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The long-term efficacy of PDT (with or without antidepressants) seemed to be comparable with other psychotherapies for depression. But the high recurrence rate urges us to shift the focus of depression treatment to improving long-term outcome and to the prevention of recurrence, in particular for young women and patients with residual symptoms of depression.

17,Clinical differences between early and late remission in depressive patients,"Objective: Predicting treatment outcome at an early stage is clinically relevant. The main objectives are: to compare rates of remission after acute and continuation phase treatment and to determine the most common residual symptoms among remitted patients; to compare the residual symptoms in early and late remitted and to identify factors that predict early or faster remission. Method: It is a prospective, naturalistic, multicenter, and nationwide epidemiological study of 1595 depressive outpatients. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Self Rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR₃₀). Assessments were carried out after 6–8 weeks of antidepressant treatment and after 14–20 weeks of continuation treatment. Early remitters were defined with an IDS-SR₃₀ score ≤14 at first and second assessment. Late remitters were defined as those scoring IDS-SR₃₀ &gt;14 at first and IDS-SR30 score ≤14 at second assessment. Results: 140 subjects (8.8%) were in remission after 6–8 weeks of antidepressant treatment and 862 remitted (59%) after 16–20 weeks of treatment. The mean number of residual symptoms is significantly higher among patients who remit later. Greater differences between early and late remitters were found in the following symptoms: feeling sad, reactivity of mood, interpersonal sensitivity and pleasure/enjoyment. Multivariate analysis showed that only comorbid anxiety disorder is significantly associated with late remission. Conclusions: Early remitted patients have a better “quality” of remission. Late remission is associated with residual symptoms more related to core depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms in early remitted patients may constitute a new target for the treatment of depression.

18,The public health impact of antidepressants: An instrumental variable analysis,"Background: There has been a marked increase in antidepressant medication prescription and use over the past three decades with unclear effects on the mental health status of the population. This study examined the impact of expansion of antidepressant use on prevalence and characteristics of depression and suicidal ideations in the community. Method: Instrumental variable models were used to assess the impact of antidepressant treatments on the prevalence of depressive episodes, mixed anxiety and depression states and suicidal ideations in 22,845 participants of the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National surveys of psychiatric morbidity of Great Britain who were between 16 and 64years of age. Results: Increased prevalence of antidepressant treatment did not impact the prevalence of depressive episodes or mixed anxiety and depression states. However, antidepressant treatment was associated with decreased prevalence of severe and, to a lesser extent, mild depressive episodes and suicidal ideations and a corresponding increase in prevalence of moderate depressive episodes. Limitations: The data were cross-sectional and based on self-report of symptoms in the past month and current medication use with no information on dose and duration of medication treatment. Conclusions: Expansion of antidepressant treatments in recent years has not changed the community prevalence of depression overall, but it has reduced the prevalence of more severe depression and suicidal ideations. The findings call for better targeting and more judicious use of antidepressants in cases of more severe depressive episodes which are more likely to respond to such treatments.

19,Epidemiology of depression in an urban population of Turkish children and adolescents,"Background: In Turkey, studies of childhood depression have been limited to those using only scales. Methods: This is a two-stage cross-sectional epidemiological study. Three schools in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey were selected by cluster sampling. The study included 1482 students between the fourth and eighth grades. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) was used for screening in the first stage. According to test results, 320 children were interviewed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Depressive disorders were diagnosed in 62 students, constituting the case group. The control group was matched to the case group on school, grade, age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: The prevalence rate was 4.2% for some form of depressive disorder, 1.55% for major depressive disorder, 1.75% for dysthymic disorder, 0.26% for double depression, and 0.60% for depressive disorder-not otherwise specified. According to the logistic regression analysis, increasing age, having a working mother and low maternal education were all positively associated with CDI score. Low SES, perception of paternal health and relations with father as negatively, low popularity and behavior subscales of the Piers-Harris self-concept scale, and high trait anxiety were associated with the presence of a depressive disorder. Limitations: Parents were not included in the diagnostic interviews. Conclusions: Dysthymic disorder was the most common depressive disorder. Low maternal education, low SES, dysfunctional interaction with the father, anxiety, and low self-esteem, which were all associated with depression, may be the target of interventions for prevention and treatment of depression.

20,"Mindfulness, response styles and dysfunctional attitudes in bipolar disorder","Background: This study aimed to examine differences between mindfulness, dysfunctional attitudes and response styles in subjects with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and controls. Method: A total of 192 participants were included in this study: 90 with bipolar disorder, 36 with remitted major depressive disorder and 66 subjects without a current or past history of a mood disorder. Results: After controlling for current mood state and co-morbid anxiety disorders, the groups did not differ on mindfulness or response styles scores, however, those with bipolar disorder scored significantly higher on the Dependency and Achievement subscales of the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale than the other two groups. Limitations: Sample sizes were relatively small for the control and remitted major depressive disorder groups making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Conclusions: Participants with bipolar disorder appear to significantly differ from remitted depressives and controls on certain cognitive styles such as Dependency and Achievement on the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale. Further research may help to understand how these cognitive domains impact on the course and outcome of bipolar disorder.

21,Common mental disorders and subsequent work disability: A population-based Health 2000 Study,"Background: Work disability due to common mental disorders has increased in Western countries during the past decade. The contribution of depressive, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders to all disability pensions at the population level is not known. Methods: Epidemiological health data from the Finnish Health 2000 Study, gathered in 2000-2001, was linked to the national register on disability pensions granted due to the ICD-10 diagnoses up to December 2007. Mental health at baseline was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Sociodemographic, clinical, and work-related factors, health behaviors, and treatment setting were used as covariates in the logistic regression analyses among the 3164 participants aged 30-58 years. Results: Anxiety, depressive, and comorbid common mental disorders predicted disability pension when adjusted for sex and age. In the fully adjusted multivariate model, comorbid common mental disorders, as well as physical illnesses, age over 45 years, short education, high job strain, and previous long-term sickness absence predicted disability pension. Limitations: The study population included persons aged 30 or over. Sub groups according to mental disorders were quite small which may have diminished statistical power in some sub groups. Baseline predictors were measured only once and the length of exposure could not be determined. The systems regarding financial compensation to employees differ between countries. Conclusions: Comorbid mental disorders pose a high risk for disability pension. Other independent predictors of work disability include socio-demographic, clinical, work-related, and treatment factors, but not health behavior. More attention should be paid to work-related factors in order to prevent chronic work disability.

22,Seasonality of Chinese rural young suicide and its correlates,"Background: There had been few studies on seasonality of Chinese suicide especially for Chinese rural youths. In this research, we wanted to find the seasonal pattern and the relationship between personal and behavioral characteristics and seasonal variation of suicide. Method: We examined Chinese rural young adults aged 15 to 34 years who died by suicide using Psychological Autopsy method to gather information from the informants of suicide victims. Altogether 330 suicide victims were collected among which 144 were female and 186 were male. The χ² test was used for comparison, and the multiple logistic regressions and Odds Ratios were adopted to analyze the seasonal preferences of suicide victims. Result: Seasonal summer peak of suicide emerged in total population and in each subgroup. Four logistic regression models were constructed: in spring, six variables were included in the regression model, which were Gender (OR=1.627), Pesticide Used (OR=1.622), Life Events (OR=2.764), Suicide Intent (OR=1.641), Marital Status (OR=0.574) and Family Conflicts (OR=0.590); in summer, only Marital Status (OR=1.927) was accepted; in autumn, four variables including Marital Problems (OR=1.924), Trait Anxiety (OR=1.758), Gender (OR=0.518) and Religion (OR=0.534) were retained; in winter, Pesticide Used (OR=0.486) and Suicide Intent (OR=0.614) were retained. Conclusion: Seasonal variations of personal and behavioral characteristics, combined with social activities, might also play very important roles in suicide seasonality.

23,Prospective cohort study of suicide attempters aged 70 and above: One-year outcomes,"Background: Most elderly persons who attempt suicide suffer from depression. This study aimed to investigate one-year outcomes in suicide attempters aged 70+, and to identify predictors of these outcomes. Methods: 101 persons (mean age 80) who were hospitalized after a suicide attempt were interviewed at baseline and followed for one year by record linkage. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 71% of those who were alive after one year (60 out of 85). Outcome measures included major/minor depression, Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, repeat non-fatal/fatal suicidal behavior and all-cause mortality. Results: One half (52%) of all those who were interviewed scored &lt;10 on the MADRS at follow-up. Among those with major depression at baseline, two thirds (26 out of 39) no longer fulfilled criteria for this disorder. Factors associated with non-remission of major depression (MADRS ≥10) included higher baseline depression and anxiety scores, higher suicide intent and lower Sense of Coherence. There were two suicides and six non-fatal repeat attempts. The relative risk of death (any cause) was 2.53 (95% CI=1.45–4.10, p&lt;0.001). Limitations: This is a naturalistic study; participants received non-uniform treatment as usual. The proportion with repeat suicidal behavior was lower than anticipated and the study was thus underpowered with regard to this outcome. Conclusions: Half of the surviving attempters were free from depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up and there were relatively few repeat attempts. However, all cause mortality remained high in this elderly cohort.

24,Structural correlates of trait anxiety: Reduced thickness in medial orbitofrontal cortex accompanied by volume increase in nucleus accumbens,"Structural deficiencies within the medial prefrontal cortex have been shown in anxiety-related psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. In healthy subjects, trait anxiety as the individual's disposition to experience anxiety-relevant feelings or thoughts has been shown to be a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. We aimed at exploring the structural correlates of trait anxiety in normal participants. We acquired high-resolution MRI scans from 34 subjects and used FreeSurfer to obtain a measure of cortical thickness. We correlated cortical thickness with self-rated trait anxiety in a whole brain analysis. Automatic subcortical segmentations of the FreeSurfer pipeline were used to relate nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala volume to trait anxiety. Trait anxiety was negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and positively correlated with the bilateral volume of NAcc. Cortical thickness measures extracted from mOFC were negatively associated with the volume of left NAcc. Since, like in anxiety-related psychiatric disorders, in the healthy sample studied here, trait anxiety was associated with a reduction of cortical thickness in mOFC we suggest that this thinning is a structural precondition rather than a consequence of psychiatric illnesses.

25,Explanations of educational differences in major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in the Irish population,"Background: Social inequalities in mental disorders have been described, but studies that explain these inequalities are lacking, especially those using diagnostic interviews. This study investigates the contribution of various explanatory factors to the association between educational level and major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in Irish men and women. Methods: The study population comprised a national random sample of 5771 women and 4207 men aged 18 or more in Ireland (SLÁN 2007 survey). Major depression and generalised anxiety disorder were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (CIDI-SF). Four groups of explanatory factors were explored: material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, and chronic disease. Results: For both genders, low educational level increased the risk of both mental disorders. Material factors, especially no private health insurance, but also no car, housing tenure, insufficient food budget, and unemployment (for men), made the highest contribution (stronger for men than for women) in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders. Psychosocial (especially formal social participation, social support and marital status) and behavioural factors (smoking and physical activity for both genders, and alcohol and drug use for men) and chronic disease made low independent contributions in explaining the association between education and both mental disorders. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional study design, no causal conclusion could be drawn. Conclusions: Targeting various material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors, as well as chronic diseases may help to reduce educational differences in depression and anxiety in the general population.

26,Intra-individual changes in anxiety and depression during 12-month follow-up in percutaneous coronary intervention patients,"Background: Only a paucity of studies focused on intra-individual changes in anxiety and depression over time and its correlates in cardiac patients, which may contribute to the identification of high-risk patients and point to targets for intervention. We examined changes in anxiety and depression over a 12-month period and the demographic and clinical correlates of change scores using an intra-individual approach in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: Consecutive PCI patients (N=715) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and at 12 months post-PCI. Individual change scores were calculated and in secondary analysis, three categories of change were identified (i.e., stable, improved, and deteriorated anxiety or depression). Results: The mean individual change was -.16 (±3.0) for anxiety and -.02 (±2.8) for depression. In linear regression analysis, baseline anxiety levels (B=-.25, 95%CI[-.30 to -.20], p=&lt;.001) and baseline depression levels (B=-.28, 95%CI[-.33 to -.22], p=&lt;.001) were significant correlates of individual change scores. Secondary analysis showed that anxiety remained stable in 76.4% (546/715) of patients, while depression remained stable in 81.4% (582/715) of patients. Conclusions: The findings of the current study showed that levels of anxiety and depression remained stable in the majority of PCI patients from the index PCI to 12months post-PCI. Future studies using an intra-individual approach are warranted to further examine individual changes in anxiety and depression over time in CAD, and PCI in particular, as a means to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.

27,"Complicated grief among individuals with major depression: Prevalence, comorbidity, and associated features","Background: Growing data suggest that complicated grief (CG) may be common in clinical care settings, but there are few prior reports about CG in outpatients presenting with primary mood disorders. Methods: The present study examined rates of bereavement and threshold CG symptoms (defined as a score ≥25 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale) in 111 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 142 healthy controls participating in a study of stress and depression. Clinical and demographic characteristics were also compared for bereaved individuals with CG (MDD+CG) to those without (MDD−CG). Participants completed structured diagnostic interviews as well as measures of CG, depression, anxiety, exposure to traumatic events, and perceived social support. Results: Lifetime history of a significant loss did not differ for the MDD and control groups (79.3% vs. 76.1%), but bereaved participants with MDD had higher rates of threshold CG (25.0% vs. 2.8%). Among those with MDD, CG was associated with a higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol dependence, greater exposure to traumatic events, and lower perceived social support. Depressed women, but not men, with CG also had higher rates of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Limitations: Our findings are limited by the lack of a clinician confirmatory assessment of CG diagnosis, absence of complete information about the nature and timing of the loss, and relatively narrow generalizability. Conclusions: We found high rates of CG in a group of psychiatric outpatients with chronic MDD, suggesting that patients with depression should be routinely screened for CG.

28,Psychological factors associated with the incidence and persistence of suicidal ideation,"Background: Suicidal ideation has been identified as both a common antecedent and a significant risk factor for suicide attempt and completed suicide. However, little is known about the incidence and persistence of suicidal ideation in the general population and the associated risk factors. Methods: A 12-month follow-up survey investigated 997 of the respondents who participated in the baseline territory-wide survey of adult population in Hong Kong. A set of baseline psychological factors was considered as predictors of first onset and persistence of suicidal ideation. Results: Twelve-month incidence (1.9%) and persistence (6.2%) rates were estimated. Respondents with anxiety and lack of reasons for living were more likely to report a development of suicidal thoughts in the follow-up assessment, while respondents with higher level of average life distress and lower level of hope were at increased risk of continuing to have suicidal thoughts. Depression was found to partially mediate the effect of average life distress on persistent suicidality. Limitations: Retention rate of the follow-up sample was about 50% only. Assessments of suicidal ideation were based on retrospective reports. Conclusions: Psychological factors differentially predict first onset and persistence of suicidal ideation. It is of clinical value that depression partially mediated the effect of life distress on persistence of suicidality.

29,Impulsivity in anxiety disorder patients: Is it related to comorbid cyclothymia?,"Objective: The relationship between anxiety and impulsivity is controversial and not well explored. In a previous study we compared impulsivity, measured by different rating tools, in patients with anxiety disorders vs. healthy controls. In the same sample we now explore the influence of comorbid soft bipolar spectrum disorders on the relationship between anxiety disorders and impulsivity. Method: A sample including 47 subjects with anxiety disorder(s) and 45 control subjects matched for demographic, educational and work characteristics underwent a diagnostic evaluation by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); a symptomatological evaluation by the Bech–Rafaelsen Depression and Mania Scale (BRDMS), the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Hypomania Check List (HCL-32) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI); a temperamental and personological evaluation by the Questionnaire for the Affective and Anxious Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego—Modified (TEMPS-M), the Separation Anxiety Symptoms Inventory (SASI), the Interpersonal Sensitivity Symptoms Inventory (ISSI); and, finally, a psychometric and a neuro-cognitive evaluation of impulsivity by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Immediate and Delayed Memory Task (IMT/DMT). The initial sample of patients with anxiety disorders was then subdivided into two subgroups depending on the presence of comorbid cyclothymia (Cyclo+, n = 26 and Cyclo−, n = 21). For the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder, we used both the DSM-IV-TR criteria and also a modified threshold for hypomania with a duration of 2days. We compared symptomatological, temperamental, personological and impulsivity measures in Cyclo+, Cyclo− and controls. Results: The comparison between Cyclo+, Cyclo− and controls showed that Cyclo+ are the most impulsive subjects in all the investigated measures and are characterized by greatest symptomatological impairment, highest scores in temperamental scales, and highest levels of interpersonal sensitivity and separation anxiety. Cyclo− subjects resulted to be more impulsive compared to controls concerning the retrospective trait measures, but not in the neuro-cognitive test. Limitations: Correlational cross-sectional study. Conclusion: In our patients with anxiety disorders, without lifetime comorbidity with major mood episodes, trait and state impulsivity resulted to be greater than in controls. In particular impulsivity was highest in patients with both anxiety disorders and cyclothymia. In anxious–cyclothymic patients also separation anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity were more severe than in anxious patients without cyclothymia and controls. Our findings suggest that impulsivity, rather than being directly related to the presence of the anxiety disorder, could be associated with comorbidity with cyclothymia.

30,Damage to the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex induces panic disorder,"Brain imaging studies suggest that panic disorder (PD) is mediated by several brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In the present report we describe a patient who experienced a panic attack during awake surgery (case 1) and another patient who developed PD after surgery and radiotherapy (case 2). In case 1, the patient experienced repeated panic attacks when the tumor at the upper border of right dorsal ACC was removed during awake surgery. In case 2, the patient developed PD at six months after surgery and Cyberknife radiotherapy. MRI examination revealed that the dorsal ACC size was reduced at six months after surgery and that the dorsal ACC was absent at two years after surgery, possibly due to radiotherapy-induced damage by radiotherapy. Profile of mood states (POMS) testing characterized the presence of tension–anxiety as the common abnormal symptom in cases 1 and 2. In conclusion, these results suggest that damage to the right dorsal ACC can induce PD and that this structure likely plays a pathophysiologic role in PD.

31,The validity of DSM symptoms for depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy,"Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

32,"Stressful events, stress perception and treatment outcomes in patients with depressive disorders: The CRESCEND Study","Background: Investigations of associations between stressful events and depression treatment outcomes have led to conflicting findings. In a prospective naturalistic study of depression treatment we sought to investigate perceived stress as a predictor of 12-week antidepressant treatment outcome. Methods: A nationwide sample of 580 people with depressive disorders was recruited from 18 hospitals in Korea. Number of stressful events in the last 12months and subjective perception of stress were ascertained, and were dichotomized by median values. Participants commenced on antidepressant treatment were re-evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12weeks later. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and at every follow-up visit. Covariates included pre-treatment socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment-related characteristics. Results: Higher baseline perceived stress was significantly associated with worse 12-week antidepressant treatment outcomes in terms of depression, anxiety, and global severity after adjustment for all covariates. However, baseline number of stressful events was not associated with any treatment outcomes. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: Depressive patients with higher level of perceived stress at the time of commencing treatment had less favorable outcomes after antidepressant treatment. This may represent a group requiring more specific assessment and more intensive management in order to improve treatment response.

33,Psychotherapies for comorbid anxiety in bipolar spectrum disorders,"Background: Comorbid anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in bipolar disorder and have been shown to have serious negative impacts on the course of illness. The pharmacological treatment of anxiety can interact with the bipolar disorder and has not been proven effective. As such, many have recommended the psychological treatment of anxiety. This paper reviews the literature on psychological treatments for anxiety comorbid to bipolar disorder. Method: The Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases were thoroughly examined for relevant treatment studies. Results: Despite frequent recommendations in the literature, surprisingly few have studied the psychological treatment of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorders. Nevertheless, preliminary results suggest that comorbid anxiety disorders can be effectively treated in a bipolar clientele using cognitive–behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive–behavioral therapy or relaxation training. In contrast, interpersonal, family therapy and psychoeducation alone would not seem to be beneficial treatment alternatives for anxiety. Cognitive–behavioral therapy appears to reduce the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and general symptoms of anxiety among patients with bipolar disorder. However, the long-term maintenance of anxiety treatment effects may be somewhat reduced and adaptationsmay be called for to augment and sustain benefits. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials of different forms of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders comorbid to bipolar disorder. Until such trials are available, the most promising approach would appear to be the sequential or modular CBT-based treatment of the anxiety disorder.

34,The influence of childhood adversity on social relations and mental health at mid-life,"Background: Childhood adversity is predictive of affective and anxiety disorders in adulthood, although there are likely to be several mediating factors. Social relations and social networks are potential mediators, and have also been linked to onset and recovery of affective and anxiety disorders in adulthood. This study explored positive and negative aspects of close relationships, their association with mid-life anxiety and affective disorders, and their mediating role in the relationship between childhood adversity and mid-life disorders. Methods: Data from the 1958 British birth cohort were analysed using measures of adversity taken during childhood, measurements of social relations at 45 years, and diagnosis of affective and anxiety disorders at 45 years of age (N = 9377). Results: Childhood adversity was associated with smaller social network size and higher negative aspects of close relationships. Smaller social network size and negative aspects of close relationships, but not emotional or practical support, were associated with higher odds of having affective or anxiety disorder. However, social relations did not mediate or moderate the pathway between childhood adversity and mid-life affective and anxiety disorders. Limitations: Social relations and affective and anxiety disorders were measured cross-sectionally so direction of causation cannot be determined. Conclusions: Negative aspects of close relationships and social network size, rather than emotional or practical support, are associated with affective and anxiety disorders. Childhood adversity is related to later social relationships as well as mid-life affective and anxiety disorders.

35,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plasma levels in drug-naïve OCD patients are lower than those in healthy people, but are not lower than those in drug-treated OCD patients","Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neural development, and has been implicated in the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder with an unclear pathophysiology. Although genetic studies have suggested an association between BDNF and OCD, the results have been inconsistent. The aims of this study were to determine whether BDNF plasma levels in OCD patients are lower than those in healthy controls and whether BDNF plasma levels differ between drug-naïve and drug-treated OCD patients. Methods: We examined BDNF plasma levels in 22 drug-naïve OCD patients, 52 drug-treated OCD patients, and 63 healthy controls. Individuals in all groups with a current or lifetime history of depression were excluded. Results: BDNF plasma levels in both drug-naïve OCD patients (1.97 ± 1.80 ng/ml, p = 0.00) and drug-treated OCD patients (1.98 ± 1.54 ng/ml, p = 0.00) were lower than those in normal controls (4.09 ± 2.00 ng/ml). However BDNF plasma levels in those two OCD patients groups were not different from each other significantly ( p = 0.99). Length of drug treatment was positively associated with BDNF plasma levels in the drug-treated patients ( r = 0.34, p = 0.03). Limitations: We used treatment length of two weeks and above as the criterion to recruit drug-treated patients. Probably this treatment length is not sufficient to identify drug-associated changes in BDNF levels. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, and may be a peripheral marker indicating neurotrophic impairment in OCD.

36,Age at onset in Canadian OCD patients: Mixture analysis and systematic comparison with other studies,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the distributions of the age at onset (AAO) using mixture analysis and better develop the understanding of AAO as a clinical feature of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Method: Mixture analysis was used to identify sub-groups characterized by differences in AAO. Clinical features were analyzed for differences in AAO sub-groups using mixture analysis. Comparisons were made with AAO cut-offs used in previous studies using the 2-Sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test. Results: Mixture analysis of our sample (n = 196) yielded a combination of 2 normal theoretical distributions with means (SD) of 9.66 (3.12) for the early-onset sub-group and 21.1 (8.36) years for the late-onset sub-group. The sub-groups were divided by a cut-off of 15 years. As expected, a negative correlation was found between AAO and duration of illness. The early-onset subjects had significantly lower age at the time of the assessment and they tended to have more often panic attacks but were treated less often with benzodiazepines and other anti-anxiety medications. The comparison analysis showed significant difference in the AAO distribution between our sample and four other study samples. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that different AAO sub-groups correspond with differences in clinical presentations of obsessive–compulsive disorder.

37,"Different white matter abnormalities between the first-episode, treatment-naive patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder without comorbid conditions","Background: This study compared brain white matter integrity in two groups of patients with DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Method: Seventeen patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 28 healthy controls were assessed on diffusion tensor imaging. Results: As compared to healthy controls, increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in left superior frontal gyrus in PTSD patients, and increased FA in right postcentral gyrus in GAD subjects were exhibited. Furthermore, patients with PTSD showed reduced FA in right anterior cingulate gyrus relative to GAD subjects. However, there was no significant correlation between the FA value of any altered region and the severity of PTSD or GAD. Limitations: The sample studied can be considered small. Gender and educational level were not well-matched among the groups. Conclusions: We tentatively speculate that abnormal white matter integrity of right anterior cingulate gyrus is an important neuroimaging marker of PTSD that distinguishes it from other anxiety disorders such as GAD.

38,Screening for perinatal common mental disorders in women in the north of Vietnam: A comparison of three psychometric instruments,"Background: There is increasing recognition that Perinatal Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) are a major public health problem for women in resource-constrained countries. There is an urgent need for screening tools suitable for use by community based health workers to assist in the identification of people with compromised mental health. The aim of this study was to establish the validity of three widely used psychometric screening instruments in detecting CMDs in women in northern Viet Nam. Methods: Translated and culturally verified versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), General Health Questionnaire 12 items (GHQ-12), Zung's Self-rated Anxiety Scale (Zung SAS) and a gold-standard diagnostic tool, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV, were administered to a community-based representative cohort of 364 Vietnamese women in the perinatal period. Post-hoc analyses, Cronbach's alpha, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to identify the optimal cut-off points and to compare the validity of three scales. Results: The Areas under the ROC Curve were: EPDS 0.77 (95%CI 0.72–0.82); Zung SAS 0.79 (95% CI 0.74–0.84) and GHQ-12 0.72 (95%CI 0.67–0.78). The optimal cut-off point for the EPDS was 3/4 (Se 69.7%; Sp 72.9%). The corresponding value for Zung SAS was 37/38 (Se 67.9%; Sp 75.3%) and for GHQ-12 was 0/1 (Se 77.1%; Sp 56.6%). The internal reliability Cronbach's alpha for EPDS was 0.75, for Zung SAS was 0.76, and for GHQ-12 was 0.64. Conclusions: These instruments are suitable for use as screening tools for CMDs in women in northern Viet Nam, but probably because of differences in emotional literacy, familiarity with test-taking and the effects of chronic social adversity require much lower cut off scores to detect clinically significant symptoms than in other settings.

39,Prevalence and correlates of lifetime deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation in naturalistic outpatients: The Leiden Routine Outcome Monitoring study,"Background: Deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation (DSHI) are common phenomena in general and mental health populations. Identifying factors associated with DSHI may contribute to the early identification, prevention and treatment of DSHI. Aims of the study are to determine the prevalence and correlates of lifetime DSHI in a naturalistic sample of psychiatric outpatients with mood, anxiety or somatoform (MAS) disorders. Methods: Of 3798 consecutive patients from January 2004 to December 2006, 2844 (74.9%) patients were analyzed (mean age = 37.5, SD = 12.0; age range: 18–65; 62.7% women). Lifetime DSHI was assessed with routine outcome monitoring (ROM), including demographic parameters, DSM-IV diagnosis, depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, general psychopathology and personality traits. Results: Of the 2844 subjects, 55% reported lifetime DSHI. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the most important factors associated with lifetime DSHI were being unmarried, low education, high number of psychiatric diagnoses, lower anxiety scores, higher depression scores and the personality trait of emotional dysregulation. Limitations: Deliberate self-harm may have been under-reported in self-report questionnaires; The assessment of personality traits may have been influenced by state psychopathology; traumatic events were not assessed. Conclusions: The findings suggest that DSHI is common among psychiatric outpatients with MAS disorders and that current symptoms and underlying personality vulnerabilities were independently involved in DSHI. Whether symptoms of somatic anxiety are protective should be confirmed in subsequent studies. These findings may help clinicians in identifying patients at risk for deliberate self-harm and suicide.

40,High and low suicidality in Europe: A fine-grained comparison of France and Spain within the &lt;i&gt;ESEMeD&lt;/i&gt; surveys,"Background: Suicidality risk-factors between countries with similar economic and religious background have been rarely compared, especially within genders. Methods: Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in the ESEMeD surveys were stratified on four separate groups: French women, Spanish women, French men, and Spanish men. Outcome odds-ratios (OR) were modelled within each group using logistic regression including demographic characteristics, lifetime mood/anxiety disorders, parental bonding, marital status, and health service-use. Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 3.4% in France (1.1% men, 5.4% women) and 1.5% in Spain (1.2% men, 1.7% women), with a significantly greater gender difference in France ( p = 0.001). Regarding risk-factors, French women reported suicide attempt more commonly with authoritarian mothers (OR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.04–2.18), unlike Spanish women (OR = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.51–1.15) ( p &lt; 0.001). Spanish men showed more than eight-times higher odds of suicide attempt with overprotecting mothers than French men ( p = 0.03). General practitioner-(GP)-use was significantly protective of suicide attempt among Spanish women (OR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.02–0.35) with no effect in French women (OR = 1.03; 95%CI = 0.54–2.00) ( p = 0.01). No significant differences in the effect of marital status, any lifetime antidepressant use, mental disorders, or religiosity on suicide attempt were observed between France and Spain within gender-stratum. Limitations: Parental bonding is retrospective and potentially influenced by mental state. Response rate was considerably lower in France than in Spain. Conclusions: Suicidality risk-factors play different roles across genders between France and Spain. Parental bonding dimensions may be interpreted differently according to country, underlining cultural importance. As recommended by WHO, mental health decisions must involve GPs in conjunction with psychiatrists or psychologists.

41,The insular cortex and the neuroanatomy of major depression,"Background: The neuroanatomical substrate underlying Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is incompletely understood. Recent reports have implicated the insular cortex. Methods: Two cohorts of participants with MDD were tested. In the first MDD cohort, we used standardised facial expression recognition tasks. In the second cohort, we focused on facial disgust recognition, a function associated with the insular cortex. T1 weighted MR imaging was used in the second cohort to test the hypothesis of abnormal insular volume being associated with impaired disgust recognition. Results: Disgust recognition was particularly impaired in both cohorts. In the second cohort, the magnitude of the disgust recognition deficit correlated with reduced insula grey matter volume. Exploring the idea of insula involvement in MDD further, we identified the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as key neural correlates of core symptoms, in that scores of 3 clinical scales (the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale) correlated with grey matter volume in these structures. Limitations: MDD participants were clinically representative of specialist and academic psychiatric practice in the UK and presented with robust primary diagnoses; we did not exclude common co-morbidities such as anxiety and personality disorders. Conclusions: We propose that cognitive and emotional functions assumed to be associated with the insula are adversely affected in patients with MDD and that this may, therefore, represent the substrate for some core clinical features of MDD. Further exploration of the involvement of the insular cortex in MDD is warranted.

42,Two-year course of depressive and anxiety disorders: Results from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: Whether course trajectories of depressive and anxiety disorders are different, remains an important question for clinical practice and informs future psychiatric nosology. This longitudinal study compares depressive and anxiety disorders in terms of diagnostic and symptom course trajectories, and examines clinical prognostic factors. Methods: Data are from 1209 depressive and/or anxiety patients residing in primary and specialized care settings, participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Diagnostic and Life Chart Interviews provided 2-year course information. Results: Course was more favorable for pure depression (n = 267, median episode duration = 6-months, 24.5% chronic) than for pure anxiety (n = 487, median duration = 16 months, 41.9% chronic).Worst course was observed in the comorbid depression–anxiety group (n = 455, median duration &gt;24 months, 56.8% chronic). Independent predictors of poor diagnostic and symptom trajectory outcomes were severity and duration of index episode, comorbid depression–anxiety, earlier onset age and older age. With only these factors a reasonable discriminative ability (C-statistic 0.72–0.77) was reached in predicting 2-year prognosis. Limitation: Depression and anxiety cases concern prevalent—not incident—cases. This, however, reflects the actual patient population in primary and specialized care settings. Conclusions: Their differential course trajectory justifies separate consideration of pure depression, pure anxiety and comorbid anxiety–depression in clinical practice and psychiatric nosology.

43,"Anxiety and depression in bariatric surgery patients: A prospective, follow-up study using structured clinical interviews","Background: Candidates for bariatric surgery frequently have co-morbid psychiatric problems. Methods: This study investigated the course and the prognostic significance of preoperative and postoperative anxiety and depressive disorders in 107 extremely obese bariatric surgery patients in a prospective design with face-to-face interviews (SCID) conducted prior to the surgery and postoperatively after 6–12 months and 24–36 months. Results: The point prevalence of depressive disorders but not of anxiety disorders decreased significantly after surgery. Preoperative depressive disorders predicted depressive disorders 24–36 months but not 6–12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative anxiety significantly predicted postoperative anxiety disorders at both follow-up time points. Preoperative lifetime and current depressive disorders were unrelated to postoperative weight loss whereas preoperative lifetime, but not current anxiety disorders were of negative prognostic value for postoperative weight loss. Patients with both depressive and anxiety disorders at baseline (current and lifetime) lost significantly less weight after surgery. Postoperative anxiety disorder was not associated with the degree of weight loss at any follow-up time-point; however postoperative depressive disorder was negatively associated with weight loss at the 24–36 month follow-up assessment point. Limitations: Missing data, limited statistical power, self-reported height and weight are the limitations of this study. Conclusions: As opposed to anxiety disorders, the point prevalence of depressive disorders decreased significantly after bariatric surgery. However, the presence of depressive disorders after bariatric surgery significantly predicted attenuated post-surgical improvements and may signal a need for clinical attention.

44,Implementation of psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in routine practice: Two year prospective cohort study,"Introduction: Worldwide, health systems are improving access to empirically supported psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. Evaluations of this effort are limited by the cross sectional nature of studies, short implementation periods, poor data completeness rates and lack of clinically significant and reliable change metrics. Objective: Assess the impact of implementing stepped care empirically supported psychological therapies by measuring the prospective outcomes of patients referred over a two year period to one Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service in the UK. Method: We collected demographic, therapeutic and outcome data on depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) from 7859 consecutive patients for 24 months between 1st July 2006 and 31st August 2008, following up these patients for a further one year. Results: 4183 patients (53%) received two or more treatment sessions. Uncontrolled effect size for depression was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.29) and for anxiety was 1.04 (0.88 to 1.23). 55.4% of treated patients met reliable improvement or reliable and clinically significant change criteria for depression, 54.7% for anxiety. Patients received a mean of 5.5 sessions over 3.5 h, mainly low-intensity CBT and phone based case management. Attrition was high with 47% of referrals either not attending for an assessment or receiving an assessment only. Conclusions: Recovery rates for patients receiving stepped care empirically supported treatments for anxiety and depression in routine practice are 40 to 46%. Only half of all patients referred go on to receive treatment. Further work is needed to improve routine engagement of patients with anxiety and depression.

45,Are patient beliefs important in determining adherence to treatment and outcome for depression? Development of the Beliefs about Depression Questionnaire,"Background: Depressive disorders are prevalent and costly but there is a lack of evidence on how to best select treatments for mild to moderate depression in primary care. Illness beliefs have been shown to influence the outcome from physical illness and our previous retrospective study suggested that beliefs may influence the duration of antidepressant medication. The development of a short questionnaire to measure beliefs will allow exploration of the relationship between beliefs, adherence to treatment and outcome for depression. Methods: A questionnaire was designed based on Leventhal's Common Sense Model of illness beliefs (CSM). Data from previous qualitative and quantitative studies as well as formal inventories were used to inform the content of individual items. The questionnaire was mailed to primary care patients with a recorded history of depression in the previous 2 years. Data were analysed by principal component analysis to determine underlying multidimensional structure and derive a shortened questionnaire. Results: Three hundred and thirty-four respondents completed the questionnaire. Fifteen components (subscales) were derived which corresponded to aspects of the CSM dimensions for cause, control/cure, consequences and timeline. The identity dimension was retained as one subscale. Reliability coefficients determined the items which best represented each subscale; 52 items were retained to derive a new shortened questionnaire. Convergent construct validity was demonstrated by comparison with the generic brief illness perception questionnaire (BIPQ) and divergent construct validitywas shown by comparison with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs). Limitations: The study was adequately powered, but the response rate means that response bias cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Beliefs about depression are multi-faceted, but fit the dimensions of the CSM. The derived shortened questionnaire will be used to determine whether beliefs about depression are predictive of outcome in a future prospective study.

46,Anxiety measures validated in perinatal populations: A systematic review,"Background: Research and screening of anxiety in the perinatal period is hampered by a lack of psychometric data on self-report anxiety measures used in perinatal populations. This paper aimed to review self-report measures that have been validated with perinatal women. Methods: A systematic search was carried out of four electronic databases. Additional papers were obtained through searching identified articles. Thirty studies were identified that reported validation of an anxiety measure with perinatal women. Results: Most commonly validated self-report measures were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS). Of the 30 studies included, 11 used a clinical interview to provide criterion validity. Remaining studies reported one or more other forms of validity (factorial, discriminant, concurrent and predictive) or reliability. The STAI shows criterion, discriminant and predictive validity and may be most useful for research purposes as a specific measure of anxiety. The Kessler 10 (K-10) may be the best short screening measure due to its ability to differentiate anxiety disorders. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) measures multiple types of distress, shows appropriate content, and remains to be validated against clinical interview in perinatal populations. Limitations: Nineteen studies did not report sensitivity or specificity data. The early stages of research into perinatal anxiety, the multitude of measures in use, and methodological differences restrict comparison of measures across studies. Conclusion: There is a need for further validation of self-report measures of anxiety in the perinatal period to enable accurate screening and detection of anxiety symptoms and disorders.

47,The effects of postnatal maternal depression and anxiety on the processing of infant faces,"Background: Postnatally depressed mothers have difficulties responding appropriately to their infants. The quality of the mother–child relationship depends on a mother's ability to respond to her infant's cues, which are largely non-verbal. Therefore, it is likely that difficulties in a mother's appraisal of her infants' facial expressions will affect the quality of mother–infant interaction. This study aimed to investigate the effects of postnatal depression and anxiety on the processing of infants' facial expressions. Method: A total of 89 mothers, 34 with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 21 with Major Depressive Disorder, and 34 controls, completed a ‘morphed infants’ faces task when their children were between 10 and 18 months. Results: Overall, mothers were more likely to identify happy faces accurately and at lower intensity than sad faces. Depressed compared to control participants, however,were less likely to accurately identify happy infant faces. Interestingly, mothers with GAD tended to identify happy faces at a lower intensity than controls. There were no differences between the groups in relation to sad faces. Limitations: Our sample was relatively small and further research is needed to investigate the links between mothers' perceptions of infant expressions and both maternal responsiveness and later measures of child development. Conclusion: Our findings have potential clinical implications as the difficulties in the processing of positive facial expressions in depression may lead to less maternal responsiveness to positive affect in the offspring and may diminish the quality of the mother–child interactions. Results for participants with GAD are consistent with the literature demonstrating that persons with GAD are intolerant of uncertainty and seek reassurance due to their worries.

48,Psychometric properties of the dickman impulsivity instrument in suicide victims and living controls of rural China,"Background: We are not aware of any of impulsivity trait for Chinese rural youths. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of Dickman Impulsivity Instrument in suicide cases and living controls in rural China. Methods: The participants, 392 suicide victims and 416 controls were respectively selected, and the psychological autopsy method was used to collect information. The Exploratory Factor Analysis was processed to evaluate the construct validity. The Cronbach's alpha was computed to evaluate the internal consistency, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between STAI Trait Anxiety Inventory, Coping Responses Inventory and Dickman Impulsivity Instrument were calculated to evaluate the convergent validity. Results: Dysfunctional and Functional impulsivity were extracted for both samples. The mean of DI scores in suicide cases was larger than that in controls, but it was reversed for FI. There were no significant differences between DI and FI in suicide cases, but in controls the mean of DI scores was significantly smaller than that of FI. The Cronbach's alpha was around .863 and .779 respectively for DI and FI scales in suicides, and it was around .746 and .680 in controls. The DI and FI were significantly correlated with each other. Both the DI and FI were correlated with Approach and Avoidance Coping Response Inventory, and both of the scales were grossly independent with Trait Anxiety Inventory in two samples. Conclusion: The results indicated that the Dickman Impulsivity Instrument was adequate to measure impulsivity trait for suicide victims and living controls through proxy data in rural China.

49,Shared genetic contributions to anxiety disorders and pathological gambling in a male population,"Background: Pathological gambling (PG) frequently co-occurs with anxiety disorders. However, the extent to which the co-occurrence is related to genetic or environmental factors across PG and anxiety disorders is not known. Method: Data from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry ( n = 7869, male twins) were examined in bivariate models to estimate genetic and shared and unique environmental contributions to PG and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and PG and panic disorder (PD). Results: While both genetic and unique environmental factors contributed individually to PG, GAD, and PD, the best fitting model indicated that the relationship between PG and GAD was attributable predominantly to shared genetic contributions (r A = 0.53). In contrast, substantial correlations were observed between both the genetic (r A = 0.34) and unique environmental (r E = 0.31) contributions to PG and PD. Limitations: Results may be limited to middle aged males. Conclusions: The existence of shared genetic contributions between PG and both GAD and PD suggests that specific genes, perhaps those involved in affect regulation or stress responsiveness, contribute to PG and anxiety disorders. Overlapping environmental contributions to the co-occurrence of PG and PD suggest that common life experiences (e.g., early life trauma) contribute to both PG and PD. Conversely, the data suggest that distinct environmental factors contribute to PG and GAD (e.g., early onset of gambling in PG). Future studies should examine the relationship between PG and anxiety disorders amongst other populations (women and adolescents) to identify specific genetic and environmental influences that account for the manifestation of these disorders and their co-occurrences.

50,"Does negative religious coping accompany, precede, or follow depression among Orthodox Jews?","Background: Cross sectional research suggests that negative religious coping (e.g., anger at God and religious disengagement) strongly correlates with depression and anxiety. However, causality is difficult to establish as negative coping can accompany, cause, or result from distress. Among Orthodox Jews, some studies have found correlations between negative religious coping and anxiety and depression, while others found that high levels of negative coping related with decreased distress. We therefore examined longitudinal relationships between negative coping and depressive symptoms among Orthodox Jews. Methods: Participants (80 Orthodox Jews) completed the Jewish Religious Coping Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies' Depression Scale at two times. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we compared four models describing possible causal patterns. Results: Negative religious coping and depressive symptoms were linearly related. Furthermore, a model including negative coping as a predictor of future depression fit the data best and did not significantly differ from a saturated model. Limitations: This research was limited by reliance on self-report measures, an internet sample, and examination of only negative religious coping. Conclusions: Consistent with a “primary spiritual struggles” conceptualization, negative religious coping appears to precede and perhaps cause future depression among Orthodox Jews. Clinical interventions should target spiritual struggles, and more research integrating this construct into theory and practice is warranted.

51,Subtyping depression in the medically ill by cluster analysis,"Background: There is increasing awareness of the need of subtyping major depressive disorder, particularly in the setting of medical disease. The aim of this investigation was to use both DSM-IV comorbidity and the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) for characterizing depression in the medically ill. Methods: 1700 patients were recruited from 8 medical centers in the Italian Health System and 1560 agreed to participate. They all underwent a cross-sectional assessment with DSM-IV and DCPR structured interviews. 198 patients (12.7%) received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Data were submitted to cluster analysis. Results: Two clusters were identified: depressed somatizers and irritable/anxious depression. The somatizer cluster included 58.6% of the cases and was characterized by DCPR somatization syndromes (persistent somatization, functional somatic symptoms secondary to a psychiatric disorder, conversion symptoms, and anniversary reactions) and DCPR alexithymia. The anxious/irritable cluster had 41.4% of the total sample and included DCPR irritable mood and type A behavior and DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Limitations: The study has limitations due to its cross-sectional nature. Further, these findings require additional validation in another sample. Conclusions: The findings indicate the need of expanding clinical assessment in the medically ill to include the various manifestations of somatization, irritable mood, type A behavior and alexithymia, as encompassed by the DCPR. Subtyping major depressive disorder may yield improved targets for psychosomatic research and treatment trials.

52,The identification of unipolar mania subtype based on anxiety comorbidity,"Background: Unipolar mania is a controversial topic. Clinical research has focused on establishing specific characteristics that allow it to be distinguished from bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Experienced and carefully trained clinicians evaluated a clinical sample of 298 patients with bipolar disorder using structured instruments to analyze the clinical and socio-demographics differences between people with manic episodes over the course of a 15-year illness compared with participants with histories of manic and depressive episodes. Results: According to adopted criteria, 16 (5.6%) participants presented unipolar mania (UM) and 282 participants presented manic and depressive (MD) phases. UM patients reported significantly more hospitalizations and medications, as well as more frequent psychosis at the first episode in the UM group than compared to the MD group. The UM group showed worse overall functioning, although differences in mood status between groups were not identified. Comorbid anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms occurred significantly less frequently in the UM group. Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional design, determining causal relationships was not possible. Furthermore, the retrospective nature of the UM diagnosis could not exclude a future depressive episode. Conclusions: The presence of anxiety disorders can differentiate patients with unipolar mania from those with bipolar mania.

53,Symptoms and behaviors prior to the first major affective episode of bipolar ii disorder. An exploratory study,"Background: Few studies have investigated the initial prodrome of bipolar disorders, and none has explicitly addressed bipolar II disorder (BD-II). We explored symptoms and behaviors preceding the first major affective episode (FMAE) of BD-II to generate hypotheses concerning possible clinical targets for early intervention. Methods: In-depth interviews of 15 BD-II patients and 22 family informants were carried out. Clinical diagnoses were reassessed. The textual data of transcribed interviews were analyzed utilizing qualitative methodology supplemented by quantitative analyses. Results: All patients experienced clinically significant symptoms and behaviors at an average of more than a decade before the FMAE. Anxiety and depression-type symptoms were the most common. Two distinct subgroups were identified based on prominent and enduring personal characteristics prior to the FMAE. The individuals in one of the subgroups were described as very well-functioning, whereas the individuals in the other subgroup were characterized by neurocognitive deficits, relatively low academic and social functioning, and pronounced irritability and aggressiveness. Furthermore, it is possible that these individuals experience earlier prodromal symptom onset, earlier FMAEs, and more symptoms than individuals without these characteristics. Limitations: This is a retrospective and hypothesis-generating qualitative study. The hypotheses generated need to be tested in future studies. Conclusions: Prodromal clinical phenomenology is too nonspecific to predict the occurrence of the FMAE of BD-II. However, identifiable subgroups may exist. We hypothesize that neurocognitive deficits together with pronounced irritability and aggressiveness may constitute a vulnerability marker for a subgroup of individuals who subsequently develop BD-II. This subgroup may be of potential interest for early identification.

54,Relationship between malnutrition and depression or anxiety in anorexia nervosa: A critical review of the literature,"Background: Depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) frequently co-occur with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Clinical consensus admits that depressive symptoms and anxiety are the sequelae of malnutrition in AN. This review presents a critical assessment of the literature that looked into the link between depression/anxiety symptoms in relation to malnutrition and their improvement throughout the treatment. Methods: We performed a systematic search of literature in Medline and PsychInfo for all the studies done to investigate psychological factors in relation to malnutrition in AN using the keywords ""Anorexia Nervosa"", ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""malnutrition"". Only articles published between 1980 and 2010 in English or French were reviewed. From the articles on AN and depression, anxiety, and/or OCD, only the ones which investigated on the relation with malnutrition were kept. This search was complemented by a manual search. We also checked the reference lists of the articles we found. Results: Seven papers were analyzed and critically reviewed for their methods and results. Results are contradictory and inconsistent at all levels of assessment. Conclusions: Evidence based data is very rare. From the 7 reviewed studies, none of them draw the same conclusion. This is mainly due to the large differences in the samples' populations and the studies' protocols. Future studies are needed to focus on the relationship between depression/ anxiety symptoms and malnutrition. A more critical nutritional assessment should be undertaken with multiple psychological assessment scales.

55,Risk factors for suicide attempt in an Arab kindred,"Objective: This explorative study examines correlates of suicidal behavior in an extended Arab kindred selected because of a high rate of suicidal behavior. Methods: Family members (n = 468) aged 15 through 55 were assessed using a comprehensive structured psychiatric interview, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which covers a wide range of psychopathology, including a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In addition, self-reported depression, anxiety, hopelessness, impulsivity and hostility, early childhood adversity, and suicidal behavior in first- and second-degree relatives were assessed. Results: Significant associations were found between suicidal thoughts and behavior, and the presence of family history of suicide, all forms of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors. In addition, impulsivity and hostility were also significantly associated with suicidality. Limitation: The absence of similar assessments in comparison families, makes it difficult to assess why this family appears to be at higher risk for suicidal behavior. Conclusion: Risk correlates of suicidal behavior in the Arab kindred are similar to those reported from other parts of the world. These findings suggest that effective means of suicide prevention used in European populations may be successfully adapted to prevent suicide in this ethnic group as well. Since all forms of suicidal behavior in this population as well as in other Arab populations are increasing rapidly (Karam et al., 2008), these results have important implications for suicide prevention as well as for the understanding of the genetics of suicide.

56,Risk of suicide and mixed episode in men in the postpartum period,"Objectives: To assess suicide risk in men with mood disorders at the postpartum period. Methods: We conduct a longitudinal study with 650 men whose child has born from April 2007 to May 2008 at maternity hospital. The first assessment was in the antenatal period and the second within 30 to 60 days postpartum. Suicide risk, anxiety disorders, hypomanic, manic and mixed episodes were assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: The prevalence of suicide risk in fathers in postpartum was of 4.8%. Fathers with postpartum depression were 20.97 (CI: 5.74; 76.53) more likely to present suicide risk and those with mixed episodes showed a chance of 46.50 (CI: 10.52; 205.53) times higher than those who did not suffer from any mood disorder. Conclusion: Mixed episodes are common in fathers at postpartum, posing a higher suicide risk than depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. Therefore, in order to reduce the suicide risk, clinicians should address and treat adequately mixed affective states in this specific population.

57,Genetic association between &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms and phobic disorders: A case–control study among mainland Han Chinese,"Introduction: Phobic disorders are a common group of syndromes comprising persistently recurring, irrational severe anxiety of specific objects, activities, or situations with avoidance behavior of the phobic stimulus. The present study investigated the association between whole region polymorphisms, (including the Val66Met variant), in the BDNF gene and phobic disorders among Han Chinese young adults. Methods: We conducted a case–control study to investigate the genetic association between BDNF polymorphisms and phobic disorders among mainland Chinese. One hundred and twenty young adults with phobic disorders and 267 matched controls were recruited. Three tag SNPs of BDNF were successfully genotyped by using PCR-based ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR). Results: We found significant differences in allele distributions of SNP rs10835210 ( P &lt; 0.001) between the experimental and the control groups. In the haplotype analysis based on linkage-disequilibrium across this gene locus, we demonstrated significant association between phobic disorders and BDNF haplotype CAC ( P = 0.004). Association was significant after 10⁴ permutation tests ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the BDNF gene may play a significant role in the etiology of phobic disorders in the Han Chinese population.

58,"Age of onset, clinical characteristics, and 15-year course of anxiety disorders in a prospective, longitudinal, observational study","Background: Age of onset is rarely studied in the anxiety disorders literature. The current study examined age of onset as it relates to clinical characteristics and course of anxiety disorders using a prospective, longitudinal, observational design. Methods: Fifteen-year follow-up data were examined for participants with panic disorder with (PDA) or without (PD) agoraphobia, social phobia (SP), and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at baseline. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether age of onset was associated with demographic or clinical variables at baseline. Cox regression analyses were conducted to examine longitudinal course (time to recurrence and recovery, respectively) for each diagnostic group. Results: At baseline, PD participants with early onset (i.e., &lt; age 20) were more likely to have comorbid MDD, GAD, and SP relative to late-onset participants (≥ age 20). For PDA, early-onset participants were less likely to be married, and more likely to have both GAD and SP at baseline. With respect to longitudinal course, earlier onset was associated with an increased likelihood of recurrence in participants with PDA. No other models reached significance. Limitations: The sample sizes for some disorders were comparatively small in relation to PDA, and all participants were treatment-seeking, which may limit generalizability. Conclusions: For some anxiety disorders, earlier age of onset appears to be associated with greater severity and worse course, as evidenced by increased risk of recurrence over 15 years of follow-up. Early interventions focused on children and adolescents may alleviate some of the public health burden associated with anxiety disorders.

59,"Quasi-experimental study on the effectiveness of psychoanalysis, long-term and short-term psychotherapy on psychiatric symptoms, work ability and functional capacity during a 5-year follow-up","Background: Psychotherapy is apparently an insufficient treatment for some patients with mood or anxiety disorder. In this study the effectiveness of short-term and long-term psychotherapies was compared with that of psychoanalysis. Methods: A total of 326 psychiatric outpatients with mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to solution-focused therapy, short-term psychodynamic and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies. Additionally, 41 patients suitable for psychoanalysis were included in the study. The patients were followed from the start of the treatment and assessed 9 times during a 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome measures on symptoms were the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales, and the Symptom Check List, anxiety scale. Primary work ability and functional capacity measures were the Work Ability Index, the Work-subscale of the Social Adjustment Scale, and the Perceived Psychological Functioning Scale. Results: A reduction in psychiatric symptoms and improvement in work ability and functional capacity was noted in all treatment groups during the 5-year follow-up. The short-term therapies were more effective than psychoanalysis during the first year, whereas the long-term therapy was more effective after 3 years of follow-up. Psychoanalysis was most effective at the 5-year follow-up, which also marked the end of the psychoanalysis. Conclusions: Psychotherapy gives faster benefits than psychoanalysis, but in the long run psychoanalysis seems to be more effective. Results from trials, among patients suitable for psychoanalysis and with longer follow-up, are needed before firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders can be drawn.

60,The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in older adults,"Background: Complicated grief is a prolongation of the normal grieving process with distinct characteristics. It impairs mental and physical health and can potentially greatly impact the quality of life of sufferers and their families. The prevalence and characteristics of complicated grief in the general population are currently unclear. The aims of the present study were therefore to evaluate the prevalence of complicated grief in a population-based cohort, examine the overlap between anxiety and depression and identify common bereavement-related and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: Based within the Rotterdam Study, 5741 older adults were evaluated. Complicated grief was assessed with a 17-item Inventory of Complicated Grief. Results: Prevalence within the general population was 4.8%. Current grief was reported by 1089 participants, and of these 277 (25.4%) were diagnosed with complicated grief. Inflated anxiety and depression rates were documented in people with complicated grief, but the vast majority remained free from co-morbidity. Time since bereavement and relationship to deceased, particularly when the source was a spouse or child, were predictive of complicated grief. People with complicated grief were older, had a lower level of education, and more cognitive impairment. Conclusions: The prevalence of complicated grief in older adults in the general population was noteworthy. Several factors were predictive of complicated grief and it was demonstrated as a separate condition to anxiety and depression. These findings highlight the need for prevention, diagnosis and treatment options for older adults with complicated grief and for recognition of complicated grief as a distinct diagnosis.

61,Prevalence and correlates of generalized anxiety disorder among older adults in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurs commonly, with widespread consequences including decreased functioning and wellbeing, and increased consumption of health resources. Notwithstanding its prevalence and impact, knowledge about GAD in older adults is still scarce. Accordingly, the main goals of this study were to estimate the prevalence and analyze the correlates of 12-month DSM-IV GAD in older community-residing adults. Methods: The sample was drawn from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being and consisted of 3035 participants aged between 55 and 85 years, assessed by lay interviewers with the fully-structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Eighty-four participants were diagnosed with GAD, equivalent to a weighted 12-month population prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.0, 3.7). In a multivariate logistic regression model older age (OR = 0.24, p = 0.006), functional limitations (OR = 1.07, p = 0.001), lifetime depression comorbidity (OR = 5.31, p &lt; 0.001), concerns about having a serious illness despite doctor's reassurance (OR = 2.29, p = 0.021), and family history of anxiety or depression (OR = 2.41, p = 0.007) were the most significant predictors of 12-month GAD in older adults. Limitations: This was a cross sectional study, limiting causal inferences. Conclusions: In community-residing older adults GAD is highly prevalent and strongly associated with functional limitations, psychiatric comorbidity and increased medication intake. These findings suggest the need for greater clinical awareness of GAD among older adults.

62,An examination of the structure of posttraumatic stress disorder in relation to the anxiety and depressive disorders,"The nature and structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been the subject of much interest in recent times. This research has been represented by two streams, the first representing a substantive body of work which focuses specifically on the factor structure of PTSD and the second exploring PTSD's relationship with other mood and anxiety disorders. The present study attempted to bring these two streams together by examining structural models of PTSD and their relationship with dimensions underlying other mood and anxiety disorders. PTSD, anxiety and mood disorder data from 989 injury survivors interviewed 3-months following their injury were analyzed using a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to identify the optimal structural model. CFA analyses indicated that the best fitting model included PTSD's re-experiencing (B1–5), active avoidance (C1–2), and hypervigilance and startle (D4–5) loading onto a Fear factor (represented by panic disorder, agoraphobia and social phobia) and the PTSD dysphoria symptoms (numbing symptoms C3–7 and hyperarousal symptoms D1–3) loading onto an Anxious Misery/Distress factor (represented by depression, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder). The findings have implications for informing potential revisions to the structure of the diagnosis of PTSD and the diagnostic algorithm to be applied, with the aim of enhancing diagnostic specificity.

63,Anxiety and depression symptoms in women and men from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum: Parity differences and effects,"This study aimed to investigate both anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum, comparing women and men and first and second-time parents. Methods: A sample of 260 Portuguese couples ( N = 520), first or second-time parents, recruited in an Obstetrics Out-patients Unit, filled in the State-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and the Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters, childbirth, and 3-months postpartum. Results: A decrease in anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum was found in both women and men, as well as in first and second-time parents. Men presented less anxiety and depression symptoms than women, but the same pattern of symptoms over time. Second-time parents showed more anxiety and depression symptoms than first-time parents and a different pattern of symptoms over time: an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms from the 3rd trimester to childbirth was observed in first-time parents versus a decrease in second-time parents. Limitations: The voluntary nature of the participation may have lead to a selection bias; women and men who agreed to participate could be those who presented fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Moreover, the use of self-report symptom measures does not give us the level of possible disorder in participants. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression symptoms diminish from pregnancy to the postpartum period in all parents. Patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms from early pregnancy to 3-months postpartum are similar in women and men, but somewhat different in first and second-time parents. Second-time parents should also be considered while studying and intervening during pregnancy and the postpartum.

64,Costs of depression in Catalonia (Spain),"Objective: To estimate the cost of depression for the adult population in Catalonia (Spain) for 2006. Method: The total adult population of Catalonia for the reference year was close to 6 million. A cross-design synthesis study was conducted, combining “top-down” and “bottom-up” data from secondary data sources, as well as expert opinion (nominal groups). A societal perspective was adopted. Estimates included direct health costs (hospital, primary, specialised and pharmacological care) and the indirect costs derived from the productivity lost due to morbidity and mortality. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for primary and specialised care resource utilisation. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to handle the uncertainty of the unit costs of primary care, specialised care and hospital visits. Results: The total annual cost of depression in Catalonia for 2006 was 735.4 million Euros. Of this figure, 21.2% corresponded to direct costs, including 41 million Euros in primary care (5.6%), 8.1 million Euros in mental health specialised care (1.1%), 5.6 million Euros due to hospitalisation (0.8%) and 101.1 million Euros due to pharmacological care (13.7%); and 78.8% to indirect costs due to productivity loss. 3.7 million work days were lost to temporary disability for depression with a cost of 199.6 million Euros (27.1%), and 353.3 million Euros due to permanent disability (48%). Mortality attributed to suicide accounted for 26.9 million Euros (3.7%). The average annual cost of an adult with depression was close to 1800 Euros. Limitations: The heterogeneity of the data sources, the uncertainty in several estimates (i.e. proportion of psychotropic expenditure attributed to the treatment of depression, suicide rate attributed to depression), and the difficulty in disaggregating anxiety and depressive disorders in a number of databases are study limitations. Conclusions: The burden of depression for the Catalan public health system and society as a whole due to the consumption of resources and, more importantly, the loss of productivity is significant. Inefficiencies may be found in the overuse of pharmaceuticals and in the eligibility criteria of disability for work.

65,The effects of continuous antidepressant treatment during the first 6 months on relapse or recurrence of depression,"Background: To examine whether continuous antidepressant treatment during the first 6 month reduces the risk of relapse/recurrence of depression in South Korea. Methods: We used National Health Insurance Data covering the period from 2001 through 2004. The study population consisted of 117,087 adult patients who received antidepressants after being diagnosed with depression. The continuous antidepressant was defined as evidence of antidepressant prescriptions for 75% of the first 6 months of treatment. Relapse or recurrence during the next 18-month period was defined by evidence of a new episode requiring antidepressant treatment, psychiatric hospitalization, electroconvulsive therapy, emergency department visit or attempted suicide. We compared the relapse/recurrence rate during the 18-month follow-up period in patients receiving continuous treatment and those who discontinued early using a Cox's proportional hazard model. Results: Patients receiving continuous antidepressant treatment experienced a lower risk of relapse/recurrence (Hazard ratio: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.40–0.44). Three or more follow-up visits in the first 3 months also reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence. Factors associated with a significant increase of relapse/recurrence were comorbid medical illness, anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse. The small benefit of SSRIs was appeared only in the early discontinued treatment subgroup, not in the continuous treatment subgroup. Limitations: We were not able to consider the antidepressant utilization pattern. Conclusions: Continuous antidepressant treatment and frequent follow-up visits during the acute phase were associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of relapse or recurrence of depression. Our results provide important evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in South Korea.

66,Factors associated with depression in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Depression is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contributes significantly to a reduced quality of life in PD patients. The determinants of depression in PD are complex and poorly understood. We investigated the factors associated with depression in PD. Methods: PD patients were recruited from Neurology clinics. A validated method was used to screen for a lifetime history of depression. ‘Depressed’ patients were identified by a score of &gt; 6 in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) or by having had prescribed treatment for depression. ‘Never depressed’ patients were recognised by a score of &lt; 5 in the GDS-15 with no signs of a history of depression. A newly developed and validated questionnaire was used to collect other information. Results: Depression was identified in 66% of the 639 PD patients who met the inclusion criteria. Depression was associated with an increased severity of illness as evidenced by higher Unified PD Rating Scale scores and a higher Hoehn and Yahr stage. Other clinical factors associated with disease severity were also more frequently observed in depressed patients. Similar to findings in non-PD samples, depressed PD patients were more likely to have a lower education level, a history of smoking and to regularly use non-aspirin based NSAIDs or analgesics. Comorbidities such as anxiety, memory problems, hallucinations, sleep disturbances and postural hypotension were more common in depressed PD patients. Limitations: To avoid patient exhaustion of over-surveying, some factors within the psychological domain were not examined. Conclusion: Our results provide a focus for future intervention strategies.

67,"Susceptibility genes, social environmental risk factors and their interactions in internalizing disorders among mainland Chinese undergraduates","Background: Analyses of large scale psychiatric epidemiology surveys suggest that common mental disorders can be generalized into two underlying dimensions, internalizing disorders (e.g. depression, and anxiety) and externalizing disorders (e.g. addictions). The present study explores the interactions among the genes (SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA) and selected environment factors (G×E), and gene×gene (G×G) interactions for internalizing disorders in the sample of Chinese university students. Methods: This is a genetic case control study. 259 undergraduates affected with internalizing disorders and 269 healthy controls were included. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the potential environmental risk factors. G×E interactions were analyzed using the method developed by Mukherjee et al. (2008). Analyses of G×G interactions were conducted by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) (Lou et al., 2007). We have previously reported on the polymorphism information for ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on SLC6A4, BDNF, and MAOA genes (Meng et al., 2009; Meng, 2010). Results: We found that an offspring's reported parents' negative mood, subject's unwillingness to express emotion, being an only child, having an unfulfilling relationship with his/her mother, and increased activity and behavior restrictions by his/her father were social environment risk factors for internalizing disorders. No statistically significant interactions were found in the G×E analyses. G×G analyses found that subjects with mutational alleles concurrently on rs10835210 and rs2030324 (BDNF gene) were significantly likely to develop internalizing disorders. Those with one mutated allele on either SNPs were 1.761 times, and those with both mutated alleles were 3.353 times, more likely to develop internalizing disorders. Conclusion: A negative family emotional environment was found to be associated with internalizing disorders. BDNF gene variants were also found to be similarly associated. Using conservative statistical analyses we did not find any G×E interactions.

68,Using the Distress Thermometer and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to screen for psychosocial morbidity in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer,"Background: The Distress Thermometer (DT) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are commonly used within oncology settings. However there is a paucity of research comparing these measures to gold standard structured clinical interviews assessing for clinical disorders. The aim of this study is to establish the sensitivity, specificity and optimal cut-off scores on these measures when compared to a clinical interview. Method: Ninety-nine patients with colorectal cancer completed the DT and HADS and a psychologist-administered gold standard structured clinical interview (the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-CIDI). Receiver Operator Characteristic analyses (ROC) were conducted to establish the optimal cut-off score on the DT and HADS to identify clinical disorders based on the CIDI. Results: Seventeen patients met criteria for a clinical disorder in the sample. A cut-off score of 4 on the DT indicated acceptable sensitivity (60%) and specificity (67%) to detect a current clinical disorder,while the optimal cut-off for the HADS was 10 (sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 72%). The area under the ROC values were 0.66 for the DT (95% CI: 0.51, 0.82) and 0.78 for the HADS (95% CI: 0.67, 0.90). The difference in AUC between the two measures was not statistically significant. Limitations: The limitations to the design and methodology of the study are discussed. Conclusion: The single item DT performed fairly, however not as well as the longer HADS in identifying clinical disorders amongst oncology patients, particularly anxiety disorders.

69,"Confirmation of the factorial structure of temperamental autoquestionnaire TEMPS-A in non-clinical young adults and relation to current state of anxiety, depression and to schizotypal traits","Background: The 39-item TEMPS-A self-rated questionnaire assesses affective temperaments. We examined the factorial structure of its French version in a large sample of young adults and examined the relation to schizotypy, depression and anxiety. Method: University students were enrolled during their mandatory preventive health visit in the University medical facility (n = 3807, 19.9 ± .5 y.o.). They answered to the 39-TEMPS-A questionnaire, the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). We performed an exploratory Factorial Component Analysis (FCA) with varimax rotation of the 39-TEMPS-A in half of the sample, randomly selected, followed by a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in the remaining subsample. TEMPS-A dimensions were correlated to HADS and SPQ sub-scores. Results: A five-factor structure was found by PCA and confirmed by the confirmatory analysis. The scale showed a good internal consistency (whole scale Cronbach's α: 0.83 and from 0.78 to 0.59 for Cyclothymic, Depressive, Irritable , Hyperthymic, Anxious subscales ). Depressive and Anxious TEMPS-A subscales were moderately correlated to HADS Depression and Anxiety subscales (Spearman ρ = 0.37 to 0.33). Cyclothymic and Depressive TEMPS-A subscales were respectively correlated to SPQ Paranoid (ρ= 0.53) and Negative dimensions (ρ = 0.52). Limitation: Representativity of the sample (higher education, response rate). Conclusion: We confirmed the five factor structure of the 39-item TEMPS-A in a large nonclinical population of young adults and found consistent correlations with anxiety—depression state markers and schizotypal traits.

70,Generalized anxiety disorder: Course and risk factors in pregnancy,"Background: There are limited studies of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) across pregnancy. Methods: Women (n = 2793) were enrolled in the Yale Pink and Blue study, a cohort enriched with subjects who suffered from major depressive disorder (MDD) within the past five years or used antidepressants in the past year. Subjects were evaluated with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at three time points: twice in pregnancy and once after delivery. We defined a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) episode as per DSM IV but with required duration reduced to one month or longer. Course and correlates of GAD were examined in women who had: 1) no GAD during the 6 months prior or in pregnancy (Group A), 2) GAD in the 6 months prior to but not in pregnancy (Group B), 3) GAD in pregnancy only (Group C) and 4) GAD both in the 6 months prior to and during pregnancy (Group D). Results: 9.5% of the cohort suffered from GAD at some point in pregnancy. Anxiety symptoms were highest in the first trimester and decreased across pregnancy. Regression analysis revealed that previous GAD episodes, education, social support and a history of child abuse distinguished between membership in the four groups. Limitations: The sample may not be representational, as it was enhanced with those at risk, and had relatively low representation of socio-economically disadvantaged women. Conclusions: Identification of anxious patients during pregnancy may provide an opportunity to engage those in need of psychiatric treatment.

71,The association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and bone mineral density in the general population: The HUNT Study,"Background: Psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method: This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995–1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Results: In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitations: Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss. Conclusions: These results indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are cross-sectionally associated with reduced BMD. These findings provide further evidence to support monitoring BMD in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric illness.

72,Relative impact of Axis I mental disorders on quality of life among adults in the community,"Background: Little is known about the relative impact of different mental disorders on adult quality of life (QOL). This study estimated associations between several mental disorders and QOL in a representative American community sample. Methods: The QOL instrument was administered to 640 adult participants in the Children in the Community Study, a population-based longitudinal study. DSM-Axis I and Axis II mental disorder diagnoses were assessed by psychiatric interview. Results: Poorer QOL was strongly associated with having a mood disorder, especially major depression disorder (MDD) (effect size, ES = −0.57, p &lt; 0.01), whereas poorer quality social relationships were associated with having dysthymia and bipolar disorders (ES = −0.92, p &lt; 0.01; ES = −0.80, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Most anxiety disorders were not independently related to QOL with the exception of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was significantly related to poorer physical health (ES = −0.78, p &lt; 0.01) and psychological well-being (ES = −0.73, p &lt; 0.01) and to less overall QOL (ES = −0.57, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: MDD and PTSD are independently related to impaired QOL and dysthymia and bipolar disorder negatively influence social relationships.

73,Cortical mechanisms of the symptomatology in major depressive disorder: A resting EEG study,"Background: Diagnosis and treatment rely on symptom criteria in modern psychiatry. However, the cortical mechanisms of symptomatology in major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not clear. This study examined neural correlates of symptom clusters of MDD by electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Resting state eye-closed EEG signals were recorded in 196 depressive patients. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) of regional power, coherence and power series correlation across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were used to correlate with overall depression severity evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Further, statistical comparisons between patients with high vs. low qEEG indices (median-split) were undertaken regarding symptom severity of core depression, sleep , activity , psychic anxiety , somatic anxiety , and delusion . Results: None of the qEEG indices significantly correlated with overall depression severity or differentiated symptom severity of core depression , sleep , activity and psychic anxiety . A higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with higher regional power over widespread cortical regions and lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections. A higher symptom severity of delusion was associated with higher regional power in the frontal and temporal regions, and lower strengths at inter-hemispheric (frontal, temporal and parietal) and fronto–temporo-parietal connections. Limitations: Our EEG recording with sampling rate of 128 Hz and 20 electrodes may provide restricted spatial and temporal precision. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cortical mechanisms play important roles in the symptom manifestation of cognitive distortion (sub-score of delusion ) and somatic anxiety in MDD. Our findings further imply that psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety are distinct entities.

74,Comorbidity and risk indicators for alcohol use disorders among persons with anxiety and/or depressive disorders: Findings from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Introduction: This study examines comorbidity of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence as well as its risk indicators among anxious and/or depressed persons, also considering temporal sequencing of disorders. Methods: Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 2329 persons with lifetime DSM-IV anxiety (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia) and/or depressive (major depressive disorder and dysthymia) disorders and 652 controls. Lifetime diagnoses of DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence were established, as well as information about socio-demographic, vulnerability, addiction-related and anxiety/depression-related characteristics. Temporal sequencing of disorders was established retrospectively, using age of onset. Results: Of persons with combined anxiety/depression 20.3% showed alcohol dependence versus 5.5% of controls. Prevalence of alcohol abuse was similar across groups (± 12%). Independent risk indicators for alcohol dependence among anxious and/or depressed persons were male gender, vulnerability factors (family history of alcohol dependence, family history of anxiety/depression, openness to experience, low conscientiousness, being single, and childhood trauma), addiction-related factors (smoking and illicit drug use) and early anxiety/depression onset. Persons with secondary alcohol dependence were more neurotic, more often single and lonelier, while persons with primary alcohol dependence were more often male and more extravert. Discussion: Alcohol dependence, but not abuse, is more prevalent in anxious and/or depressed persons. Persons with comorbid alcohol dependence constitute a distinct subgroup of anxious and/or depressed persons, characterized by addiction-related habits and vulnerability. However, considerable variation in characteristics exists depending on temporal sequencing of disorders. This knowledge may improve identification and treatment of those anxious and/or depressed patients who are additionally suffering from alcohol dependence.

75,Chronic posttraumatic stress and its predictors in patients living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"Introduction: Patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) show clinically relevant depression and anxiety, but little is known about their levels of posttraumatic stress. We assessed chronic posttraumatic stress attributable to a traumatic cardiac event and its predictors in patients at two time points after ICD placement. Methods: We investigated 107 consecutively enrolled patients (57 ± 14 years, 62% men) on average 24 ± 21 months after ICD placement (baseline) and again 41 ± 18 months later (follow-up). All patients completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to self-rate the severity of posttraumatic stress (range 0–110). The 30% of patients with the highest IES-R scores (≥25) at baseline were defined as PTSD cases; the same threshold was applied to define PTSD caseness at follow-up. Results: Posttraumatic stress increased from baseline to follow-up (19 ± 22 vs. 25 ± 19, p &lt; 0.001); 19% of patients had PTSD at both assessments, 12% at baseline only, and 18% at follow-up only. Female gender as well as greater peritraumatic dissociation and depression predicted greater posttraumatic stress at baseline ( p -values ≤ 0.041). Greater baseline posttraumatic stress, helplessness, alexithymia, and ≥ 5 shocks during follow-up all predicted greater posttraumatic stress at follow-up ( p -values ≤ 0.029). Female gender, helplessness, and depression predicted PTSD at baseline ( p -values ≤ 0.022); low education and posttraumatic stress at baseline predicted PTSD at follow-up ( p -values ≤ 0.003). Conclusions: Between 2 and 5.5 years post-ICD placement chronic posttraumatic stress slightly increased and nearly one-fifth of patients had newly developed PTSD. The identified psychological predictors of long-term chronicity of posttraumatic stress might particularly inform behavioral interventions for ICD recipients.

76,Pregnancy and post-partum depression and anxiety in a longitudinal general population cohort: The effect of eating disorders and past depression,"Background: This study investigated the effect of past depression, past and current eating disorders (ED) on perinatal anxiety and depression in a large general population cohort of pregnant women, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Methods: Anxiety and depression were measured during and after pregnancy in 10,887 women using the Crown-Crisp Experiential Inventory and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Women were grouped according to depression and ED history: past ED with ( n = 123) and without past depression ( n = 50), pregnancy ED symptoms with ( n = 77) and without past depression ( n = 159), past depression only ( n = 818) and controls ( n = 9,660). We compared the course of depression and anxiety with linear mixed-effect regression models; and probable depressive and anxiety disorders using logistic regression. Results: Women with both past depression and past/current ED had high anxiety and depression across time perinatally; this was most marked in the group with pregnancy ED symptoms and past depression ( b coefficient:5.1 (95% CI: 4.1–6.1), p &lt; 0.0001), especially at 8 months post-partum. At 18 weeks in pregnancy all women (apart from those with past ED only) had a higher risk for a probable depressive and anxiety disorder compared to controls. At 8 months post-partum pregnancy ED symptoms and/or past depression conferred the highest risk for a probable depressive and anxiety disorder. Limitations: Data were based on self-report. There was some selective attrition. Conclusions: Pregnancy ED symptoms and past depression have an additive effect in increasing the risk for depression and anxiety perinatally. Screening at risk women for anxiety and depression in the perinatal period might be beneficial.

77,Impact of temperament on depression and anxiety symptoms and depressive disorder in a population-based birth cohort,"Background: The aim of this study was to characterize at the population level how innate features of temperament relate to experience of depressive mood and anxiety, and whether these symptoms have separable temperamental backgrounds. Methods: The study subjects were 4773 members of the population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966, a culturally and genetically homogeneous study sample. Temperament was measured at age 31 using the temperament items of the Temperament and Character Inventory and a separate Pessimism score. Depressive mood was assessed based on a previous diagnosis of depressive disorder or symptoms of depression according to the Hopkins Symptom Check List–25. Anxiety was assessed analogously. Results: High levels of Harm avoidance and Pessimism were related to both depressive mood (effect sizes; d = 0.84 and d = 1.25, respectively) and depressive disorder ( d = 0.68 and d = 0.68, respectively). Of the dimensions of Harm avoidance, Anticipatory worry and Fatigability had the strongest effects. Symptoms of depression and anxiety showed very similar underlying temperament patterns. Limitations: Although Harm avoidance and Pessimism appear to be important endophenotype candidates for depression and anxiety, their potential usefulness as endophenotypes, and whether they meet all the suggested criteria for endophenotypes will remain to be confirmed in future studies. Conclusions: Personality characteristics of Pessimism and Harm avoidance, in particular its dimensions Anticipatory worry and Fatigability, are strongly related to symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as to depressive disorder in this population. These temperamental features may be used as dimensional susceptibility factors in etiological studies of depression, which may aid in the development of improved clinical practice.

78,Objective physical functioning in patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders,"Background: Poorer physical function in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders has been reported, but is often measured by self-reports which may be biased by mood. This study examined the association between depression and anxiety and physical function using objective measures in a large cohort, and investigated which psychiatric characteristics are associated with physical function. Methods: Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used, including persons with current depressive and/or anxiety disorders ( n = 1629) and healthy controls without lifetime diagnoses ( n = 629). Psychiatric characteristics studied included type of disorder, duration, severity, age of onset, and antidepressant use. Hand grip strength and lung function were used as general objective measurements of physical function. Results: Women with depressive or anxiety disorders had significantly poorer physical function—both lower grip strength and lung function—compared to healthy controls, especially those with a late age of onset (≥40 years). Poorer lung function was present among the women using antidepressants, those with higher symptom severity, and those with depression compared to anxiety disorder. In men, depressive or anxiety disorder was associated with better lung function but not with hand grip strength. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design no causal relationships could be established. Conclusions: In women, depressive or anxiety disorders were associated with objective indicators of poorer physical function. Since this association was most pronounced for later onset disorders, it suggests a larger role of physical function in depressive and anxiety disorders at later age.

79,Explosive anger in postconflict Timor Leste: Interaction of socio-economic disadvantage and past human rights-related trauma,"Background: Countries emerging from major conflict commonly experience recurrent periods of communal instability. A psychosocial theory, Adaptation and Development after Persecution and Trauma (ADAPT), suggests that experiences of past human rights abuses interact with socio-economic disadvantage in the postconflict period to generate or maintain explosive forms of anger. Previous research has supported a link between trauma exposure and anger but the role of ongoing socio-economic disadvantage requires further clarification. Methods: The present study examined a structural equation model based on cross-sectional epidemiological data (n = 1245) collected in post-conflict Timor Leste in 2004. The model included four trauma dimensions derived from a prior factor analysis; a latent variable of postconflict distress symptoms (derived from measures of PTSD and depression/anxiety); an index of socio-economic distress; and an indigenously-based measure of explosive anger. Results: The final model yielded a good fit (chi-square = 26.59 df = 20 p = 0.15 CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.016). Postconflict distress symptoms mediated the associations of trauma dimensions and socio-economic disadvantage with anger. Trauma dimensions associated with human rights violations and witnessing murder were partly mediated by ongoing socio-economic disadvantage in the path to postconflict distress and anger. Limitations: Longitudinal studies will be needed to confirm the chronological sequencing of these relationships. Conclusions: The study offers empirical support for a link between past trauma related to human rights violations and ongoing socio-economic disadvantage in the path to distress and anger.

80,Disability is already pronounced in young people with early stages of affective disorders: Data from an early intervention service,"Background: Although there is growing recognition that disability emerges early in the course of psychotic disorders, it is unclear whether young people with early stages of anxiety or affective disorders are similarly affected. This study examined patient self-reported disability in young people attending a designated early intervention service. Methods: Cross-sectional study comparing new headspace patients on self-reported measures of disability and distress (Kessler-10, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, and Brief Disability Questionnaire) with clinician-rated diagnosis and clinical stage. Results: Data from 330 participants with an average age of 16.8 years (50.0% male) was analysed and demonstrated high levels of psychological distress and disability in the overall group. Higher levels of self-reported psychological distress and disability were associated with affective disorder diagnosis and increased with advancing clinical stage. Female gender and younger age also predicted affective disorder diagnosis. Limitations: Clinician-rated participant disability was obtained via a single global measure (SOFAS) and not a systematic assessment. Additionally, data collected was cross-sectional and collected at intake only. Longitudinal assessment of clinical features and disability is required to map changes in disability over time. Conclusions: Surprisingly high levels of psychological distress and disability are apparent in young people presenting to early intervention services. Data suggests that distress and disability in those with anxiety is less than for affective disorder. Results also suggest that clinical staging approaches capture the increasing disability associated with illness progression. The obtained results highlight the need for interventions that specifically target disability, rather than just symptoms of mental health problems.

81,Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and self reported depression: An association study from the HUNT,"Background: There is increasing evidence suggesting oxidative stress may play a role in the aetiology of depression. Glutathione is the brain's predominant free radical scavenger, and associated polymorphisms of the glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) gene have been reported for related psychiatric disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate candidate polymorphisms of GCL validated in schizophrenia and their association with current state depression, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Methods: Polymorphisms were genotyped on 983 cases and 967 controls selected from a population sample of adults participating in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study. Cases were the top scoring individuals (98.5th percentile) on the HADS depression subscale while the controls were randomly selected from below this cut-off. The polymorphisms comprised three SNPs from GCLM, the gene encoding the GCL modifier and 9 SNPs plus a trinucleotide repeat (TNTR) from intron 1 and the 5′UTR of GCLC, the gene encoding the GCL catalytic subunit. Using the linkage disequilibrium between the GCLC markers we also tested whether SNPs could represent the variation of the TNTR. Results: The candidate polymorphisms showed no evidence for association with depression. The C allele of SNP rs9474592 is coupled with the 9 GAG repeats allele of the TNTR, r²=0.81. None of the other SNPs either individually or as two or three-SNP haplotypes was associated with the TNTR alleles. Limitations: Depression was self-reported and measured at one time point. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence to suggest that polymorphisms of GCL are associated with self-reported depression.

82,The distressed (type D) personality in both patients and partners enhances the risk of emotional distress in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"Background: A subgroup of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) experiences emotional distress. This may be related to partner factors. We examined the impact of the personality of the partner (i.e., the distressed (Type D) personality) in combination with that of the patient on anxiety and depression levels in ICD patients. Methods: Consecutively implanted ICD patients (N=281; 80.1% men; mean age=58.3±11.0) and their partners (N=281; 20.6% men; mean age=56.5±11.7) completed the Type D Scale at baseline; patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and 6 months post-implantation. Results: ANOVA for repeated measures, using the Type D main effects and the interaction effect, showed that the interaction time by Type D patient by Type D partner was significant (F (1,277) =7.0, p=.009) for depression as outcome, but not for anxiety (F (1,277) =3.1, p=.08). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that Type D patients with a Type D partner (n=23/281, 8.2%) experienced the highest depression levels compared to other personality combinations (all ps&lt;.05). Limitations: The group of Type D patients with a Type D partner was rather small. Conclusions: ICD patients with a Type D personality report more depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, if the partner also has a Type D personality. This may be due to poor communication and lack of emotional support in the relationship. These results emphasize the importance of taking into account the psychological profile of the partner in the management and care of the ICD patient, and to direct behavioural support not only at the ICD patient but also at the partner.

83,"Prevalence of distress, comorbid conditions and well being in the general population","Background: The purposes of this paper are to determine the prevalence of distress in the community, to identify its determinants and to assess its relationship to somatic conditions and subjective well being. Methods: Distress and associated factors were investigated in a random sample of 5000 participants (35–74 years) of a community-based, prospective, observational cohort study in western Mid-Germany (""Gutenberg Heart Study"") between 04/2007 and 10/2008. The sample was stratified 1:1 for gender and residence and in equal strata for decades of age. Data were assessed by self-report instruments, interviews and medical examination. Results: We found a prevalence rate for depression of 7.2% (6.5–8.0%), social anxiety 7.0% (6.3–7.7%), panic 4.6% (4.0–5.2%), generalized anxiety 3.4% (2.9–3.9%), and Type D personality 22.1% (21.0–23.2%). Mental conditions declined by age. Depression was related to diabetes (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.26–3.15), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.79), coronary heart disease (CHD; OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.04–3.39), and the history of stroke (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.02–5.76). Panic was related to the history of myocardial infarction (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.15–5.25), and generalized anxiety to obesity (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.11–2.44). Mental distress was unrelated to hypertension, atrial fibrillation and cancer. In ordinal logistic regression subjective physical and mental well being were associated with anxiety, depression and Type D personality. Conclusions: While mental conditions are highly prevalent, especially depression is associated with several somatic conditions. Mental and physical well being are strongly related to mental conditions. Future work should take into account comorbid conditions when identifying the impact of depression on CHD.

84,Mental health outcome of long-term and episodic adolescent depression: 15-year follow-up of a community sample,"Background: Recent studies have highlighted the unfavourable natural course of chronic/long-term depression. We investigated the adult mental health outcome of adolescent depression, with specific focus on long-term and episodic adolescent major depression (MD). Methods: A community sample of depressed adolescents and non-depressed peers was followed-up with a structured diagnostic interview after 15 years. The participants (n = 382) were divided into five groups depending on their status in adolescence: no depression (n = 155); long-term MD (n = 91); episodic MD (n = 63); dysthymia (n = 33); and subthreshold symptoms (n = 40). Outcomes (age 19–31) included mood disorders, other mental disorders, suicidality, and treatment for mental disorders. Results: The long-term group overall had a poorer outcome than the non-depressed group, with the episodic group in an intermediate position. The outcome of the dysthymic group was similar to that of the long-term group, while the subsyndromal group did not differ markedly from the non-depressed group. The long-term group was more likely than the episodic group to report adult anxiety disorders, multiple mental disorders, suicide attempts, and treatment; they also seemed to develop more persistent adult depressions, with a higher number of recurrent episodes and longer duration of antidepressant treatment. Even after adjustment for adolescent factors of clinical and etiological importance, the long-term group had a markedly less favourable outcome than the episodic group. Limitation: The participation rate at follow-up was 64.6%. Conclusion: Longstanding depression in adolescence is a powerful predictor of continued mental health problems in adulthood. It is now important to evaluate if early interventions can alter this severe course.

85,"Towards parenthood: An antenatal intervention to reduce depression, anxiety and parenting difficulties","Background: There have been few antenatal interventions aimed at preparing women for the transition to parenthood and previous attempts to intervene antenatally to prevent postnatal depression and anxiety have had limited impact. Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of an antenatal intervention which targeted risk factors for poor postnatal adjustment, with the dual aim of reducing both postnatal symptoms of depression/anxiety and parenting difficulties (a nine-unit self-guided workbook with weekly telephone support). Based on an initial feasibility study ( n = 200) which confirmed a low level of help-seeking among distressed women during pregnancy, an additional community networking component was developed aimed at increasing social support and access to health professionals to facilitate treatment of current antenatal depression/anxiety, if present. In the evaluation of a second version of the intervention, pregnant women ( n = 143) were randomly allocated to receive either the intervention or routine care. Results: Following the antenatal intervention there were significantly fewer cases scoring above threshold for mild-to-severe depression/anxiety symptoms postnatally compared to routine care, along with a trend towards reduced parenting stress. The community networking component appeared helpful and women with higher baseline depression scores showed higher levels of help-seeking in both intervention and routine care groups. Limitations: It was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of individual program components separately. Conclusions: The findings provide support for the effectiveness of the Towards Parenthood intervention both as a preparation for parenthood program and in reducing symptoms of postnatal depression/anxiety.

86,Prevalence of episodes of mania and hypomania and associated comorbidities among young adults,"Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of episodes of mania and hypomania, as well as associated factors and comorbidities among adults 18 to 24 years old in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Method: This is a cross-sectional population-based study. The sample was selected through conglomerates, and episodes of mania and hypomania were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric. Results: The sample consisted of 1560 subjects. The lifetime prevalence of manic and hypomanic episodes was 7.5% and 5.3%, respectively. Subjects with (hypo)manic episodes had a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, substance abuse and suicidality. Limitation: The high rate of (hypo)mania may to some extent reflect diagnostic error. Conclusion: Such high prevalence of (hypo)mania may nonetheless be valid as it was associated with corresponding rates of comorbidity and suicidality.

87,High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as an augmenting strategy in severe treatment-resistant major depression: A prospective 4-week naturalistic trial,"Background: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have found repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to be effective for major depression, but its usefulness as an augmenting strategy for severe treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has yet to be firmly established. Methods: In a naturalistic trial, 15 chronically depressed, severely treatment-resistant patients were treated with daily high frequency (HF) rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4 weeks as an augmenting strategy. Depressive and anxious symptoms (both subjective and objective), as well as quality of life (QOL) domains were measured pre-post rTMS treatment. Results: Pre-post rTMS comparisons revealed significant reductions of both clinician-rated and selfreport depression and anxiety measures and increases in three (out of five) domains of subjective QOL (i.e., global, physical, and psychological). Limitations: Small sample size and non-controlled design. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HF rTMS, when used as an augmenting strategy, positively affects depressive and anxious symptoms as well as QOL in patients with severe TRD. However, further studies with larger samples and controlled designs are needed to better clarify our preliminary findings.

88,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs cognitive behaviour therapy as a treatment for non-melancholic depression,"Aim: To examine the comparative effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) as treatments for non-melancholic depression. Method: Participants who met criteria for a current episode of major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBCT (n = 19) or CBT (n = 26) group therapy condition. They were assessed at pre-treatment, 8-week post-group, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Results: There were significant improvements in pre- to post-group depression and anxiety scores in both treatment conditions and no significant differences between the two treatment conditions. However, significant differences were found when participants in the two treatment conditions were dichotomized into those with a history of four or more episodes of depression vs those with less than four. In the CBT condition, participants with four or more previous episodes of depression demonstrated greater improvements in depression than those with less than four previous episodes. No such differences were found in the MBCT treatment condition. No significant differences in depression or anxiety were found between the two treatment conditions at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Limitations: Small sample sizes in each treatment condition, especially at follow-up. Conclusions: MBCT appears to be as effective as CBT in the treatment of current depression. However, CBT participants with four or more previous episodes of depression derived greater benefits at 8-week post-treatment than those with less than four episodes.

89,The relationship between physical conditions and suicidal behavior among those with mood disorders,"Background: There has recently been increased interest in the relationship between physical illness, mental illness, and suicide. The present study utilizes a large community-based sample to investigate the association between certain physical conditions and suicidal behavior, among those with a history of a mood disorder. Methods: Data came from the nationally representative German Health Survey (N = 4181, age 18–65). Physical conditions were assessed by a general practice physician. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Among those with a lifetime mood disorders, suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between physical conditions and suicidal behavior among those with a history of mood disorder. Results: Anxiety and substance use disorders were significantly positively associated with suicidal behavior [OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13–2.31 and 2.01, 95% 1.34–3.00, respectively]. After adjusting for anxiety and substance use disorders as well as sociodemographic variables, respiratory illness, hypertension, and number of physical disorders were significantly associated with suicidal behavior [AORs 1.72, 1.68, and 1.16, respectively]. Limitations: The findings of this study are limited to adults with a history of a mood disorder. Personality disorders were not assessed. Conclusion: The present study suggests that among people with mood disorder, respiratory illnesses, hypertension, and number of physical conditions are associated with suicidal behavior independent of the effects of comorbid mental illness. Clinicians should recognize the contributing risk of physical health problems to suicidal behavior.

90,Clinical correlates of eating disorder comorbidity in women with bipolar disorder type I,"Objective: To report on the presence of current and lifetime eating disorders (ED) in a well-defined sample of 137 female individuals with bipolar disorder type I. Methods: Trained psychiatrists interviewed the patients, and the diagnoses of BD and comorbidities were confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Axis I Disorders. Clinical and demographic characteristics of both groups (group with ED vs. group without ED) were compared. Results: Female patients with ED had an earlier onset of BD and an increased number of mood episodes, predominantly depressive. Women in the ED group also had higher rates of comorbidity with substance use disorders and anxiety disorders and reported a history of suicide attempts more frequently than women without ED. Conclusion: The presence of ED is a correlate of severity of BD type I, and interventions should be developed to minimize distress and suicide risk and to improve treatment outcome.

91,Childhood CBCL bipolar profile and adolescent/young adult personality disorders: A 9-year follow-up,"Background: To assess the late adolescent psychiatric outcomes associated with a positive Child Behavior Checklist-Juvenile Bipolar Disorder Phenotype (CBCL-JBD) in children diagnosed with ADHD and followed over a 9-year period. Methods: Parents of 152 children diagnosed as ADHD (ages 7–11years) completed the CBCL. Ninety of these parents completed it again 9 years later as part of a comprehensive evaluation of Axis I and II diagnoses as assessed using semi-structured interviews. As previously proposed, the CBCL-JBD phenotype was defined as T-scores of 70 or greater on the Attention Problems, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Results: The CBCL-JBD phenotype was found in 31% of those followed but only 4.9% of the sample continued to meet the phenotype criteria at follow-up. Only two of the sample developed Bipolar Disorder by late adolescence and only one of those had the CBCL-JBD profile in childhood. The proxy did not predict any Axis I disorders. However, the CBCL-JBD proxy was highly predictive of later personality disorders. Limitations: Only a subgroup of the original childhood sample was followed. Given this sample was confined to children with ADHD, it is not known whether the prediction of personality disorders from CBCL scores would generalize to a wider community or clinical population. Conclusions: A positive CBCL-JBD phenotype profile in childhood does not predict Axis I Disorders in late adolescence; however, it may be prognostic of the emergence of personality disorders.

92,Recognition and subsequent treatment of patients with sub-threshold symptoms of depression in primary care,"Background: Non-psychiatric physicians are better at correctly ruling out depressive disorders than appropriately recognising them. However, given large numbers of non-depressed patients, a small percentage of false positives equates to a greater number of patients than the number of depressed patients that GPs fail to detect. Concern thus arises that substantial numbers of patients with falsely identified depression may receive inappropriate interventions. Methods: Unselected GP consulters were screened with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). GPs' perceptions of depression were independently rated on an ICD-10 scale. Case records were reviewed. Analysis related to participants with HADS-D&lt;8. Data were assessed of 660 participants with sub-threshold symptoms. Factors were assessed according to GP ratings. Results: GP perceived depression in false positive cases were more likely at index visit, to have a mental health presenting problem (OR = 6.74 (95% CI = 3.21, 14.16); receive antidepressant prescriptions (OR 3.79 (95% CI = 1.69, 8.49) and have greater severity of HADS-D score (OR 1.18 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.38). Subthreshold cases that GPs identified as depressed, more often had a recording, over subsequent six months, of: depressive symptoms (16 (35%) versus 26 (7%), p &lt; 0.001); antidepressant prescriptions (11 (24%) versus 25 (7%), p = 0.001); and Community Mental Health Team referrals (4 (9%) versus 1 (&lt;1%), p = 0.001). They also consulted GPs more frequently than those not identified (median = 5 (IQR 2.8, 6.3) versus median = 3 (IQR = 2, 5), p = 0.004 over six months. Limitations: The HADS is not a diagnostic tool. Conclusions: GPs' diagnoses of depressive disorder in patients with sub-threshold symptoms were appropriate. Interventions offered to this group were consistent with documented previous histories.

93,Occupational impairment and social anxiety disorder in a sample of primary care patients,"Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the second most prevalent psychiatric condition in the US. Because of the inherent nature of SAD, it may cause impairments in workplace functioning, particularly compared to other anxiety disorders that do not necessarily lead to social impairments. In this study, we compared workplace functioning in primary care patients with SAD to patients with other anxiety disorders and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Data are obtained from the Primary Care Anxiety Project (PCAP), a naturalistic, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in 539 primary care patients. We examined intake demographic and interviewer-assessed ratings of workplace functioning. Results: Results revealed that patients with SAD and MDD had significantly decreased workplace functioning, compared to individuals with other anxiety disorders. Furthermore, results showed that patients with SAD were greater than two-times more likely to be unemployed, but expected to work, than all other patients. Limitations: Workplace functioning was not measured objectively and the sample may not be representative of the general population. Conclusions: These findings highlight the particular need to assess for the presence of undereducation and underperformance at work and/or underemployment in individuals with SAD, as they are at most risk for these impairments. Additionally, early detection and intervention in individuals with or at risk for SAD may curb the future impact of social anxiety on occupational attainment.

94,Biased emotional recognition in depression: Perception of emotions in music by depressed patients,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder, that impairs a person's social skills and also their quality of life. Populations affected with depression also suffer from a higher mortality rate. Depression affects person's ability to recognize emotions. We designed a novel experiment to test the hypothesis that depressed patients show a judgment bias towards negative emotions. Methods: To investigate how depressed patients differ in their perception of emotions conveyed by musical examples, both healthy (n = 30) and depressed (n = 79) participants were presented with a set of 30 musical excerpts, representing one of five basic target emotions, and asked to rate each excerpt using five Likert scales that represented the amount of each one of those same emotions perceived in the example. Results: Depressed patients showed moderate but consistent negative self-report biases both in the overall use of the scales and their particular application to certain target emotions, when compared to healthy controls. Also, the severity of the clinical state (depression, anxiety and alexithymia) had an effect on the self-report biases for both positive and negative emotion ratings, particularly depression and alexithymia. Limitations: Only musical stimuli were used, and they were all clear examples of one of the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger and tenderness. No neutral or ambiguous excerpts were included. Conclusions: Depressed patients' negative emotional bias was demonstrated using musical stimuli. This suggests that the evaluation of emotional qualities in music could become a means to discriminate between depressed and non-depressed subjects. The practical implications of the present study relate both to diagnostic uses of such perceptual evaluations, as well as a better understanding of the emotional regulation strategies of the patients.

95,Mexican migration experiences to the US and risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms,"Background: Scant and contradictory information prevails on the risk for common psychiatric disorders in Mexican immigrants to the United States (US). Extension of these results in larger samples is needed to better address treatment needs. This study investigates the association between migration to the US and development of depressive and anxiety symptoms in four urban areas of Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional survey in 2005 of individuals ages 12–65 from four cities formed a representative sample. Immigration-related experiences and prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were recorded. Respondents were classified into three groups: (i) ‘return migrants’, (ii) ‘relatives of migrants’ and (iii) ‘non-migrants’ in the general population. Depression symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and anxiety was determined using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were estimated as the proportion of the entire sample reporting the outcome. Crude and adjusted OR's were estimated in logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1630 respondents, represent a 70.5% response rate. Overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were both approximately 16%. Increased risk for depressive symptoms (OR = 1.49 CI 95% = 1.01–2.20) among return migrants and depressive (OR = 1.48, CI 95% = 1.07–2.05) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.38, CI 95% = 1.08–1.78) in relatives of migrants was found in comparison to those without a migration experience. Limitations: Specific age and timing of migration experiences were not recorded. Conclusions: Migration experiences produce important levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms that could be linked to psychopathology.

96,"Risk of placental abruption in relation to maternal depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms","Background: Little is known about the influence of psychiatric factors on the etiology of placental abruption (PA), an obstetrical condition that complicates 1–2% of pregnancies. We examined the risk of PA in relation to maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: This case–control study included 373 PA cases and 368 controls delivered at five medical centers in Lima, Peru. Depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to calculate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Depressive symptoms of increasing severity (using the DASS depression subscale) was associated with PA ( p for trend = 0.02). Compared with women with no depressive symptoms, the aOR (95%CI) for PA associated with each level of severity of depression symptoms based on the DASS assessment were as follows: mild 1.84 (0.91–3.74); moderate 1.25 (0.67–2.33); and severe 4.68 (0.98–22.4). The corresponding ORs for mild, moderate, and moderately severe depressive symptoms based on the PHQ assessment were 1.10 (0.79–1.54), 3.31 (1.45–7.57), and 5.01 (1.06–23.6), respectively. A positive gradient was observed for the odds of PA with severity of anxiety ( p for trend = 0.002) and stress symptoms ( p for trend = 0.002). Limitations: These cross-sectionally collected data may be subject to recall bias. Conclusions: Maternal psychiatric disorders may be associated with an increased occurrence of AP. Larger studies that allow for more precise evaluations of maternal psychiatric health in relation to PA risk are warranted.

97,Childhood history of behavioral inhibition and comorbidity status in 256 adults with social phobia,"Background: Behavioral inhibition (BI), a heritable temperament, predisposes one to an increased risk of social phobia. Recent investigations have reported that BI may also be a precursor to anxiety as well as depressive and alcohol-related disorders, which are frequently comorbid with social phobia. In the present study, we explored the relationship between BI and psychiatric disorders in 256 adults with a primary diagnosis of social phobia. Methods: BI severity was retrospectively assessed with the Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition (RSRI). The severity of social phobia and the presence of comorbid diagnoses were evaluated with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Results: The RSRI score was significantly and positively correlated with both the LSAS score and the occurrence of a major depressive disorder. No significant association was found with other anxiety and substance-related disorders. Limitation: The assessment of BI was retrospective and self-reported. Conclusion: A childhood history of BI was associated with an increased risk of depressive comorbidity in social phobia.

98,Personal and perceived depression stigma in Australian adolescents: Magnitude and predictors,"Background: Depression stigma has been identified as a barrier to help-seeking in adolescents. This study aimed to examine and compare levels of personal and perceived depression stigma amongst Australian adolescents and to identify predictors of these constructs. Methods: A total of 1,375 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( M = 14.34) completed the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) and a number of other sociodemographic and symptom scale measurements as part of the pre-intervention questionnaire of the YouthMood Project. Results: Levels of perceived stigma ( M = 20.53, SD = 5.06) were significantly higher than levels of personal stigma ( M = 14.48, SD = 5.28). Higher personal stigma was predicted by being male ( p &lt; .001), younger ( p = .01), living with both parents ( p = .02), having no history of depression ( p &lt; .001), having no history of parental depression ( p &lt; .01), speaking English as a second language ( p &lt; .001), lower levels of mastery ( p &lt; .01), and higher levels of alcohol consumption ( p &lt; .001) and perceived stigma ( p &lt; .001). Higher perceived stigma was predicted by being female ( p = .02), having a history of parental depression ( p = .05), and higher levels of anxiety ( p &lt; .001) and personal stigma ( p &lt; .001). Limitations: Participants completed a self-report cross-sectional survey, which does not allow temporal relationships to be drawn. Conclusions: Stigmatising attitudes are common amongst the adolescent population. The identified predictors of stigma should be considered in the development of future community campaigns to reduce stigma in adolescents.

99,Improvement within 2 weeks and later treatment outcomes in patients with depressive disorders: The CRESCEND study,"Background: Although antidepressants are conventionally given for 4–6 weeks before deciding on response, several reports suggest that early improvement predicts later outcomes. In a naturalistic national cohort study, we sought to investigate the predictive value of early improvement on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score for later outcomes (depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s) and functioning (SOFAS)), as well as socio-demographic and clinical correlates of early improvement. Methods: Participants were recruited from 18 hospitals across South Korea. All met DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders, scored ≥14 on the HAMD and received antidepressant treatment for up to 12 weeks. Treatment was naturalistic in that each clinician freely decided the types, doses, and regimes of antidepressant and concomitant medications. Early improvement was defined as a reduction in HAMD score of ≥20% compared with baseline within 2 weeks of treatment. Later treatment outcomes were measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: In a recruited sample of 568 patients, early improvement predicted 12 week treatment outcomes with high sensitivity and high negative predictive values. The predictive values for HAMD and HAMA 12-week responses were higher compared to CGI-s and SOFAS responses. Early improvement was associated with higher monthly income, baseline lower anxiety and higher functioning levels. The patients with early improvement more frequently received antidepressant monotherapy. Limitations: The study was observational, and the treatment modality was naturalistic. Conclusions: Early antidepressant improvement strongly predicted later outcomes, and was associated with higher income, lower anxiety, and higher function.

100,CBT for pharmacotherapy non-remitters—A systematic review of a next-step strategy,"Background: Non-remission rates to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders are related to higher relapse rates, decreased quality of life and greater functional impairment. Here we sought to investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as a next-step strategy in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit after a pharmacological intervention. Method: We carried out a systematic review in the ISI, Pubmed and PsycINFO/PsychLit databases. Studies that did not use CBT and that did not focus on resistance to drug therapy were excluded. We considered resistant patients who failed to respond (did not fully remit) to an adequate trial of pharmacotherapy and still exhibited residual symptoms of anxiety disorder. Results: We identified 603 references in our survey, of which 17 were included: eight were on OCD, five on panic disorder, and four on PTSD. No studies were found on social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. We observed a lack of standardization of terminology and of definitions of resistance, which makes comparison of results difficult. Finally, all of the identified studies showed benefits from the addition of CBT as a next-step strategy. Limitations: A limited number of randomized controlled studies were found. Conclusions: CBT seems to be a promising next-step strategy for patients with anxiety disorders who did not remit with drug-based therapies. However, further clinical trials with strong methodological designs are needed to definitely establish its efficacy in this population.

101,Obstetric and perinatal outcomes among women with blood- and injection phobia during pregnancy,"Background: Little is known about how anxiety disorders affect pregnancy outcomes. Therefore we investigated the impact of one anxiety disorder, blood- and injection phobia, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: From a population-based prospectively collected cohort we compared an index group of 110 women with blood- and injection phobia with a control group of 220 women. Standardized medical records were used to collect data. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes e.g. elective cesarean, prematurity, and small for gestational age were used as the main outcome measures. Results: Women with blood- and injection phobia stated more often a fear of childbirth (p &lt; 0.001) and were more frequently delivered by elective cesarean section (p = 0.032). The incidence of premature delivery (p = 0.028), neonatal morbidity (p = 0.001) and the risk of having a baby born small for gestational age (p = 0.009) was higher among women with blood-and injection phobia. Limitations: The medical records, from which all information is drawn, despite standardization, sometimes may lack some information. However, this dilemma exists in both groups. Conclusions: Women with an anxiety disorder such as blood- and injection phobia are at increased risk for adverse obstetric outcomes, premature delivery and for having a baby born with higher neonatal morbidity. It therefore seems important to identify and treat women with anxiety disorders without delay early during pregnancy in an effort to minimize risks of complications for the woman herself and the child.

102,Risk factors for chronic depression—A systematic review,"Background: One of five patients with an acute depressive episode develops chronic depression. Risk factors for a current depressive episode to become chronic are insufficiently known. This review was conducted to examine which factors represent a risk factor for the development of chronic depression for patients diagnosed with a depressive episode. Method: Medline, Psycinfo, ISI Web of Science, CINHAL and BIOSIS Previews were searched up until September 2007, complemented by handsearching in the December 1987 to December 2007 issues of Journal of Affective Disorders and investigating reference lists of included articles and existing reviews. On the basis of a formal checklist, two investigators independently decided which studies to include or exclude. Results: 25 relevant primary studies with a total of 5192 participants were included in the systematic review. Overall the methodological quality of the included studies was found to be sufficient. Data synthesis was performed via vote counting. The following risk factors were identified: younger age at onset , longer duration of depressive episode , and family history of mood disorders . Psychological comorbidity i.e. anxiety disorders , personality disorders and substance abuse , low level of social integration , negative social interaction and lower severity of depressive symptoms repeatedly appeared concurrently with chronic depression. Limitations: Most included studies were cross-sectional thus drawing causal conclusions with regard to risk factors proved to be difficult. Conclusion: Risk factors for a current depressive episode to become chronic were identified. To date only few significant longitudinal studies on this topic are available.

103,The functional Val¹⁵⁸Met polymorphism in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is associated with depression and motivation in men from a Swedish population-based study,"Background: Environmental risk factors together with genetic vulnerability create a complex background to develop depression. Methods: We investigated the associations between COMT Val¹⁵⁸Met and depression in a Swedish population-based sample of 405 depressed individuals (major depression diagnosis, dysthymia or mixed anxiety depression defined according to DSM-IV) and 2,151 healthy controls. We also analyzed interaction between this genetic variation and some environmental risk factors for depression and the link between this polymorphism and the low motivational level and negative mood state found in depressed individuals. Results: Depressed individuals displayed a higher frequency of the Met/Met and Met/Val genotypes compared to controls (OR = 1.49, CI 95% = 1.11–2.00, P = 0.009). The association was found among men only (OR = 2.26, CI 95% = 1.26–4.05, p = 0.008). Regression analysis including some potential risk factors for depression, did further indicate that Met/Met and Met/Val were associated with depression in men (P = 0.005). There was also an interaction between genotype and family childhood problems (RERI = 0.876, CI 95% = 0.090–1.662 and AP = 0.426, CI 95% = 0.030–0.821). Further, depressed men homozygous for the Val-allele, had a higher motivational level than depressed men with a Met-variant (P = 0.02). Limitations: The sample size of depressed individuals per group when stratifying cases according to gender and genotypes is considered a limitation. Conclusions: The Met-variants of COMT Val158Met are risk variants for depression and low motivational level in depressed Swedish men, but not women. Individuals with this risk variant in combination with a problematic childhood, have an even higher risk to develop depression.

104,Antenatal anxiety disorder as a predictor of postnatal depression: A longitudinal study,"Previous research has implicated high levels of antenatal anxiety as a predictor of postnatal depression, but there is a paucity of evidence on the relationship between the various forms of anxiety and postnatal depression. A longitudinal study of 246 mothers (56 with antenatal generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), 68 with antenatal generalised social phobia, 28 with both disorders in the antenatal period, and 94 with no antenatal GAD or social phobia) allowed us to explore whether antenatal social phobia and GAD predict high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores (probable depression N12) at 10–14 days, 10–12 weeks, 10 months, 14 months, and 24 months postnatally. We found that, after accounting for the presence of other antenatal anxiety disorders, antenatal depression, maternal age at child's birth, socioeconomic status and ethnicity in the models, antenatal GAD independently predicted depression at all time points after delivery. A less robust relationship was found for antenatal social phobia, which predicted postnatal depression at only 10 months after birth. One possibility consistent with our findings is that there may be differences in the timing of postnatal depression with different forms of antenatal anxiety disorders.

105,Subthreshold anxiety better defined by symptom self-report than by diagnostic interview,"Background: There is no consensus on how to define subthreshold anxiety. Based on functional impairment, we aim to evaluate the use of a diagnostic instrument and an anxiety severity questionnaire to derive an empirical cut-off for defining clinically relevant, subthreshold anxiety. Methods: Our sample consisted of 1788 subjects without full-syndromal anxiety disorders from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We used ANCOVA to compare the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in their association with functional impairment, measured by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS II). The BAI was selected over the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) for its highest associations with anxiety disorders. ROC analysis determined the percentage of functionally impaired with subthreshold anxiety based on found cut-offs. Results: The CIDI was very modestly associated with functional impairment, possibly because of skip rules, wording or scoring, while the BAI was highly correlated to functional impairment. A score of 11 on the BAI defined clinically relevant subthreshold anxiety. This cut-off identified 36.0% of the most functionally impaired as having subthreshold anxiety. Limitations: No “natural” cut-off on the BAI for determining subthreshold anxiety could be determined. The cut-off point of 11, based on a large effect size relative to normal anxiety, thus remains somewhat arbitrary. Conclusions: The questionnaire BAI is more suitable than the interview CIDI to measure clinically relevant, subthreshold anxiety. The BAI score of 11 appeared to be the most appropriate cut-off for identifying clinically relevant subthreshold anxiety.

106,A pharmaco-epidemiological study of migraine and antidepressant medications: Complete one year data from the Norwegian population,"Background: Migraine, depression and anxiety disorders have been associated with one another in several epidemiological studies. However, it is not known if or how these associations are reflected in the concurrent use of medications for migraine and depressive/anxiety disorders in the general population. The purpose of the present study was to identify groups of patients particularly likely to receive clinical treatment for both conditions. Methods: Data from the Norwegian Prescription Database for 2006 were analysed for the purpose of ascertaining concurrence of prescriptions for migraine and depression/anxiety disorders. Data were subjected to analysis testing deviation from unity for the OR performed by a chi-square test. Results: In the total Norwegian population ( N = 4640219) migraine drugs were prescribed to 81225 persons (1.8% of the population), antidepressant drugs to 257700 persons (5.6% of the population), and 11269 persons were prescribed both types of drugs. The prescription of antidepressants was significantly increased in patients receiving a prescription for a medication used to treat migraine (OR = 2.82 (95% CI = 2.76–2.88); chi-square p &lt; 0.001), and this association was stronger for men than for women. Teenage women carried the highest risk for this co-morbid constellation (OR = 3.89 CI = 3.17–4.77); chi-square p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study revealed a strong positive association between the prescription of migraine and antidepressant medications, and this association was generally most pronounced in men. However, teenage girls carried the highest risk of receiving both kinds of prescriptions, suggesting particular attentiveness is required in the clinical management of these patients.

107,In the company of my sisters: Sister circles as an anxiety intervention for professional African American women,"Background: Sister circles have been used within African American communities to raise awareness about physical health. The possibility exists that sister circles could be used to educate and teach women strategies about managing anxiety and panic. In this paper we examine professional Black women's conceptualization of panic attacks and other related anxiety issues. Then, we explore the feasibility of sister circles as a psycho-educational anxiety intervention for African American professional women. Methods: Four focus groups ( n = 37) were conducted. Focus group interviews were transcribed and were coded into three categories: (a) a major theme; (b) a minor theme; or (c) an off-topic comment. Specifically, we generate information regarding the key content and research components of a sister circle for African American female professionals. Results: Focus group members saw a distinct difference between anxiety and panic. The number of African American women who experienced was seen as low. Women felt sister circles were a nice vehicle for helping African American women manage their anxiety and panic. Confidentially was a key component. Sister circles for anxiety and panic were seen as a natural outgrowth of African American women's professional networks. Limitations: Limited data were collected on participant's anxiety levels. Conclusions: Overall, sister circles were seen as feasible interventions for African American professional women. The data from the focus groups were used to enhance the development of a sister circle intervention for anxious professional African American women.

108,Major depression is associated with impaired processing of emotion in music as well as in facial and vocal stimuli,"Background: The processing of emotional stimuli is thought to be negatively biased in major depression. This study investigates this issue using musical, vocal and facial affective stimuli. Methods: 23 depressed in-patients and 23 matched healthy controls were recruited. Affective information processing was assessed through musical, vocal and facial emotion recognition tasks. Depression, anxiety level and attention capacity were controlled. Results: The depressed participants demonstrated less accurate identification of emotions than the control group in all three sorts of emotion-recognition tasks. The depressed group also gave higher intensity ratings than the controls when scoring negative emotions, and they were more likely to attribute negative emotions to neutral voices and faces. Limitations: Our in-patient group might differ from the more general population of depressed adults. They were all taking anti-depressant medication, which may have had an influence on their emotional information processing. Conclusions: Major depression is associated with a general negative bias in the processing of emotional stimuli. Emotional processing impairment in depression is not confined to interpersonal stimuli (faces and voices), being also present in the ability to feel music accurately.

109,Prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in 875 patients with bipolar disorder,"Objective: Relatively little is known about the co-occurrence of bipolar and eating disorders. We therefore assessed the prevalence and clinical correlates of eating disorders in 875 patients with bipolar disorder. Method: 875 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder were evaluated with structured diagnostic interviews and clinician- and self-administered questionnaires to determine bipolar and eating disorder diagnoses, other comorbid Axis I disorder diagnoses, and demographic and historical illness characteristics. Results: 125 (14.3%) patients met DSM-IV criteria for at least one comorbid lifetime Axis I eating disorder, with binge eating disorder (N = 77) being more common than bulimia nervosa (n = 42) and anorexia nervosa (N = 27). There were no significant eating disorder comorbidity differences between bipolar I and bipolar II patients. Presence of a lifetime comorbid eating disorder was associated with female gender, younger age, earlier age of onset of mood symptoms and of bipolar disorder, presentation in a mixed episode, greater number of prior mood episodes, history of rapid cycling and suicide attempts, greater mean BMI, obesity and severe obesity, and family history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, and drug abuse. When the three eating disorder groups were compared, lifetime anorexia nervosa was associated with normal weight and a lifetime anxiety disorder, lifetime bulimia nervosa was associated with overweight, and lifetime binge eating disorder was associated with obesity and severe obesity. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder, especially women, not infrequently have comorbid eating disorders, and this comorbidity is associated with an earlier age of onset and more severe course of bipolar illness.

110,Validity of the GAD-7 scale as an outcome measure of disability in patients with generalized anxiety disorders in primary care,"Objective: To explore the validity of the GAD-7 scale as an outcome measure of disability in primary care. Methods: A random sample of 212 subjects was recruited in primary care clinics; 50% diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by DSM-IV criteria and 50% concurrent matched controls. The GAD-7, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the abridged 12-item version of World Health Organization Disability Scale (WHO-DAS-II) were administered. The number of visits to primary care and specialty clinics was also recorded. Results: Strong and significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlations were found between GAD-7 and HAM-A (r = 0.852) and WHO-DAS-II (r = 0.704) scores, particularly for Participation in Society (r = 0.741), Understanding and Communication (r = 0.679), and Life Activities (0.638) dimensions. Moderate but significant correlations were also found between GAD-7 score and the number of visits to Primary Care (r = 0.393) and Specialty clinics (r = 0.373). In all cases, an overall relation was observed between GAD-7 severity levels and disability scores [F (3,208) = 25.4, p &lt; 0.001] as assessed by the WHO-DAS II, with higher mean disability values related to higher severity levels. Conclusions: The GAD-7 scale has been shown to highly correlate not only with specific anxiety but also with disability measures. It has been shown that more severe GAD levels correlate with higher disability states and tend to demand more health care attention. As the GAD-7 is self-administered and is not time consuming, this instrument could be a good choice to explore the level of patient disability in subjects with GAD in primary care settings.

111,Fibromyalgia syndrome and depressive symptoms: Comorbidity and clinical correlates,"Objective: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and higher pain perception in specific anatomic sites called tender points. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with psychiatric symptoms, like depression and anxiety; indeed some authors have argued about the possibility to classify this syndrome into affective spectrum disorder. Few studies have analyzed the impact of depressive symptoms on pain threshold. This research is aimed at evaluating the prevalence and the clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in fibromyalgic patients, and investigating their impact on pain perception and quality of life. Methods: Outpatients between 18 and 75 years with diagnosis of fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology have been included. All subjects have been evaluated with the following rating scales: HAM-D; VAS (to quantify pain); a visual analogical scale to evaluate quality of life; and Paykel's List of Recent Life Events. Results: Thirty subjects have been recruited. Most patients (83.3%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms as indicated by a HAM-D score &gt; 7. Depressive symptoms are associated with higher pain perception, worse quality of life and more severe life events. Conclusion: The presence of depressive symptoms is associated with a great impairment in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome: indeed the psychiatric comorbidity lowers pain threshold and worsens the quality of life of our patients. Future studies should be conducted in order to identify the individual factors, e.g. stress or inflammatory processes, which drive the association between depression and higher severity of fibromyalgia syndrome.

112,Aripiprazole: A clinical review of its use for the treatment of anxiety disorders and anxiety as a comorbidity in mental illness,"Background: Although anxiety disorders are common, optimal treatment is elusive. More than half of anxiety patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve: treatment resistance, residual symptoms, and recurrence/relapse remain a challenge. Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been considered for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. This review will explore the available data for the role of aripiprazole in the treatment of anxiety. Methods: PubMed and conference abstracts were searched for randomized, double-blind studies that investigated the efficacy of aripiprazole in anxiety; its efficacy in bipolar disorder and depression was also explored for comparison. Results: A number of studies have shown atypical antipsychotics to be effective in anxiety, and currently available data suggest that aripiprazole augmentation in patients with anxiety disorders is likely as effective as other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Although there have been no randomized, controlled trials, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in two open-label trials. This combined with the larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration. Limitations: Data from large randomized, controlled trials on the use of atypical antipsychotics for anxiety in general, and aripiprazole in particular, are currently lacking. Conclusion: The results of open-label trials of aripiprazole in anxiety provide enough support to warrant its further study. This, combined with a larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration.

113,Aripiprazole: Striving towards euthymia with a novel mechanism of action,"The introduction of the psychopharmacological era in the mid 20th century aimed to provide ataraxia to those who suffer from chronic debilitating mental illnesses. Ataraxia is described as freedom from the anguish of affective, anxiety, and/or psychotic symptoms; a ""pharmacologic euthymia"". Currently, aripiprazole, olanzapine (in combination with fluoxetine), and quetiapine are FDA approved as treatments for individuals insufficiently responding to conventional unimodal antidepressant monotherapy. The widespread availability, evaluation, and marketing of atypical antipsychotics as resulted in this class of agents being used ahead of first-generation antipsychotics in the algorithmic treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. There are several key messages that busy practitioners can take away from this collection of articles. Aripiprazole offers symptom relief in the treatment of anxiety symptoms admixed with depressive episodes; its efficacy in anxiety disorders has not been sufficiently evaluated. We continue to aim for ataraxia and functional recovery, the expanding therapeutic options in mood and anxiety disorders is introducing more complexity in the treatment algorithm yet hopefully raising the probability of successful outcome.

114,Grandparental anxiety and depression predict young children's internalizing and externalizing problems: The generation R study,"Background: Family history is a major risk factor for child problem behaviour, yet few studies have examined the association between grandparental psychiatric disorder and child problem behaviour. Results are inconsistent as to whether the effect of grandparental depression on child problem behaviour is independent of parental psychopathology. Methods: Mothers and their children participated in an ethnically Dutch subcohort of a population-based prospective cohort in the Netherlands. N = 816 (66%) mothers and n = 691 fathers participated in the prenatal interviews. N = 687 (84%) mothers and children and n = 565 (82%) fathers participated three years postpartum. (Grand)parental psychopathology was assessed during pregnancy of the mothers with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Child behaviour was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by mother and father when the child was three years old. Results: Grandparental anxiety disorder predicted maternal reports of children's internalizing problems (OR = 1.98, 95% C.I. (1.20, 3.28), p-value &lt; 0.01) and externalizing problems (OR = 1.73, 95% C.I. (1.04, 2.87), p-value = 0.03), independent of parental psychopathology. Results were similar for grandparental depression; internalizing OR = 1.75, 95% C.I (1.11, 2.75), p-value = 0.02 and externalizing OR = 1.67, 95% C.I. (1.05, 2.64) p-value = 0.03. However, grandparental psychopathology was not associated with children's problem behaviour as reported by the father. Limitations: Information on grandparental lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed through a parental interview which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence rates. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of a family history including not only the parental but also the grandparental generations.

115,Psychiatric disorders and functional impairment among disaster victims after exposure to a natural disaster: A population based study,"Objective: We aimed to examine psychiatric morbidity and functional impairment after a natural disaster. Method: Norwegian tourists who survived the 2004 tsunami in Khao Lak (n = 63), a severely affected area in Thailand, were interviewed in person 2.5years after the disaster. The examination included the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), the Global Assessment of Functioning function score (GAF-F), and questions covering background characteristics and disaster exposure. Results: The most prevalent disorders were specific phobia (30.2%), agoraphobia (17.5%), social anxiety disorder (11.1%), PTSD (11.1%), major depressive disorder (MDD, 11.1%), and dysthymic disorder (DD, 11.1%). In 24 of the 40 respondents with a current psychiatric disorder, symptoms had originated after the tsunami. The post-tsunami 2.5year incidence of PTSD and MDD was 36.5% and 28.6%, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that the depressive disorders (MDD and DD) and PTSD were associated with self-reported functional impairment (WSAS), and the depressive disorders were associated with clinician assessed functional impairment (GAF-F). Limitations: Small sample size and high education may limit the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Depression and anxiety disorders were common among disaster victims 2.5years after the 2004 tsunami. Psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, especially depressive disorders, are of clinical importance when considering long-term mental health effect of disasters.

116,Base rates for depersonalization according to the 2-item version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2) and its associations with depression/anxiety in the general population,"Background: Recently, the two item version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2) has been validated in a clinical sample and has demonstrated that it is a useful tool for the detection of clinically significant depersonalization (DP). In order to provide a framework for the interpretation of the CDS-2 scores the aim of this study was to achieve normative data of a representative sample of the German population and to evaluate the associations with depression, anxiety and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: A nationally representative face-to-face household survey was conducted during the mid of 2009 in Germany. The sample comprised N=2512 participants. The survey questionnaire consisted of the CDS-2, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and demographic characteristics. Results: Case level of DP was found for 3.4% of the participants without significant sex and age differences. Although DP was strongly associated with depression and anxiety, principal component analysis clearly supported the distinctiveness of the psychopathological syndromes of depression, anxiety and DP. Limitations: A criterion standard diagnostic interview for DP, anxiety and depression was not included. Conclusions: The results provide a framework for the interpretation of the CDS-2 scores and support the view that DP is a common and distinct psychopathological syndrome.

117,Treatment for depression and change in mood instability,"Background: Mood varies along at least 2 dimensions, severity and instability (MI). Compared with severity, there is little research on the treatment of MI. We assessed changes in MI with community psychiatric treatment, in patients with depression and mood swings. Method: Diagnoses were obtained with the MINI. Thirty-four patients completed the Mood Disorders Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). MI was calculated from visual analogue scales (VAS) ratings for depression and anxiety. The VAS was rated twice a day for a week. The BDI, STAI-T and VAS were repeated after 3–6months of treatment. Results: Patients improved with treatment on depression (BDI) and anxiety (STAI-T) severity but not on MI. However, change in MI predicted change in depression severity (BDI). Limitations: The sample size was relatively small and information on treatment waslimited. There was no control group. Studies of longer duration and with more comprehensive treatment might be necessary to show changes in MI. Conclusions: MI does not respond consistently within 3–6months to common effective psychiatric treatments for depression and anxiety. Improved treatment of MI could result in improved treatment for major depression.

949,Witnessing violence toward siblings: An understudied but potent form of early adversity,"Research on the consequences of witnessing domestic violence has focused on inter-adult violence and most specifically on violence toward mothers. The potential consequences of witnessing violence to siblings have been almost entirely overlooked. Based on clinical experience we sought to test the hypothesis that witnessing violence toward siblings would be as consequential as witnessing violence toward mothers. The community sample consisted of unmedicated, right-handed, young adults who had siblings (n = 1,412; 62.7% female; 21.8 ± 2.1 years of age). History of witnessing threats or assaults to mothers, fathers and siblings, exposure to parental and sibling verbal abuse and physical abuse, sexual abuse and sociodemographic factors were assessed by self-report. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization, anger-hostility, dissociation and ‘limbic irritability’ were assessed by rating scales. Data were analyzed by multiple regression, with techniques to gauge relative importance; logistic regression to assess adjusted odds ratios for clinically-significant ratings; and random forest regression using conditional trees. Subjects reported witnessing violence to siblings slightly more often than witnessing violence to mothers (22% vs 21%), which overlapped by 51–54%. Witnessing violence toward siblings was associated with significant effects on all ratings. Witnessing violence toward mother was not associated with significant effects on any scale in these models. Measures of the relative importance of witnessing violence to siblings were many fold greater than measures of importance for witnessing violence towards mothers or fathers. Mediation and structural equation models showed that effects of witnessing violence toward mothers or fathers were predominantly indirect and mediated by changes in maternal behavior. The effects of witnessing violence toward siblings were more direct.

950,Individual differences in the ability to recognise facial identity are associated with social anxiety,"Previous research has been concerned with the relationship between social anxiety and the recognition of face expression but the question of whether there is a relationship between social anxiety and the recognition of face identity has been neglected. Here, we report the first evidence that social anxiety is associated with recognition of face identity , across the population range of individual differences in recognition abilities. Results showed poorer face identity recognition (on the Cambridge Face Memory Test ) was correlated with a small but significant increase in social anxiety ( Social Interaction Anxiety Scale ) but not general anxiety ( State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ). The correlation was also independent of general visual memory ( Cambridge Car Memory Test ) and IQ. Theoretically, the correlation could arise because correct identification of people, typically achieved via faces, is important for successful social interactions, extending evidence that individuals with clinical-level deficits in face identity recognition (prosopagnosia) often report social stress due to their inability to recognise others. Equally, the relationship could arise if social anxiety causes reduced exposure or attention to people’s faces, and thus to poor development of face recognition mechanisms.

951,Extraversion is linked to volume of the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala,"Neuroticism and extraversion are personality factors associated with the vulnerability for developing depression and anxiety disorders, and are possibly differentially related to brain structures implicated in the processing of emotional information and the generation of mood states. To date, studies on brain morphology mainly focused on neuroticism, a dimension primarily related to negative affect, yielding conflicting findings concerning the association with personality, partially due to methodological issues and variable population samples under study. Recently, extraversion, a dimension primarily related to positive affect, has been repeatedly inversely related to with symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, high resolution structural T1-weighted MR images of 65 healthy adults were processed using an optimized Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) approach. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test for associations of neuroticism and extraversion with prefrontal and subcortical volumes. Orbitofrontal and right amygdala volume were both positively related to extraversion. Extraversion was differentially related to volume of the anterior cingulate cortex in males (positive) and females (negative). Neuroticism scores did not significantly correlate with these brain regions. As extraversion is regarded a protective factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression and has been related to the generation of positive affect, the present results indicate that the reduced likelihood of developing affective disorders in individuals high on extraversion is related to modulation of emotion processing through the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala.

952,Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency during brain maturation reduces neuronal and behavioral plasticity in adulthood,"Omega-3-fatty acid DHA is a structural component of brain plasma membranes, thereby crucial for neuronal signaling; however, the brain is inefficient at synthesizing DHA. We have asked how levels of dietary n-3 fatty acids during brain growth would affect brain function and plasticity during adult life. Pregnant rats and their male offspring were fed an n-3 adequate diet or n-3 deficient diets for 15 weeks. Results showed that the n-3 deficiency increased parameters of anxiety-like behavior using open field and elevated plus maze tests in the male offspring. Behavioral changes were accompanied by a level reduction in the anxiolytic-related neuropeptide Y-1 receptor, and an increase in the anxiogenic-related glucocorticoid receptor in the cognitive related frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. The n-3 deficiency reduced brain levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and increased the ratio n-6/n-3 assessed by gas chromatography. The n-3 deficiency reduced the levels of BDNF and signaling through the BDNF receptor TrkB, in proportion to brain DHA levels, and reduced the activation of the BDNF-related signaling molecule CREB in selected brain regions. The n-3 deficiency also disrupted the insulin signaling pathways as evidenced by changes in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS). DHA deficiency during brain maturation reduces plasticity and compromises brain function in adulthood. Adequate levels of dietary DHA seem crucial for building long-term neuronal resilience for optimal brain performance and aiding in the battle against neurological disorders.

953,Psychophysiological responses to stress after stress management training in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Background: Stress management interventions may prove useful in preventing the detrimental effects of stress on health. This study assessed the effects of a stress management intervention on the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Seventy-four patients with RA, who were randomly assigned to either a control group or a group that received short-term stress management training, performed a standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) 1 week after the stress management training and at a 9-week follow-up. Psychological and physical functioning, and the acute psychophysiological response to the stress test were assessed. Results: Patients in the intervention group showed significantly lower psychological distress levels of anxiety after the training than did the controls. While there were no between-group differences in stress-induced tension levels, and autonomic (α-amylase) or endocrine (cortisol) responses to the stress test 1 week after the intervention, levels of stress-induced tension and cortisol were significantly lower in the intervention group at the 9-week follow-up. Overall, the response to the intervention was particularly evident in a subgroup of patients with a psychological risk profile. Conclusion: A relatively short stress management intervention can improve psychological functioning and influences the psychophysiological response to stress in patients with RA, particularly those psychologically at risk. These findings might help understand how stress can affect health and the role of individual differences in stress responsiveness.

954,Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale in policewomen,"Background: The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is one of most widely used instruments to measure a global level of perceived stress in a range of clinical and research settings. This study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the Simplified Chinese version of the PSS-10 in policewomen. Methodology: A total of 240 policewomen were recruited in this study. The Simplified Chinese versions of the PSS-10, the Beck Depression Inventory Revised (BDI-II), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered to all participants, and 36 of the participants were re-tested two weeks after the initial testing. Principal Findings: The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.86, and the test–retest reliability coefficient was 0.68. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) yielded 2 factors with eigen values of 4.76 and 1.48, accounting for 62.41% of variance. Factor 1 consisted of 6 items representing ‘‘negative feelings’’; whereas Factor 2 consisted of 4 items representing ‘‘positive feelings’’. The item loadings ranged from 0.72 to 0.83. The Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated a very good fit of this two-factor model to this sample. The PSS-10 significantly correlated with both BDI-II and BAI, indicating an acceptable concurrent validity. Conclusions: The Simplified Chinese version of the PSS-10 demonstrated adequate psychometric properties for evaluating stress levels. The results support its use among the Chinese population.

955,Dose-dependent effects of endotoxin on neurobehavioral functions in humans,"Clinical and experimental evidence document that inflammation and increased peripheral cytokine levels are associated with depression-like symptoms and neuropsychological disturbances in humans. However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent cognitive functions like memory and attention are affected by and related to the dose of the inflammatory stimulus. Thus, in a cross-over, double-blind, experimental approach, healthy male volunteers were administered with either placebo or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at doses of 0.4 ( n = 18) or 0.8 ng/kg of body weight ( n = 16). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, norephinephrine and cortisol concentrations were analyzed before and 1, 1.75, 3, 4, 6, and 24 h after injection. In addition, changes in mood and anxiety levels were determined together with working memory (n-back task) and long term memory performance (recall of emotional and neutral pictures of the International Affective Picture System). Endotoxin administration caused a profound transient physiological response with dose-related elevations in body temperature and heart rate, increases in plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), salivary and plasma cortisol, and plasma norepinephrine. These changes were accompanied by dose-related decreased mood and increased anxiety levels. LPS administration did not affect accuracy in working memory performance but improved reaction time in the high-dose LPS condition compared to the control condition. In contrast, long-term memory performance was impaired selectively for emotional stimuli after administration of the lower but not of the higher dose of LPS. These data suggest the existence of at least two counter-acting mechanisms, one promoting and one inhibiting cognitive performance during acute systemic inflammation.

956,A RCT of a transdiagnostic Internet-delivered treatment for three anxiety disorders: Examination of support roles and disorder-specific outcomes,"Background: Anxiety disorders share common vulnerabilities and symptoms. Disorder-specific treatment is efficacious, but few access evidence-based care. Administering transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy via the internet (iCBT) may increase access to evidence-based treatment, with a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) providing preliminary support for this approach. This study extends those findings and aims to answer three questions: Is a transdiagnostic iCBT program for anxiety disorders efficacious and acceptable? Does it result in change for specific disorders? Can good clinical outcomes be obtained when guidance is provided via a Coach rather than a Clinician? Method: RCT (N = 131) comparing three groups: Clinician-supported (CL) vs. Coach-supported (CO) vs. waitlist control (Control). Individuals met DSM-IV criteria for a principal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) or panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (Pan/Ag). Treatment consisted of an 8-lesson/10 week iCBT program with weekly contact from a Clinician or Coach, and follow-up at 3-months post-treatment. Results: Outcomes for the pooled treatment groups (CL+CO) were superior to the Control group on measures of anxiety, depression and disability, were associated with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = .76–1.44) (response rate = 89–100%), and were maintained at follow-up. Significant reductions were found on disorder-specific outcomes for each of the target diagnoses, and were associated with large effect sizes. CO participants achieved similar outcomes to CL participants at post-treatment, yet had significantly lower symptom severity scores on general anxiety, panic-disorder, depression and disability at follow-up ( d = .45–.46). Seventy-four percent of CO and 76% of CL participants completed the program. Less than 70 minutes of Clinician or Coach time was required per participant during the program. Discussion: This transdiagnostic iCBT course for anxiety appears to be efficacious, associated with significant change for three target disorders, and is efficacious when guided by either a Clinician or Coach.

957,Does tinnitus distress depend on age of onset?,"Objectives: Tinnitus is the perception of a sound in the absence of any physical source of it. About 5–15% of the population report hearing such a tinnitus and about 1–2% suffer from their tinnitus leading to anxiety, sleep disorders or depression. It is currently not completely understood why some people feel distressed by their tinnitus, while others don’t. Several studies indicate that the amount of tinnitus distress is associated with many factors including comorbid anxiety, comorbid depression, personality, the psychosocial situation, the amount of the related hearing loss and the loudness of the tinnitus. Furthermore, theoretical considerations suggest an impact of the age at tinnitus onset influencing tinnitus distress. Methods: Based on a sample of 755 normal hearing tinnitus patients we tested this assumption. All participants answered a questionnaire on the amount of tinnitus distress together with a large variety of clinical and demographic data. Results: Patients with an earlier onset of tinnitus suffer significantly less than patients with an onset later in life. Furthermore, patients with a later onset of tinnitus describe their course of tinnitus distress as more abrupt and distressing right from the beginning. Conclusion: We argue that a decline of compensatory brain plasticity in older age accounts for this age-dependent tinnitus decompensation.

958,Default-mode-like network activation in awake rodents,"During wakefulness and in absence of performing tasks or sensory processing, the default-mode network (DMN), an intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) network, is in an active state. Non-human primate and human CNS imaging studies have identified the DMN in these two species. Clinical imaging studies have shown that the pattern of activity within the DMN is often modulated in various disease states (e.g., Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia or chronic pain). However, whether the DMN exists in awake rodents has not been characterized. The current data provides evidence that awake rodents also possess ‘DMN-like’ functional connectivity, but only subsequent to habituation to what is initially a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment as well as physical restraint. Specifically, the habituation process spanned across four separate scanning sessions (Day 2, 4, 6 and 8). At Day 8, significant (p &lt; 0.05) functional connectivity was observed amongst structures such as the anterior cingulate (seed region), retrosplenial, parietal, and hippocampal cortices. Prior to habituation (Day 2), functional connectivity was only detected (p &lt; 0.05) amongst CNS structures known to mediate anxiety (i.e., anterior cingulate (seed region), posterior hypothalamic area, amygdala and parabracial nucleus). In relating functional connectivity between cingulate-default-mode and cingulate-anxiety structures across Days 2-8, a significant inverse relationship (r = −0.65, p = 0.0004) was observed between these two functional interactions such that increased cingulate-DMN connectivity corresponded to decreased cingulate anxiety network connectivity. This investigation demonstrates that the cingulate is an important component of both the rodent DMN-like and anxiety networks.

959,The Small World of Psychopathology,"Background: Mental disorders are highly comorbid: people having one disorder are likely to have another as well. We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). Principal Findings: We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders. Conclusions: In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.

960,Adolescent oxytocin exposure causes persistent reductions in anxiety and alcohol consumption and enhances sociability in rats,"Previous studies have suggested that administration of oxytocin (OT) can have modulatory effects on social and anxiety-like behavior in mammals that may endure beyond the time of acute OT administration. The current study examined whether repeated administration of OT to male Wistar rats (n = 48) during a key developmental epoch (early adolescence) altered their physiology and behavior in later-life. Group housed rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either 1 mg/kg OT or vehicle during early adolescence (post natal-days [PND] 33–42). OT treatment caused a transient inhibition of body weight gain that recovered quickly after the cessation of treatment. At PND 50, the rats pre-treated with OT displayed less anxiety-like behavior on the emergence test, while at PND 55 they showed greater levels of social interaction. A subgroup of OT pre-treated rats examined at PND 63 showed a strong trend towards increased plasma OT levels, and also displayed significantly increased OT receptor mRNA in the hypothalamus. Rats pre-treated with OT and their controls showed similar induction of beer intake in daily 70 min test sessions (PND 63 onwards) in which the alcohol concentration of beer was gradually increased across days from 0.44% to 4.44%. However, when given ad libitum access to beer in their home cages from PND 72 onwards (early adulthood), consumption of beer but not water was significantly less in the OT pre-treated rats. A “booster” shot of OT (1 mg/kg) given after 25 days of ad libitum access to beer had a strong acute inhibitory effect on beer intake without affecting water intake. Overall these results suggest that exogenous OT administered during adolescence can have subtle yet enduring effects on anxiety, sociability and the motivation to consume alcohol. Such effects may reflect the inherent neuroplasticity of brain OT systems and a feed-forward effect whereby exogenous OT upregulates endogenous OT systems.

961,Effects of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive and emotional functioning in young adults—A randomised controlled trial,"Background: Epidemiological research links vitamin D status to various brain-related outcomes. However, few trials examine whether supplementation can improve such outcomes and none have examined effects on cognition. This study examined whether Vitamin D supplementation led to improvements in diverse measures of cognitive and emotional functioning, and hypothesised that supplementation would lead to improvements in these outcomes compared to placebo. Methods/Principal Findings: Healthy young adults were recruited to a parallel-arm, double-blind trial conducted at The University of Queensland. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Vitamin D (one capsule daily, containing 5000 IU cholecalciferol) or identical placebo capsule for six weeks. All participants and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcome measures assessed at baseline and 6 weeks were working memory, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Secondary outcomes were: hallucination-proneness, psychotic-like experiences, and ratings of depression, anxiety and anger. 128 participants were recruited, randomised and included in primary analyses (vitamin D n = 63; placebo n = 65). Despite significant increases in vitamin D status in the active group, no significant changes were observed in working memory (F = 1.09; p = 0.30), response inhibition (F = 0.82; p = 0.37), cognitive flexibility (F = 1.37; p = 0.24) or secondary outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not influence cognitive or emotional functioning in healthy young adults. Future controlled trials in targeted populations of interest are required to determine whether supplementation can improve functioning in these domains.

962,Modulation of &lt;i&gt;Tcf7l2&lt;/i&gt; expression alters behavior in mice,"The comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with several psychiatric diseases is well established. While environmental factors may partially account for these co-occurrences, common genetic susceptibilities could also be implicated in the confluence of these diseases. In support of shared genetic burdens, TCF7L2 , the strongest genetic determinant for T2D risk in the human population, has been recently implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ) risk, suggesting that this may be one of many loci that pleiotropically influence both diseases. To investigate whether Tcf7l2 is involved in behavioral phenotypes in addition to its roles in glucose metabolism, we conducted several behavioral tests in mice with null alleles of Tcf7l2 or overexpressing Tcf7l2 . We identified a role for Tcf7l2 in anxiety-like behavior and a dose-dependent effect of Tcf7l2 alleles on fear learning. None of the mutant mice showed differences in prepulse inhibition (PPI), which is a well-established endophenotype for SCZ. These results show that Tcf7l2 alters behavior in mice. Importantly, these differences are observed prior to the onset of detectable glucose metabolism abnormalities. Whether these differences are related to human anxiety-disorders or schizophrenia remains to be determined. These animal models have the potential to elucidate the molecular basis of psychiatric comorbidities in diabetes and should therefore be studied further.

963,Cysteamine attenuates the decreases in TrkB protein levels and the anxiety/depression-like behaviors in mice induced by corticosterone treatment,"Objective: Stress and glucocorticoid hormones, which are released into the circulation following stressful experiences, have been shown to contribute significantly to the manifestation of anxiety-like behaviors observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its receptor TrkB plays an important role in stress-mediated changes in structural as well as functional neuroplasticity. Studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby TrkB signaling is regulated in chronic stress might provide valuable information for the development of new therapeutic strategies for several stress-related psychiatric disorders. Materials and Methods: We examined the potential of cysteamine, a neuroprotective compound to attenuate anxiety and depression like behaviors in a mouse model of anxiety/depression induced by chronic corticosterone exposure. Results: Cysteamine administration (150 mg/kg/day, through drinking water) for 21 days significantly ameliorated chronic corticosterone-induced decreases in TrkB protein levels in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, cysteamine treatment reversed the anxiety and depression like behavioral abnormalities induced by chronic corticosterone treatment. Finally, mice deficient in TrkB, showed a reduced response to cysteamine in behavioral tests, suggesting that TrkB signaling plays an important role in the antidepressant effects of cysteamine. Conclusions: The animal studies described here highlight the potential use of cysteamine as a novel therapeutic strategy for glucocorticoid-related symptoms of psychiatric disorders.

964,Increased activity imbalance in fronto-subcortical circuits in adolescents with major depression,"Background: A functional discrepancy exists in adolescents between frontal and subcortical regions due to differential regional maturational trajectories. It remains unknown how this functional discrepancy alters and whether the influence from the subcortical to the frontal system plays a primacy role in medication naïve adolescent with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methodology/Principal Findings: Eighteen MDD and 18 healthy adolescents were enrolled. Depression and anxiety severity was assessed by the Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) respectively. The functional discrepancy was measured by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of resting-state functional MRI signal. Correlation analysis was carried out between ALFF values and SMFQ and SCARED scores. Resting brain activity levels measured by ALFF was higher in the frontal cortex than that in the subcortical system involving mainly (para) limbic-striatal regions in both HC and MDD adolescents. The difference of ALFF values between frontal and subcortical systems was increased in MDD adolescents as compared with the controls. Conclusions/Significance: The present study identified an increased imbalance of resting-state brain activity between the frontal cognitive control system and the (para) limbic-striatal emotional processing system in MDD adolescents. The findings may provide insights into the neural correlates of adolescent MDD.

965,Cognitive and emotional alterations are related to hippocampal inflammation in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome,"Converging clinical data suggest that peripheral inflammation is likely involved in the pathogenesis of the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the question arises as to whether the increased prevalence of behavioral alterations in MetS is also associated with central inflammation, i.e. cytokine activation, in brain areas particularly involved in controlling behavior. To answer this question, we measured in a mouse model of MetS, namely the diabetic and obese db/db mice, and in their healthy db/ + littermates emotional behaviors and memory performances, as well as plasma levels and brain expression (hippocampus; hypothalamus) of inflammatory cytokines. Our results shows that db/db mice displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors in the open-field and the elevated plus-maze (i.e. reduced percent of time spent in anxiogenic areas of each device), but not depressive-like behaviors as assessed by immobility time in the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Moreover, db/db mice displayed impaired spatial recognition memory (hippocampus-dependent task), but unaltered object recognition memory (hippocampus-independent task). In agreement with the well-established role of the hippocampus in anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory, behavioral alterations of db/db mice were associated with increased inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus but not the hypothalamus. These results strongly point to interactions between cytokines and central processes involving the hippocampus as important contributing factor to the behavioral alterations of db/db mice. These findings may prove valuable for introducing novel approaches to treat neuropsychiatric complications associated with MetS.

In this study, we aim to identify potential novel molecular targets that contribute to the multigenic trait ""anxiety"". We used microarrays to investigate the gene expression profiles of different brain regions within the limbic system of mice which were selectively bred for either high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior, and also show signs of comorbid depression-like behavior. We identified and confirmed sex-independent differences in the basal expression of 13 candidate genes, using tissue from the entire brain, including coronin 7 ( Coro7 ), cathepsin B ( Ctsb ), muscleblind-like 1 ( Mbnl1 ), metallothionein 1 ( Mt1 ), solute carrier family 25 member 17 ( Slc25a17 ), tribbles homolog 2 ( Trib2 ), zinc finger protein 672 ( Zfp672 ), syntaxin 3 ( Stx3 ), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 2 ( Abca2 ), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5 ( Enpp5 ), high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 ( Hmgn3 ) and pyruvate dehydrogenase beta ( Pdhb ). Additionally, we confirmed brain region-specific differences in the expression of synaptotagmin 4 ( Syt4 ). Our identification of about 90 polymorphisms in Ctsb suggested that this gene might play a critical role in shaping our mouse model’s behavioral endophenotypes. Indeed, the assessment of anxiety-related and depression-like behaviors of Ctsb knock-out mice revealed an increase in depression-like behavior in females. Altogether, our results suggest that Ctsb has significant effects on emotionality, irrespective of the tested mouse strain, making it a promising target for future pharmacotherapy.

967,Predator cat odors activate sexual arousal pathways in brains of &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; infected rats,"Cat odors induce rapid, innate and stereotyped defensive behaviors in rats at first exposure, a presumed response to the evolutionary pressures of predation. Bizarrely, rats infected with the brain parasite Toxoplasma gondii approach the cat odors they typically avoid. Since the protozoan Toxoplasma requires the cat to sexually reproduce, this change in host behavior is thought to be a remarkable example of a parasite manipulating a mammalian host for its own benefit. Toxoplasma does not influence host response to non-feline predator odor nor does it alter behavior on olfactory, social, fear or anxiety tests, arguing for specific manipulation in the processing of cat odor. We report that Toxoplasma infection alters neural activity in limbic brain areas necessary for innate defensive behavior in response to cat odor. Moreover, Toxoplasma increases activity in nearby limbic regions of sexual attraction when the rat is exposed to cat urine, compelling evidence that Toxoplasma overwhelms the innate fear response by causing, in its stead, a type of sexual attraction to the normally aversive cat odor.

968,Behavioral and autonomic responses to acute restraint stress are segregated within the lateral septal area of rats,"Background: The Lateral Septal Area (LSA) is involved with autonomic and behavior responses associated to stress. In rats, acute restraint (RS) is an unavoidable stress situation that causes autonomic (body temperature, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) increases) and behavioral (increased anxiety-like behavior) changes in rats. The LSA is one of several brain regions that have been involved in stress responses. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the neurotransmission blockade in the LSA would interfere in the autonomic and behavioral changes induced by RS. Methodology/Principal Findings: Male Wistar rats with bilateral cannulae aimed at the LSA, an intra-abdominal datalogger (for recording internal body temperature), and an implanted catheter into the femoral artery (for recording and cardiovascular parameters) were used. They received bilateral microinjections of the non-selective synapse blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl₂, 1 mM/ 100 nL) or vehicle 10 min before RS session. The tail temperature was measured by an infrared thermal imager during the session. Twenty-four h after the RS session the rats were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Conclusions/Significance: Inhibition of LSA neurotransmission reduced the MAP and HR increases observed during RS. However, no changes were observed in the decrease in skin temperature and increase in internal body temperature observed during this period. Also, LSA inhibition did not change the anxiogenic effect induced by RS observed 24 h later in the EPM. The present results suggest that LSA neurotransmission is involved in the cardiovascular but not the temperature and behavioral changes induced by restraint stress.

969,Differential effects of prenatal stress in 5-Htt deficient mice: Towards molecular mechanisms of gene × environment interactions,"Prenatal stress (PS) has been shown to influence the development of the fetal brain and to increase the risk for the development of psychiatric disorders in later life. Furthermore, the variation of human serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SLC6A4) gene was suggested to exert a modulating effect on the association between early life stress and the risk for depression. In the present study, we used a 5-Htt × PS paradigm to investigate whether the effects of PS are dependent on the 5-Htt genotype. For this purpose, the effects of PS on cognition, anxiety- and depression-related behavior were examined using a maternal restraint stress paradigm of PS in C57BL6 wild-type (WT) and heterozygous 5-Htt deficient (5-Htt +/−) mice. Additionally, in female offspring, a genome-wide hippocampal gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. 5-Htt +/− offspring showed enhanced memory performance and signs of reduced anxiety as compared to WT offspring. In contrast, exposure of 5-Htt +/− mice to PS was associated with increased depressive-like behavior, an effect that tended to be more pronounced in female offspring. Further, 5-Htt genotype, PS and their interaction differentially affected the expression of numerous genes and related pathways within the female hippocampus. Specifically, MAPK and neurotrophin signaling were regulated by both the 5-Htt +/− genotype and PS exposure, whereas cytokine and Wnt signaling were affected in a 5-Htt genotype x PS manner, indicating a gene x environment interaction at the molecular level. In conclusion, our data suggest that although the 5-Htt +/− genotype shows clear adaptive capacity, 5-Htt +/− mice –particularly females– at the same time appear to be more vulnerable to developmental stress exposure when compared to WT offspring. Moreover, hippocampal gene expression profiles suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms mediate the behavioral effects of the 5-Htt genotype, PS exposure, and their interaction.

HTRs are highly expressed in human prefrontal cortex and exert control over prefrontal excitability. The serotonin system is a key treatment target for several psychiatric disorders; however, the effectiveness of these drugs varies according to age. Despite strong evidence for developmental changes in prefrontal Htrs of rodents, the developmental regulation of HTR expression in human prefrontal cortex has not been examined. Using postmortem human prefrontal brain tissue from across postnatal life, we investigated the expression of key serotonin receptors with distinct inhibitory ( HTR1A, HTR5A ) and excitatory ( HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR4, HTR6 ) effects on cortical neurons, including two receptors which appear to be expressed to a greater degree in inhibitory interneurons of cerebral cortex ( HTR2C, HTR6 ). We found distinct developmental patterns of expression for each of these six HTRs , with profound changes in expression occurring early in postnatal development and also into adulthood. However, a collective look at these HTRs in terms of their likely neurophysiological effects and major cellular localization leads to a model that suggests developmental changes in expression of these individual HTRs may not perturb an overall balance between inhibitory and excitatory effects. Examining and understanding the healthy balance is critical to appreciate how abnormal expression of an individual HTR may create a window of vulnerability for the emergence of psychiatric illness.

971,Influence of early stress on social abilities and serotonergic functions across generations in mice,"Exposure to adverse environments during early development is a known risk factor for several psychiatric conditions including antisocial behavior and personality disorders. Here, we induced social anxiety and altered social recognition memory in adult mice using unpredictable maternal separation and maternal stress during early postnatal life. We show that these social defects are not only pronounced in the animals directly subjected to stress, but are also transmitted to their offspring across two generations. The defects are associated with impaired serotonergic signaling, in particular, reduced 5HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and increased serotonin level in a dorsal raphe projection area. These findings underscore the susceptibility of social behaviors and serotonergic pathways to early stress, and the persistence of their perturbation across generations.

972,Neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aortic aneurysms,"Background: Emerging evidence suggests that vascular disease confers vulnerability to a late-onset of depressive illness and the impairment of specific cognitive functions, most notably in the domains of memory storage and retrieval. Lower limb athero-thrombosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have both been previously associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms possibly due to associated intracerebral vascular disease or systemic inflammation, hence suggesting that these illnesses may be regarded as models to investigate the vascular genesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety and a variety of cognitive domains in patients who had symptoms of peripheral athero-thrombosis (intermittent claudication) and those who had an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a cross-sectional study, 26 participants with either intermittent claudication or AAA were assessed using a detailed neuropsychiatric assessment battery for various cognitive domains and depression and anxiety symptoms (Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales). Student t test and linear regression analyses were applied to compare neuropsychiatric symptoms between patient groups. AAA participants showed greater levels of cognitive impairment in the domains of immediate and delayed memory as compared to patients who had intermittent claudication. Cognitive dysfunction was best predicted by increasing aortic diameter. CRP was positively related to AAA diameter, but not to cognitive function. AAA and aortic diameter in particular were associated with cognitive dysfunction in this study. Conclusions/Significance: AAA patients are at a higher risk for cognitive impairment than intermittent claudication patients. Validation of this finding is required in a larger study, but if confirmed could suggest that systemic factors peculiar to AAA may impact on cognitive function.

973,Characteristics and treatment preferences of people with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder: An internet survey,"Background: Although Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling anxiety disorder, relatively few people with this condition access evidence-based care. Barriers to treatment are multiple and complex, but the emerging field of Internet therapy for PTSD may improve access to evidence-based treatment. However, little is known about the characteristics of people with PTSD who seek online treatment, or whether they perceive internet treatment as an acceptable treatment option. Methodology: An online survey was used to collect information about the demographic and symptom characteristics of individuals with elevated levels of PTSD symptoms, and this was compared to data from corresponding sample from a national survey. Previous treatment experiences, perceived barriers to treatment and treatment preferences for Internet therapy and face-to-face treatment were also compared. Principal Findings: High levels of PTSD symptoms were reported by survey respondents. Psychological distress and disability was greater than reported by individuals with PTSD from a national survey. Half of the sample reported not having received treatment for PTSD; however, 88% of those who reported receiving treatment stated they received an evidence-based treatment. Primary barriers to treatment included cost, poor awareness of service availability, lack of prior treatment response and not perceiving personal distress as severe enough to warrant treatment. Most survey respondents indicated they were willing to try Internet treatment for PTSD. Conclusions: The Internet sample was symptomatically severe and multiple barriers existed to treatment. Internet therapy is an acceptable option for the treatment of PTSD in an internet sample.

974,War and bereavement: Consequences for mental and physical distress,"Background: Little is known about the long-term impact of the killing of a parent in childhood or adolescence during war on distress and disability in young adulthood. This study assessed current prevalence rates of mental disorders and levels of dysfunction among young adults who had lost their father due to war-related violence in childhood or adolescence. Methods: 179 bereaved young adults and 175 non-bereaved young adults were interviewed a decade after experiencing the war in Kosovo. Prevalence rates of Major Depressive Episode (MDE), anxiety, and substance use disorders, and current suicide risk were assessed using the Mini–International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The syndrome of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) was assessed with the Prolonged Grief Disorder Interview (PG-13). Somatic symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. General health distress was assessed with the General Health Questionnaire. Findings: Bereaved participants were significantly more likely to suffer from either MDE or any anxiety disorder than non-bereaved participants (58.7% vs. 40%). Among bereaved participants, 39.7% met criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 34.6% for PGD, and 22.3% for MDE. Bereaved participants with PGD were more likely to suffer from MDE, any anxiety disorder, or current suicide risk than bereaved participants without PGD. Furthermore, these participants reported significantly greater physical distress than bereaved participants without PGD. Conclusion: War-related loss during middle childhood and adolescence presents significant risk for adverse mental health and dysfunction in young adulthood in addition to exposure to other war-related traumatic events. Furthermore, the syndrome of PGD can help to identify those with the greatest degree of distress and dysfunction.

975,Diffusion-weighted MRI and quantitative biophysical modeling of hippocampal neurite loss in chronic stress,"Chronic stress has detrimental effects on physiology, learning and memory and is involved in the development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Besides changes in synaptic formation and neurogenesis, chronic stress also induces dendritic remodeling in the hippocampus, amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Investigations of dendritic remodeling during development and treatment of stress are currently limited by the invasive nature of histological and stereological methods. Here we show that high field diffusion-weighted MRI combined with quantitative biophysical modeling of the hippocampal dendritic loss in 21 day restraint stressed rats highly correlates with former histological findings. Our study strongly indicates that diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to regional dendritic loss and thus a promising candidate for non-invasive studies of dendritic plasticity in chronic stress and stress-related disorders.

976,Social isolation-induced aggression potentiates anxiety and depressive-like behavior in male mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress,"Background: Accumulating epidemiological evidence shows that life event stressors are major vulnerability factors for psychiatric diseases such as major depression. It is also well known that social isolation in male mice results in aggressive behavior. However, it is not known how social isolation-induced aggression affects anxiety and depressive-like behavior in isolated male mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS), an animal model of depression. Methodology/Principal Findings: C57/B6 male mice were divided into 3 groups; non-stressed controls, in Group I; isolated mice subjected to the CMS protocol in Group II and aggression by physical contact in socially isolated mice subjected to the CMS protocol in Group III. In the sucrose intake test, ingestion of a 1% sucrose solution by mice in Groups II and III was significantly lower than in Group I. Furthermore, intake of this solution in Group III mice was significantly lower than in Group II mice. In the open field test, mice in Group III, showed reduced locomotor activity and reduced entry and retention time in the central zone, compared to Groups I and II mice. Moreover, the distances moved in 1 hour by Group III mice did not differ between night and morning. In the light/black box test, Groups II and III animals spent significantly less time in the light box compared to Group I animals. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the immobility times of Group II and Group III mice were significantly longer than in Group I mice. In addition, immobility times in the FST were significantly longer in Group III than in Group II mice. Conclusions/Significance: These findings show that social isolation-induced aggression could potentiate anxiety and depressive -like behaviors in isolated male mice subjected to CMS.

977,Signs of mood and anxiety disorders in chimpanzees,"Background: In humans, traumatic experiences are sometimes followed by psychiatric disorders. In chimpanzees, studies have demonstrated an association between traumatic events and the emergence of behavioral disturbances resembling posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We addressed the following central question: Do chimpanzees develop posttraumatic symptoms, in the form of abnormal behaviors, which cluster into syndromes similar to those described in human mood and anxiety disorders? Methodology/Principal Findings: In phase 1 of this study, we accessed case reports of chimpanzees who had been reportedly subjected to traumatic events, such as maternal separation, social isolation, experimentation, or similar experiences. We applied and tested DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and major depression to published case reports of 20 chimpanzees identified through PrimateLit. Additionally, using the DSM-IV criteria and ethograms as guides, we developed behaviorally anchored alternative criteria that were applied to the case reports. A small number of chimpanzees in the case studies met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and depression. Measures of inter-rater reliability, including Fleiss' kappa and percentage agreement, were higher with use of the alternative criteria for PTSD and depression. In phase 2, the alternative criteria were applied to chimpanzees living in wild sites in Africa (n = 196) and chimpanzees living in sanctuaries with prior histories of experimentation, orphanage, illegal seizure, or violent human conflict (n = 168). In phase 2, 58% of chimpanzees living in sanctuaries met the set of alternative criteria for depression, compared with 3% of chimpanzees in the wild (p = 0.04), and 44% of chimpanzees in sanctuaries met the set of alternative criteria for PTSD, compared with 0.5% of chimpanzees in the wild (p = 0.04). Conclusions/Significance: Chimpanzees display behavioral clusters similar to PTSD and depression in their key diagnostic criteria, underscoring the importance of ethical considerations regarding the use of chimpanzees in experimentation and other captive settings (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2011
978,Human papillomavirus infection and anxiety: Analyses in women with low-grade cervical cytological abnormalities unaware of their infection status,"Background: Women testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection experience increased levels of anxiety that have been attributed to fears of stigmatization and developing cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between HPV infection and anxiety in women who were unaware they had been tested specifically for HPV, to determine if any anxiety experienced by HPV-positive women could be due to causes other than learning of test results. Methods: This study was nested within a randomised controlled trial of management of women with abnormal cervical cytology conducted in the United Kingdom with recruitment between 1999 and 2002. At baseline, prior to having a sample taken for HPV testing, the results of which were not disclosed, women were assessed for anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and asked about fears of developing cervical cancer (“cancer worries”); this assessment was repeated at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of follow-up. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used for the cross-sectional (baseline) and longitudinal analyses, respectively. Results: Among the 2842 participants, there was no association between HPV status and anxiety among white women. Among non-white women, however, anxiety was less common among HPV-positive than HPV-negative women (adjusted odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.77). Among non-smokers, cancer worry was more common in HPV-positive than HPV-negative women; the opposite association was observed among ex-smokers. Conclusions: Associations between HPV status and anxiety may be explained by factors other than learning of test results and may vary by ethnicity and lifestyle factors.

979,A behavioral comparison of male and female adults with high functioning autism spectrum conditions,"Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) affect more males than females in the general population. However, within ASC it isunclear if there are phenotypic sex differences. Testing for similarities and differences between the sexes is important notonly for clinical assessment but also has implications for theories of typical sex differences and of autism. Using cognitiveand behavioral measures, we investigated similarities and differences between the sexes in age- and IQ-matched adults withASC (high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome). Of the 83 (45 males and 38 females) participants, 62 (33 males and 29females) met Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) cut-off criteria for autism in childhood and were included in allsubsequent analyses. The severity of childhood core autism symptoms did not differ between the sexes. Males and femalesalso did not differ in self-reported empathy, systemizing, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive traits/symptoms ormentalizing performance. However, adult females with ASC showed more lifetime sensory symptoms (p = 0.036), fewercurrent socio-communication difficulties (p = 0.001), and more self-reported autistic traits (p = 0.012) than males. In addition,females with ASC who also had developmental language delay had lower current performance IQ than those withoutdevelopmental language delay (p,0.001), a pattern not seen in males. The absence of typical sex differences inempathizing-systemizing profiles within the autism spectrum confirms a prediction from the extreme male brain theory.Behavioral sex differences within ASC may also reflect different developmental mechanisms between males and femaleswith ASC. We discuss the importance of the superficially better socio-communication ability in adult females with ASC interms of why females with ASC may more often go under-recognized, and receive their diagnosis later, than males.

980,The acceptability of internet-based treatment and characteristics of an adult sample with obsessive compulsive disorder: An internet survey,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling anxiety disorder, but most individuals delay seeking treatment. Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is an innovative service delivery method that may help to improve access to care, but the acceptability to consumers of such programs has not yet been established. Methodology: People with symptoms of OCD were invited to complete an online survey enquiring about demographic characteristics, symptom severity, and acceptability of Internet-based treatment. Demographic and symptom severity data were compared with people with OCD identified in a national epidemiological survey and with a sample of patients with OCD from a specialist outpatient anxiety clinic. Participants: 129 volunteers to an online Internet survey, 135 patients at a specialist anxiety disorders outpatient clinic, and 297 cases identified in a national epidemiological survey. Main Measures: Demographic characteristics, and severity of symptoms as measured by the Kessler 10-Item scale, the 12-item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule - Second Edition and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Self Report Version. Principal Findings: The Internet sample was similar demographically but reported more severe symptoms than the comparison groups, although had similar severity of symptoms of OCD compared with other clinical samples reported in the literature. Participants reported Internet-based treatment for OCD would be highly acceptable. Conclusions: Internet-based treatment may reduce barriers to accessing treatment to people with OCD. Individuals in this study were similar demographically to other samples and had similar severity of symptoms as those identified in other clinical samples, suggesting that Internet-based treatment using techniques employed in face-to-face treatment may be effective in this group. Internet-based treatments for OCD need to be developed and evaluated.

981,A propaganda index for reviewing problem framing in articles and manuscripts: An exploratory study,"Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an index in increasing recognition of misleading problem framing in articles and manuscripts. Design: A propaganda index consisting of 32 items was developed drawing on related literature. Seventeen subjects who review manuscripts for possible publication were requested to read five recent published reports of randomized controlled trials concerning social anxiety and to identify indicators of propaganda (defined as encouraging beliefs and actions with the least thought possible). They then re-read the same five articles using a propaganda index to note instances of propaganda. Data source: Convenience sample of individuals who review manuscripts for possible publication and sample of recent published reports of randomized controlled trials regarding social anxiety in five different journals by different authors, blinded by author and journal. Results: Data showed that there was a high rate of propagandistic problem framing in reports of RCTs regarding social anxiety such as hiding well argued alternative views and vagueness. This occurred in 117 out of 160 opportunities over five research reports. A convenience sample of 17 academics spotted only 4.5 percent of propaganda indicators. This increased to 64 percent with use of the 32 item propaganda index. Use of a propaganda index increased recognition of related indicators. However many instances remained undetected. Conclusion: This propaganda index warrants further exploration as a complement to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT and PRISMA.

982,Do psychological variables affect early surgical recovery?,"Background: Numerous studies have examined the effect of psychological variables on surgical recovery, but no definite conclusion has been reached yet. We sought to examine whether psychological factors influence early surgical recovery. Methods: We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases to identify studies examining the association of preoperative psychological variables or interventions with objectively measured, early surgical outcomes. Results: We identified 16 eligible studies, 15 of which reported a significant association between at least one psychological variable or intervention and an early postoperative outcome. However, most studies also reported psychological factors not influencing surgical recovery and there was significant heterogeneity across the studies. Overall, trait and state anxiety, state anger, active coping, subclinical depression, and intramarital hostility appeared to complicate recovery, while dispositional optimism, religiousness, anger control, low pain expectations, and external locus of control seemed to promote healing. Psychological interventions (guided relaxation, couple support visit, and psychiatric interview) also appeared to favor recovery. Psychological factors unrelated to surgical outcomes included loneliness, perceived social support, anger expression, and trait anger. Conclusion: Although the heterogeneity of the available evidence precludes any safe conclusions, psychological variables appear to be associated with early surgical recovery; this association could bear important implications for clinical practice. Large clinical trials and further analyses are needed to precisely evaluate the contribution of psychology in surgical recovery.

983,Gender difference of unconscious attentional bias in high trait anxiety individuals,"By combining binocular suppression technique and a probe detection paradigm, we investigated attentional bias to invisible stimuli and its gender difference in both high trait anxiety (HTA) and low trait anxiety (LTA) individuals. As an attentional cue, happy or fearful face pictures were presented to HTAs and LTAs for 800 ms either consciously or unconsciously (through binocular suppression). Participants were asked to judge the orientation of a gabor patch following the face pictures. Their performance was used to measure attentional effect induced by the cue. We found gender differences of attentional effect only in the unconscious condition with HTAs. Female HTAs exhibited difficulty in disengaging attention from the location where fearful faces were presented, while male HTAs showed attentional avoidance of it. Our results suggested that the failure to find attentional avoidance of threatening stimuli in many previous studies might be attributed to consciously presented stimuli and data analysis regardless of participants’ gender. These findings also contributed to our understanding of gender difference in anxiety disorder.

984,Intermittent hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits are mediated by NADPH oxidase activity in a murine model of sleep apnea,"Background: In rodents, exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with neurobehavioral impairments, increased apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as increased oxidant stress and inflammation. Excessive NADPH oxidase activity may play a role in IH-induced CNS dysfunction. Methods and Findings: The effect of IH during light period on two forms of spatial learning in the water maze and well as markers of oxidative stress was assessed in mice lacking NADPH oxidase activity ( gp91phox _/Y ) and wild-type littermates. On a standard place training task, gp91phox _/Y displayed normal learning, and were protected from the spatial learning deficits observed in wild-type littermates exposed to IH. Moreover, anxiety levels were increased in wild-type mice exposed to IH as compared to room air (RA) controls, while no changes emerged in gp91phox _/Y mice. Additionally, wild-type mice, but not gp91phox _/Y mice had significantly elevated levels of NADPH oxidase expression and activity, as well as MDA and 8-OHDG in cortical and hippocampal lysates following IH exposures. Conclusions: The oxidative stress responses and neurobehavioral impairments induced by IH during sleep are mediated, at least in part, by excessive NADPH oxidase activity, and thus pharmacological agents targeting NADPH oxidase may provide a therapeutic strategy in sleep-disordered breathing.

985,Predicting impaired extinction of traumatic memory and elevated startle,"Background: Emotionally traumatic experiences can lead to debilitating anxiety disorders, such as phobias and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Exposure to such experiences, however, is not sufficient to induce pathology, as only up to one quarter of people exposed to such events develop PTSD. These statistics, combined with findings that smaller hippocampal size prior to the trauma is associated with higher risk of developing PTSD, suggest that there are pre-disposing factors for such pathology. Because prospective studies in humans are limited and costly, investigating such pre-dispositions, and thus advancing understanding of the genesis of such pathologies, requires the use of animal models where predispositions are identified before the emotional trauma. Most existing animal models are retrospective: they classify subjects as those with or without a PTSD-like phenotype long after experiencing a traumatic event. Attempts to create prospective animal models have been largely unsuccessful. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that individual predispositions to a PTSD-like phenotype, consisting of impaired rate and magnitude of extinction of an emotionally traumatic event coupled with long-lasting elevation of acoustic startle responses, can be revealed following exposure to a mild stressor, but before experiencing emotional trauma. We compare, in rats, the utility of several classification criteria and report that a combination of criteria based on acoustic startle responses and behavior in an anxiogenic environment is a reliable predictor of a PTSD-like phenotype. Conclusions/Significance: There are individual predispositions to developing impaired extinction and elevated acoustic startle that can be identified after exposure to a mildly stressful event, which by itself does not induce such a behavioral phenotype. The model presented here is a valuable tool for studying the etiology and pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and provides a platform for testing behavioral and pharmacological interventions that can reduce the probability of developing pathologic behaviors associated with such disorders.

986,"Transient gastric irritation in the neonatal rats leads to changes in hypothalamic CRF expression, depression and anxiety-like behavior as adults","Aims: A disturbance of the brain-gut axis is a prominent feature in functional bowel disorders (such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) and psychological abnormalities are often implicated in their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that psychological morbidity in these conditions may result from gastrointestinal problems, rather than causing them. Methods: Functional dyspepsia was induced by neonatal gastric irritation in male rats. 10-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.1% iodoacetamide (IA) or vehicle by oral gavage for 6 days. At 8–10 weeks of age, rats were tested with sucrose preference and forced-swimming tests to examine depression-like behavior. Elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box tests were used to test anxiety-like behaviors. ACTH and corticosterone responses to a minor stressor, saline injection, and hypothalamic CRF expression were also measured. Results: Behavioral tests revealed changes of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in IA-treated, but not control rats. As compared with controls, hypothalamic and amygdaloid CRF immunoreactivity, basal levels of plasma corticosterone and stress-induced ACTH were significantly higher in IA-treated rats. Gastric sensory ablation with resiniferatoxin had no effect on behaviors but treatment with CRF type 1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, reversed the depression-like behavior in IA-treated rats. Conclusions: The present results suggest that transient gastric irritation in the neonatal period can induce a long lasting increase in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, increased expression of CRF in the hypothalamus, and an increased sensitivity of HPA axis to stress. The depression-like behavior may be mediated by the CRF1 receptor. These findings have significant implications for the pathogenesis of psychological co-morbidity in patients with functional bowel disorders.

987,Psychological balance in high level athletes: Gender-based differences and sport-specific patterns,"Objectives: Few epidemiological studies have focused on the psychological health of high level athletes. This study aimed to identify the principal psychological problems encountered within French high level athletes, and the variations in their prevalence based on sex and the sport practiced. Methods: Multivariate analyses were conducted on nationwide data obtained from the athletes’ yearly psychological evaluations. Results: A representative sample of 13% of the French athlete population was obtained. 17% of athletes have at least one ongoing or recent disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) being the most prevalent (6%), followed by non-specific eating disorders (4.2%). Overall, 20.2% of women had at least one psychopathology, against 15.1% in men. This female predominance applied to anxiety and eating disorders, depression, sleep problems and self-harming behaviors. The highest rates of GAD appeared in aesthetic sports (16.7% vs. 6.8% in other sports for men and 38.9% vs. 10.3% for women); the lowest prevalence was found in high risk sports athletes (3.0% vs. 3.5%). Eating disorders are most common among women in racing sports (14% vs. 9%), but for men were found mostly in combat sports (7% vs. 4.8%). Discussion: This study highlights important differences in psychopathology between male and female athletes, demonstrating that the many sex-based differences reported in the general population apply to elite athletes. While the prevalence of psychological problems is no higher than in the general population, the variations in psychopathology in different sports suggest that specific constraints could influence the development of some disorders.

988,Do stress responses promote leukemia progression? An animal study suggesting a role for epinephrine and prostaglandin-E₂ through reduced NK activity,"In leukemia patients, stress and anxiety were suggested to predict poorer prognosis. Oncological patients experience ample physiological and psychological stress, potentially leading to increased secretion of stress factors, including epinephrine, corticosteroids, and prostaglandins. Here we tested whether environmental stress and these stress factors impact survival of leukemia-challenged rats, and studied mediating mechanisms. F344 rats were administered with a miniscule dose of 60 CRNK-16 leukemia cells, and were subjected to intermittent forced swim stress or to administration of physiologically relevant doses of epinephrine, prostaglandin-E₂ or corticosterone. Stress and each stress factor, and/or their combinations, doubled mortality rates when acutely applied simultaneously with, or two or six days after tumor challenge. Acute administration of the β-adrenergic blocker nadolol diminished the effects of environmental stress, without affecting baseline survival rates. Prolonged β-adrenergic blockade or COX inhibition (using etodolac) also increased baseline survival rates, possibly by blocking tumor-related or normal levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins. Searching for mediating mechanisms, we found that each of the stress factors transiently suppressed NK activity against CRNK-16 and YAC-1 lines on a per NK basis. In contrast, the direct effects of stress factors on CRNK-16 proliferation, vitality, and VEGF secretion could not explain or even contradicted the in vivo survival findings. Overall, it seems that environmental stress, epinephrine, and prostaglandins promote leukemia progression in rats, potentially through suppressing cell mediated immunity. Thus, patients with hematological malignancies, which often exhibit diminished NK activity, may benefit from extended β-blockade and COX inhibition.

989,"Unstable maternal environment, separation anxiety, and heightened CO₂ sensitivity induced by gene-by-environment interplay","Background: In man, many different events implying childhood separation from caregivers/unstable parental environment are associated with heightened risk for panic disorder in adulthood. Twin data show that the occurrence of such events in childhood contributes to explaining the covariation between separation anxiety disorder, panic, and the related psychobiological trait of CO₂ hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that early interference with infant-mother interaction could moderate the interspecific trait of response to CO₂ through genetic control of sensitivity to the environment. Methodology: Having spent the first 24 hours after birth with their biological mother, outbred NMRI mice were crossfostered to adoptive mothers for the following 4 post-natal days. They were successively compared to normally-reared individuals for: number of ultrasonic vocalizations during isolation, respiratory physiology responses to normal air (20%O₂), CO₂-enriched air (6% CO₂), hypoxic air (10%O₂), and avoidance of CO₂-enriched environments. Results: Cross-fostered pups showed significantly more ultrasonic vocalizations, more pronounced hyperventilatory responses (larger tidal volume and minute volume increments) to CO₂-enriched air and heightened aversion towards CO₂- enriched environments, than normally-reared individuals. Enhanced tidal volume increment response to 6%CO₂ was present at 16–20, and 75–90 postnatal days, implying the trait’s stability. Quantitative genetic analyses of unrelated individuals, sibs and half-sibs, showed that the genetic variance for tidal volume increment during 6%CO₂ breathing was significantly higher (Bartlett x = 8.3, p = 0.004) among the cross-fostered than the normally-reared individuals, yielding heritability of 0.37 and 0.21 respectively. These results support a stress-diathesis model whereby the genetic influences underlying the response to 6%CO₂ increase their contribution in the presence of an environmental adversity. Maternal grooming/licking behaviour, and corticosterone basal levels were similar among cross-fostered and normally-reared individuals. Conclusions: A mechanism of gene-by-environment interplay connects this form of early perturbation of infant-mother interaction, heightened CO₂ sensitivity and anxiety. Some non-inferential physiological measurements can enhance animal models of human neurodevelopmental anxiety disorders.

Many studies have reported undertreatment with antidepressants in primary care. Recently, some studies also reported overtreatment with antidepressants. The present study was designed to assess whether treatment with antidepressants in primary care is in accordance with current guidelines, with a special focus on overtreatment. Methodology: We used baseline data of primary care respondents from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (n = 1610). Seventy-nine patients with treatment in secondary care were excluded. We assessed justification for treatment with antidepressant according to the Dutch primary care guidelines for depression and for anxiety disorders. Use of antidepressants was based on drug-container inspection or, if unavailable, on self-report. Results were recalculated to the original population of primary care patients from which the participants in NESDA were selected (n = 10,677). Principal Findings: Of 1531 included primary care patients, 199 (13%) used an antidepressant, of whom 188 (94.5%) (possibly) justified. After recalculating these numbers to the original population (n = 10,677), we found 908 (95% CI 823 to 994) antidepressant users. Forty-nine (95% CI 20 to 78) of them (5.4%) had no current justification for an antidepressant, but 27 of them (54.5%) had a justified reason for an antidepressant at some earlier point in their life. Conclusions: We found that overtreatment with antidepressants in primary care is not a frequent problem. Too long continuation of treatment seems to explain the largest proportion of overtreatment as opposed to inappropriate initiation of treatment.

991,Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy vs. cognitive behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial,"Background and Aims: Cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) is an effective, well-established, but not widely available treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has the potential to increase availability and facilitate dissemination of therapeutic services for SAD. However, ICBT for SAD has not been directly compared with in-person treatments such as CBGT and few studies investigating ICBT have been conducted in clinical settings. Our aim was to investigate if ICBT is at least as effective as CBGT for SAD when treatments are delivered in a psychiatric setting. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with allocation to ICBT (n = 64) or CBGT (n = 62) with blinded assessment immediately following treatment and six months post-treatment. Participants were 126 individuals with SAD who received CBGT or ICBT for a duration of 15 weeks. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was the main outcome measure. The following non-inferiority margin was set: following treatment, the lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference between groups should be less than 10 LSAS-points. Results: Both groups made large improvements. At follow-up, 41 (64%) participants in the ICBT group were classified as responders (95% CI, 52%–76%). In the CBGT group, 28 participants (45%) responded to the treatment (95% CI, 33%–58%). At post-treatment and follow-up respectively, the 95 % CI of the LSAS mean difference was 0.68–17.66 (Cohen’s d between group = 0.41) and −2.51–15.69 (Cohen’s d between group = 0.36) favoring ICBT, which was well within the non-inferiority margin. Mixed effects models analyses showed no significant interaction effect for LSAS, indicating similar improvement across treatments ( F = 1.58; df = 2, 219; p = .21). Conclusions: ICBT delivered in a psychiatric setting can be as effective as CBGT in the treatment of SAD and could be used to increase availability to CBT.

992,The relationship between the Val158Met catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism and irritable bowel syndrome,"Background: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme has a key function in the degradation of catecholamines and a functional polymorphism is val158met. The val/val genotype results in a three to fourfold higher enzymatic activity compared with the met/met genotype, with the val/met genotype exhibiting intermediate activity. Since pain syndromes as well as anxiety and depression are associated to low and high COMT activity respectively and these conditions are all associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) we wanted for the first time to explore the relationship between the polymorphism and IBS. Methodology/Principal Findings: 867 subjects (445 women) representative of the general population and 70 consecutively sampled patients with IBS (61 women) were genotyped for the val158met polymorphism and the IBS patients filled out the Hospital-Anxiety-and-Depression-Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and an IBS symptom diary. Results: There was a significantly higher occurrence of the val/val genotype in patients compared with controls (30% vs 20%; Chi² (1) 3.98; p = 0.046) and a trend toward a lower occurrence of the val/met genotype in IBS patients compared with controls (39% vs 49%; Chi² (1) 2.89; p = 0.089). Within the IBS patients the val/val carriers exhibited significantly increased bowel frequency (2.6 vs 1.8 stools per day; Chi² (1) 5.3; p = 0.03) and a smaller proportion of stools with incomplete defecation (41% vs 68%; Chi² (1) 4.3; p = 0.04) compared with the rest (val/met+met/met carriers). The val/val carriers also showed a trend for a smaller proportion of hard stools (0% vs 15%; Chi² (1) 3.2; p = 0.08) and a higher frequency of postprandial defecation (26% vs 21%; Chi² (1) 3.0; p = 0.08). Conclusions/Significance: In this study we found an association between the val/val genotype of the val158met COMT gene and IBS as well as to specific IBS related bowel pattern in IBS patients.

993,"Association of gender with clinical expression, quality of life, disability, and depression and anxiety in patients with systemic sclerosis","Objectives: To assess the association of gender with clinical expression, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability, and self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods: SSc patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology and/or the Leroy and Medsger criteria were assessed for clinical symptoms, disability, HRQoL, self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety by specific measurement scales. Results: Overall, 381 SSc patients (62 males) were included. Mean age and disease duration at the time of evaluation were 55.9 (13.3) and 9.5 (7.8) years, respectively. One-hundred-and-forty-nine (40.4%) patients had diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). On bivariate analysis, differences were observed between males and females for clinical symptoms and self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, however without reaching statistical significance. Indeed, a trend was found for higher body mass index (BMI) (25.0 [4.1] vs 23.0 [4.5], p = 0.013), more frequent dcSSc, echocardiography systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt;35 mmHg and interstitial lung disease in males than females (54.8% vs 37.2%, p = 0.010; 24.2% vs 10.5%, p = 0.003; and 54.8% vs 41.2%, p = 0.048, respectively), whereas calcinosis and self-reported anxiety symptoms tended to be more frequent in females than males (36.0% vs 21.4%, p = 0.036, and 62.3% vs 43.5%, p = 0.006, respectively). On multivariate analysis, BMI, echocardiography PAP&gt;35 mmHg, and anxiety were the variables most closely associated with gender. Conclusions: In SSc patients, male gender tends to be associated with diffuse disease and female gender with calcinosis and self-reported symptoms of anxiety. Disease-associated disability and HRQoL were similar in both groups.

994,Three-dimensional neurophenotyping of adult zebrafish behavior,"The use of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in neurobehavioral research is rapidly expanding. The present large-scale study applied the newest video-tracking and data-mining technologies to further examine zebrafish anxiety-like phenotypes. Here, we generated temporal and spatial three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion, globally assessed behavioral profiles evoked by several anxiogenic and anxiolytic manipulations, mapped individual endpoints to 3D reconstructions, and performed cluster analysis to reconfirm behavioral correlates of high- and low-anxiety states. The application of 3D swim path reconstructions consolidates behavioral data (while increasing data density) and provides a novel way to examine and represent zebrafish behavior. It also enables rapid optimization of video tracking settings to improve quantification of automated parameters, and suggests that spatiotemporal organization of zebrafish swimming activity can be affected by various experimental manipulations in a manner predicted by their anxiolytic or anxiogenic nature. Our approach markedly enhances the power of zebrafish behavioral analyses, providing innovative framework for high-throughput 3D phenotyping of adult zebrafish behavior.

995,Enhanced fear expression in a psychopathological mouse model of trait anxiety: Pharmacological interventions,"The propensity to develop an anxiety disorder is thought to be determined by genetic and environmental factors. Here we investigated the relationship between a genetic predisposition to trait anxiety and experience-based learned fear in a psychopathological mouse model. Male CD-1 mice selectively bred for either high (HAB), or normal (NAB) anxiety-related behaviour on the elevated plus maze were subjected to classical fear conditioning. During conditioning both mouse lines showed increased fear responses as assessed by freezing behaviour. However, 24 h later, HAB mice displayed more pronounced conditioned responses to both a contextual or cued stimulus when compared with NAB mice. Interestingly, 6 h and already 1 h after fear conditioning, freezing levels were high in HAB mice but not in NAB mice. These results suggest that trait anxiety determines stronger fear memory and/or a weaker ability to inhibit fear responses in the HAB line. The enhanced fear response of HAB mice was attenuated by treatment with either the α 2,3,5 -subunit selective benzodiazepine partial agonist L-838,417, corticosterone or the selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist L-822,429. Overall, the HAB mouse line may represent an interesting model (i) for identifying biological factors underlying misguided conditioned fear responses and (ii) for studying novel anxiolytic pharmacotherapies for patients with fear-associated disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias.

996,Mental health problems among children one-year after Sichuan earthquake in China: A follow-up study,"Background: On May 12, 2008, a destructive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale struck Sichuan Province, southwest China. Beichuan County was the epicenter which was one of the areas nearly completely destroyed by the earthquake. In Beichuan, about 15,000 people died and 3,000 people were missing. Specially, the earthquake took 1,587 students’ and 214 teachers’ lives from the elementary and middle schools there. The main purpose of the study was to provide a better understanding of mental health problems and associated risk factors among children after earthquake. Method: Three hundred and thirty grades 3–5 children completed the questionnaire of disaster–related experience and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children-Alternate Version (TSCC-A). The first survey was carried out six months after the earthquake, and the second one was carried out six months later. The measurements and methodology applied in the two sessions were identical. Results: The prevalence rates of the problems at two time-points were 23.3% and 22.7% for anxiety, 14.5% and 16.1% for depression, and 11.2% and 13.4% for PTSD, respectively. Among demographic variables, no significant age difference existed, while it was found that 6 months after the earthquake, symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were significantly more common among students in grades 4 and 5 than those in grade 3, Initial exposure to death, bereavement and extreme fear were significant predictive factors for the occurrence of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Conclusions: Findings of this study suggest that posttraumatic mental health problems after natural disaster in children may have reached epidemic proportions and remain high for a long period. Psychologist and social workers should pay more attention to children who experienced more traumatic stresses and provide appropriate mental health interventions. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed.

997,Precursor or sequela: Pathological disorders in people with Internet addiction disorder,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the roles of pathological disorders in Internet addiction disorder and identify the pathological problems in IAD, as well as explore the mental status of Internet addicts prior to addiction, including the pathological traits that may trigger Internet addiction disorder. Methods and Findings: 59 students were measured by Symptom Checklist-90 before and after they became addicted to the Internet. A comparison of collected data from Symptom Checklist-90 before Internet addiction and the data collected after Internet addiction illustrated the roles of pathological disorders among people with Internet addiction disorder. The obsessive-compulsive dimension was found abnormal before they became addicted to the Internet. After their addiction, significantly higher scores were observed for dimensions on depression, anxiety, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, and psychoticism, suggesting that these were outcomes of Internet addiction disorder. Dimensions on somatisation, paranoid ideation, and phobic anxiety did not change during the study period, signifying that these dimensions are not related to Internet addiction disorder. Conclusions: We can not find a solid pathological predictor for Internet addiction disorder. Internet addiction disorder may bring some pathological problems to the addicts in some ways.

998,Human stiff-person syndrome IgG induces anxious behavior in rats,"Background: Anxiety is a heterogeneous behavioral domain playing a role in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. While anxiety is the cardinal symptom in disorders such as panic disorder, co-morbid anxious behavior can occur in a variety of diseases. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a CNS disorder characterized by increased muscle tone and prominent agoraphobia and anxiety. Most patients have high-titer antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65. The pathogenic role of these autoantibodies is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: We re-investigated a 53 year old woman with SPS and profound anxiety for GABA-A receptor binding in the amygdala with (11)C-flumazenil PET scan and studied the potential pathogenic role of purified IgG from her plasma filtrates containing high-titer antibodies against GAD 65. We passively transferred the IgG fraction intrathecally into rats and analyzed the effects using behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological methods. In cell culture, we measured the effect of patient IgG on GABA release from hippocampal neurons. Repetitive intrathecal application of purified patient IgG in rats resulted in an anxious phenotype resembling the core symptoms of the patient. Patient IgG selectively bound to rat amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortical areas. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, patient IgG inhibited GABA release. In line with these experimental results, the GABA-A receptor binding potential was reduced in the patient's amygdala/hippocampus complex. No motor abnormalities were found in recipient rats. Conclusion/Significance: The observations in rats after passive transfer lead us to propose that anxiety-like behavior can be induced in rats by passive transfer of IgG from a SPS patient positive for anti-GAD 65 antibodies. Anxiety, in this case, thus may be an antibody-mediated phenomenon with consecutive disturbance of GABAergic signaling in the amygdala region.

999,Reliability and validity of the Ethiopian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in HIV infected patients,"Background: The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) is a widely used instrument for evaluating psychological distress from anxiety and depression. HADS has not yet been validated in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Amharic (Ethiopian language) version of HADs among HIV infected patients. Methods: The translated scale was administered to 302 HIV/AIDS patients on follow up for and taking anti-retroviral treatment. Consistency assessment was conducted using Cronbach’s alpha, test-retest reliability using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Construct validity was examined using principal components analysis (PCA). Parallel analysis, Kaiser’s criterion and the scree test were used for factor extraction. Results: The internal consistency was 0.78 for the anxiety, 0.76 for depression subscales and 0.87 for the full scale of HADS. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 80%, 86%, and 84% for the anxiety and depression subscales, and total score respectively. PCA revealed a one dimensional scale. Conclusion: This preliminary validation study of the Ethiopian version of the HADs indicates that it has promising acceptability, reliability and validity. The adopted scale has a single underlying dimension as indicated by Razavi’s model. The HADS can be used to examine psychological distress in HIV infected patients. Findings are discussed and recommendations made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2011
104,"A prospective cohort study investigating associations between hyperemesis gravidarum and cognitive, behavioural and emotional well-being in pregnancy","Objectives: To investigate the association between hyperemesis gravidarum and altered cognitive, behavioural and emotional well-being in pregnancy. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 3423 nulliparous women recruited in the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study performed in Auckland, New Zealand; Adelaide, Australia; Cork, Ireland; Manchester and London, United Kingdom between November 2004 and August 2008. Women were interviewed at 15 ± 1 weeks’ gestation and at 20 ± 1weeks’ gestation. Women with a diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) were compared with women who did not have a diagnosis of HG. Main outcome measures included the Short form State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score (range 6–24), Perceived Stress Scale score (PSS, range 0–30), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score (range 0–30 or categories a–c) and behavioural responses to pregnancy score (limiting/resting [range 0–20] and all-or-nothing [range 0–28]). Results: During the study period 164 women suffered from HG prior to their 15 week interview. Women with HG had significantly higher mean STAI, PSS, EPDS and limiting response to pregnancy scores compared to women without HG. These differences were observed at both 15 ± 1 and 20 ± 1 weeks’ of gestation. The magnitude of these differences was greater in women with severe HG compared to all women with HG. Women with severe HG had an increased risk of having a spontaneous preterm birth compared with women without HG (adjusted OR 2.6 [95% C.I. 1.2, 5.7]). Conclusion: This is the first large prospective study on women with HG. Women with HG, particularly severe HG, are at increased risk of cognitive, behavioural and emotional dysfunction in pregnancy. Women with severe HG had a higher rate of spontaneous preterm birth compared to women without HG. Further research is required to determine whether the provision of emotional support for women with HG is beneficial.

105,Fluoxetine exerts age-dependent effects on behavior and amygdala neuroplasticity in the rat,"The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) Prozac ® (fluoxetine) is the only registered antidepressant to treat depression in children and adolescents. Yet, while the safety of SSRIs has been well established in adults, serotonin exerts neurotrophic actions in the developing brain and thereby may have harmful effects in adolescents. Here we treated adolescent and adult rats chronically with fluoxetine (12 mg/kg) at postnatal day (PND) 25 to 46 and from PND 67 to 88, respectively, and tested the animals 7–14 days after the last injection when (nor)fluoxetine in blood plasma had been washed out, as determined by HPLC. Plasma (nor)fluoxetine levels were also measured 5 hrs after the last fluoxetine injection, and matched clinical levels. Adolescent rats displayed increased behavioral despair in the forced swim test, which was not seen in adult fluoxetine treated rats. In addition, beneficial effects of fluoxetine on wakefulness as measured by electroencephalography in adults was not seen in adolescent rats, and age-dependent effects on the acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition were observed. On the other hand, adolescent rats showed resilience to the anorexic effects of fluoxetine. Exploratory behavior in the open field test was not affected by fluoxetine treatment, but anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze test were increased in both adolescent and adult fluoxetine treated rats. Finally, in the amygdala, but not the dorsal raphe nucleus and medial prefrontal cortex, the number of PSA-NCAM (marker for synaptic remodeling) immunoreactive neurons was increased in adolescent rats, and decreased in adult rats, as a consequence of chronic fluoxetine treatment. No fluoxetine-induced changes in 5-HT 1A receptor immunoreactivity were observed. In conclusion, we show that fluoxetine exerts both harmful and beneficial age-dependent effects on depressive behavior, body weight and wakefulness, which may relate, in part, to differential fluoxetine-induced neuroplasticity in the amygdala.

869,Gender differences in firesetting: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"This study presents gender differences in sociodemographics and in psychiatric correlates of firesetting in the United States. Data were derived from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a representative sample of U.S. adults. Face-to-face interviews of more than 43,000 adults were conducted in the 2001–2002 period. This study focused on the 407 subjects with a lifetime history of firesetting. The prevalence of lifetime firesetting in the U.S. was 1.7% in men and 0.4% in women. Firesetting was significantly associated with a wide range of antisocial behaviors that differed by gender. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated associations in both genders with psychiatric and addictive disorders. Men with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than men without such history to have lifetime generalized anxiety disorder as well as a diagnosis of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol or cannabis use disorder, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Women with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than women without such history to have lifetime alcohol or cannabis use disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial or obsessive compulsive personality disorder, as well as psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder or schizoid personality disorder. Women with a lifetime history of firesetting were significantly more likely than men with such history to have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse and antisocial personality disorder as well as a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder. Our findings indicate that firesetting in women could represent a behavioral manifestation of a broader spectrum than firesetting in men.

870,Psychosocial and neurocognitive profiles in depressed patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder,"Previous studies have revealed psychosocial and cognitive impairments in patients during depression. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) differ in psychosocial and neurocognitive profiles. A second aim was to examine whether cognitive impairments are homogeneous among depressed patients. Patients with MDD ( n = 16) and BD ( n = 14) were enrolled during a major depressive episode. About half of them had comorbidities, including personality, substance use, and anxiety disorders. Information was collected about symptomatology and psychosocial functioning, whereas an exhaustive neuropsychological battery was administered to assess cognition. During a depressive episode, MDD and BD patients had global psychosocial dysfunction, characterized by occupational and relational impairments. A cognitive slowing was also observed, as well as deficits related to alertness, spontaneous flexibility, sustained and divided attention. Moreover, severity of depression and cognitive functions were significantly associated with psychosocial functioning. In the case of severe mood disorders, psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning seem similar among MDD and BD patients during a depressive episode. In addition to an altered daily functioning, the neurocognitive profile was heterogeneous with regard to the nature and extent of cognitive deficits. Executive functions, as well as verbal learning and memory, were preserved better than attentional processes.

871,Impulsivity and internalizing disorders in childhood,"Impulsivity has often been related to externalizing disorders, but little is known about how it is related to symptoms of internalizing disorders. This study aims to examine the relationship between impulsivity and depression and anxiety symptoms of depression and anxiety in childhood, and compare it with its relationship with a measure of aggressive behavior, which is present in many externalizing disorders. We administered the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 for children, the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Children's Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders to a case–control sample of 562 children aged between 9 and 13 who were selected from an epidemiological study of anxiety and depression and whose teachers provided information about their proactive and reactive aggression. Impulsivity was related to measures of anxiety, depression and aggressive behavior, and showed higher relationships with measures of internalizing symptoms than with aggression. Motor impulsivity, a component of impulsivity related to inhibition deficits, was the component most related to anxiety and depression. Cognitive impulsivity, on the other hand, was negatively related to anxiety and depression. The relationships between impulsivity and symptoms of internalizing disorders seem to indicate that impulsivity should be taken into account not only in externalizing problems, but also in depression and anxiety in children and adolescents.

872,One-year severity of depressive symptoms: Results from the NESDA Study,"The aim of this study was to simultaneously examine a wide range of risk factors and clinical characteristics in their predictive value for the 1-year severity of depressive symptoms. Data from 789 participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), a large psychiatric cohort study, with a major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline were used. Depression severity at 1-year follow-up was studied using linear and multinomial logistic regression models. Results of the analyses showed that high neuroticism, no partner and older age were found predictive of a poorer outcome independent of baseline clinical characteristics. Further, comorbid anxiety disorder, first episode, having a moderate subtype (vs. melancholic), and higher baseline depression severity predicted poorer outcome. To conclude, both risk factors and clinical characteristics independently predicted 1-year severity of depressive symptoms. The findings indicate that the prediction of prognosis and identification of persons at risk of a poor outcome should not only be based on clinical characteristics, but on risk factors as well.

873,Dysfunctional distracter inhibition and facilitation for sad faces in depressed individuals,"Depression is a commonly occurring mental disorder, which is characterized by dysfunctional inhibition and facilitation for emotional stimuli. The aim of the present study was to investigate distracter inhibition and facilitation for emotional faces in depressed individuals in a negative affective priming task. Control participants who had never suffered from depression (NC), sub-clinically depressed participants, and participants diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (MDD), Anxiety Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Score were recruited using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck and DSM-IV as tools. Twenty-four participants in each group completed a negative affective priming task. The main finding was that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the positive and negative priming effects of happy faces. However, there were significant differences for positive and negative priming effects of sad faces between each pair of groups, with the effects being lowest for MDD and highest for NC participants. It can be concluded that depressed individuals are characterized by enhanced facilitation and deficient inhibition for negative materials, which is a stable cognitive vulnerability risk, possibly associated with the occurrence of depression. There are differences in the cognitive dysfunction for negative stimuli between clinically depressed and sub-clinically depressed individuals.

874,Cigarette smoking in outpatients with chronic schizophrenia in Taiwan: Relationships to socio-demographic and clinical characteristics,"In individuals with schizophrenia, the prevalence of cigarette smoking is significantly higher than that of the general population; this appears to be associated with specific psychosocial and clinical characteristics. Indeed, some evidence suggests an increased risk of suicide among smokers with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of smokers with schizophrenia in Taiwan. In this cross-sectional study, 95 outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited and independently interviewed for nicotine dependency with tobacco use. The effects of cigarette smoking on the various measures, especially suicidality, were investigated. The results revealed that smokers with schizophrenia had higher rates of hospitalization, lifetime suicide attempts, antipsychotic treatment side effects, psychopathology, impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk than non-smokers with schizophrenia. When separate analyses were conducted in male and female patients, depressive symptoms were significant predictors of suicidality among males, whereas heavy smoking, anxious symptoms, and hopelessness were significant predictors among females. From this study, we may gain insights into the role of cigarette smoking in patients of schizophrenia in Taiwan. Furthermore, cigarette smoking may influence aspects of suicidality in schizophrenia.

875,"History of suicide attempt in male substance-dependent inpatients and relationship to borderline personality features, anger, hostility and aggression","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between severity of borderline personality features and history of suicide attempt (HSA) in male substance-dependent inpatients and the effect of anger, hostility and aggression on this relationship. Further, the effect of some variables that may be related to suicide and/or borderline personality, such as age at inception of regular substance use, substance of dependence (alcohol/drug), depression, and both state and trait anxiety, were controlled. Participants were 200 consecutively admitted male substance-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Among substance-dependent inpatients, 33.0% ( n = 66) were identified as the group with HSA. Mean scores employment status,marital status and duration of education did not differ between groups, whereas current age and age at onset of regular substance use were lower in group with HSA. Mean scores of BPI, AQ and its subscales (anger, hostility and physical/verbal aggression), BDI and STAI were higher in the HSA group. In addition, the rates of drug dependency and borderline personality disorder were higher in this group. The severity of borderline personality symptoms was highly correlated with subscales of the AQ, depression and anxiety, whereas it was negatively correlated with age at onset of regular substance use. The severity of anger and borderline personality features predicted HSA in the logistic regression model. Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of suicide attempt among substance-dependent patients, the feeling of anger must be the target of evaluation and treatment among those with borderline personality features.

876,Assessment of empathy in first-episode psychosis and meta-analytic comparison with previous studies in schizophrenia,"Empathy is a multidimensional construct that relies on affective and cognitive component processes. A few studies have reported impairments of both cognitive and affective empathy components in patients with schizophrenia. It is, however, not known whether these difficulties are already present at psychosis onset. The affective and cognitive components of empathy were thus assessed in 31 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 31 matched healthy controls using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Our results were then compared to previous studies of empathy in patients with more chronic schizophrenia via a meta-analysis. In addition, we also assessed the relationship between empathy ratings, Mentalizing performance and clinical symptoms. Contrary to what has been reported in people with more chronic schizophrenia, the IRI ratings did not significantly differ between FEP and controls in our study, though a trend was observed for the Personal distress scale. For the Perspective taking scale, our meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower effect size in this study with FEP patients relative to previous schizophrenia studies. In the FEP group, the IRI ratings were not related to positive, negative or general psychopathology symptoms, but a significant relationship emerged between the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Perspective taking (negative correlation). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between the Empathic concern subscale and our theory of mind task. This study supports the idea that the cognitive component of empathy is less affected in patients with first-episode psychosis relative to patients with more chronic schizophrenia, and the impairments reported in previous reports with more chronic populations should be interpreted in light of a possible deterioration of this cognitive skill. The findings also provide some insight into the relationship between empathy and clinical symptoms such as social anxiety.

877,Varenicline prevents affective and cognitive exacerbation during smoking abstinence in male patients with schizophrenia,"To explore the effects of varenicline on the psychopathology and cognition of chronic inpatients with schizophrenia, we conducted a non-randomized control group time series investigation between March 2009 and April 2010. In a mandatory smoking cessation intervention, 41 male inpatient smokers were scheduled to undergo either a 5-week varenicline treatment (varenicline group) or the use of no drugs (non-treatment group). Depression (HAM-D), anxiety (HAM-A), and psychosis (PANSS) were evaluated at baseline, and at the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th week after abstinence; four neuropsychological tests, including Digit Span Forward and Backward (DSF and DSB), and Trail Making Test-A and -B, were evaluated at baseline and at the 4th, 8th and 12th week. .Thirty patients completed the study. Among 15 patients in the non-treatment group, the HAM-D, HAM-A, DSF, and DSB scores were exacerbated during the 2–8 weeks of abstinence, but there were no changes in psychotic symptoms and the other two neuropsychological tests. Compared with the non-treatment group, varenicline users experienced less impairment in HAM-D and HAM-A scores at the 2nd and 4th weeks, and in DSF tasks at the 4th week after abstinence. In conclusions, varenicline can attenuate abstinence-induced adverse outcomes and appears to be well-tolerated in smokers with schizophrenia.

878,Correlates of perceptual distortions in clinical and non-clinical populations using the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS): Associations with anxiety and depression and a re-validation using a representative population sample,"Although the literature on hallucinations in psychiatric patients shows clear links with anxiety and depression, associations of affect with a wider array of anomalous perceptual experiences have been much less studied. This study investigated patients with psychosis (N=29) and a non-clinical population (N=193) using the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS), a measure of perceptual distortion and associated distress, intrusiveness and frequency; along with measures of depression, anxiety and worry. The study also allowed a re-validation of the CAPS in a more representative sample of the UK population. Moderate, reliable correlations with depression, anxiety and worry were found in the non-clinical population with the association being stronger in psychotic patients. The study re-confirmed that anomalous perceptual experiences are common in the general population and that a significant minority (11.9%) have higher levels than the mean of psychotic patients. Scale reliability and validity were also re-confirmed, and the CAPS score was found to be unrelated to age or gender in either sample. As in the original study, factor analysis produced a three-factor solution, although factor theme was not fully replicated: as before, a cluster of first-rank symptoms emerged, but with equivocal evidence for a temporal lobe factor and no replication of a ‘chemosensation’ component.

879,Healthy people with delusional ideation change their mind with conviction,"Emotional distress and reasoning biases are two factors known to contribute to delusions. As a step towards elucidating mechanisms underlying delusions, the main aim of this study was to evaluate a possible “jumping to new conclusions” reasoning bias in healthy people with delusional ideation and its association with emotions. We surveyed 80 healthy participants, measuring levels of depression, anxiety, cognitive error and delusional ideation. Participants completed two versions of the beads task to evaluate their reasoning style. Results showed that people with delusional ideation reached a conclusion after less information, as expected. Interestingly, they also tended to change their conclusions more often than people without delusional ideation and did so with greater conviction. Depression and cognitive errors were strong predictors of delusional ideation but not of reasoning style. We conclude that delusional ideation in non-psychotic individuals is independently predicted by depressive symptoms and by a high conviction in new conclusions.

The study attempted to replicate the results of two studies that found positive associations with panic disorder (PD) and related phenotypes. This study investigated 795 individuals, 563 with direct genotype and phenotype information, forming 139 pedigrees. The study found no statistically significant phenotype-polymorphism combinations. The present study had less power to detect an association and produced false-negative results. The phenotypes were not representative of individuals with pure anxiety or mood disorders.

881,The backward masking red light effect and schizotypy: The influence of sex,"Previous research has shown a unique effect of red light on visual processing related to both schizophrenia and positive schizotypy. The current study examined whether this effect is influenced by sex in a more broadly-defined schizotypy sample. A location backward masking (BM) task with red, green, and gray backgrounds was administered to 34 undergraduate students (59% female) with a high score on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and 38 students (50% female) with a low score. Results revealed that the group by color interaction was significant for the male participants, while it did not approach significance in the females. The male schizotypy participants showed a significant decrease in BM accuracy to the red (vs. green) background, while the male control participants showed a non-significant mean increase in accuracy. A decrease in accuracy to the red background in the male schizotypy participants was related to a higher score on the Social Anxiety subscale of the SPQ. Findings suggest that the previously reported schizophrenia red light effect is limited to males when examining a SPQ-defined sample, and appears to be primarily related to negative schizotypy symptoms. The red light effect continues to show promise as a new endophenotype for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

882,Micronutrients reduce stress and anxiety in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder following a 7.1 earthquake,"The role of good nutrition for resilience in the face of stress is a topic of interest, but difficult to study. A 7.1 earthquake took place in the midst of research on a micronutrient treatment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), providing a unique opportunity to examine whether individuals with ADHD taking micronutrients demonstrated more emotional resilience post-earthquake than individuals with ADHD not taking micronutrients. Thirty-three adults with ADHD were assessed twice following the earthquake using a measure of depression, anxiety and stress also completed at some point pre-earthquake (baseline). Seventeen were not taking micronutrients at the time of the earthquake (control group), 16 were (micronutrient group). While there were no between-group differences one week post-quake (Time 1), at two weeks post-quake (Time 2), the micronutrient group reported significantly less anxiety and stress than the controls (effect size 0.69). These between group differences could not be explained by other variables, such as pre-earthquake measures of emotions, demographics, psychiatric status, and personal loss or damage following the earthquake. The results suggest that micronutrients may increase resilience to ongoing stress and anxiety associated with a highly stressful event in individuals with ADHD and are consistent with controlled studies showing benefit of micronutrients for mental health.

883,The validity of DSM-IV-TR criteria B and C of hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania): Evidence from a clinical study,"In both DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, hair-pulling disorder (trichotillomania, or TTM) is described as hair-pulling, with a rising urge or tension prior to pulling or when attempting to resist, and pleasure, relief or gratification during or after pulling. However, it has been questioned whether all patients with hair-pulling experience these other phenomena, and whether they occur with all pulling episodes. The objective of this study was to examine the DSM-IV-TR requirement of criteria B and C for a diagnosis of TTM in a sample of people with hair-pulling. A multi-site sample of adults with hair-pulling who met both DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria B and C (n =82, 89.13%) were compared to those who failed to satisfy both B and C (n =10, 10.87%) on a number of clinical variables. There were no differences in hair-pulling severity, levels of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, number of comorbid body-focused repetitive behaviors, or impairment between those patients who did and did not meet criteria B and C. Our study does not provide convincing support for the inclusion of the current diagnostic criteria B and C for TTM in DSM-5.

884,Personality characteristics and psychological distress associated with primary exercise dependence: An exploratory study,"The aim of this study was to assess personality characteristics and psychological distress associated with primary exercise dependence (ExeDepI) in a mixed gender sample. A cross-sectional study was carried out with adult habitual physical exercisers. A total of 79 participants voluntarily completed a package of self-report questionnaires including the Exercise Dependence Questionnaire (EDQ), the Eating Disorder Inventory II (EDI-2), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the Attitude Toward Self scale (ATS), and the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). Significant differences were found on the EDQ exercise for weight control subscale with regard to gender, as well as on the EDI-2 total score and five of its subscales, with higher scores for females compared to males. Participants reporting primary exercise dependence (N =32) were more likely to present with disordered eating patterns than controls (N =47). They also showed higher levels of harm avoidance and persistence on the TCI, but lower self-directness and less mature character. Furthermore, ExeDepI group scored higher on the ATS dysmorphophobia subscale, as well as on the anxiety and hostility subscales of the SQ compared to the control group. These findings provide support to the idea that primary exercise dependence can be considered as a clinical syndrome associated with certain personality characteristics and psychological symptoms that might be accurately assessed in clinical settings.

886,Carbon dioxide induction of panic anxiety in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations,"Panic is commonly co-morbid with schizophrenia. Panic may emerge prodromally, contribute to specific psychotic symptoms, and predictmedication response. Panic is often missed due to agitation, impaired cognition, psychotic symptom overlap and limited clinician awareness. Carbon dioxide exposure has been used reliably to induce panic in non-psychotic panic subjects, but has not been systematically studied in schizophrenia. Eight inpatients with schizophrenia, recent auditory hallucinations, none preselected for panic, all on antipsychotic medication, received a structured Panic and Schizophrenia Interview (PaSI), assessing DSM-IV panic symptoms concurrent with paroxysmal auditory hallucinations. On that interview, all eight subjects reported panic concurrent with auditory hallucinations. At one sitting, subjects were exposed, in random order, to 35% carbon dioxide and to placebo roomair, blinded to condition. All subjects experienced panic to carbon dioxide, one with limited symptoms. Only one subject panicked to placebo. One subject (one of only two without antipanic medication) had paroxysmal voices concurrent with induced panic. With added adjunctive clonazepam, that patient had marked clinical improvement and no response to carbon dioxide re-challenge. This first systematic examination offers preliminary evidence that carbon dioxide safely induces panic symptoms in schizophrenia. Panic may be prevalent and pathophysiologically significant in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations.

887,Gender differences in 12-week antidepressant treatment outcomes for a naturalistic secondary care cohort: The CRESCEND study,"This study aimed to determine whether men and women with depression differ in socio-demographic, treatment-related characteristics, and in their responses to treatment with antidepressants, as well as to explore differences in treatment outcomes by menopausal status. From a nationwide sample of 18 hospitals in South Korea, 723 depressive patients were recruited. After baseline evaluation, they received naturalistic clinician-determined antidepressant interventions. Assessment scales for evaluating depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-s), and functioning (SOFAS) were administered at baseline and reevaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. At baseline, women were older, less educated, less likely to be employed, had lower income, were more likely to be married, and had longer illness duration than men. There were no gender differences in the treatment-regime received. After adjustment for baseline status, women were more likely to achieve HAMD remission (OR = 1.51), HAMD response (OR = 1.64), and HAMA response (OR = 1.61). Women also experienced shorter times to HAMD response, HAMA response, and CGI-s remission. Postmenopausal women showed higher HAMA response with newer dual action antidepressants than premenopausal women. Women were found to have better outcomes following antidepressant treatment than men, and postmenopausal women had a better response on anxiety symptoms with newer dual action antidepressants.

888,Suicidal ideation in Huntington disease: The role of comorbidity,"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by cognitive impairments, motor abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbance. An increased risk for suicide has been documented. The majority of HD research has focused on cognitive and motor features of HD; the implications of psychiatric manifestations have received less consideration. Recent studies have sought to identify the stages of HD in which patients are at increased risk to experience suicidal ideation, though no study has examined possible risk factors for suicidality. The current study examines the presence of psychiatric comorbidity and its involvement in suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was examined in 1941 HD patients enrolled in the Huntington Study Group. Of those, 19% (N = 369) endorsed current suicidal ideation. Logistic regression analyses indicated that depression/anxiety and aggression/irritability are significant predictors of suicidal ideation. In a subsample with the greatest suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug abuse were also predictive. It is recommended that all individuals with HD (specifically those with features of depression, aggression, substance abuse) have routine suicide assessment; further research is needed to understand the high rate of suicide in HD.

The authors regret that although the text (i.e., Section 3.2, “Associations between co-occurring diagnoses and outcomes”) correctly noted that antisocial personality disorder (aspd) was not uniquely significantly associated with any outcomes, Table 3 (“Results from path models with co-occurring diagnoses predicting outcomes”) incorrectly displays stars (**) below “OCDS” and “MADRS,” indicating statistically significant associations between aspd and these outcomes. Please note that the betas listed in the table are all correct, it is simply the stars for the associations of aspd with “OCDS” and “MADRS” that are misplaced. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.] Despite the high prevalence and detrimental impact of alcoholism on bipolar patients, the diagnostic and treatment factors associated with better or worse clinical outcomes in alcohol-dependent patients with bipolar disorder are not well understood. The present study investigated the prospective impact of baseline psychiatric comorbidities and treatment regimens on clinical outcomes in bipolar alcoholics. Data were drawn from an 8-week randomized controlled clinical trial of acamprosate for individuals (n =30) with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence. Depressive and manic symptoms, and alcohol craving and consumption were monitored longitudinally using standardized instruments. Path analysis was used to estimate the prospective associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. More than 50% of patients were diagnosed with at least one anxiety (76.7%) or drug dependence disorder (60.0%). Comorbid anxiety disorders were prospectively associated with increased depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants were prescribed an average of 2.6 psychotropic medications at baseline. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants were prospectively associated with increased alcohol use; anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines were associated with increased alcohol craving. Antidepressants were associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conversely, lithium was associated with decreased alcohol craving and depressive symptoms. The findings from the present study suggest areas for future research in this population.

890,GAD is good? Generalized anxiety disorder predicts a superior five-year outcome following an acute coronary syndrome,"While differing anxiety disorders have been reported to have quite variable impact on outcome following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a recent study quantified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as having a distinctly negative impact. We examined anxiety disorder status at baseline for any differential five-year impact on cardiac outcome following initial hospitalization for an ACS in 489 subjects. Of those initially assessed, 89% were examined at a five-year review. There were non-significant trends for all non-GAD anxiety disorders to be associated with a worse cardiac outcome. Meeting GAD criteria (both at baseline assessment and over the subjects' lifetime) was associated with a superior five-year cardiac outcome, particularly in the sub-set of those experiencing GAD as their only anxiety disorder, and after controlling for depression and medical comorbidities. As our results are at distinct variance with two previous studies specifically examining the impact of GAD on outcome in cardiac patients, we consider methodological and other explanations. We conclude that, if our findings are valid, then they may more reflect GAD patients having a ‘constructive worrying’ capacity and therefore being more likely to seek help in response to less severe somatic symptoms and to also be more adherent with cardiac rehabilitation programs.

891,Distinctiveness and overlap of depersonalization with anxiety and depression in a community sample: Results from the gutenberg heart study,"Depersonalization disorder is considered to be a common clinical phenomenon and disorder with an enormous gap between prevalence and detection partly due to the common interpretation of depersonalization (DP) being a negligible variant of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we sought to analyze (1) the prevalence rate of DP in a large community sample ( n = 5000) according to a recently developed ultra brief two-item depersonalization screener; (2) the associations with depression, anxiety, physical and mental health status; and 93) whether DP contributes independently to the health status beyond anxiety and depression. The prevalence of clinically significant DP was 0.8% ( n = 41), and 8.5% ( n = 427) endorsed at least one symptom of DP. DP was independently associated with impairment of mental and physical health status as well as with a medical history of any depressive or anxiety disorder. Despite the consistent association of DP with anxiety and depression, the shared variances were small, and DP was clearly separated from symptoms of anxiety and depression in the principal component analysis. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of depersonalization screening might be recommended.

892,"Associations among perceptual anomalies, social anxiety, and paranoia in a college student sample","Recent evidence suggests that normal-range paranoid ideation may be particularly likely to develop in individuals disposed to both social anxiety and perceptual anomalies. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that among college students in an unselected sample, social anxiety and experience of perceptual anomalies would not only each independently predict the experience of self-reported paranoid ideation, but would also interact to predict paranoid patterns of thought. A diverse sample of 644 students completed a large battery of self-report measures, as well as the five-factor Paranoia/Suspiciousness Questionnaire (PSQ). We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses predicting scores on each PSQ factor from responses on measures of social anxiety, perceptual aberration, and the interaction between the two constructs. Current general negative affect was covaried in all analyses. We found that both social anxiety and perceptual aberrations, along with negative affect, predicted multiple dimensions of paranoia as measured by the PSQ; the two constructs did not, however, interact significantly to predict any dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceptual aberration and anxiety may contribute to normal-range paranoid ideation in an additive rather than an interactive manner.

893,Reduced capacity in automatic processing of facial expression in restrictive anorexia nervosa and obesity,"There is growing evidence that disordered eating is associated with facial expression recognition and emotion processing problems. In this study, we investigated the question of whether anorexia and obesity occur on a continuum of attention bias towards negative facial expressions in comparison with healthy individuals of normal weight. Thirty-three patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa (AN-R), 30 patients with obesity (OB) and 63 healthy age and social–economic status matched controls were recruited. Our results indicated that AN-R patients were more attentive to angry faces and had difficulties in being attentive to positive expressions, whilst OB patients had problems in looking for or being attentive to negative expressions independently of self-reported depression and anxiety. Our findings did not support the idea that AN-R and OB occur on a continuum.We found that AN-R was associated with a reduced capacity in positive facial expression processing, whereas OB was associated with a reduced capacity in negative facial expressions processing. The social relevance of our findings and a possible explanation based upon neuroscience are discussed.

894,N4 component responses to pre-pulse startle stimuli in young adults: Relationship to alcohol dependence,"Both physiological and behavioral studies provide evidence to suggest that deficits in frontal cortical control circuits may contribute to the risk for developing alcohol dependence. Event-related potential (ERP) and eye blink responses to startle and short delay prepulse-plus-startle stimuli, and psychiatric diagnoses were investigated in young adult (age 18–30 years) men ( n = 135) and women ( n = 205) Mexican Americans. Women displayed a significant increase in the amplitude of the eye blink response to both the startle and prepulse- plus-startle stimuli. None of the psychiatric diagnoses were associated with differences in eye blink responses. ERP responses to the startle and prepulse-plus startle stimuli included a negative polarity wave at approximately 400 ms that was of the highest amplitude in the frontal leads (N4S). Women were found to have significantly higher amplitude N4S responses than men. Participants with alcohol dependence demonstrated significantly less inhibition and more facilitation of the N4S component by the pre-pulse stimuli. This finding was not associated with a diagnosis of: any other drug dependence disorder (including nicotine), anxiety or affective disorder, or conduct/antisocial personality disorder. The present study suggests that gender and a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence may selectively contribute to this frontal late wave electrophysiological response to prepulse-plus-startle stimuli.

895,Low cholesterol is a risk factor for attentional impulsivity in patients with mood symptoms,"This study examined the relationship between cholesterol levels and impulsivity in a large sample of patients with mood symptoms. Three hundred and one patients with mood, anxiety, and personality disorders completed a battery of psychometric scales including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). On the same day of psychometric assessment, blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Statistical analysis controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, diagnosis, and current mood symptoms showed that lower TC levels were associated with increased attentional impulsivity. There was a weak linear correlation between TC and attentional impulsivity across the entire range of TC levels (110–295 mg/dL) but a highly significant difference between participants with TC levels lower than 165 mg/dL and the rest of the sample. The current study adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the association between serum cholesterol and mental health. Considering that attentional impulsivity is a demonstrated risk factor for suicide, patients presenting with low cholesterol and mood symptoms may warrant increased clinical attention and surveillance.

The purpose of this study was to clarify (1) the factor structure of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and (2) the associations between the factors extracted from this questionnaire and lifestyle, in particular sleep status, by using a representative sample population of Japanese adolescents. One hundred three thousand sixty hundred fifty self-administered questionnaires were collected from students enrolled in junior high and high schools in Japan. Of these questionnaires, 99,668 were analyzed. Sleep duration, subjective sleep assessment, bedtime, and insomnia symptoms of these students over the past month were studied to investigate sleep status. The factor analyses yielded two factors: depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion. Sleep duration of less than 7 h was found to be associated with both depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion, whereas sleep duration of 8 h or more was associated only with loss of positive emotion. Subjective sleep assessment and insomnia symptoms were associated with both depression/anxiety and loss of positive emotion. It was demonstrated that two underlying factors of mental health status were associated with differences in sleep status. In order to improve the mental health status of adolescents, it is important to provide guidance about sleep and lifestyle habits according to the mental health status of the individual.

This paper aims to validate the web-based self-rated 7-item GAD-7, its shortened 2-item GAD-2 and a single item from the GAD-7 scale (GAD-SI) to screen for GAD. Of a total of 502 subjects aged 18–80 who rated the web-based GAD-7, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 157 (31%) subjects had a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-disorders by telephone. The GAD-7 had good reliability. Subjects with a GAD-diagnosis had significantly higher means on GAD-2, GAD-SI and GAD-7 than subjects without a GAD-diagnosis. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the GAD-SI and GAD-2was accurate and not significantly different to the GAD-7 AUC. The web-based GAD-SI, GAD-2 and GAD-7 are reliable, valid tools to quickly screen for GAD in busy mental health settings and clinical research. More research is needed to validate the GAD-SI ‘Do you have trouble relaxing’ to see if its screening properties approach those of the GAD-7.

899,An admixture analysis of the age at index episodes in bipolar disorder,"The interaction between polarity at onset (PAO) and age at onset (AAO) appears to be important for interpreting results of previous analyses of AAO in bipolar disorder (BD). Using an admixture analysis, we examined independently the distributions of age at first depressive and hypomanic/manic episodes in 379 BD I and II patients. Subsequently, we examined the association of PAO and AAO with specific clinical variables, using parametric and nonparametric analyses. Both depressive and manic onsets showed bimodal distributions. For depressive episodes, the means were: 18.5±4.1 (early onset) and 33.6±10.4 (late onset) years; and for manic episodes 18.9±3.3 (early onset) and 34.8±10.9 (late onset) years. For the overall AAO the best fit was for a mixture of three lognormal distributions (mean±S.D.): 15.5±2.0, 22.8±4.6, and 36.1±10.1 years. Overall, an early onset was significantly associated with a chronic course of the disorder, a stronger family history of affective disorder, higher rates of rapid cycling, suicidal behavior, psychotic symptoms, and co-morbid anxiety disorders. Early onset depressive episodes were associated with higher rates of suicidal behavior and anxiety disorders, whereas early onset manic episodes were associated with psychotic symptoms and rapid cycling. Our results suggest the presence of a bimodal distribution of age at onset in BD according to the polarity of the index episode, and denote that an early onset BD, irrespective of polarity, may be a more serious subtype of the disorder.

Main findings included the following: 1) MBCT in adjunct to usual care was significantly better than usual care alone for reducing major depression (MD) relapses in patients with three or more prior depressive episodes (4 studies), 2) MBCT plus gradual discontinuation of maintenance ADs was associated to similar relapse rates at 1 year as compared with continuation of maintenance antidepressants (1 study), 3) the augmentation of MBCT could be useful for reducing residual depressive symptoms in patients with MD (2 studies) and for reducing anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in remission (1 study) and in patients with some anxiety disorders (2 studies). However, several methodological shortcomings including small sample sizes, non-randomized design of some studies and the absence of studies comparing MBCT to control groups designed to distinguish specific from non-specific effects of such practice underscore the necessity for further research.

901,Is there a hypersensitive visual alarm system in panic disorder?,"Agoraphobia in panic disorder (PD) has been related to abnormal balance system function. Vision influences balance and behavioural adaptations; peripheral vision influences orienting and fast defensive reactions whereas central vision analyzes details of objects. We have hypothesized that the abnormal balance function in PD could be mainly related to peripheral vision as part of a defensive alarm system in the brain. In 25 patients with PD and agoraphobia and 31 healthy controls we assessed, by posturography, balance system reactivity to video-films projected in peripheral and central visual fields (randomized sequence). Length, velocity and surface of body sway were calculated. Patients increased their body sway during peripheral stimulation, whereas controls did not; the two groups showed a similar increase of body sway during central stimulation. Anxiety levels during peripheral stimulation significantly influenced the postural response in the group of patients. These preliminary results suggest that the higher visual sensitivity to peripheral stimulation in patients with PD and agoraphobia may be linked to a more active ""visual alarm system"" involving visual, vestibular and limbic areas that might influence the development of agoraphobia in situations where environmental stimuli are uncertain.

902,Defense style in panic disorder before and after pharmacological treatment,"Whether or not the use of maladaptive defense style is a trait, as opposed to a state dependent phenomenon, in panic disorder (PD) is a topic still very much up for debate. The aim of the study was to verify whether PD patients, both before and after treatment, used different defense style than the control group. Sixty-one PD patients (recruited from an original sample of 90 patients) and 64 healthy controls were evaluated against the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders, the Symptoms Check List-90, the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and for Depression and finally the Defense Style Questionnaire-40 (DSQ). The patients were treated with paroxetine or citalopram and were evaluated monthly for one year to assess the remission. The DSQ was re-administered to the patients at the end of the study. Before treatment, PD patients used more neurotic and immature forms of defense than controls. After treatment, those in remission used the same defense styles as the control group, whereas non-remitters still used more immature defenses. However, all the aforementioned difference disappeared, after excluding the effect of symptom severity. Our data supports the hypothesis that the use of maladaptive defenses might be the consequence of PD: when subjects fall ill, their capacity to use mature adaptive defenses may diminish, but when they recover their defensive style returns to a greater maturity. The present results are however limited by the dropout rate (one third of patients did not complete the study) and the use of just one questionnaire to evaluate the complexity of defense styles.

903,Treatment-seeking for social anxiety disorder in a general outpatient psychiatry setting,"Many individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) seek treatment principally for another psychiatric disorder, but when directly asked, a majority of these individuals also desire treatment for SAD. Several reasons may exist for why individuals with SAD do not seek treatment for it, such as the severity or functional impairment related to SAD. The aim of the current study was to examine factors related to SAD severity, impairment, and comorbidity, to gain a better understanding of what factors may be related to treatment-seeking for SAD. In 819 psychiatric outpatients with SAD, initial results showed that age, duration of SAD illness, number of social fears endorsed, Clinical Global Impression score, Sheehan Disability Scale ratings for social life and distress, presence of major depressive disorder, and presence of depressive disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) were associated with treatment-seeking for SAD status. However, a regression analysis found that DDNOS was the most robust predictor of treatment-seeking for SAD status, followed by the number of feared social situations. Other factors should be examined in the future, such as knowledge of SAD and available treatment options.

904,Obsessive beliefs and neurocognitive flexibility in obsessive–compulsive disorder,"A substantial proportion of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not endorse the dysfunctional beliefs proposed by cognitive models of OCD to be important in the onset and maintenance of symptoms. Previous research has attempted to characterize Low and High obsessive beliefs groups in terms of cognitive and symptom correlates to distil potential etiological differences in these subgroups of OCD patients. The current study sought to further examine potential neurocognitive differences between obsessive beliefs subgroups. Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was compared between a Low Beliefs OCD subgroup, a High Beliefs OCD subgroup, and two anxious control groups: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia (PDA) and Social Phobia (SP). The High Beliefs OCD subgroup performed significantly poorer on WCST subscales compared to the other diagnostic groups. These findings were not accounted for by severity of OCD or depressive symptoms. The Low Beliefs OCD subgroup performed similar to the anxiety disorder control groups. The results suggest a potential interplay between heightened obsessive beliefs and neurocognitive inflexibility.

905,Suicidal ideation among individuals whose parents have divorced: Findings from a representative Canadian community survey,"This study used a large, nationally representative sample to examine the gender-specific association between parental divorce and the cumulative lifetime incidence of suicidal ideation. Known risk factors for suicidal ideation, such as childhood stressors, socioeconomic factors, adult health behaviors and stressors, marital status, and any history of mood and/or anxiety disorders were controlled. Gender-specific analyses revealed that for men, the parental divorce–suicidal ideation relationship remained statistically significant even when the above-listed cluster of risk factors were included in the analyses (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56, 3.58). For women, the association between parental divorce and suicidal ideation was reduced to non-significance when other adverse childhood experiences were included in the analyses (full adjustment OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.72, 1.50). These findings indicate a need for screening of suicidal ideation among individuals, particularly men and those with mood and/or anxiety disorders, who have experienced parental divorce. Future research should focus on the mechanisms linking parental divorce and suicidal ideation.

906,Decreased aldosterone in the plasma of suicide attempters with major depressive disorder,"Hormones and neurobiological factors may be regulated differently in suicidal versus non-suicidal depressive patients. There is currently limited knowledge about the relation of substances in the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone system to depression and suicidality. We therefore investigated whether plasma levels of renin and aldosterone differ between suicide attempters, non-suicidal depressive patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we analyzed the relation of renin and aldosterone to psychiatric symptoms in the patients. Suicidal patients with MDD, adjustment disorder and dysthymia, as well as two control groups consisting of non-suicidal MDD patients and healthy subjects, were rated using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), including the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA). Plasma samples were frozen immediately after collection and stored at −80°C for 5–18 years. Aldosterone and renin levels were analyzed using radioactive- and chemiluminescent immunoassays. We found that suicide attempters with MDD had significantly lower plasma levels of aldosterone than the other patient groups, as well as than the healthy controls. Moreover, increasing severity of psychiatric symptoms was associated with lower aldosterone levels in the suicide attempters with MDD. Non-suicidal patients with MDD did not differ significantly compared to healthy controls with respect to aldosterone and renin levels. These findings may indicate that low aldosterone levels could be a marker of suicidality in patients with MDD.

907,Lack of association between SNPs in the NEUROD2 gene and alcohol dependence in a German patient sample,"Results of a human post mortem study performed by our own group have suggested that the transcription factor NEUROD2, which plays a role in neuronal development, as well as in the development of anxiety and risk behavior in mice, might be a susceptibility factor for addictive disorders. Therefore the aim of the present study was to analyze a possible relation between genetic variants in the NEUROD2 gene and alcohol dependence in a sample of the Munich Gene Bank of Alcoholism (MGBA). We performed single SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and haplotype studies in 430 alcohol-dependent patients and 365 healthy controls with four SNPs covering the gene region of NEUROD2. Neither single SNP nor haplotype analysis could detect significant associations with alcohol dependence. Additionally we could not detect any relation of the analyzed genetic variants to Cloninger's Type 1/2 or Babor's Type A/B classification, to the age of onset or to the amount of alcohol intake. Our results do not provide evidence for an involvement of NEUROD2 polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence. Further association studies are needed to confirm our findings.

908,Alcohol consumption and later risk of hospitalization with psychiatric disorders: Prospective cohort study,"The potential effects of alcohol intake upon the risk of psychiatric disorders have not often been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a population sample, the association between self-reported amount of alcohol intake and the later risk of being registered in a Danish hospital with a psychiatric disorder. The prospective cohort study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study ( n = 18,146), was used, containing three updated sets of alcohol intake and lifestyle covariates and up to 26 years follow-up. Alcohol intake was measured by self-report while psychiatric disorders were measured through registers. For women, the overall pattern showed that drinking above the sensible limits increased the risk of psychiatric disorders in general, especially for anxiety disorders where women drinking above the sensible drinking limits had a risk of 2.00 (confidence interval: 1.31–3.04) compared to women drinking below the sensible drinking limits. For men, the risk functions were slightly U-shaped; thus, a weekly low or moderate alcohol intake seemed to have a protective effect towards developing psychiatric disorders. The findings suggest sex differences in the association between alcohol consumption and risk of psychiatric disorders.

909,Feedback and reward processing in high-functioning autism,"Individuals with high-functioning autism often display deficits in social interactions and high-level cognitive functions. Such deficits may be influenced by poor ability to process feedback and rewards. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related potential (ERP) that is more negative following losses than gains. We examined FRN amplitude in 25 individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 25 age- and IQ-matched typically developing control participants who completed a guessing task with monetary loss/gain feedback. Both groups demonstrated a robust FRN that was more negative to loss trials than gain trials; however, groups did not differ in FRN amplitude as a function of gain or loss trials. N1 and P300 amplitudes did not differentiate groups. FRN amplitude was positively correlated with age in individuals with ASD, but not measures of intelligence, anxiety, behavioral inhibition, or autism severity. Given previous findings of reduced-amplitude error-related negativity (ERN) in ASD, we propose that individuals with ASD may process external, concrete, feedback similar to typically developing individuals, but have difficulty with internal, more abstract, regulation of performance.

910,Poor response to antidepressant medication of patients with depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology in the STAR*D study,"Studies suggest that the gender difference in the prevalence of depression results because women exhibit higher prevalence than men of a depressive phenotype associated with somatic symptoms. Because this phenotype has been found to be based in psychosocial forces, it may not respond well to antidepressant medication. In this study, data from the STAR*D Study were analyzed to compare remission rates in response to an SSRI and to several other antidepressants of patients exhibiting depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology versus other patients. Scores on the Clinician Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology were used to measure clinical remission in response to medication. Patients exhibiting depression accompanied by somatic symptomatology exhibited less remission to the SSRI Citalopram (31% versus 43%) and to the various medications administered in level 3 (14% versus 25%) than did other patients in STAR*D. The low rates of remission in response to medication of patients exhibiting somatic symptomatology were not due to the greater proportion of women, nor to the greater proportion of patients exhibiting anxiety disorders, among patients exhibiting somatic symptomatology. Remission rates were found to be related to exhibiting somatic symptomatology not to exhibiting nonsomatic symptoms.

911,Group versus individual cognitive treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Changes in non-OCD symptoms and cognitions at post-treatment and one-year follow-up,"Current cognitive approaches postulate that obsessions and compulsions are caused and/or maintained by misinterpretations about their meaning. This assumption has led to the development of cognitive therapeutic (CT) procedures designed to challenge the dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs patients have about their obsessions. Nonetheless, few studies have compared the efficacy of individual and group CT in changing the dysfunctional cognitions that hypothetically underlie Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In this study, 44 OCD patients were assigned to individual ( n = 18) or group ( n = 24) CT. Sixteen completed the individual CT, and 22 completed the group CT. The effects of the two CT conditions on depression and worry tendencies were comparable. Individual treatment was more effective than group treatment in decreasing scores on dysfunctional beliefs (responsibility, overestimation of threat, and intolerance to uncertainty) and the use of suppression as a thought control strategy. The post-treatment changes were maintained one year later. The correlations between symptom improvement (OCD severity change) and belief changes were moderate: in the individual treatment the greatest associations were with beliefs about thoughts (importance and control), whereas in the group treatment the greatest associations were with beliefs related to anxiety in general (threat overestimation and intolerance to uncertainty).

912,Validity of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in detecting depressive and anxiety disorders among high school students,"Despite the common use of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) with adolescents, there is limited data supporting its validity with this population. The aims of the study were to investigate the psychometric properties of the GHQ-12 among high school students, to validate the GHQ-12 against the gold standard of a diagnostic interview, and to suggest a threshold score for detecting depressive and anxiety disorders. Six hundred and fifty-four high school students from years 10 to 12 (ages 15–18) completed the GHQ-12 (Likert scored) and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Test Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. The mean GHQ-12 score for the total sample was 9.9 (S.D. = 5.4). Results from the ROC curve indicated that the GHQ-12 performed better than chance at identifying depressive and anxiety disorders (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.781). A GHQ-12 threshold score of 9/10 for males and 10/11 for females was found to be optimal. Given the significant proportion of mental illness among high school students, there may be a need to introduce screening for mental illnesses as part of the school curriculum. This can assist with the early identification and enable low stigma preventive intervention within the school environment.

913,Effectiveness of guided self-help for depression and anxiety disorders in primary care: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of (guided) self-help in primary care for patients diagnosed with a minor or major mood and/or anxiety disorder. The study population consists of 120 (screened) primary care patients aged 18–65 years with at least one mood and/or anxiety disorder. The primary focus is the reduction of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The self-help courses (Problem Solving Treatment and exposure) took 6 weeks to complete. The self-help group reported slightly better outcomes than the care-as-usual group but these results were not significant: d =−0.18 (95% CI = −2.29 to 7.31) for symptoms of depression and d =−0.20 (95% CI=−0.74 to 2.29) for symptoms of anxiety. For patients with an anxiety disorder only, the anxiety symptoms decreased significantly compared to the care-as-usual group ( d =−0.68; 95% CI = 0.25 to 4.77). Self-help seems only slightly superior to care-as-usual and therefore might not be an effective tool in general practice. But the lack of results could also be due to our selection of patients or to our selection of GPs (with interest in psychiatric disorders). Nonetheless the promising signals with respect to anxiety disorders warrant further research.

914,Therapeutic relationships in vocational rehabilitation: Predicting good relationships for people with psychosis,"Therapeutic relationships between clients and vocational rehabilitation workers have been shown to predict entering competitive employment. We aimed to determine predictors of good relationships, using data from an international randomized controlled trial of supported employment ( n = 312). Baseline predictors of early therapeutic relationships with vocational workers were assessed, along with the impact of vocational status and changing clinical and social functioning variables on relationship ratings over time. Associations between client and professional relationship ratings were also explored. Better early client-rated therapeutic relationship was predicted by better baseline relationship with the clinical keyworker, being in the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) service, the absence of work history and a greater proportion of care needs being met, whereas over time it was predicted by being in the IPS service. Professional-rated early relationship was predicted by social disability and remission, while over time it was predicted by being the same sex as the client, duration of the relationship and the client's increasing anxiety. Client and professional ratings were positively associated but clients' ratings were higher than professionals', particularly in the IPS service. Relationships were better where clients may have been more motivated to engage, including by their prior experience of a good therapeutic relationship with the clinical keyworker.

915,An empirical investigation of the structure of anxiety and depressive symptoms in late adolescence: Cross-sectional study using the Greek version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule,"Several studies in the past have examined whether the hierarchical structure of anxiety and depressive symptoms can explain the high comorbidity between them but more studies are needed from other settings and with different methods. The present study aimed to examine the structure of common anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents 16–18 years old attending secondary schools using the Greek version of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R), a fully structured psychiatric interview. A total of 2431 adolescents were interviewed with the computerized version of the CIS-R. The hierarchical structure of 12 depressive and anxiety symptoms was examined with confirmatory factor analytical methods. Four alternative models of increasing complexity were tested. The best-fitting model included three first-order factors, representing the dimensions of anxiety, depression and non-specific distress respectively. A model with a higher-order factor representing the broader internalizing dimension was less supported by the data. The findings of this and other studies should be taken into account in future classifications of psychiatric disorders and may have clinical practical implications.

A total of 6081 subjects aged 18 to 59 years participated in this study. Diagnostic assessments were based on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Screener and Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered by lay interviewers. The frequencies of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders, sleep disturbances, and suicidal tendency were compared in the ADHD and non-ADHD groups. Odds ratios and significance levels were calculated. The 6 month prevalence of adult ADHD symptoms was 1.1%. Associations between ADHD symptoms and alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, somatoform disorder, sleep disturbances, and suicidality were overwhelmingly positive and significant ( P &lt; 0.05), after controlling for gender and age. Adult ADHD symptoms are highly associated with substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disturbances and suicidality, suggesting that clinicians should carefully evaluate and treat such psychiatric disorders in adults with ADHD symptoms.

917,Psychiatric comorbidity in methamphetamine dependence,"The primary aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in a large sample of methamphetamine (MA)-dependent subjects using a validated structured clinical interview, without limitation to sexual orientation or participation in a treatment program. The secondary aim was to assess whether the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities varied by gender. Structured clinical interviews (SCIDs) were administered to 189 MA-dependent subjects and lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses was assessed. Across the sample, 28.6% had primary psychotic disorders, 23.8% of which were substance-induced; 13.2% had MA-induced delusional disorders and 11.1% had MA-induced hallucinations. A substantial number of lifetime mood disorders were identified that were not substance-induced (32.3%), whereas 14.8% had mood disorders induced by substances, and 10.6% had mood disorders induced by amphetamines. Of all participants, 26.5% had anxiety disorders and 3.7% had a substance-induced anxiety disorder, all of which were induced by MA. Male subjects reported a higher percentage of MA-induced delusions compared to female abusers. Given the impact of MA psychosis and other drug-induced symptoms on hospitals and mental health services, the description and characterization of comorbid psychiatric symptoms associated with MA use is of paramount importance.

918,"Relationships between stress, social adaptation, personality traits, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol plasma concentrations in employees at a publishing company in Japan","There is growing evidence that blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), a major metabolite of noradrenaline, are related to depression-associated personality traits as well as to depressive, suicidal and anxious states. Psychological job stress is well known to lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide. We have recently reported that psychological job stress among hospital employees altered blood levels of BDNF and MHPG (Mitoma et al., 2008). In the present study, we re-examined the effects of social adaptation and personality traits, as well as those of psychological job stress, on plasma levels of BDNF and MHPG in healthy employees ( n = 269, male/female = 210/59, age = 49 ± 10 years) working in a publishing company in Japan. The values (mean ± SD) of scores on the Stress and Arousal Check Lists (s-SACL and a-SACL), Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS), plasma MHPG levels and plasma BDNF levels were 6.0 ± 3.4, 5.7 ± 2.3, 33.7 ± 6.8, 5.8 ± 4.3 and 4.6 ± 3.1 ng ml –1 , respectively. A positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and scores on the s-SACL, but not the a-SACL. A positive correlation was also found between SASS scores and plasma MHPG levels and between SASS scores and plasma BDNF levels. A negative correlation was found between plasma BDNF levels and s-SACL scores. Furthermore, a positive correlation between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Openness) scores and plasma MHPG levels was observed, as well as between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Extroversion) scores and plasma BDNF levels. These results suggest that levels of plasma BDNF and plasma MHPG might be associated with psychological job stress and certain personality traits among employees in the publishing industry in Japan.

919,The Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire predicts functioning styles of personality disorder: A trial in healthy subjects and personality-disorder patients,"Normal personality traits, as measured by the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ), predicted some personality disorders in a sample of healthy volunteers. Whether these predictions could be more pronounced in patients with personality disorders remains unknown. We administered the ZKPQ and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM), which describes the functioning styles of personality disorder, in 134 patients with a range of personality disorders and in 268 age-, gender- and education level-matched healthy volunteers. Cluster A patients scored lowest on Sociability, cluster B highest on Impulsive Sensation Seeking and Aggression–Hostility, cluster C1 (Avoidant and Dependent types) highest on Neuroticism–Anxiety, and cluster C2 (Obsessive-Compulsive type) highest on Activity. Most of the predictors were consistent across both the healthy and patient groups. The variances that accounted for predicting most PERM styles by the ZKPQ traits in the patient group were higher than those in the healthy group. Our results showed that the ZKPQ traits could specifically predict the PERM styles in both healthy subjects and personality-disorder patients. This result was more pronounced in the latter group. The most powerful predictions were obtained for Antisocial, Dependent, Borderline and Avoidant styles, and the weakest for the Schizotypal and Schizoid styles in the patient group.

920,Are sedentary television watching and computer use behaviors associated with anxiety and depressive disorders?,"Sedentary behaviors may be more common among persons with mental disorders and thereby result in poorer health outcomes. This study examined whether independently of general physical activity level, mental disorders are linked to two important examples of sedentary behavior: computer use and watching television. We used cross-sectional data from The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Our study sample consisted of 2353 participants (age 18–65) of whom 1701 had a current anxiety and/or depressive diagnosis and 652 were healthy controls. Anxiety and depression diagnoses were conducted using the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Controlling for sociodemographics and physical activity level we found that persons with a major depressive disorder (MDD) spend significantly more leisure time using the computer. We found that persons with dysthymia, panic disorder and agoraphobia spend significantly more daily hours watching television compared to controls. This study illustrates that sedentary behaviors occur more frequently among persons with a mental disorder, independent of general physical activity level.

921,The evaluation of emotional facial expressions in early postpartum depression mood: A difference between adult and baby faces?,"Research suggests that depressive individuals exhibit disturbances in the evaluation of emotional facial expressions. Owing to the specific character of postnatal depressive mood, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether postpartum depressive mood intensity in the mothers would involve the same disturbances as depression or a specific distortion in the emotional evaluation of baby faces as compared to adult faces. Three days after birth, the participants ( N = 79) completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. They also evaluated the facial expressions of adults and babies displaying anger, happiness, sadness and neutrality in terms of the intensity of five emotions: Anger, disgust, sadness, happiness and neutrality. Our findings suggest that judgements of emotional facial expressions depend to a great extent on anxiety, which specifically increased negative perception of babies' emotions. Moreover, the only difference between mothers with and without postpartum depressive mood lays in their assessment of the babies' faces, neutral baby faces being judged to be less neutral, thus demonstrating the specificity of postpartum affective disorders.

922,Decreased hair cortisol concentrations in generalised anxiety disorder,"Previous research examining hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has suggested a general hypercortisolism. These studies have mostly relied on salivary, plasma or urinary assessments, reflecting cortisol secretion over short time periods. The current study utilised the novel method of cortisol assessment in hair to obtain a retrospective index of cortisol secretion over a prolonged period of time. Hair cortisol levels were determined in 15 GAD patients and in 15 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, participants collected six saliva samples (on awakening, + 30 min, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 h and at bedtime) on two consecutive weekdays for the assessment of the diurnal cortisol profile. Results revealed significantly lower (50–60%) cortisol levels in the first and second 3-cm hair segments of GAD patients compared to those of controls. No significant between-group differences were seen in diurnal cortisol profiles. The hair cortisol findings tentatively suggest that under naturalistic conditions GAD is associated with hypocortisolism. If corroborated by future research, this demonstrates the important qualities of cortisol measurement in hair as an ecologically valid, retrospective index of long-term cortisol secretion and as a marker for psychiatric disorders associated with hypo- or hypercortisolism.

Subjects were 4,134 residents in selected sites in Japan. Diagnoses of mental disorders are based on the World Mental Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of IED were 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively, whereas those of narrow IED were 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Male gender and young age were positively associated with an increased prevalence of IED. Mood and anxiety disorders as well as suicidal ideation were shown to be associated with IED in both genders. The overall association between anxiety disorders and IED was stronger in women than in men. Positive association of substance use problems with IED was also observed. Similar findings were observed between those psychosocial factors and narrow IED. These results suggest that people having those mixed complications might have a high suicidal risk.

924,Self-mutilative behaviours in male alcohol-dependent inpatients and relationship with posttraumatic stress disorder,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-mutilation (SM) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in male alcohol-dependent inpatients, and to examine whether there is something unique about self-mutilaters with the PTSD/alcohol-dependence co-morbidity, compared with self-mutilaters without PTSD in this population. Participants were 156 consecutively admitted male alcohol-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Self-mutilative Behaviour Questionnaire (SMBQ), the Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC), the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Among alcohol-dependent inpatients, 34.0% ( n = 53) were considered as group with SM. Rate of being unemployed, history of any trauma, history of suicide attempt and lifetime PTSD diagnosis were higher, whereas being married, current age, age at onset of regular alcohol use and duration of education were lower in the group with SM. Mean scores of SCL-90 subscales, TEC and MAST were higher in the SM group. Although SM might be related with PTSD among male alcohol-dependent inpatients, predictors of SM were age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and hostility. Age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and somatisation predicted SM in the subgroup of patients without PTSD, whereas hostility predicted SM alone in the subgroup of patients with PTSD. Results support the anti-suicide and the affect-regulation models of SM in the non-PTSD group, whereas they support the hostility model of SM in the subgroup with PTSD in alcohol-dependent inpatients. Thus, to reduce self-mutilative behaviour (SMB)among alcohol-dependent patients, clinicians must address different subjects in different subgroup patients; that is, focussing hostility in those with PTSD co-morbidity.

925,Defensive startle response to emotional social cues in social anxiety,"Potentiation of fear-related defense behaviours coordinated by the amygdala in response to environmental threat characterizes several anxiety disorders. We compared eye-blink startle responses to startle probes delivered during the presentation of emotional and neutral social cues in high and low generalized social anxiety. Socially anxious individuals exhibited larger startle responses to emotional (positive and negative) relative to neutral social cues, compared to non-anxious individuals.

926,Validation of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale—Revised (CESD-R): Pragmatic depression assessment in the general population,"Depression has a huge societal impact, making accurate measurement paramount. While there are several available measures, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD) is a popular assessment tool that has wide applicability in the general population. In order to reflect modern diagnostic criteria and improve upon psychometric limitations of its predecessor, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) was recently created, but has yet to be publicized. This study explored psychometric properties of the CESD-R across a large community sample ( N = 7389) and smaller student sample ( N = 245). A newly proposed algorithmic classification method yielded base-rates of depression consistent with epidemiological results. Factor analysis suggested a unidimensional factor structure, but important utility for two separate symptom clusters. The CESD-R exhibited good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency, strong factor loadings, and theoretically consistent convergent and divergent validity with anxiety, schizotypy, and positive and negative affect. Results suggest the CESD-R is an accurate and valid measure of depression in the general population with advantages such as free distribution and an atheoretical basis.

927,Earning and learning among Australian community residents with psychiatric disorders,"At a population level the extent that psychiatric disorders and other health conditions disrupt participation in education and employment is rarely considered simultaneously and remains largely unknown. This is an important issue because policy makers are as concerned with educational attainment, school to work transitions, and workforce skills, as they are with overall labour force participation. We investigated earning or learning, and educational attainment, among Australian community residents by age group and by category of psychiatric disorder. Data files were provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from a population survey conducted in 2003 using a multi-stage probability sample ( N = 23,787). Adults with schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders were compared to (1) working age adults with other non-psychiatric health conditions and disabilities; and (2) healthy adults of working age. Participation in formal education and employment was extensively disrupted by all health conditions and by psychiatric disorders in particular. The extent of career-related disruption provides benchmarks for policy makers and service providers attempting to increase participation in formal education and in the labour force.

928,Platelet [³H] paroxetine binding in female patients with borderline personality disorder and their sisters,"Paroxetine binding could be a vulnerability marker for traits associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). To study this relationship, we examined [³H] paroxetine binding in female patients with BPD and their sisters. The sample consisted of 54 sibling pairs in which a proband met criteria for BPD. All subjects were given the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, revised (DIB-R), the Diagnostic Assessment for Personality Pathology: Brief Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), the Affective Lability Scale (ALS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Symptom Checklist-90, revised (SCL-90-R). All subjects had platelets assayed for [³H] paroxetine binding. There were no significant differences between probands and sisters, but both groups scored significantly lower than a previously studied control group on B max . There were no differences on Kd. Neither B max nor K d was related to most trait or symptomatic measures. Paroxetine binding could reflect endophenotypes common to BPD probands and their first-degree relatives.

929,The role of emotion regulation in auditory hallucinations,"Emotion regulation involves the use of strategies to influence the experience and expression of emotions. Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations (AHs). Individuals usually try to down-regulate (decrease) such emotions, consequently abnormal or maladaptive use of one or more of these down-regulatory processes (e.g. increased use of expressive suppression or maladaptive attentional deployment, i.e. rumination/worry) may play an important role in AHs (e.g. increasing AH severity and distress). This study examined the self-reported use of a range of emotion regulation strategies in individuals with schizophrenia and current AHs (SZ AH; N = 34) and healthy controls ( N = 34). Two separable dimensions of hallucinatory experiences (severity and distress) were assessed together with measures of anxiety, depression and happiness. Within the SZ AH group, greater use of expressive suppression was associated with an increase in severity of AHs and greater disruption in daily life. In addition, rumination was significantly positively correlated with the distress (but not with the severity) associated with AHs. Within the control group, expressive suppression, rumination and worry were associated with more anxiety/depression and less happiness, as predicted. The implications of different emotion regulation strategies for the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia and AHs are discussed.

930,Psychiatric diagnoses in patients who screen positive on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire: Implications for using the scale as a case-finding instrument for bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder is prone to being overlooked because its diagnosis is more often based on retrospective report than cross-sectional assessment. Recommendations for improving the detection of bipolar disorder include the use of screening questionnaires. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is the most widely studied self-report screening scale that has been developed to improve the detection of bipolar disorder. Although developed as a screening scale, the MDQ has also been used as a case-finding measure. However, studies of the MDQ in psychiatric patients have found high false positive rates, though no study has determined the psychiatric diagnoses associated with false positive results on the MDQ. The goal of the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project was to identify the psychiatric disorders associated with increased false positive rates on the MDQ. Four hundred eighty psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed the MDQ. After excluding the 52 patients diagnosed with a lifetime history of bipolar disorder we compared diagnostic frequencies in patients who did and did not screen positive on the MDQ. Based on the Hirschfeld et al. scoring guidelines of the MDQ, 15.2% ( n = 65) of the 428 nonbipolar patients screened positive on MDQ. Compared to patients who screened negative, the patients who screened positive were significantly more likely have a current and lifetime diagnosis of specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug use disorders, any eating disorder, any impulse control disorder, and attention deficit disorder. Results were similar using a less restrictive threshold to identify MDQ cases. That is, MDQ caseness was associated with significantly elevated rates of anxiety, impulse control, substance use, and attention deficit disorders. Studies using the MDQ as a stand-alone proxy for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder should consider whether the presence of these other forms of psychopathology could be responsible for differences between individuals who screen positive and negative on the scale.

931,"Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and burnout in Pakistani earthquake recovery workers","Past research has shown a substantial prevalence of emotional disorders in professionals involved in rescue and/or relief operations following natural disasters, including earthquakes. However, no published study to date has investigated whether disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction workers involved in later phases of the earthquake response are also affected by emotional problems. A nearly complete sample of earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction workers ( N = 267) involved in the response to the 2005 earthquake in Northern Pakistan filled in a set of self-report questionnaires assessing emotional problems and predictor variables approximately 24 months after the earthquake. Most participants had experienced the disaster themselves and suffered from a number of stressors during and shortly after the acute earthquake phase. A substantial subgroup of participants reported clinically relevant levels of emotional disorders, especially earthquake-related posttraumatic stress disorder (42.6%), as well as depression and anxiety (approx. 20%). Levels of burnout were low. Symptom levels of posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with the severity of the earthquake experience, past traumas, work-related stressors, low social support, and female gender. The results document a high prevalence of emotional problems in earthquake rehabilitation and recovery workers.

932,A longitudinal study of child mental health and problem behaviours at 14 years of age following unplanned pregnancy,"A substantial minority of children are born as a consequence of an unplanned pregnancy. Yet little is known about the impact of unplanned/unwanted pregnancy (UP) on long-term health outcomes for children. This study aimed to examine the association between UP and child mental health and behavioural problems at 14 years, and whether this association is confounded or mediated by other variables. Data were from a pre-birth prospective study that included 4765 mothers and their children (48.4% female and 51.6% male) followed up from pregnancy to 14 years of the child's age in Brisbane, Australia. Child anxiety/depression, aggression, delinquency, attention problems, withdrawal problems, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, internalizing, externalizing and total problems were measured using the Achenbach's Youth Self Report at 14 years. Child smoking and alcohol consumption were self-reported at 14 years. UP was prospectively assessed at the first antenatal visit of pregnancy. UP as reported by mothers at first antenatal visit predicted elevated levels of problem behaviours and increased substance use in children at 14 years. The impact of UP on child mental health and problem behaviours is partly due to the confounding effect of other variables, such as maternal socio-demographic status, mental health and substance use during pregnancy. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanism of association between UP and child aggression and early alcohol consumption at 14 years.

933,Basal cortisol levels in relation to dimensions and DSM-IV categories of depression and anxiety,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV classification may fail to adequately distinguish neuroendocrine factors involved in the etiology of depressive and anxiety disorders. Continuous phenotypic dimensions may correlate better with underlying neuroendocrine dysregulations. We compared the categorical DSM-IV diagnoses with a dimensional approach in the same group of outpatients with depressive ( n = 36), anxiety ( n = 18), and comorbid depressive and anxiety ( n = 19) disorders, who were free of psychotropic medication, and in 36 healthy controls. The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) was used to measure the three dimensions of the tripartite model, i.e., anhedonic depression, anxious arousal, and general distress. The salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) (0, 30, 45, and 60min after awakening), and diurnal cortisol decline (11:00h, 15:00h, 19:00h, and 23:00h) were analyzed for linear and nonlinear associations. The CAR showed statistically significant nonlinear relationships with two MASQ dimensions, i.e., anhedonic depression and general distress, but no differences between DSM-IV categories. The diurnal cortisol decline was linearly related to the MASQ dimensions anhedonic depression and general distress and significantly higher AUC diurnal levels and a steeper slope were found in depressive patients compared to controls using DSM-IV categories. The present study shows that linear and nonlinear associations with salivary cortisol are detected when using phenotypic dimensions and may be complementary to phenotypic DSM-IV categories when doing neuroendocrine research.

934,The accuracy of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to identify PTSD cases in victims of urban violence,"As a consequence of the increasing urban violence in Brazil, many cases of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are now seen in the community and clinical settings. The main aim of this article is to assess the psychometric properties of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to study factors related to the etiology, prognosis, and efficacy of interventions of PTSD in civilian populations. PTSD outpatients from a program of victims of violence and subjects identified in an epidemiological survey conducted in the city of Sao Paulo completed a battery of validated instruments and the CAPS. Instrument reliability and validity were measured. The comparison between the CAPS scores and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) interview resulted in the following validity coefficients: sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 95%, and misclassification rate = 7.1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.97. There was a positive correlation between CAPS scores with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; 0.70) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; 0.76) scores. The Kappa coefficients were all higher than 0.63 for all CAPS items. The internal consistency for all CAPS items resulted in a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97. The CAPS showed to be both an accurate and a reliable research instrument to identify PTSD cases in a civilian population.

935,Subclinical eating disorders and their comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders in adolescent girls,"The present study assesses the prevalence of subclinical eating disorders and examines their comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders in a sample of adolescent girls. A DSM-III-R computerized self-reported interview was administered to 833 adolescent girls (mean age = 15.7 ± 0.5 years) from a population sample to assess the prevalence of subclinical eating disorders, major depression, dysthymia, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. The prevalence of subclinical anorexia nervosa (restricting subtype) was 3.5%, 13.3% for weight concerns (restricting subtype), 3.8% for subclinical bulimia nervosa, and 10.8% for subclinical binge eating disorder. Girls with subclinical anorexia nervosa had a higher prevalence of separation anxiety diagnosis, and they reported significantly more major depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Girls with weight concerns reported significantly more major depressive, separation, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Girls with subclinical bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder had a higher prevalence of mood disorders (major depression and dysthymia) compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. Furthermore, girls with subclinical bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder also reported significantly more anxiety symptoms (separation anxiety and generalized anxiety) compared with girls reporting no eating disorders. In summary, adolescent girls suffering from subclinical eating disorders should be investigated concomitantly for mood and anxiety disorders while those suffering from mood and anxiety disorders should be investigated simultaneously for subclinical eating disorders.

520,A randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based cognitive-behavioural skills package for carers of people with anorexia nervosa,"  Background Anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a major burden on families. Carers (e.g. parents or partners) of people with AN are often highly distressed and may inadvertently respond in ways that can contribute to the maintenance of the disorder, e.g. through high levels of over-involvement and criticism [also known as expressed emotion (EE)]. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel web-based systemic cognitive-behavioural (CBT) intervention for carers of people with AN, designed to reduce carer distress and teach skills in how to offer effective support. Method Carers of people with AN (n=64) were randomly allocated to either the web-intervention, overcoming anorexia online, with limited clinician supportive guidance (by email or phone), or to ad-hoc usual support from the UK patient and carer organization Beat. Carer outcomes were assessed at post-treatment (4 months) and follow-up (6 months). Results Compared with the control intervention, web-based treatment significantly reduced carers' anxiety and depression (primary outcome) at post-treatment, with a similar trend in carers' EE. Other secondary outcomes did not favour the online intervention. Gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions This is the first ever study to use an online CBT program to successfully reduce carer distress and improve carers' ability to support the person with AN.

522,"Prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in preterm and full-term children, adolescents and young adults: a meta-analysis","  Background Preterm (PT) birth and low birth weight (LBW) are high-prevalence events that are associated with adverse outcomes in the longer term, with vulnerability increasing as maturity at birth decreases. Psychiatric symptomatology appears heightened in PT/LBW survivors, though there are some discordant findings from studies using questionnaire measures, particularly with respect to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method This article synthesises findings from research using clinical psychiatric diagnostic criteria in PT/LBW individuals aged 10-25 years compared with term-born peers. Key outcomes of interest were the rates of individuals receiving any psychiatric diagnosis and the number of diagnoses of anxiety or depressive disorders. Results A literature search for studies reporting prevalence of 'any diagnosis' yielded five studies that met inclusion criteria, with a total of 565 PT/LBW and 533 control individuals. Also, five studies were found that reported rates of anxiety/depression (692 PT/LBW and 605 control individuals). The risk of these outcomes was increased for PT/LBW individuals compared with controls [any diagnosis: odds ratio (OR) 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-5.21; anxiety or depressive disorder: OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.73-4.73]. Conclusions The studies reviewed here indicate that, in addition to monitoring and management of medical and cognitive sequelae, the psychological well-being of PT/LBW individuals should be a key part of ongoing care.

523,Long working hours and symptoms of anxiety and depression: a 5-year follow-up of the Whitehall II study,"  Background Although long working hours are common in working populations, little is known about the effect of long working hours on mental health. Method We examined the association between long working hours and the onset of depressive and anxiety symptoms in middle-aged employees. Participants were 2960 full-time employees aged 44 to 66 years (2248 men, 712 women) from the prospective Whitehall II cohort study of British civil servants. Working hours, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and covariates were measured at baseline (1997-1999) followed by two subsequent measurements of depressive and anxiety symptoms (2001 and 2002-2004). Results In a prospective analysis of participants with no depressive (n=2549) or anxiety symptoms (n=2618) at baseline, Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for baseline covariates showed a 1.66-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.61] risk of depressive symptoms and a 1.74-fold (95% CI 1.15-2.61) risk of anxiety symptoms among employees working more than 55 h/week compared with employees working 35-40 h/week. Sex-stratified analysis showed an excess risk of depression and anxiety associated with long working hours among women [hazard ratios (HRs) 2.67 (95% CI 1.07-6.68) and 2.84 (95% CI 1.27-6.34) respectively] but not men [1.30 (0.77-2.19) and 1.43 (0.89-2.30)]. Conclusions Working long hours is a risk factor for the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms in women. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",917420015.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
524,Is childhood OCD a risk factor for eating disorders later in life? A longitudinal study,"  Background It has been suggested that childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be a risk factor for the development of an eating disorder (ED) later in life, but prospective studies are lacking. We aimed to determine the prevalence of ED at follow-up and clinical predictors in a longitudinal clinical sample of adolescents/young adults diagnosed with OCD in childhood. Method All contactable (n=231) young people with OCD assessed over 9 years at a national and specialist paediatric OCD clinic were included in this study. At follow-up, 126 (57%) young people and parents completed the ED section of the Developmental and Well-being Assessment. Predictors for ED were investigated using logistic regression. Results In total, 16 participants (12.7%) had a diagnosis of ED at follow-up. Having an ED was associated with female gender and persistent OCD at follow-up. There was a trend for family history of ED being predictive of ED diagnosis. Five (30%) of those who developed an ED at follow-up had ED symptoms or food-related obsessions/compulsions at baseline. A difference in predictors for an ED versus other anxiety disorders at follow-up was identified. Conclusions This study provides initial evidence that baseline clinical predictors such as female gender and family history of ED might be specific to the later development of ED in the context of childhood OCD. Clinicians should be alert to ED subthreshold symptoms in young girls presenting with OCD. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the relationship between childhood OCD and later ED.

525,Heart rate after trauma and the specificity of fear circuitry disorders,"  Background Fear circuitry disorders purportedly include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia and specific phobia. It is proposed that these disorders represent a cluster of anxiety disorders triggered by stressful events and lead to fear conditioning. Elevated heart rate (HR) at the time of an aversive event may reflect strength of the unconditioned response, which may contribute to fear circuitry disorders. Method This prospective cohort study assessed HR within 48 h of hospital admission in 602 traumatically injured patients, who were assessed during hospital admission and within 1 month of trauma exposure for lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. At 3 months after the initial assessment, 526 patients (87%) were reassessed for PTSD, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Results At the 3-month assessment there were 77 (15%) new cases of fear circuitry disorder and 87 new cases of non-fear circuitry disorder (17%). After controlling for gender, age, type of injury and injury severity, patients with elevated HR (defined as [= or &gt;, slanted]96 beats per min) at the time of injury were more likely to develop PTSD [odds ratio (OR) 5.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32-14.43], panic disorder (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.16-10.34), agoraphobia (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.76-8.61) and social phobia (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.42-11.14). Elevated HR also predicted new fear circuitry disorders that were not co-morbid with a non-fear circuitry disorder (OR 7.28, 95% CI 2.14-24.79). Conclusions These data provide tentative evidence of a common mechanism underpinning the onset of fear circuitry disorders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",917419978.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011

The aim of this study was to test a theoretical model of CBT and investigate if cognitions and/or behaviour mediated the changes seen in CBT for IBS. Method To assess for possible mediating effects, we applied path analysis to the dataset of 149 diagnosed participants randomized to mebeverine hydrochloride plus CBT or mebeverine hydrochloride alone. Primary outcome was symptom severity, while secondary outcomes were work and social adjustment and anxiety. Results The path analyses supported mediational paths for all outcomes. Changes in behaviour and cognitions mediated all three outcomes, with models placing behaviour change 'upstream' of cognition change having best fit. The analyses of model fits revealed best fit for the anxiety model and hence provide increased confidence in the causal model of anxiety. Conclusions Changes in behaviour and cognitions mediate the change in CBT given to IBS patients. The results strengthen the validity of a theoretical model of CBT by confirming the interaction of cognitive, emotional and behavioural factors in IBS.

At 3 months after the initial assessment, 526 patients (87%) were reassessed for PTSD, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Results. At the 3-month assessment there were 77 (15%) new cases of fear circuitry disorder and 87 new cases of non-fear circuitry disorder (17%). After controlling for gender, age, type of injury and injury severity, patients with elevated HR (defined as at least 96 beats per min) at the time of injury were more likely to develop PTSD [odds ratio (OR) 5.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32-14.43], panic disorder (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.16-10.34), agoraphobia (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.76-8.61) and social phobia (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.42-11.14). Elevated HR also predicted new fear circuitry disorders that were not co-morbid with a non-fear circuitry disorder (OR 7.28, 95% CI 2.14-24.79). Conclusions. These data provide tentative evidence of a common mechanism underpinning the onset of fear circuitry disorders. Adapted from the source document.",1023092485.0, Journal Article,2011
531,A randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based cognitive-behavioural skills package for carers of people with anorexia nervosa,"Background. Anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a major burden on families. Carers (e.g. parents or partners) of people with AN are often highly distressed and may inadvertently respond in ways that can contribute to the maintenance of the disorder, e.g. through high levels of over-involvement and criticism [also known as expressed emotion (EE)]. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel web-based systemic cognitive-behavioural (CBT) intervention for carers of people with AN, designed to reduce carer distress and teach skills in how to offer effective support. Method. Carers of people with AN (n=64) were randomly allocated to either the web-intervention, overcoming anorexia online, with limited clinician supportive guidance (by email or phone), or to ad-hoc usual support from the UK patient and carer organization Beat. Carer outcomes were assessed at post-treatment (4 months) and follow-up (6 months). Results. Compared with the control intervention, web-based treatment significantly reduced carers' anxiety and depression (primary outcome) at post-treatment, with a similar trend in carers' EE. Other secondary outcomes did not favour the online intervention. Gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions. This is the first ever study to use an online CBT program to successfully reduce carer distress and improve carers' ability to support the person with AN.

532,"Prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in preterm and full-term children, adolescents and young adults: a meta-analysis","Background. Preterm (PT) birth and low birth weight (LBW) are high-prevalence events that are associated with adverse outcomes in the longer term, with vulnerability increasing as maturity at birth decreases. Psychiatric symptomatology appears heightened in PT/LBW survivors, though there are some discordant findings from studies using questionnaire measures, particularly with respect to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method. This article synthesises findings from research using clinical psychiatric diagnostic criteria in PT/LBW individuals aged 10-25 years compared with term-born peers. Key outcomes of interest were the rates of individuals receiving any psychiatric diagnosis and the number of diagnoses of anxiety or depressive disorders. Results. A literature search for studies reporting prevalence of 'any diagnosis' yielded five studies that met inclusion criteria, with a total of 565 PT/LBW and 533 control individuals. Also, five studies were found that reported rates of anxiety/depression (692 PT/LBW and 605 control individuals). The risk of these outcomes was increased for PT/LBW individuals compared with controls [any diagnosis: odds ratio (OR) 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-5.21; anxiety or depressive disorder: OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.73-4.73]. Conclusions. The studies reviewed here indicate that, in addition to monitoring and management of medical and cognitive sequelae, the psychological well-being of PT/LBW individuals should be a key part of ongoing care.

533,The clinical effectiveness of CBT-based guided self-help interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders: a systematic review,"  Background Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help (GSH) has been suggested to be an effective intervention for mild to moderate anxiety and depression, yet the evidence seems inconclusive, with some studies reporting that GSH is effective and others finding that GSH is ineffective. GSH differs in important respects from other levels of self-help, yet the literature regarding exclusively guided self-help interventions for anxiety and depression has not been reviewed systematically. Method A literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining CBT-based GSH interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were searched; several journals spanning key disciplines were hand-searched; reference lists of included review articles were scanned and relevant first authors were contacted. Results Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis indicated the effectiveness of GSH at post-treatment, although GSH was found to have limited effectiveness at follow-up or among more clinically representative samples. Studies that reported greater effectiveness of GSH tended to be of lower methodological quality and generally involved participants who were self-selected rather than recruited through clinical referrals. Conclusions Although there is support for the effectiveness of CBT-based GSH among media-recruited individuals, the finding that the reviewed RCTs had limited effectiveness within routine clinical practice demonstrates that the evidence is not conclusive. Further rigorous evidence based on clinical populations that examines longer-term outcomes is required before CBT-based GSH interventions can be deemed effective for adults accessing primary care services for treatment of anxiety and depression.",904546044.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
534,Genetic and environmental risk factors for sexual distress and its association with female sexual dysfunction,"  Background The DSM-V Working Group is currently re-evaluating distress as a primary diagnostic criterion for female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Here, for the first time, we explored the epidemiology of sexual distress and its putative aetiological relationship to FSD by estimating the influence of genetic and environmental risk factors. Method Questionnaire data on a representative sample of 930 British female twins using validated scales of FSD and sexual distress were subject to variance components analyses to quantify latent genetic and environmental factors influencing phenotypic variation and covariation. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify other potential risk factors of sexual distress. Results Of 319 women with any sexual problems, only 36.5% reported distress. Of women classified as functional, 16.5% felt sexual distress. Sexual distress had a heritability of 44% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.54]. Bivariate analysis suggested that the majority (91% CI 86-99%) of the covariance between sexual distress and FSD was due to unique environmental effects common to both traits. Associations were found between sexual distress and other risk variables, including relationship dissatisfaction [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, p&lt;0.001], anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology (OR 1.2, p&lt;0.01, for both). Conclusions There seems to be a weak phenotypic and genetic basis for including sexual distress as a diagnostic indicator of FSD. Instead, the data indicate that unrelated psychological factors play an important role in sexual distress and tentatively suggest that sexual distress is less a consequence of FSD and more related to general anxiety among women.",904544495.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
535,Autistic-like traits and their association with mental health problems in two nationwide twin cohorts of children and adults,"  Background Autistic-like traits (ALTs), that is restrictions in intuitive social interaction, communication and flexibility of interests and behaviors, were studied in two population-based Swedish twin studies, one in children and one in adults: (1) to examine whether the variability in ALTs is a meaningful risk factor for concomitant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, conduct problems, depression and substance abuse, and (2) to assess whether common genetic and environmental susceptibilities can help to explain co-existence of ALTs and traits associated with such concomitant problems. Method Two nationwide twin cohorts from Sweden (consisting of 11 222 children and 18 349 adults) were assessed by DSM-based symptom algorithms for autism. The twins were divided into six groups based on their degree of ALTs and the risk for concomitant mental health problems was calculated for each group. Genetic and environmental susceptibilities common to ALTs and the other problem types were examined using bivariate twin modeling. Results In both cohorts, even the lowest degree of ALTs increased the risk for all other types of mental health problems, and these risk estimates increased monotonically with the number of ALTs. For all conditions, common genetic and environmental factors could be discerned. Overall, the phenotypic correlation between ALTs and the traits examined were less pronounced in adulthood than in childhood and less affected by genetic compared with environmental factors. Conclusions Even low-grade ALTs are relevant to clinical psychiatry as they increase the risk for several heterotypical mental health problems. The association is influenced partly by common genetic and environmental susceptibilities. Attention to co-existing ALTs is warranted in research on a wide range of mental disorders.",904544493.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
536,Neural correlates of perception of emotional facial expressions in out-patients with mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety. A multicenter fMRI study,"  Background Depression has been associated with limbic hyperactivation and frontal hypoactivation in response to negative facial stimuli. Anxiety disorders have also been associated with increased activation of emotional structures such as the amygdala and insula. This study examined to what extent activation of brain regions involved in perception of emotional faces is specific to depression and anxiety disorders in a large community-based sample of out-patients. Method An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm was used including angry, fearful, sad, happy and neutral facial expressions. One hundred and eighty-two out-patients (59 depressed, 57 anxiety and 66 co-morbid depression-anxiety) and 56 healthy controls selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were included in the present study. Whole-brain analyses were conducted. The temporal profile of amygdala activation was also investigated. Results Facial expressions activated the amygdala and fusiform gyrus in depressed patients with or without anxiety and in healthy controls, relative to scrambled faces, but this was less evident in patients with anxiety disorders. The response shape of the amygdala did not differ between groups. Depressed patients showed dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) hyperactivation in response to happy faces compared to healthy controls. Conclusions We suggest that stronger frontal activation to happy faces in depressed patients may reflect increased demands on effortful emotion regulation processes triggered by mood-incongruent stimuli. The lack of strong differences in neural activation to negative emotional faces, relative to healthy controls, may be characteristic of the mild-to-moderate severity of illness in this sample and may be indicative of a certain cognitive-emotional processing reserve.",904540879.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
537,"Common limbic and frontal-striatal disturbances in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder and hypochondriasis","  Background Direct comparisons of brain function between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety or OCD spectrum disorders are rare. This study aimed to investigate the specificity of altered frontal-striatal and limbic activations during planning in OCD, a prototypical anxiety disorder (panic disorder) and a putative OCD spectrum disorder (hypochondriasis). Method The Tower of London task, a 'frontal-striatal' task, was used during functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements in 50 unmedicated patients, diagnosed with OCD (n=22), panic disorder (n=14) or hypochondriasis (n=14), and in 22 healthy subjects. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were calculated for contrasts of interest (planning versus baseline and task load effects). Moreover, correlations between BOLD responses and both task performance and state anxiety were analysed. Results Overall, patients showed a decreased recruitment of the precuneus, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus, compared with healthy controls. There were no statistically significant differences in brain activation between the three patient groups. State anxiety was negatively correlated with dorsal frontal-striatal activation. Task performance was positively correlated with dorsal frontal-striatal recruitment and negatively correlated with limbic and ventral frontal-striatal recruitment. Multiple regression models showed that adequate task performance was best explained by independent contributions from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (positive correlation) and amygdala (negative correlation), even after controlling for state anxiety. Conclusions Patients with OCD, panic disorder and hypochondriasis share similar alterations in frontal-striatal brain regions during a planning task, presumably partly related to increased limbic activation.",904540132.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011

544,"The nature, frequency and course of psychiatric disorders in the first year after traumatic brain injury: a prospective study","  Background Psychiatric disorders are common following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, few studies have examined the course of disorder development and the influence of pre-injury psychiatric history. The present study aimed to examine the frequency of, and association between, psychiatric disorders occurring pre- and post-injury, and to examine the post-injury course of disorders. Method Participants were 102 adults (75.5% male) with predominantly moderate-severe TBI. Participants were initially assessed for pre-injury and current disorders, and reassessed at 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). Results Over half of the participants had a pre-injury psychiatric disorder; predominantly substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders. In the first year post-injury, 60.8% of participants had a psychiatric disorder, commonly anxiety and mood disorders. Post-injury disorders were associated with the presence of a pre-injury history (p&lt;0.01), with 74.5% of participants with a pre-injury psychiatric history experiencing a post-injury disorder, which commonly presented at initial assessment or in the first 6 months. However, 45.8% of participants without a pre-injury history developed a novel post-injury disorder, which was less likely to emerge at the initial assessment and generally developed later in the year. Conclusions Despite evidence that most post-injury psychiatric disorders represent the continuation of pre-existing disorders, a significant number of participants developed novel psychiatric disorders. This study demonstrates that the timing of onset may differ according to pre-injury history. There seem to be different trajectories for anxiety and depressive disorders. This research has important implications for identifying the time individuals are most at risk of psychiatric disorders post-injury.

545,A longitudinal etiologic model for symptoms of anxiety and depression in women,"  Background Designed as state measures to monitor treatment response, symptoms of anxiety and depression (SxAnxDep) also have trait-like characteristics. No comprehensive etiologic model for SxAnxDep has illuminated the inter-relationship between their state- and trait-like characteristics, while including key predictor variables. Method In a prospective three-wave study of 2395 female twins from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD), we examined, using structural equation modeling, how genes, childhood and past-year environmental stressors, personality and episodes of major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) influence SxAnxDep. Results The best-fit model, which explained 68-74% of the variance in SxAnxDep, revealed two etiologic pathways. Stable levels of SxAnxDep resulted largely from neuroticism, which in turn was influenced by genetic and early environment risk factors. Occasion-specific influences resulted from stressful events mediated through episodes of MD or GAD. These two pathways, which had approximately equal influences on levels of SxAnxDep, were substantially correlated because the genetic, early environmental and personality factors that impacted on stable symptom levels also predisposed to event exposure and disorder onset. No significant interaction was seen between the two pathways. Conclusions SxAnxDep in women in the general population arise from two inter-related causal pathways. The first, the 'trait-like' pathway, reflects genetic and early environmental risk factors, and is mediated largely through personality. The second pathway is mediated through episodes of MD and GAD, and is the result of both recent environmental adversities and trait-like factors that influence event exposure and the probability of disorder onset.

546,Predicting the onset of major depression in primary care: international validation of a risk prediction algorithm from Spain,"  Background The different incidence rates of, and risk factors for, depression in different countries argue for the need to have a specific risk algorithm for each country or a supranational risk algorithm. We aimed to develop and validate a predictD-Spain risk algorithm (PSRA) for the onset of major depression and to compare the performance of the PSRA with the predictD-Europe risk algorithm (PERA) in Spanish primary care. Method A prospective cohort study with evaluations at baseline, 6 and 12 months. We measured 39 known risk factors and used multi-level logistic regression and inverse probability weighting to build the PSRA. In Spain (4574), Chile (2133) and another five European countries (5184), 11 891 non-depressed adult primary care attendees formed our at-risk population. The main outcome was DSM-IV major depression (CIDI). Results Six variables were patient characteristics or past events (sex, age, sexxage interaction, education, physical child abuse, and lifetime depression) and six were current status [Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical score, SF-12 mental score, dissatisfaction with unpaid work, number of serious problems in very close persons, dissatisfaction with living together at home, and taking medication for stress, anxiety or depression]. The C-index of the PSRA was 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.84]. The Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) was 0.0558 [standard error (s.e.)=0.0071, Zexp=7.88, p&lt;0.0001] mainly due to the increase in sensitivity. Both the IDI and calibration plots showed that the PSRA functioned better than the PERA in Spain. Conclusions The PSRA included new variables and afforded an improved performance over the PERA for predicting the onset of major depression in Spain. However, the PERA is still the best option in other European countries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",904041929.0," Feature , Journal Article , Comparative Study",2011
547,Factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression in five cohorts of community-based older people: the HALCyon (Healthy Ageing across the Life Course) Programme,"  Background Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in older people, but the relative importance of factors operating in early and later life in influencing risk is unclear, particularly in the case of anxiety. Method We used data from five cohorts in the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme: the Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936, the Caerphilly Prospective Study, the Hertfordshire Ageing Study, the Hertfordshire Cohort Study and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921. We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between factors from early and later life and risk of anxiety or depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each. Results Greater neuroticism, poorer cognitive or physical function, greater disability and taking more medications were associated in cross-sectional analyses with an increased overall likelihood of anxiety or depression. Associations between lower social class, either in childhood or currently, history of heart disease, stroke or diabetes and increased risk of anxiety or depression were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounding or mediating variables. There was no association between birth weight and anxiety or depression in later life. Conclusions Anxiety and depression in later life are both strongly linked to personality, cognitive and physical function, disability and state of health, measured concurrently. Possible mechanisms that might underlie these associations are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",904039090.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
548,Latent class analysis of co-morbidity in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England 2007: implications for DSM-5 and ICD-11,"  Background Psychiatric co-morbidity is complex and ubiquitous. Our aim was to describe the extent, nature and patterning of psychiatric co-morbidity within a representative sample of the adult population of England, using latent class analysis. Method Data were used from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a two-phase national household survey undertaken in 2007 comprising 7325 participants aged 16 years and older living in private households in England. The presence of 15 common mental health and behavioural problems was ascertained using standardized clinical and validated self-report measures, including three anxiety disorders, depressive episode, mixed anxiety depressive disorder, psychosis, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit disorder, alcohol and drug dependencies, problem gambling and attempted suicide. Results A four-class model provided the most parsimonious and informative explanation of the data. Most participants (81.6%) were assigned to a non-symptomatic or 'Unaffected' class. The remainder were classified into three qualitatively different symptomatic classes: 'Co-thymia' (12.4%), 'Highly Co-morbid' (5.0%) and 'Addictions' (1.0%). Classes differed in mean numbers of conditions and impairments in social functioning, and these dimensions were correlated. Conclusions Our findings confirm that mental disorders typically co-occur and are concentrated in a relatively small number of individuals. Conditions associated with the highest levels of disability, mortality and cost - psychosis, suicidality and personality disorders - are often co-morbid with more common conditions. This needs to be recognized when planning services and when considering aetiology. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",904039085.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
549,Co-morbidity between major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders: shared etiology or direct causation?,"  Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (ANX) are debilitating and prevalent conditions that often co-occur in adolescence and young adulthood. The leading theoretical models of their co-morbidity include the direct causation model and the shared etiology model. The present study compared these etiological models of MDD-ANX co-morbidity in a large, prospective, non-clinical sample of adolescents tracked through age 30. Method Logistic regression was used to examine cross-sectional associations between ANX and MDD at Time 1 (T1). In prospective analyses, Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine T1 predictors of subsequent disorder onset, including risk factors specific to each disorder or common to both disorders. Prospective predictive effect of a lifetime history of one disorder (e.g. MDD) on the subsequent onset of the second disorder (e.g. ANX) was then examined. This step was repeated while controlling for common risk factors. Results The findings supported relatively distinct profiles of risk between MDD and ANX depending on order of development. Whereas the shared etiology model best explained co-morbid cases in which MDD preceded ANX, direct causation was supported for co-morbid cases in which ANX preceded MDD. Conclusions Consistent with previous research, significant cross-sectional and prospective associations were found between MDD and ANX. The results of the present study suggest that different etiological models may characterize the co-morbidity between MDD and ANX based upon the temporal order of onset. Implications for classification and prevention efforts are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",904039077.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
550,The influence of immigrant status and concentration on psychiatric disorder in Canada: a multi-level analysis,"  Background Many studies have reported an increased incidence of psychiatric disorder (particularly psychotic disorders) among first generation adult immigrants, along with an increasing risk for ethnic minorities living in low-minority concentration neighborhoods. These studies have depended mostly on European case-based databases. In contrast, North American studies have suggested a lower risk for psychiatric disorder in immigrants, although the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration has not been studied extensively. Method Using multi-level modeling to disaggregate individual from area-level influences, this study examines the influence of first generation immigrant status at the individual level, immigrant concentration at the neighborhood-level and their combined effect on 12-month prevalence of mood, anxiety and substance-dependence disorders and lifetime prevalence of psychotic disorder, among Canadians. Results Individual-level data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 1.2, a cross-sectional study of psychiatric disorder among Canadians over the age of 15 years; the sample for analysis was n=35 708. The CCHS data were linked with neighborhood-level data from the Canadian Census 2001 for multi-level logistic regression. Immigrant status was associated with a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorder, with an added protective effect for immigrants living in neighborhoods with higher immigrant concentrations. Immigrant concentration was not associated with elevated prevalence of psychiatric disorder among non-immigrants. Conclusions The finding of lower 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorder in Canadian immigrants, with further lessening as the neighborhood immigrant concentration increases, reflects a model of person-environment fit, highlighting the importance of studying individual risk factors within environmental contexts.

551,Co-occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst older adults in low- and middle-income countries: findings from the 10/66 study,"  Background There is relative little information about the prevalence and risk factors of co-morbid anxiety and depression in later life. These disorders are often associated with worse response to treatment than either condition alone, and researching their epidemiology in diverse settings is vital to policy makers. We therefore investigated the co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive syndromes amongst older adults living in developing countries and measured the separate and joint effect of these two disorders on levels of associated disability. Method The 10/66 study carried out cross-cultural surveys of all residents aged 65 years or over (n=15021) in 11 sites in seven countries (People's Republic of China, India, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico and Peru). Anxiety was measured by using the Geriatric Mental State Examination and the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy diagnostic system. Depression was assessed according to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) and EURO-D criteria. Disability was measured by using the World Health Organization's Disablement Assessment Scale Version II. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to investigate the association of common mental disorders and disability. Results The prevalence of co-occurring anxiety and depression (with the exclusion of subthreshold disorders) ranged between 0.9% and 4.2% across sites. Gender, socio-economic status, urbanicity and physical co-morbidities were associated with the different co-morbid states. Having both disorders was linked to higher disability scores than having anxiety or depression alone. Conclusions Given the close association of co-morbid anxiety and depression with disability, new policies to improve prevention, recognition and treatment will be needed to adapt to ageing populations and their mental health needs.

552,Emotional triggering and low socio-economic status as determinants of depression following acute coronary syndrome,"  Background The determinants of depression following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are poorly understood. Triggering of ACS by emotional stress and low socio-economic status (SES) are predictors of adverse outcomes. We therefore investigated whether emotional triggering and low SES predict depression and anxiety following ACS. Method This prospective observational clinical cohort study involved 298 patients with clinically verified ACS. Emotional stress was assessed for the 2 h before symptom onset and compared with the equivalent period 24 h earlier using case-crossover methods. SES was defined by household income and education. Depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and anxiety with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 3 weeks after ACS and again at 6 and 12 months. Age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, duration of hospital stay and history of depression were included as covariates. Results Emotional stress during the 2-h hazard period was associated with increased risk of ACS (odds ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.61). Both low income and emotional triggering predicted depression and anxiety at 3 weeks and 6/12 months independently of covariates. The two factors interacted, with the greatest depression and anxiety in lower income patients who experienced acute emotional stress. Education was not related to depression. Conclusions Patients who experience acute emotional stress during their ACS and are lower SES as defined by current affluence and access to resources are particularly vulnerable to subsequent depression and anxiety.",906777950.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
553,Psychopathology in young adults born at extremely low birth weight,"  Background Little is known about the long-term mental health of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (&lt;1000 g) survivors. We test whether young adults aged 22 to 26 years born at ELBW differ from normal birth weight (NBW) controls in self-reported levels of psychopathology. Method Participants included 142 ELBW survivors (86% response) born between 1977 and 1982 to residents of central-west Ontario, Canada and 133 NBW control subjects (92% response). The Young Adult Self-Report measure was used to create five DSM-IV oriented scales aggregated to form internalizing (depressive problems, anxiety problems, avoidant personality problems) and externalizing (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder problems and antisocial personality problems) scales. Results After adjusting for family background characteristics, mean scores for ELBW survivors were 3.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-5.26] points higher for internalizing problems and no different, i.e. 0.00 (95% CI -1.17 to 1.17), for externalizing problems. There was a sexxgroup statistical interaction such that being male muted the risk for externalizing problems among those born at ELBW: -2.11 (95% CI -4.21 to -0.01). Stratifying ELBW adults as born small for gestational age (SGA) versus appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA) revealed a significant gradient of risk for levels of internalizing problems that was largest for SGA, i.e. 4.75 (95% CI 1.24-8.26), and next largest for AGA, 2.49 (95% CI 0.11-4.87), compared with NBW controls. Conclusions Depression, anxiety and avoidant personality problems (internalizing problems) are elevated in young adulthood among ELBW survivors.

554,Barriers to mental health treatment: results from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication,"  Background The aim was to examine barriers to initiation and continuation of treatment among individuals with common mental disorders in the US general population. Method Respondents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication with common 12-month DSM-IV mood, anxiety, substance, impulse control and childhood disorders were asked about perceived need for treatment, structural barriers and attitudinal/evaluative barriers to initiation and continuation of treatment. Results Low perceived need was reported by 44.8% of respondents with a disorder who did not seek treatment. Desire to handle the problem on one's own was the most common reason among respondents with perceived need both for not seeking treatment (72.6%) and for dropping out of treatment (42.2%). Attitudinal/evaluative factors were much more important than structural barriers both to initiating (97.4% v. 22.2%) and to continuing (81.9% v. 31.8%) of treatment. Reasons for not seeking treatment varied with illness severity. Low perceived need was a more common reason for not seeking treatment among individuals with mild (57.0%) than moderate (39.3%) or severe (25.9%) disorders, whereas structural and attitudinal/evaluative barriers were more common among respondents with more severe conditions. Conclusions Low perceived need and attitudinal/evaluative barriers are the major barriers to treatment seeking and staying in treatment among individuals with common mental disorders. Efforts to increase treatment seeking and reduce treatment drop-out need to take these barriers into consideration as well as to recognize that barriers differ as a function of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.",904542590.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
555,An international risk prediction algorithm for the onset of generalized anxiety and panic syndromes in general practice attendees: predictA,"  Background There are no risk models for the prediction of anxiety that may help in prevention. We aimed to develop a risk algorithm for the onset of generalized anxiety and panic syndromes. Method Family practice attendees were recruited between April 2003 and February 2005 and followed over 24 months in the UK, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia (Europe4 countries) and over 6 months in The Netherlands, Estonia and Chile. Our main outcome was generalized anxiety and panic syndromes as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire. We entered 38 variables into a risk model using stepwise logistic regression in Europe4 data, corrected for over-fitting and tested it in The Netherlands, Estonia and Chile. Results There were 4905 attendees in Europe4, 1094 in Estonia, 1221 in The Netherlands and 2825 in Chile. In the algorithm four variables were fixed characteristics (sex, age, lifetime depression screen, family history of psychological difficulties); three current status (Short Form 12 physical health subscale and mental health subscale scores, and unsupported difficulties in paid and/or unpaid work); one concerned country; and one time of follow-up. The overall C-index in Europe4 was 0.752 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.724-0.780]. The effect size for difference in predicted log odds between developing and not developing anxiety was 0.972 (95% CI 0.837-1.107). The validation of predictA resulted in C-indices of 0.731 (95% CI 0.654-0.809) in Estonia, 0.811 (95% CI 0.736-0.886) in The Netherlands and 0.707 (95% CI 0.671-0.742) in Chile. Conclusions PredictA accurately predicts the risk of anxiety syndromes. The algorithm is strikingly similar to the predictD algorithm for major depression, suggesting considerable overlap in the concepts of anxiety and depression.",904028108.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011

559,"Relationship between adiposity, emotional status and eating behaviour in obese women: role of inflammation","Background. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation that may lead to emotional distress and behavioural symptoms. This study assessed the relationship between adiposity, low-grade inflammation, eating behaviour and emotional status in obese women awaiting gastric surgery and investigated the effects of surgery-induced weight loss on this relationship. Method. A total of 101 women with severe or morbid obesity awaiting gastric surgery were recruited. Assessments were performed before and at 1 year post-surgery and included the measurement of neuroticism and extraversion using the revised Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness personality inventory (NEO-PI-R) and eating behaviour using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). Blood samples were collected for the measurement of serum inflammatory markers [interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP)] and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin). Results. At baseline, body mass index (BMI) was positively correlated with inflammatory markers and adipokines. Regression analyses adjusting for age and diabetes revealed that baseline concentrations of IL-6 and hsCRP were associated with the depression and anxiety facets of neuroticism, with higher inflammation predicting higher anxiety and depression. This association remained significant after adjusting for BMI. Gastric surgery induced significant weight loss, which correlated with reduced inflammation. After controlling for BMI variations, decreases in inflammatory markers, notably hsCRP, were associated with reduced anxiety and TFEQ-cognitive restraint scores. Conclusions. These findings indicate strong associations between adiposity, inflammation and affectivity in obese subjects and show that surgery-induced weight loss is associated concomitantly with reduced inflammation and adipokines and with significant improvement in emotional status and eating behaviour. Inflammatory status appears to represent an important mediator of emotional distress and psychological characteristics of obese individuals.

560,Predictors of onset of depression and anxiety in the year after diagnosis of breast cancer,"Background. Depression and anxiety are common after diagnosis of breast cancer. We examined to what extent these are recurrences of previous disorder and, controlling for this, whether shame, self-blame and low social support after diagnosis predicted onset of depression and anxiety subsequently. Method. Women with primary breast cancer who had been treated surgically self-reported shame, self-blame, social support and emotional distress post-operatively. Psychiatric interview 12 months later identified those with adult lifetime episodes of major depression (MD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before diagnosis and onset over the subsequent year. Statistical analysis examined predictors of each disorder in that year. Results. Of the patients, two-thirds with episodes of MD and 40% with episodes of GAD during the year after diagnosis were experiencing recurrence of previous disorder. Although low social support, self-blame and shame were each associated with both MD and GAD after diagnosis, they did not mediate the relationship of disorder after diagnosis with previous disorder. Low social support, but not shame or self-blame, predicted recurrence after controlling for previous disorder. Conclusions. Anxiety and depression during the first year after diagnosis of breast cancer are often the recurrence of previous disorder. In predicting disorder following diagnosis, self-blame and shame are merely markers of previous disorder. Low social support is an independent predictor and therefore may have a causal role.

561,A computer-assisted depression intervention in primary care,"Background. The clinical benefit for depression of an interactive computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral program on CD-ROM, the Wellness Workshop (WW), was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Method. A total of 191 individuals referred by primary-care physicians were randomly assigned to a control group, where physician-directed treatment as usual (TAU) was provided, or to a treatment group, where TAU was supplemented with the WW CD-ROM, delivered by mail (WW+TAU). Data were collected at baseline, at 6 weeks' post-intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up assessment. Participants were given a strong incentive by a reimbursement of $75 for completion of each assessment. Measures included symptom ratings obtained via structured clinical diagnostic interviews, as well as a battery of self-report questionnaires on symptoms specifically targeted by the intervention. Results. Analysis of results demonstrated evidence for skill acquisition for improving dysfunctional thinking and reducing anxiety. Among those who met diagnostic criteria for depression, WW + TAU participants were three times more likely to remit at 6 weeks' post-test than TAU participants. Conclusions. The evidence supports the conclusion that the WW intervention added benefit to traditional care for depression. No placebo comparison group was included and the WW + TAU participants received slightly more attention (a supportive telephone contact, 5 mm or less from a psychologist 2 weeks after receiving the program). Overall, the findings add support to the accumulating evidence for the potential clinical benefit of computer-assisted behavioral health interventions.

562,The anxiety disorders and suicidal ideation: accounting for co-morbidity via underlying personality traits,"Background. The anxiety disorders are robust correlates/predictors of suicidal ideation, but it is unclear whether (a) the anxiety disorders are specifically associated with suicidal ideation or (b) the association is due to co-morbidity with depression and other disorders. One means of modeling co-morbidity is through the personality traits neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE) and extraversion/positive emotionality (E/PE), which account for substantial shared variance among the internalizing disorders. The current study examines the association between the internalizing disorders and suicidal ideation, after controlling for co-morbidity via N/NE and E/PE. Method. The sample consisted of 327 psychiatric out-patients. Multiple self-report and interview measures were collected for internalizing disorders [depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety, panic and specific phobia] and suicidal ideation, as well as self-report measures for N/NE and E/PE. A model was hypothesized in which each disorder and suicidal ideation was regressed on N/NE, and depression and social anxiety were regressed on E/PE. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the unique association of suicidality with each disorder, beyond shared variance with N/NE and E/PE. Results. The hypothesized model was an acceptable fit to the data. Although zero-order analyses indicated that suicidal ideation was moderately to strongly correlated with all of the disorders, only depression and PTSD remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the SEM analyses. Conclusions. In a latent variable model that accounts for measurement error and a broad source of co-morbidity, only depression and PTSD were uniquely associated with suicidal ideation; panic, GAD, social anxiety and specific phobia were not.

567,Empirical foundations for the diagnosis of somatization: implications for DSM-5,"Background. The aim of this study was to develop empirically validated criteria for the diagnoses of clinically relevant somatization. Method. This study was performed in a population-representative cohort consisting of 461 males (47.8%) and 503 females (52.2%), with an average age of 55.8 years (S.D. = 11.1). Somatization, anxiety and depression were derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Mplus was used to perform confirmative factor analyses on the current DSM-IV symptom groups; on alternative symptom clusters previously suggested; and to perform latent class analysis in order to define an empirically derived cut-off for somatization. Results. The existence of symptom groups as described in DSM-IV was not supported by our data, whereas a differentiation between cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal and general somatic symptoms did fit our data. Latent class analysis revealed two classes characterized by few (n = 859) and many (n = 105) symptoms. The class of subjects could be approached by a simple cut-off of four functional symptoms (sensitivity 79%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 82%, negative predictive value 97%) regardless of the number of organ systems involved. Conclusions. This study in a large population-representative cohort suggests that a simple symptom count can be used as a dimensional diagnosis of somatization. In those instances in which a categorical diagnosis is preferred, a simple cut-off of four out of 43 functional symptoms best fitted our data. We did not find any added value for incorporating the number of symptom dusters into the diagnostic criteria. Adapted from the source document.",881450956.0, Journal Article,2011
568,Childhood sexual abuse and abnormal personality: a population-based study,"Background. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been shown to be a risk factor for personality disorder (PD). However, no previous studies have examined whether associations exist between sexual abuse and abnormal personality as measured both categorically and dimensionally. Such enquiry would more fully illuminate the impact of CSA on adult personality. Method. Using a large nationally representative sample, we set out to examine associations between CSA and categorically defined PD. We also examined associations between CSA and the five dimensions of personality (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). A total of 1520 young adults were interviewed to determine the prevalence of sexual abuse occurring before age 16 years. A dimensional measure of personality was completed by 1469 participants, and 1145 had an informant-based PD assessment. Results. PD was independently associated with repeated CSA [fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-3.4]. Repeated sexual abuse was also associated with higher neuroticism and lower agreeableness (p values for both <0.001). Adjusting for the effects of potential confounders and mediators, including earlier symptoms of anxiety and depression, had little impact on the strength of associations. Conclusions. We conclude that repeated CSA is independently associated with categorically defined PD, and also with higher neuroticism and lower agreeableness. Our findings suggest that if a dimensional classification of PDs is adopted in future classification systems, there might be meaningful continuity with previous aetiological research conducted using the current categorical system.

570,Empirical foundations for the diagnosis of somatization: implications for DSM-5,"  Background The aim of this study was to develop empirically validated criteria for the diagnoses of clinically relevant somatization. Method This study was performed in a population-representative cohort consisting of 461 males (47.8%) and 503 females (52.2%), with an average age of 55.8 years (s.d.=11.1). Somatization, anxiety and depression were derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Mplus was used to perform confirmative factor analyses on the current DSM-IV symptom groups; on alternative symptom clusters previously suggested; and to perform latent class analysis in order to define an empirically derived cut-off for somatization. Results The existence of symptom groups as described in DSM-IV was not supported by our data, whereas a differentiation between cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal and general somatic symptoms did fit our data. Latent class analysis revealed two classes characterized by few ( n =859) and many ( n =105) symptoms. The class of subjects could be approached by a simple cut-off of four functional symptoms (sensitivity 79%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 82%, negative predictive value 97%) regardless of the number of organ systems involved. Conclusions This study in a large population-representative cohort suggests that a simple symptom count can be used as a dimensional diagnosis of somatization. In those instances in which a categorical diagnosis is preferred, a simple cut-off of four out of 43 functional symptoms best fitted our data. We did not find any added value for incorporating the number of symptom clusters into the diagnostic criteria.",865886479.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011
571,The pathway from glandular fever to chronic fatigue syndrome: can the cognitive behavioural model provide the map?,"Background. The cognitive behavioural model of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) suggests that the illness is caused through reciprocal interactions between physiology, cognition, emotion and behaviour. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the psychological factors operationalized in this model could predict the onset of CFS following an acute episode of infectious mononucleosis commonly known as glandular fever (GF). Method. A total of 246 patients with GF were recruited into this prospective cohort study. Standardized self-report measures of perceived stress, perfectionism, somatization, mood, illness beliefs and behaviour were completed at the time of their acute illness. Follow-up questionnaires determined the incidence of new-onset chronic fatigue (CF) at 3 months and CFS at 6 months post-infection. Results. Of the participants, 9.4% met the criteria for CF at 3 months and 7.8% met the criteria for CPS at 6 months. Logistic regression revealed that factors proposed to predispose people to CFS including anxiety, depression, somatization and perfectionism were associated with new-onset CFS. Negative illness beliefs including perceiving GF to be a serious, distressing condition, that will last a long time and is uncontrollable, and responding to symptoms in an all-or-nothing behavioural pattern were also significant predictors. All-or-nothing behaviour was the most significant predictor of CFS at 6 months. Perceived stress and consistently limiting activity at the time of GF were not significantly associated with CFS. Conclusions. The findings from this study provide support for the cognitive behavioural model and a good basis for developing prevention and early intervention strategies for CFS.

572,The role of mental disorders in the risk and speed of transition to alcohol use disorders among community youth,"Among adolescents and young adults with DSM-IV alcohol use disorders (AUDs), there are inter-individual differences in the speed of transition from initial alcohol use (ALT) to AUD. AUDs are highly co-morbid with other mental disorders. The factors associated with rapid transition from first AU to AUD remain unknown and the role of mental disorders in rapid transitions is unclear. Given this background we examined (1) whether prior anxiety, mood, externalizing and non-alcohol substance use disorders are related to the risk and speed of transition from first AU to DSM-IV alcohol abuse (AA) and alcohol dependence (AD) and (2) whether early age of onset of prior mental disorders (PMDs) is a promoter of rapid transition. Method. A total of 3021 community subjects (97.7% lifetime AU) aged 14-24 years at baseline were followed up prospectively for up to 10 years. AU and mental disorders were assessed with the DSM-TV/M-CIDI. Results. Among subjects with lifetime AU, several PMDs, such as specific phobia, bipolar disorder and nicotine dependence, were associated with an increased risk of AUD independent of externalizing disorders. Associations of PMDs with the speed of transition to AUDs were mostly weak and inconsistent. Only social phobia and externalizing disorders were associated with faster transitions to AD even after adjustment for other PMDs. Earlier age of onset of PMD was not associated with rapid transition. Conclusions. Mental disorders are associated with the risk of AUD. With the possible exception of social phobia and externalizing disorders, they do not promote rapid transition, even if they occur particularly early. Future research needs to identify factors relevant to rapid transition to AUD. Adapted from the source document.",875712749.0, Journal Article,2011
573,Attenuated responses to emotional expressions in women with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is under-researched despite its high prevalence and large impact on the healthcare system. There is a paucity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that explore the neural correlates of emotional processing in GAD. The present study investigated the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to processing positive and negative facial emotions in patients with GAD. Method. A total of 15 female GAD patients and 16 female controls undertook an implicit face emotion task during fMRI scanning. They also performed a face emotion recognition task outside the scanner. Results. The only behavioural difference observed in GAD patients was less accurate detection of sad facial expressions compared with control participants. However, GAD patients showed an attenuated BOLD signal in the prefrontal cortex to fearful, sad, angry and happy facial expressions and an attenuated signal in the anterior cingulate cortex to happy and fearful facial expressions. No differences were found in amygdala response. Conclusions. In contrast with previous research, this study found BOLD signal attenuation in the ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex during face emotion processing, consistent with a hypothesis of hypo-responsivity to external emotional stimuli in GAD. These decreases were in areas that have been implicated in emotion and cognition and may reflect an altered balance between internally and externally directed attentional processes.

574,The association of personality disorders with the prospective 7-year course of anxiety disorders,"Background. This study prospectively examined the natural clinical course of six anxiety disorders over 7 years of follow-up in individuals with personality disorders (PDs) and/or major depressive disorder. Rates of remission, relapse, new episode onset and chronicity of anxiety disorders were examined for specific associations with PDs. Method. Participants were 499 patients with anxiety disorders in the Collaborative longitudinal Personality Disorders Study, who were assessed with structured interviews for psychiatric disorders at yearly intervals throughout 7 years of follow-up. These data were used to determine probabilities of changes in disorder status for social phobia (SP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (CCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder and panic disorder with agoraphobia. Results. Estimated remission rates for anxiety disorders in this study group ranged from 73% to 94%. For those patients who remitted from an anxiety disorder, relapse rates ranged from 34% to 67%. Rates for new episode onsets of anxiety disorders ranged from 3% to 17%. Specific PDs demonstrated associations with remission, relapse, new episode onsets and chronicity of anxiety disorders. Associations were identified between schizotypal PD with course of SP, PTSD and GAD; avoidant PD with course of SP and CCD; obsessive-compulsive PD with course of GAD, CCD, and agoraphobia; and borderline PD with course of CCD, GAD and panic with agoraphobia. Conclusions. Findings suggest that specific PD diagnoses have negative prognostic significance for the course of anxiety disorders underscoring the importance of assessing and considering PD diagnoses in patients with anxiety disorders.

575,Concomitants of paranoia in the general population,"Background. Paranoia is an unregarded but pervasive attribute of human populations. In this study we carried out the most comprehensive investigation so far of the demographic, economic, social and clinical correlates of self-reported paranoia in the general population. Method. Data weighted to be nationally representative were analysed from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England (APMS 2007; n=7281). Results. The prevalence of paranoid thinking in the previous year ranged from 18.6% reporting that people were against them, to 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause them serious harm. At all levels, paranoia was associated with youth, lower intellectual functioning, being single, poverty, poor physical health, poor social functioning, less perceived social support, stress at work, less social cohesion, less calmness, less happiness, suicidal ideation, a great range of other psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, worry, phobias, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), cannabis use, problem drinking and increased use of treatment and services. Conclusions. Overall, the results indicate that paranoia has the widest of implications for health, emotional well-being, social functioning and social inclusion. Some of these concomitants may contribute to the emergence of paranoid thinking, while others may result from it. Adapted from the source document.",875712255.0, Journal Article,2011
576,Borderline personality disorder co-morbidity: relationship to the internalizing-externalizing structure of common mental disorders,"Background. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) shows high levels of co-morbidity with an array of psychiatric disorders. The meaning and causes of this co-morbidity are not fully understood. Our objective was to investigate and clarify the complex co-morbidity of BPD by integrating it into the structure of common mental disorders. Method. We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on diagnostic interview data from a representative US population-based sample of 34653 civilian, non-institutionalized individuals aged 18 years or older. We modeled the structure of lifetime DSM-TV diagnoses of BPD and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, marijuana dependence, and any other drug dependence. Results. In both women and men, the internalizing-externalizing structure of common mental disorders captured the co-morbidity among all disorders including BPD. Although BPD was unidimensional in terms of its symptoms, BPD as a disorder showed associations with both the distress subfactor of the internalizing dimension and the externalizing dimension. Conclusions. The complex patterns of co-morbidity observed with BPD represent connections to other disorders at the level of latent internalizing and externalizing dimensions. BPD is meaningfully connected with liabilities shared with common mental disorders, and these liability dimensions provide a beneficial focus for understanding the co-morbidity, etiology and treatment of BPD.

583,Universal prevention of depression in women postnatally: cluster randomized trial evidence in primary care,"Background. To test whether receiving care from a health visitor (HV) trained in identification and psychological intervention methods prevents depression 6-18 months postnatally in women who are not depressed 6 weeks postnatally. Method. The study was a prospective duster trial, randomized by GP practice, with follow-up for 18 months in 101 primary care teams in the Trent area of England. The participants were women scoring <12 on the postal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 weeks postnatally (1474 intervention and 767 control women). Intervention HVs (n = 89, 63 clusters) were trained in identifying depressive symptoms using the EPDS and face-to-face clinical assessment and in providing psychologically orientated sessions based on cognitive behavioral or person-centered principles. The control group comprised HVs (n=49, 37 clusters) providing care as usual (CAU). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women scoring 12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. Secondary outcomes were mean EPDS score, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation -- Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI-SF) scores at 6, 12 and 18 months. Results. After adjusting for individual-level covariates, living alone, previous postnatal depression (PND), the presence of one or more adverse life events and the 6-week EPDS score, the odds ratio (OR) for EPDS 12 at 6 months was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.97, p =0.031] for the intervention group (IG) women compared with the control (CAU) group women. Two subgroups were formed by baseline severity: a 'subthreshold' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 6-11 (n =999) and a 'lowest severity' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 0-5 (n = 1242). There was no difference in psychological effectiveness by subgroup (interaction term: z = -0.28, p = 0.782). Conclusions. This study provides new evidence of a universal, enduring preventive effect for depression in women who screen negative for depression postnatally.

584,Personal debt and suicidal ideation,"Background. Personal debt is one of many factors associated with anxiety, depression and suicidality. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between personal debt and suicidal ideation in the context of sociodemographic factors, employment and income, lifestyle behaviours, and recently experienced traumatic events. Method. Interviews were conducted with a random probability sample comprising 7461 respondents for the third national survey of psychiatric morbidity of adults in England. Fieldwork was carried out throughout 2007. The prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the past week, past year and lifetime was assessed and current sources of debt were recorded. Results. In 2007, 4.3% of adults in England had thought about taking their own life in the past 12 months, ranging from 1.8% of men aged 55 years to 7.0% of women aged 35-54 years. Those in debt were twice as likely to think about suicide after controlling for sociodemographic, economic, social and lifestyle factors. Difficulty in making hire purchase or mail order repayments and paying off credit card debt, in addition to housing-related debt (rent and mortgage arrears), was strongly associated with suicidal thoughts. Feelings of hopelessness partially mediated the relationship between debt and suicidal ideation. Conclusions. The number of debts, source of the debt and reasons for debt are key correlates of suicidal ideation. Individuals experiencing difficulties in repaying their debts because they are unemployed or have had a relationship breakdown or have heavy caring responsibilities may require psychiatric evaluation in addition to debt counselling.

585,The impact of the Val158Met catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype on neural correlates of sad facial affect processing in patients with bipolar disorder and their relatives,"Background. The Met allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) valine-to-methionine (Val158Met) polymorphism is known to affect dopamine-dependent affective regulation within amygdala-prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks. It is also thought to increase the risk of a number of disorders characterized by affective morbidity including bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. The disease risk conferred is small, suggesting that this polymorphism represents a modifier locus. Therefore our aim was to investigate how the COMT Val158Met may contribute to phenotypic variation in clinical diagnosis using sad facial affect processing as a probe for its neural action. Method. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activation in the amygdala, ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and ventrolateral PFC (vlFFC) during sad facial affect processing in family members with BD (n =40), MDD and anxiety disorders (n=22) or no psychiatric diagnosis (n=25) and 50 healthy controls. Results. Irrespective of clinical phenotype, the Val158 allele was associated with greater amygdala activation and the Met158 allele with greater signal change in the vmPFC and vlPFC. Signal changes in the amygdala and vmPFC were not associated with disease expression. However, in the right vlPFC the Met158 allele was associated with greater activation in all family members with affective morbidity compared with relatives without a psychiatric diagnosis and healthy controls. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism has a pleiotropic effect within the neural networks subserving emotional processing. Furthermore the Met158 allele further reduces cortical efficiency in the v1PFC in individuals with affective morbidity. Adapted from the source document.",868221309.0, Journal Article,2011
586,Mental and personality disorders and abstinence from alcohol: results from a national household survey,"Background. The beneficial outcomes associated with moderate compared with low alcohol intake or abstinence may be due to the inclusion of people as 'low consumers', who have stopped consumption because of poor health. We investigated the association between alcohol abstinence and symptoms of common mental disorder and personality disorder, distinguishing between lifelong abstinence and abstinence following previous consumption. Method. Analyses were based on the British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity 2000, which sampled 8580 residents aged 16-74 years. Hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) was excluded. Symptoms of common mental disorder (depression/anxiety) were identified by the Clinical interview Schedule. The screening questionnaire of the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis II Personality Disorders was used to identify potential personality disorder. Self-reported alcohol abstinence was divided into lifelong abstinence and previous consumption. Previous consumers were asked why they had stopped. Covariates included socio-economic status, social activity and general health status. Results. After adjustment, alcohol abstinence was associated with both common mental disorder symptoms and any personality disorder, but only for previous consumers, in whom odds ratios were 1.69 (95% CI 1.23-2.32) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.09-1.94). Associations were non-specific, being apparent for most individual mental disorder symptoms and personality disorder categories. More detailed analysis indicated that associations were again limited to previous consumers who reported ceasing alcohol consumption for health reasons. Conclusions. Worse mental health in low alcohol consumers, particularly those who have previously ceased for health reasons, should be taken into account when interpreting associations between moderate (compared with low) alcohol consumption and beneficial health outcomes.

587,Neural correlates of trait anxiety in fear extinction,"Background. Fear conditioning involves the amygdala as the main neural structure for learning fear responses whereas fear extinction mainly activates the inhibitory prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during fear conditioning and extinction. Method. Thirty-two healthy subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 T while performing a cued fear-conditioning task. All participants completed the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), Activations of the amygdala and the dACC were examined with respect to the effects of trait anxiety. Results. Analysis of the fMRI data demonstrated enhanced activation in fear-related brain areas, such as the insula and the ACC, during both fear conditioning and extinction. Activation of the amygdala appeared only during the late acquisition phase whereas deactivation was observed during extinction. Regression analyses revealed that highly trait-anxious subjects exhibited sustained amygdala activation and reduced dACC involvement during the extinction of conditioned responses. Conclusions. This study reveals that high levels of trait anxiety are associated with both increased amygdala activation and reduced dACC recruitment during the extinction of conditioned fear. This hyper-responsitivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders.

588,Battlefield-like stress following simulated combat and suppression of attention bias to threat,"Background. Acute stress disorder involves prominent symptoms of threat avoidance. Preliminary cross-sectional data suggest that such threat-avoidance symptoms may also manifest cognitively, as attentional threat avoidance. Confirming these findings in a longitudinal study might provide insights on risk prediction and anxiety prevention in traumatic exposures. Method. Attention-threat bias and post-traumatic symptoms were assessed in soldiers at two points in time: early in basic training and 23 weeks later, during advanced combat training. Based on random assignment, the timing of the repeat assessment occurred in one of two schedules: for a combat simulation group, the repeat assessment occurred immediately following a battlefield simulation exercise, and for a control group, the assessment occurred shortly before this exercise. Results. Both group showed no threat-related attention bias at initial assessments. Following acute stress, the combat simulation group exhibited a shift in attention away from threat whereas the control group showed no change in attention bias. Stronger threat avoidance in the combat simulation group correlated with severity of post-traumatic symptoms. Such an association was not found in the control group. Conclusions. Acute stress may lead some individuals to shift their attention away from threats, perhaps to minimize stress exposure. This acute attention response may come at a psychological cost, given that it correlates with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Further research is needed to determine how these associations relate to full-blown PTSD in soldier and civilian populations. Adapted from the source document.",868221191.0, Journal Article,2011

Conclusions: The number of debts, source of the debt and reasons for debt are key correlates of suicidal ideation. Individuals experiencing difficulties in repaying their debts because they are unemployed or have had a relationship breakdown or have heavy caring responsibilities may require psychiatric evaluation in addition to debt counseling.

591,Neural correlates of trait anxiety in fear extinction,"  Background: Fear conditioning involves the amygdala as the main neural structure for learning fear responses whereas fear extinction mainly activates the inhibitory prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during fear conditioning and extinction. Method: Thirty-two healthy subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 T while performing a cued fear-conditioning task. All participants completed the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). Activations of the amygdala and the dACC were examined with respect to the effects of trait anxiety. Results: Analysis of the fMRI data demonstrated enhanced activation in fear-related brain areas, such as the insula and the ACC, during both fear conditioning and extinction. Activation of the amygdala appeared only during the late acquisition phase whereas deactivation was observed during extinction. Regression analyses revealed that highly trait-anxious subjects exhibited sustained amygdala activation and reduced dACC involvement during the extinction of conditioned responses. Conclusions: This study reveals that high levels of trait anxiety are associated with both increased amygdala activation and reduced dACC recruitment during the extinction of conditioned fear. This hyper-responsitivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders.

592,Universal prevention of depression in women postnatally: cluster randomized trial evidence in primary care,"  Background: To test whether receiving care from a health visitor (HV) trained in identification and psychological intervention methods prevents depression 6-18 months postnatally in women who are not depressed 6 weeks postnatally. Method: The study was a prospective cluster trial, randomized by GP practice, with follow-up for 18 months in 101 primary care teams in the Trent area of England. The participants were women scoring &lt;12 on the postal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 weeks postnatally (1474 intervention and 767 control women). Intervention HVs (n=89, 63 clusters) were trained in identifying depressive symptoms using the EPDS and face-to-face clinical assessment and in providing psychologically orientated sessions based on cognitive behavioral or person-centered principles. The control group comprised HVs (n=49, 37 clusters) providing care as usual (CAU). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women scoring [= or &gt;, slanted]12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. Secondary outcomes were mean EPDS score, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI-SF) scores at 6, 12 and 18 months. Results: After adjusting for individual-level covariates, living alone, previous postnatal depression (PND), the presence of one or more adverse life events and the 6-week EPDS score, the odds ratio (OR) for EPDS [= or &gt;, slanted]12 at 6 months was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.97, p=0.031] for the intervention group (IG) women compared with the control (CAU) group women. Two subgroups were formed by baseline severity: a 'subthreshold' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 6-11 (n=999) and a 'lowest severity' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 0-5 (n=1242). There was no difference in psychological effectiveness by subgroup (interaction term: z=-0.28, p=0.782). Conclusions: This study provides new evidence of a universal, enduring preventive effect for depression in women who screen negative for depression postnatally.

593,Mental and personality disorders and abstinence from alcohol: results from a national household survey,"  Background: The beneficial outcomes associated with moderate compared with low alcohol intake or abstinence may be due to the inclusion of people as 'low consumers', who have stopped consumption because of poor health. We investigated the association between alcohol abstinence and symptoms of common mental disorder and personality disorder, distinguishing between lifelong abstinence and abstinence following previous consumption. Method: Analyses were based on the British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity 2000, which sampled 8580 residents aged 16-74 years. Hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) was excluded. Symptoms of common mental disorder (depression/anxiety) were identified by the Clinical Interview Schedule. The screening questionnaire of the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis II Personality Disorders was used to identify potential personality disorder. Self-reported alcohol abstinence was divided into lifelong abstinence and previous consumption. Previous consumers were asked why they had stopped. Covariates included socio-economic status, social activity and general health status. Results: After adjustment, alcohol abstinence was associated with both common mental disorder symptoms and any personality disorder, but only for previous consumers, in whom odds ratios were 1.69 (95% CI 1.23-2.32) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.09-1.94). Associations were non-specific, being apparent for most individual mental disorder symptoms and personality disorder categories. More detailed analysis indicated that associations were again limited to previous consumers who reported ceasing alcohol consumption for health reasons. Conclusions: Worse mental health in low alcohol consumers, particularly those who have previously ceased for health reasons, should be taken into account when interpreting associations between moderate (compared with low) alcohol consumption and beneficial health outcomes.

594,The impact of the Val158Met catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype on neural correlates of sad facial affect processing in patients with bipolar disorder and their relatives,"  Background: The Met allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) valine-to-methionine (Val158Met) polymorphism is known to affect dopamine-dependent affective regulation within amygdala-prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks. It is also thought to increase the risk of a number of disorders characterized by affective morbidity including bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. The disease risk conferred is small, suggesting that this polymorphism represents a modifier locus. Therefore our aim was to investigate how the COMT Val158Met may contribute to phenotypic variation in clinical diagnosis using sad facial affect processing as a probe for its neural action. Method: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activation in the amygdala, ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) during sad facial affect processing in family members with BD (n=40), MDD and anxiety disorders (n=22) or no psychiatric diagnosis (n=25) and 50 healthy controls. Results: Irrespective of clinical phenotype, the Val158 allele was associated with greater amygdala activation and the Met158 allele with greater signal change in the vmPFC and vlPFC. Signal changes in the amygdala and vmPFC were not associated with disease expression. However, in the right vlPFC the Met158 allele was associated with greater activation in all family members with affective morbidity compared with relatives without a psychiatric diagnosis and healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism has a pleiotropic effect within the neural networks subserving emotional processing. Furthermore the Met158 allele further reduces cortical efficiency in the vlPFC in individuals with affective morbidity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",853634692.0," Feature , Journal Article",2011

Empirical examinations of interpersonal behaviors in individuals with SAD have frequently relied on analogue samples, global retrospective reports and laboratory observation. Moreover, research has focused on avoidance and safety behaviors, neglecting potential links between SAD and affiliative behaviors. The influence of situational anxiety and emotional security on interpersonal behaviors was examined for individuals with SAD (n=40) and matched normal controls (n=40). Participants monitored their behavior and affect in naturally occurring social interactions using an event-contingent recording procedure. Individuals with SAD reported higher levels of submissive behavior and lower levels of dominant behavior relative to controls. Consistent with cognitive-behavioral and evolutionary theories, elevated anxiety in specific events predicted increased submissiveness among individuals with SAD. Consistent with attachment theory, elevations in event-level emotional security were associated with increased affiliative behaviors (increased agreeable behavior and decreased quarrelsome behavior) among members of the SAD group. Results were not accounted for by concurrent elevations in sadness or between-group differences in the distribution of social partners. These findings are consistent with predictions based on several theoretical perspectives. Further, the present research documents naturally occurring interpersonal patterns of individuals with SAD and identifies conditions under which these individuals may view social interactions as opportunities for interpersonal connectedness.

596,"Ageing, social class and common mental disorders: longitudinal evidence from three cohorts in the West of Scotland","Understanding how common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression vary with socio-economic circumstances as people age can help to identify key intervention points. However, much research treats these conditions as a single disorder when they differ significantly in terms of their disease burden. This paper examines the socio-economic pattern of anxiety and depression separately and longitudinally to develop a better understanding of their disease burden for key social groups at different ages. The Twenty-07 Study has followed 4510 respondents from three cohorts in the West of Scotland for 20 years and 3846 respondents had valid data for these analyses. Hierarchical repeated-measures models were used to investigate the relationship between age, social class and the prevalence of anxiety and depression over time measured as scores of 8 or more out of 21 on the relevant subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social class differences in anxiety and depression widened with age. For anxiety there was a nonlinear decrease in prevalence with age, decreasing more slowly for those from manual classes compared to non-manual, whereas for depression there was a non-linear increase in prevalence with age, increasing more quickly for those from manual classes compared to non-manual. This relationship is robust to cohort, period and attrition effects. The more burdensome disorder of depression occurs more frequently at ages where socio-economic inequalities in mental health are greatest, representing a 'double jeopardy' for older people from a manual class.

601,"A randomized trial of sertraline, self-administered cognitive behavior therapy, and their combination for panic disorder","Self-administered cognitive behavior therapy (SCBT) has been shown to be an effective alternative to therapist-delivered treatment for panic disorder (PD). However, it is unknown whether combining SCBT and antidepressants can improve treatment. This trial evaluated the efficacy of SCBT and sertraline, alone or in combination, in PD. Patients (n=251) were randomized to 12 weeks of either placebo drug, placebo drug plus SCBT, sertraline, or sertraline plus SCBT. Those who improved after 12 weeks of acute treatment received treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Outcome measures included core PD symptoms (panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic avoidance), dysfunctional cognitions (fear of bodily sensations, agoraphobic cognitions), disability, and clinical global impression of severity and improvement. Efficacy data were analyzed using general and generalized linear mixed models. Primary analyses of trends over time revealed that sertraline/SCBT produced a significantly greater rate of decline in fear of bodily sensations compared to sertraline, placebo/SCBT and placebo. Trends in other outcomes were not significantly different over time. Secondary analyses of mean scores at week 12 revealed that sertraline/SCBT fared better on several outcomes than placebo, with improvement being maintained at the end of continuation treatment. Outcome did not differ between placebo and either sertraline monotherapy or placebo/SCBT. Moreover, few differences emerged between the active interventions. This trial suggests that sertraline combined with SCBT may be an effective treatment for PD. The study could not confirm the efficacy of sertraline monotherapy or SCBT without concomitant medication or therapist assistance in the treatment of PD.

602,A randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioural therapy versus short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy versus no intervention for patients with hypochondriasis,"Hypochondriasis is common in the clinic and in the community. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in previous trials. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a treatment routinely offered to patients with hypochondriasis in many countries, including Denmark. The aim of this study was to test CBT for hypochondriasis in a centre that was not involved in its development and compare both CBT and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) to a waiting-list control and to each other. CBT was modified by including mindfulness and group therapy sessions, reducing the therapist time required. STPP consisted of individual sessions. Eighty patients randomized to CBT, STPP and the waiting list were assessed on measures of health anxiety and general psychopathology before and after a 6-month treatment period. Waiting-list patients were subsequently offered one of the two active treatments on the basis of re-randomization, and assessed on the same measures post-treatment. Patients were again assessed at 6- and 12-month follow-up points. Patients who received CBT did significantly better on all measures relative to the waiting-list control group, and on a specific measure of health anxiety compared with STPP. The STPP group did not significantly differ from the waiting-list group on any outcome measures. Similar differences were observed between CBT and STPP during follow-up, although some of the significant differences between groups were lost. A modified and time-saving CBT programme is effective in the treatment of hypochondriasis, although the two psychotherapeutic interventions differed in structure.

609,Emotional triggering and low socio-economic status as determinants of depression following acute coronary syndrome,"The determinants of depression following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are poorly understood. Triggering of ACS by emotional stress and low socio-economic status (SES) are predictors of adverse outcomes. We therefore investigated whether emotional triggering and low SES predict depression and anxiety following ACS. This prospective observational clinical cohort study involved 298 patients with clinically verified ACS. Emotional stress was assessed for the 2 h before symptom onset and compared with the equivalent period 24 h earlier using case-crossover methods. SES was defined by household income and education. Depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and anxiety with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 3 weeks after ACS and again at 6 and 12 months. Age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score, duration of hospital stay and history of depression were included as covariates. Emotional stress during the 2-h hazard period was associated with increased risk of ACS (odds ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.61). Both low income and emotional triggering predicted depression and anxiety at 3 weeks and 6/12 months independently of covariates. The two factors interacted, with the greatest depression and anxiety in lower income patients who experienced acute emotional stress. Education was not related to depression. Patients who experience acute emotional stress during their ACS and are lower SES as defined by current affluence and access to resources are particularly vulnerable to subsequent depression and anxiety.

610,The influence of immigrant status and concentration on psychiatric disorder in Canada: a multi-level analysis,"Many studies have reported an increased incidence of psychiatric disorder (particularly psychotic disorders) among first generation adult immigrants, along with an increasing risk for ethnic minorities living in low-minority concentration neighborhoods. These studies have depended mostly on European case-based databases. In contrast, North American studies have suggested a lower risk for psychiatric disorder in immigrants, although the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration has not been studied extensively. Using multi-level modeling to disaggregate individual from area-level influences, this study examines the influence of first generation immigrant status at the individual level, immigrant concentration at the neighborhood-level and their combined effect on 12-month prevalence of mood, anxiety and substance-dependence disorders and lifetime prevalence of psychotic disorder, among Canadians. Individual-level data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 1.2, a cross-sectional study of psychiatric disorder among Canadians over the age of 15 years; the sample for analysis was n=35 708. The CCHS data were linked with neighborhood-level data from the Canadian Census 2001 for multi-level logistic regression. Immigrant status was associated with a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorder, with an added protective effect for immigrants living in neighborhoods with higher immigrant concentrations. Immigrant concentration was not associated with elevated prevalence of psychiatric disorder among non-immigrants. The finding of lower 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorder in Canadian immigrants, with further lessening as the neighborhood immigrant concentration increases, reflects a model of person-environment fit, highlighting the importance of studying individual risk factors within environmental contexts.

611,Latent class analysis of co-morbidity in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England 2007: implications for DSM-5 and ICD-11,"Psychiatric co-morbidity is complex and ubiquitous. Our aim was to describe the extent, nature and patterning of psychiatric co-morbidity within a representative sample of the adult population of England, using latent class analysis. Data were used from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a two-phase national household survey undertaken in 2007 comprising 7325 participants aged 16 years and older living in private households in England. The presence of 15 common mental health and behavioural problems was ascertained using standardized clinical and validated self-report measures, including three anxiety disorders, depressive episode, mixed anxiety depressive disorder, psychosis, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit disorder, alcohol and drug dependencies, problem gambling and attempted suicide. A four-class model provided the most parsimonious and informative explanation of the data. Most participants (81.6%) were assigned to a non-symptomatic or 'Unaffected' class. The remainder were classified into three qualitatively different symptomatic classes: 'Co-thymia' (12.4%), 'Highly Co-morbid' (5.0%) and 'Addictions' (1.0%). Classes differed in mean numbers of conditions and impairments in social functioning, and these dimensions were correlated. Our findings confirm that mental disorders typically co-occur and are concentrated in a relatively small number of individuals. Conditions associated with the highest levels of disability, mortality and cost -- psychosis, suicidality and personality disorders -- are often co-morbid with more common conditions. This needs to be recognized when planning services and when considering aetiology. Adapted from the source document.",908021900.0, Journal Article,2011
612,Co-morbidity between major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders: shared etiology or direct causation,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (ANX) are debilitating and prevalent conditions that often co-occur in adolescence and young adulthood. The leading theoretical models of their co-morbidity include the direct causation model and the shared etiology model. The present study compared these etiological models of MDD-ANX co-morbidity in a large, prospective, non-clinical sample of adolescents tracked through age 30. Logistic regression was used to examine cross-sectional associations between ANX and MDD at Time 1 (T1). In prospective analyses, Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine T1 predictors of subsequent disorder onset, including risk factors specific to each disorder or common to both disorders. Prospective predictive effect of a lifetime history of one disorder (e.g. MDD) on the subsequent onset of the second disorder (e.g. ANX) was then examined. This step was repeated while controlling for common risk factors. The findings supported relatively distinct profiles of risk between MDD and ANX depending on order of development. Whereas the shared etiology model best explained co-morbid cases in which MDD preceded ANX, direct causation was supported for co-morbid cases in which ANX preceded MDD. Consistent with previous research, significant cross-sectional and prospective associations were found between MDD and ANX. The results of the present study suggest that different etiological models may characterize the co-morbidity between MDD and ANX based upon the temporal order of onset. Implications for classification and prevention efforts are discussed. Adapted from the source document.",908021869.0, Journal Article,2011
613,Co-occurrence of anxiety and depression amongst older adults in low- and middle-income countries: findings from the 10/66 study,"There is relative little information about the prevalence and risk factors of co-morbid anxiety and depression in later life. These disorders are often associated with worse response to treatment than either condition alone, and researching their epidemiology in diverse settings is vital to policy makers. We therefore investigated the co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive syndromes amongst older adults living in developing countries and measured the separate and joint effect of these two disorders on levels of associated disability. The 10/66 study carried out cross-cultural surveys of all residents aged 65 years or over (n=15021) in 11 sites in seven countries (People's Republic of China, India, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico and Peru). Anxiety was measured by using the Geriatric Mental State Examination and the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy diagnostic system. Depression was assessed according to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) and EURO-D criteria. Disability was measured by using the World Health Organization's Disablement Assessment Scale Version II. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to investigate the association of common mental disorders and disability. The prevalence of co-occurring anxiety and depression (with the exclusion of subthreshold disorders) ranged between 0.9% and 4.2% across sites. Gender, socio-economic status, urbanicity and physical co-morbidities were associated with the different co-morbid states. Having both disorders was linked to higher disability scores than having anxiety or depression alone. Given the close association of co-morbid anxiety and depression with disability, new policies to improve prevention, recognition and treatment will be needed to adapt to ageing populations and their mental health needs.

614,"The nature, frequency and course of psychiatric disorders in the first year after traumatic brain injury: a prospective study","Psychiatric disorders are common following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, few studies have examined the course of disorder development and the influence of pre-injury psychiatric history. The present study aimed to examine the frequency of, and association between, psychiatric disorders occurring pre- and post-injury, and to examine the post-injury course of disorders. Participants were 102 adults (75.5% male) with predominantly moderate-severe TBI. Participants were initially assessed for pre-injury and current disorders, and reassessed at 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). Over half of the participants had a pre-injury psychiatric disorder; predominantly substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders. In the first year post-injury, 60.8% of participants had a psychiatric disorder, commonly anxiety and mood disorders. Post-injury disorders were associated with the presence of a pre-injury history (p<0.01), with 74.5% of participants with a pre-injury psychiatric history experiencing a post-injury disorder, which commonly presented at initial assessment or in the first 6 months. However, 45.8% of participants without a pre-injury history developed a novel post-injury disorder, which was less likely to emerge at the initial assessment and generally developed later in the year. Despite evidence that most post-injury psychiatric disorders represent the continuation of pre-existing disorders, a significant number of participants developed novel psychiatric disorders. This study demonstrates that the timing of onset may differ according to pre-injury history. There seem to be different trajectories for anxiety and depressive disorders. This research has important implications for identifying the time individuals are most at risk of psychiatric disorders post-injury.

615,A longitudinal etiologic model for symptoms of anxiety and depression in women,"Designed as state measures to monitor treatment response, symptoms of anxiety and depression (SxAnxDep) also have trait-like characteristics. No comprehensive etiologic model for SxAnxDep has illuminated the inter-relationship between their state- and trait-like characteristics, while including key predictor variables. In a prospective three-wave study of 2395 female twins from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD), we examined, using structural equation modeling, how genes, childhood and past-year environmental stressors, personality and episodes of major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) influence SxAnxDep. The best-fit model, which explained 68-74% of the variance in SxAnxDep, revealed two etiologic pathways. Stable levels of SxAnxDep resulted largely from neuroticism, which in turn was influenced by genetic and early environment risk factors. Occasion-specific influences resulted from stressful events mediated through episodes of MD or GAD. These two pathways, which had approximately equal influences on levels of SxAnxDep, were substantially correlated because the genetic, early environmental and personality factors that impacted on stable symptom levels also predisposed to event exposure and disorder onset. No significant interaction was seen between the two pathways. SxAnxDep in women in the general population arise from two inter-related causal pathways. The first, the 'trait-like' pathway, reflects genetic and early environmental risk factors, and is mediated largely through personality. The second pathway is mediated through episodes of MD and GAD, and is the result of both recent environmental adversities and trait-like factors that influence event exposure and the probability of disorder onset.

616,Factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression in five cohorts of community-based older people: the HALCyon (Healthy Ageing across the Life Course) Programme,"Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in older people, but the relative importance of factors operating in early and later life in influencing risk is unclear, particularly in the case of anxiety. We used data from five cohorts in the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme: the Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936, the Caerphilly Prospective Study, the Hertfordshire Ageing Study, the Hertfordshire Cohort Study and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921. We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between factors from early and later life and risk of anxiety or depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each. Greater neuroticism, poorer cognitive or physical function, greater disability and taking more medications were associated in cross-sectional analyses with an increased overall likelihood of anxiety or depression. Associations between lower social class, either in childhood or currently, history of heart disease, stroke or diabetes and increased risk of anxiety or depression were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounding or mediating variables. There was no association between birth weight and anxiety or depression in later life. Anxiety and depression in later life are both strongly linked to personality, cognitive and physical function, disability and state of health, measured concurrently. Possible mechanisms that might underlie these associations are discussed. Adapted from the source document.",908020914.0, Journal Article,2011
617,Predicting the onset of major depression in primary care: international validation of a risk prediction algorithm from Spain,"The different incidence rates of, and risk factors for, depression in different countries argue for the need to have a specific risk algorithm for each country or a supranational risk algorithm. We aimed to develop and validate a predictD-Spain risk algorithm (PSRA) for the onset of major depression and to compare the performance of the PSRA with the predictD-Europe risk algorithm (PERA) in Spanish primary care. A prospective cohort study with evaluations at baseline, 6 and 12 months. We measured 39 known risk factors and used multi-level logistic regression and inverse probability weighting to build the PSRA. In Spain (4574), Chile (2133) and another five European countries (5184), 11 891 non-depressed adult primary care attendees formed our at-risk population. The main outcome was DSM-IV major depression (CIDI). Six variables were patient characteristics or past events (sex, age, sex*age interaction, education, physical child abuse, and lifetime depression) and six were current status [Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical score, SF-12 mental score, dissatisfaction with unpaid work, number of serious problems in very close persons, dissatisfaction with living together at home, and taking medication for stress, anxiety or depression]. The C-index of the PSRA was 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.84]. The Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) was 0.0558 [standard error (s.e.)=0.0071, Zexp=7.88, p<0.0001] mainly due to the increase in sensitivity. Both the IDI and calibration plots showed that the PSRA functioned better than the PERA in Spain. The PSRA included new variables and afforded an improved performance over the PERA for predicting the onset of major depression in Spain. However, the PERA is still the best option in other European countries. Adapted from the source document.",908020546.0, Journal Article,2011
618,Emotion-modulated startle in anxiety disorders is blunted by co-morbid depressive episodes,"Background. While anxiety has been associated with exaggerated emotional reactivity, depression has been associated with blunted, or context insensitive, emotional responding. Although anxiety and depressive disorders are frequently co-morbid, surprisingly little is known about emotional reactivity when the two disorders co-occur. Method. We utilized the emotion-modulated startle (EMS) paradigm to examine the effects of a concurrent depressive episode on emotional reactivity in young adults with anxiety disorders. Using an archival dataset from a multi-disciplinary project on risk factors in childhood-onset depression, we examined eye-blink startle reactions to late-onset auditory startle probes while participants viewed pictures with affectively pleasant, unpleasant and neutral content. EMS response patterns were analyzed in 33 individuals with a current anxiety (but no depressive) disorder, 24 individuals with a current anxiety disorder and co-morbid depressive episode and 96 healthy controls. Results. Control participants and those with a current anxiety disorder (but no depression) displayed normative linearity in startle responses, including potentiation by unpleasant pictures. By contrast, individuals with concurrent anxiety and depression displayed blunted EMS. Conclusions. An anxiety disorder concurrent with a depressive episode is associated with reactivity that more closely resembles the pattern of emotional responding that is typical of depression (i.e. context insensitive) rather than the pattern that is typical for anxiety (i.e. exaggerated).

619,Genetic and environmental influences on internalizing psychopathology vary as a function of economic status,"Background. Different theories of the link between socio-economic status (SES) and mental illness have been postulated. In particular, two theories of this association, social causation and social selection, differ in the implied causal pathway. The authors employ behavior genetic modeling to consider evidence for both social selection and social causation in the relationship between income variation and internalizing disorders. Method. Behavior genetic modeling was used to estimate the presence of gene-environment interaction (GxE, social causation) in the presence of gene-environment correlation (rGE, social selection). Participants were members of a sample of 719 twin pairs from the Midlife in the United States study. Four internalizing (INT) syndromes were assessed: major depression (MD); generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); panic attacks (PA); neuroticism (N). SES was measured with total family household income. Results. One factor best accounted for the variance shared between MD, GAD, PA and N. The etiology of variation in INT changed from high to low levels of income, with unique environmental factors playing a larger role in INT variation at lower levels of income. Across levels of income, rGE between income and INT was modest (low income ra = 0.39 to high income ra = 0.54), implying a selection process operating through genetic effects linking lower income with INT psychopathology. Conclusions. Findings support social causation by suggesting that low income contributes significantly to environmental variation in INT. Modest support was found for social selection, but should be extended using longitudinal designs. Effective interventions for internalizing psychopathology may differ depending on income.

620,Developmental trajectories of psychotic-like experiences across adolescence: impact of victimization and substance use,"Background. Research suggests that psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in the general population are common, but can reflect either transitory or persistent developmental phenomena. Using a general adolescent population it was examined whether different developmental subtypes of PLEs exist and whether different trajectories of PLEs are associated with certain environmental risk factors, such as victimization and substance use. Method. Self-reported PLEs were collected from 409 adolescents (mean age 14 years 7 months) at four time points, each 6 months apart. General growth mixture modelling was utilized to identify classes of adolescents who followed distinct trajectories of PLEs across this period. Predictors of class membership included demographics, personality, victimization, depression, anxiety and substance use. Results. We identified the following three developmental subgroups of PLEs: (1) persistent; (2) increasing; (3) low. Adolescents on the persistent trajectory reported frequent victimization and consistent elevated scores in depression and anxiety. Adolescents on the increasing trajectory were engaging in cigarette use prior to any increases in PLEs and were engaging in cocaine, cannabis and other drug use as PLEs increased at later time points. Conclusions. The findings suggest that different developmental subgroups of PLEs exist in adolescence and are differentially related to victimization and substance use.

621,"Symptoms of depression and anxiety, and change in body mass index from adolescence to adulthood: results from a British birth cohort","Background. Depression and anxiety have been shown to be associated with obesity and underweight, but little is known about how the relationship varies across the life course, from adolescence through adulthood. We aimed to investigate the association between adolescent- and adult-onset affective symptoms and body mass index (BMI) change from age 15 to 53 years. Method. We used data from a British birth cohort born in 1946 and followed up ever since. The relationship between affective symptom profiles, distinguishing adolescent-onset and adult-onset symptoms, and BMI change from adolescence to age 53 years was investigated using multilevel models. Results. Women with adolescent-onset symptoms had lower mean BMI at age 15 years, faster rates of increase across adulthood, and higher BMI at age 53 years than those with no symptoms. Men with adolescent-onset symptoms had lower BMI at all ages from 15 to 53 years. The BMI trajectories of men and women with adult-onset symptoms did not differ from those with absence of symptoms at all ages. Conclusions. The relationship between affective symptoms and change in BMI varies by sex and age at onset of symptoms. Adolescence may be an important period for the development of the association between affective symptoms and weight gain in girls. Intervention to prevent increases in BMI across adult life in women with adolescent-onset symptoms, even if they are not overweight at this age, should be considered.

622,Psychiatric 'diseases' versus behavioral disorders and degree of genetic influence,"Background. Psychiatric conditions in which symptoms arise involuntarily ('diseases') might be assumed to be more heritable than those in which choices are essential (behavioral disorders). We sought to determine whether psychiatric 'diseases' (Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and mood and anxiety disorders) are more heritable than behavioral disorders (substance use disorders and anorexia nervosa). Method. We reviewed the literature for recent quantitative summaries of heritabilities. When these were unavailable, we calculated weighted mean heritabilities from twin studies meeting modern methological standards. Results. Heritability summary estimates were as follows: bipolar disorder (85%), schizophrenia (81%), Alzheimer's disease (75%), cocaine use disorder (72%), anorexia nervosa (60%), alcohol dependence (56%), sedative use disorder (51%), cannabis use disorder (48%), panic disorder (43%), stimulant use disorder (40%), major depressive disorder (37%), and generalized anxiety disorder (28%). Conclusions. No systematic relationship exists between the disease-like character of a psychiatric disorder and its heritability; many behavioral disorders seem to be more heritable than conditions commonly construed as diseases. These results suggest an error in 'common-sense' assumptions about the etiology of psychiatric disorders. That is, among psychiatric disorders, there is no close relationship between the strength of genetic influences and the etiologic importance of volitional processes.
