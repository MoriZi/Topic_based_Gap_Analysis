0,Threat rapidly disrupts reward reversal learning,"Threat changes cognition and facilitates adaptive coping. However, when threat becomes overwhelming, it may be deleterious to mental health, especially for vulnerable individuals. Flexible decision-making was probed with a reward reversal task to investigate how well healthy participants (N = 34) can adapt to changes in reward contingency when they expect adverse events (i.e., electric shocks). In comparison to a safe control condition, the threat of shock significantly impaired reward reversal learning. Moreover, enhanced self-reported threat ratings and elevated skin conductance levels support the successful induction of stressful and aversive apprehensions. The findings are in line with literature showing the stress-induced inhibition of goal-directed behavior at the advantage of a reflexive (habitual) response style. Notably, reversal learning was rapidly restored with the omission of threat through several cycles of threat and safety contexts within one experimental session. These results extend the literature and illuminate the immediate consequence of a sustained threatening stressor (and its removal) on decision-making. Better knowledge of the immediate effects of anticipatory anxiety on behavior could improve understanding of psychopathology and may be informative for the development of effective therapy for anxiety and emotion dysregulation.",2445966824.0, Journal Article,2020
1,Fear in the context of pain: Lessons learned from 100 years of fear conditioning research,"Human fear conditioning research since Watson's case study on ""Little Albert"" has vastly evolved and its impact today is reaching far beyond phobic anxiety. This review focuses on how fear conditioning research, mainly using exteroceptive conditioned stimuli (CSs) and aversive, non-noxious stimuli as unconditioned stimuli (USs), has been extended and translated to chronic pain research. We describe the different pain-related fear conditioning paradigms using proprioceptive and interoceptive CSs and painful stimuli as USs that have been developed to study specific forms of pain-related fear (i.e. fear of movement, fear of touch, fear of visceral sensations, and fear of penetration) that are relevant for different chronic pain conditions (i.e. musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, and genital pain). We present evidence that patients with chronic pain demonstrate impaired safety learning and excessive fear generalization; learning anomalies that have also been observed in anxiety disorders. Extinction-based protocols (exposure in vivo) have been developed to reduce pain-related fear and increase daily functioning in various chronic pain disorders. Finally, we outline some challenges and future directions to further our understanding of learning mechanisms underlying the development, persistence, and treatment of chronic pain disability.",2445966027.0, Journal Article,2020
2,The effects of positive interpretation bias on cognitive reappraisal and social performance: Implications for social anxiety disorder,"People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) lack non-socially anxious individuals' tendency to interpret ambiguous social information in a positively biased manner. To gain a better understanding of the specific in-vivo social consequences of positive interpretation bias, we recruited 38 individuals with SAD and 31 healthy controls (HC) to participate in an in-vivo social task. We tested whether a positive interpretation bias, measured using a sentence completion task, might confer benefits for the adaptive emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal, and whether such benefits depended on participants’ emotional states. We also examined whether positive interpretation bias might confer additional benefits such as improved self-perceived and observer-rated social performance. In support of prior research, HC participants exhibited a positive interpretation bias on the sentence completion task, whereas participants with SAD did not. Regression analyses revealed that positive interpretation bias predicted greater cognitive reappraisal during social stress, particularly when state positive affect was low. Moreover, positive interpretation bias predicted more positive self-perception of social performance and reduced underestimations of performance relative to observer ratings. These results suggest that positive interpretations of ambiguous social information may be related to increased use of cognitive reappraisal and more positive self-perceptions of social performance.",2445965242.0, Journal Article,2020
3,Implementation and effectiveness of adolescent life skills programs in low- and middle-income countries: A critical review and meta-analysis,"Background Adolescence represents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in health. Individual adolescent life skills programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have demonstrated success but neither their relative effectiveness across multiple health arenas, including mental health, nor their key ingredients have been examined. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify key implementation processes and effectiveness of life skills programs among adolescents in LMICs which targeted at least one mental health outcome, as well as their relative effectiveness. Six academic databases, including PubMed and PsychInfo and bibliographies of related reviews, were systematically searched until July 1, 2016, with no restrictions on language or publication year. Studies were excluded if they were conducted in HIC settings, among chronically ill populations or lacking adolescents aged 10–19 years. Data from published reports related to the characteristics of RCTs and their implementation processes related to ‘who, what, how and where’ were extracted, including the development of a taxonomy to determine which life skills constituted each program. Meta-analyses with random effects models examined the overall trial effectiveness, as determined by their primary outcomes. Subsequent exploratory analyses determined which implementation processes predicted trial effectiveness (PROSPERO CRD42016043448). Results We included 50 eligible RCTs from 45 articles with a focus on an adolescent health program, which targeted at least one or more mental health outcomes. Most of the RCTs, conducted across 19 LMICs, targeted students (82%) and refugees (7%), and both genders (71%). Most of the interventions were delivered by teachers (n = 12), and specialist providers (n = 11), and most were focused on high-risk groups rather than clinically-disordered populations. These interventions were effective in reducing symptoms of anger (SMD = 1.234), improving life skills (SMD = 0.755) and functioning (SMD = 0.491), and decreasing PTSD (SMD = 0.327), depression and anxiety (SMD = 0.305). Trial effectiveness was positively associated with the following life skills: interventions focused on parent-child interactions (β = 0.557, p &lt; 0.05), assessing interpersonal relations (β = 0.204, p &lt; 0.05) and stress management (β = 0.216, p &lt; 0.05). Discussion Our results demonstrate the benefits of life skills programs targeting one or more mental health outcomes and co-occurring risk factors in school and community settings. Comprehensive programs focusing on multiple life skills related to the individual, his or her social environment and, in particular, interventions promoting parent-child interactions may hold particular promise in LMICs to address the burden of poor mental health and other health arenas.",2435222091.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
4,The effects of age and trait anxiety on avoidance learning and its generalization,"Avoidance is an important self-protective behavior, but excessive avoidance is maladaptive and a core feature of anxiety disorders. Given that several of these disorders emerge in adolescence, maladaptive avoidance learning might be a risk factor in subsequent psychopathology. The current study investigated the effects of age and trait anxiety on avoidance learning and related processes. Adults and youth completed a differential fear-conditioning task. Thereafter, during avoidance conditioning, participants learned to press a button cancelling an upcoming aversive sound. Next, during extinction, no aversive sound was presented, and the avoidance button was removed. Last, in the generalization test, a series of morphs ranging in similarity from the safety cue to the danger cue were presented, and the avoidance button was reintroduced. Self-reported safety-danger ratings and skin conductance responses were collected. Developmental differences emerged in safety-danger ratings during avoidance conditioning; while adults exhibited a gradual decrease in differential danger ratings, among youth, this response was moderated by trait anxiety levels. Following extinction, participants returned to avoid the danger cue and perceptually similar morphs. Moreover, avoidance response to some generalized stimuli was associated with trait anxiety levels. These findings highlight the importance of examining avoidance learning in relation to anxiety symptoms throughout development.",2445966078.0, Journal Article,2020
5,No robust differences in fear conditioning between patients with fear-related disorders and healthy controls,"Fear conditioning and extinction serve as a dominant model for the development and maintenance of pathological anxiety, particularly for phasic fear to specific stimuli or situations. The validity of this model would be supported by differences in the physiological or subjective fear response between patients with fear-related disorders and healthy controls, whereas the model's validity would be questioned by a lack of such differences. We derived pupillometry, skin conductance response and startle electromyography as well as unconditioned stimulus expectancy in a two-day fear acquisition, immediate extinction and recall task and compared an unmedicated group of patients ( = 73) with phobias or panic disorder and a group of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, n = 21) to a group of carefully screened healthy controls (n = 35). Bayesian statistics showed no convincing evidence for a difference in physiological and subjective responses between the groups during fear acquisition, extinction learning or recall. Only the PTSD subgroup had altered startle reactions during extinction learning. Our data do not provide evidence for general differences in associative fear or extinction learning in fear-related pathologies and thereby question the diagnostic validity of the associative fear learning model of these disorders.",2445966030.0, Journal Article,2020
6,Neurocognitive processes in d-cycloserine augmented single-session exposure therapy for anxiety: A randomized placebo-controlled trial,"Drugs targeting N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the ability to learn new associations have been proposed as adjunct treatments to boost the success of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. However, the effects of the NMDA partial agonist d-cycloserine on psychological treatment have been mixed. We investigated potential neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of d-cycloserine-augmented exposure, to inform the optimal combination of this and similar agents with psychological treatment. Panic disorder patients were randomised to single-dose d-cycloserine (250 mg; N = 17) or matching placebo (N = 16) 2hrs before one session of exposure therapy. Neurocognitive markers were assessed one day after treatment, including reaction-time based threat bias for fearful faces (primary outcome) and amygdala response to threat (secondary outcome). Clinical symptom severity was measured the day before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-months follow-up (secondary outcome). d-cycloserine was associated with greater clinical recovery at 1-month follow-up than placebo (d-cyloserine 71% vs placebo 25%), with the placebo group matching the clinical gains of the d-cycloserine group during 6-months follow-up (d-cycloserine 71% vs placebo 44%). One day after treatment, threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala threat response was lower in the drug compared to placebo group. Lower amygdala magnitude predicted greater clinical improvement during follow-up across groups. While this experimental study is of a preliminary nature due to the limited sample size, these findings highlight a neurocognitive potential mechanism by which d-cycloserine may exert its augmentative effects on psychological treatment and bring forward a marker that may help understand and facilitate development of combination treatments for anxiety.

7,Changes in functional connectivity with cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder predict outcomes at follow-up,"Approximately half of individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) treated with psychological intervention do not achieve clinically significant improvement or retain long-term gains. Neurobiological models of SAD propose that disruptions in functioning of amygdala-prefrontal circuitry is implicated in short-term treatment response. However, whether treatment-related changes in functional connectivity predict long-term well-being after psychotherapy is unknown. Patients with SAD completed an incidental emotion regulation task during fMRI before and after treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy (n = 23, collapsed across groups). Psychophysiological interaction analyses using amygdala seed regions were conducted to assess changes in functional connectivity from pre-to post-treatment that predicted symptom change from 6 to 12-month follow-up. Negative change (i.e., greater inverse/weaker positive) in amygdala connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) predicted greater symptom reduction during follow-up. Positive change in amygdala connectivity with the cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, and pre-central and post-central gyri predicted less symptom reduction (e.g., no change or worsening). Results suggest that strengthened amygdala connectivity with regulatory regions may promote better long-term outcomes, whereas changes with visual and sensorimotor regions may represent sensitization to emotion-related cues, conferring poorer outcomes. Clinical implications for treatment personalization are discussed, should effects replicate in larger samples.",2445964342.0, Journal Article,2020
8,Costly avoidance triggered by categorical fear generalization,"Fear generalization refers to the spread of acquired fear to novel stimuli that resemble the original fear-related stimulus. Preliminary evidence suggests that excessive fear generalization is a pathogenic feature of anxiety disorders, however, it remains unclear how fear generalization affects pathological avoidance. The current study thus aimed to examine the link between categorical fear generalization and costly avoidance. By combining a fear acquisition training phase and an avoidance test, the current findings showed that acquired fear spreads to novel stimuli that belonged to the same category of the original fear-related stimuli, but not to those that belonged to the fear-irrelevant categories. Importantly, participants avoided these fear-related novel stimuli despite costs. The current findings indicate that categorical fear generalization triggers costly avoidance. In terms of clinical implication, a decrease in costly avoidance aligned with a decrease in US expectancies. This emphasizes that behavioral approach may initiate extinction learning.",2445964316.0, Journal Article,2020
9,Identifying the presence and timing of discrete mood states prior to therapy,"The present study tested a novel, person-specific method for identifying discrete mood profiles from time-series data, and examined the degree to which these profiles could be predicted by lagged mood and anxiety variables and time-based variables, including trends (linear, quadratic, cubic), cycles (12-hr, 24-hr, and 7-day), day of the week, and time of day. We analyzed ambulatory data from 45 individuals with mood and anxiety disorders prior to therapy. Data were collected four-times-daily for at least 30 days. Latent profile analysis was applied person-by-person to discretize each individual's continuous multivariate time series of rumination, worry, fear, anger, irritability, anhedonia, hopelessness, depressed mood, and avoidance. That is, each time point was classified according to its unique blend of emotional states, and latent classes representing discrete mood profiles were identified for each participant. We found that the modal number of latent classes per person was three (mean = 3.04, median = 3), with a range of two to four classes. After splitting each individual's time series into random halves for training and testing, we used elastic net regularization to identify the temporal and lagged predictors of each mood profile's presence or absence in the training set. Prediction accuracy was evaluated in the testing set. Across 127 models, the average area under the curve was 0.77, with sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.75. Brier scores indicated an average prediction accuracy of 83%.",2443883918.0, Journal Article,2020
10,Blended care in the treatment of subthreshold symptoms of depression and psychosis in emerging adults: A randomised controlled trial of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily-Life (ACT-DL),"In this study, the feasibility and efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily Life (ACT-DL), ACT augmented with a daily life application, was investigated in 55 emerging adults (age 16 to 25) with subthreshold depressive and/or psychotic complaints. Participants were randomized to ACT-DL (n = 27) or to active control (n = 28), with assessments completed at pre- and post-measurement and 6- and 12-months follow-up. It took up to five (ACT-DL) and 11 (control) months to start group-based interventions. Participants attended on average 4.32 out of 5 ACT-DL sessions. On the app, they filled in on average 69 (48%) of signal-contingent beep-questionnaires, agreed to 15 (41%) of offered beep-exercises, initiated 19 on-demand exercises, and rated ACT-DL metaphors moderately useful. Relative to active control, interviewer-rated depression scores decreased significantly in ACT-DL participants (p = .027). Decreases in self-reported depression, psychotic-related distress, anxiety, and general psychopathology did not differ between conditions. ACT-DL participants reported increased mean NA (p = .011), relative to active controls. Mean PA did not change in either group, nor did psychological flexibility. ACT-DL is a feasible intervention, although adaptations in future research may improve delivery of and compliance with the intervention. There were mixed findings for its efficacy in reducing subthreshold psychopathology in emerging adults.

11,Mental imagery in generalized anxiety disorder: A comparison with healthy control participants,"Mental imagery plays a prominent role across psychopathology. However, its quality and role in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have not been examined as extensively as in other disorders. The goal of the present study was to obtain a better understanding of general imagery processes and individual differences in people with GAD. Adults with GAD (N = 31) were compared to a Healthy Control (HC) group (N = 32) across mental imagery domains as per Pearson, Deeprose, Wallace-Hadrill, Heyes, and Holmes (2013)'s framework: cognitive, general use/experience, and clinical. No differences were found between the GAD and HC groups on cognitive aspects of imagery. Both groups were also similar in their ability to imagine experiences across sensory modalities. No differences were found between groups in their spontaneous use of imagery in everyday situations, or in vividness of sensory-perceptual imagery. For clinical aspects of imagery, between-group differences emerged in the experience of prospective imagery; those with GAD reported greater ""pre-experiencing"" (""intrusive, prospective, personally-relevant imagery""; Deeprose &amp; Holmes, 2010), rated imagined future negative scenarios as more vivid, more likely, and more personally relevant, and evaluated the experience of these images as more intense than did HCs. Taken together, findings suggest that the presence of intrusive mental imagery distinguishes individuals with GAD from those without psychopathology. Findings could help improve interventions utilizing imagery techniques.",2434467984.0, Journal Article,2020
12,"Reflecting on rumination: Consequences, causes, mechanisms and treatment of rumination","We review research showing that rumination has multiple negative consequences: (a) exacerbating psychopathology by magnifying and prolonging negative mood states, interfering with problem-solving and instrumental behaviour and reducing sensitivity to changing contingencies; (b) acting as a transdiagnostic mental health vulnerability impacting anxiety, depression, psychosis, insomnia, and impulsive behaviours; (c) interfering with therapy and limiting the efficacy of psychological interventions; (d) exacerbating and maintaining physiological stress responses. The mechanisms underlying rumination are examined, and a model (H-EX-A-GO-N – Habit development, EXecutive control, Abstract processing, GOal discrepancies, Negative bias) is proposed to account for the onset and maintenance of rumination. H-EX-A-GO-N outlines how rumination results from dwelling on problematic goals developing into a learnt habit that involves the tendency to process negative information in an abstract way, particularly in the context of poor executive control and negative information-processing biases. These proximal factors integrate experimental evidence to provide a partial answer to the critical question of what maintains rumination. They constitute a pathway by which more distal biological and environmental factors increase the likelihood of rumination developing. Treatments for rumination are reviewed, with preliminary trials suggesting that psychological interventions designed to specifically target these mechanisms may be effective at reducing rumination.",2434467918.0, Journal Article,2020
13,Linking inhibition and anxiety symptoms following sleep restriction: The moderating role of prior sleep efficiency,"Although sleep loss increases state anxiety, the effects of partial sleep restriction on specific anxiety symptoms and mechanisms that may influence this relation remain unknown. It is also unknown whether prior sleep buffers the impact of sleep restriction on anxiety symptoms. Thus, the present study examined the relations between inhibition and repetitive negative thinking (RNT), obsessions, and other OCD symptoms following sleep restriction and the moderating role of prior night's sleep efficiency. Healthy sleeping adults (n = 73) completed measures of inhibition, anxiety symptoms, and sleep before and after one night of sleep restriction (4 h between 4:00am and 8:00am). Results indicate significant associations between decreased post-sleep restriction inhibition and increased post-sleep restriction RNT and obsessions. Prior night's subjective and objective sleep efficiency significantly moderated these relations, such that the highest post-sleep restriction anxiety symptoms were reported by those with the lowest post-sleep restriction inhibition and the lowest pre-sleep restriction sleep efficiency. These findings suggest decreased inhibition may be one mechanism by which sleep loss affects anxiety, and those with worse sleep prior to acute sleep loss may be particularly vulnerable. The implications for the prevention and treatment of anxiety-related disorders characterized by intrusive cognition are discussed.",2434467152.0, Journal Article,2020
14,"Avoidance and its bi-directional relationship with conditioned fear: Mechanisms, moderators, and clinical implications","Fear motivates different types of defensive behaviors. These behaviors are, however, not mere byproducts of fear. In this review, we highlight a bi-directional relationship between conditioned fear and instrumental defensive behavior in humans. We discuss mechanisms involved in the link from fear to goal-directed avoidance (e.g., relief, generalization), that may become habitual. These defensive behaviors may in turn reduce, preserve, or amplify fear responding (e.g., protection-from-extinction, behavior-as-information). Multiple factors moderate the bi-directional relationship. Evidence for amplifying and dampening effects of inter-individual differences (e.g., trait anxiety, distress tolerance), intra-individual states (e.g., stress), and external factors (e.g., incentives for competing behavior) on goal-directed and/or habitual defensive behavior is reviewed. However, the exact mechanisms by which these factors moderate the bi-directional relationship are still largely unknown (e.g., modulating avoidance directly vs. indirectly via conditioned fear). Finally, we discuss major implications: First, understanding factors moderating the bi-directional relationship provides insights into risk and resilience factors for anxious psychopathology. Second, specific experimental models and clinical interventions can be mapped onto distinct defensive behaviors (e.g., goal-directed vs. habitual avoidance). More precise matching will help to develop nuanced models and interventions to reduce pathological behaviors and individualize treatments.",2376945118.0, Journal Article,2020
15,Test of an Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Program for at-risk youth (ASAP-Y),"Objective: Adult research supports the efficacy of targeting the malleable risk factor of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in preventing anxiety and related psychopathology. However, very little work has evaluated the impact of AS reduction among youth, which is unfortunate given adolescence is a ""core risk"" period in terms of disorder onset. Method: The primary project aim was to test the effects of an Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Program for Youth (ASAP-Y) among a sample of 88 youth aged 10–14 years with elevated AS. High AS youth and a parent were randomly assigned to either the ASAP-Y, which consisted of psychoeducation and experimenter-led and parent-led exposures, or a general health information control condition. Results: Youth in the intervention condition sustained low AS levels across the intervention period, and although AS levels in both conditions decreased from baseline to the one-month assessment, this decrease was more pronounced at one-month for youth in the intervention condition. Further, significant indirect effects of condition on one-month anxiety and depression symptoms via reduced AS were detected. Homework compliance rates and self-report data support the acceptability of the ASAP-Y. Contrary to hypotheses, differences between conditions in emotional reactivity elicited using experimental psychopathology methods were not observed. Conclusions: The current findings offer preliminary support for the ASAP-Y as an acceptable selective preventive intervention for at-risk youth, with specific anxiety- and depression-related effects through reduced AS.",2376945091.0, Journal Article,2020
16,"Beliefs about losing control, obsessions, and caution: An experimental investigation","Fear of acting on unwanted impulses (e.g., stabbing a loved one) and avoidance of threatening stimuli (e.g., knives) are common phenomena in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Cognitive models of OCD suggest that maladaptive beliefs underlie the development and maintenance of symptoms. The goal of this experiment was to determine whether beliefs about losing control over one's behaviour lead to experiencing anxiety and intrusive thoughts while approaching stimuli that are commonly feared in OCD, and to behaving more cautiously while interacting with the stimuli. Undergraduate participants (N = 128) were provided with false feedback about the meaning of their intrusive thoughts: ""having intrusive thoughts means that you are likely to lose control over your behaviour"" versus ""intrusive thoughts are normal"". Participants were then asked to approach sharp knives in a stepwise manner (i.e., behavioural approach test; BAT). Afterwards, they sorted the stimuli in a knife block as quickly as possible. Participants with higher (versus lower) beliefs about losing control experienced significantly increasing anxiety throughout the BAT. They also remembered experiencing more intrusive thoughts throughout the protocol and perceived themselves as less cautious while sorting the knives. Interestingly, objective measures of intrusive thoughts and caution were not significantly different between conditions.",2376944710.0, Journal Article,2020
17,A review on mental imagery in fear conditioning research 100 years since the 'Little Albert' study,"Since the seminal 'Little Albert' study by Watson and Rayner (1920), fear conditioning has become one of the most commonly used paradigms for studying the etiology of anxiety-related disorders. In a fear conditioning procedure, a (neutral) conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), resulting in fear-related conditioned responses (CRs) to the CS. Whereas fear conditioning research initially focused on observable elements in the environment (i.e., CSs, USs, and their contingency) and their effects (i.e., CRs), subsequent research indicated that attention should also be given to unobservable mental events (e.g., intrusive memories of aversive outcomes) to more fully account for the symptomatology of anxiety disorders. In this paper, we review the research relating to four major research questions on the relationship between mental imagery and fear conditioning: (1) Can mental imagery substitute for actual stimulus administration? (2) Can mental imagery inflate CRs? (3) Can fear conditioning result in the installment of mental images as CRs (i.e., intrusions)? (4) Can mental imagery-based interventions reduce CRs? For all these research questions, tentative confirmatory evidence has been found and these findings corroborate contemporary conditioning theories. Nonetheless, we point to several open questions and methodological issues that require further research.",2376944520.0, Journal Article,2020
18,Distress and anhedonia as predictors of depression treatment outcome: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial,"Two core features of depression include depressed mood (heightened distress) and anhedonia (reduced pleasure). Despite their centrality to depression, studies have not examined their contribution to treatment outcomes in a randomized clinical trial providing mainstream treatments like antidepressant medications (ADM) and cognitive therapy (CT). We used baseline distress and anhedonia derived from a factor analysis of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire to predict remission and recovery in 433 individuals with recurrent/chronic major depressive disorder. Patients were provided with only ADM or both ADM and CT. Overall, higher baseline distress and anhedonia predicted longer times to remission within one year and recovery within three years. When controlling for treatment condition, distress improved prediction of outcomes over and above anhedonia, while anhedonia did not improve prediction of outcomes over and above distress. Interactions with treatment condition demonstrated that individuals with higher distress and anhedonia benefited from receiving CT in addition to ADM, whereas there was no added benefit of CT for individuals with lower distress and anhedonia. Assessing distress and anhedonia prior to treatment may help select patients who will benefit most from CT in addition to ADM. For the treatments and outcome measures tested, utilizing distress to guide treatment planning may yield the greatest benefit.",2358489720.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
19,Approach and avoidance patterns in reward learning across domains: An initial examination of the Social Iowa Gambling Task,"The current study examines learning patterns in response to both monetary and social incentives through both approach and avoidance behaviors using modified versions of the Iowa Gambling Task. Specifically, we investigated learning in response to both positive and negative feedback in a sample of 191 undergraduate students. The social task was a novel paradigm, and social feedback were images of faces displaying positive and negative emotions. We examined internal validity of the tasks through modeling changes in approach and avoidance. We also explored associations between approach and avoidance learning and individual differences in anxiety and social anxiety, depression and well-being, general anhedonia and social closeness, and fun-seeking, using multilevel models (MLMs). Results showed that both the monetary and social tasks demonstrated learning as shown by decreases in plays on disadvantageous decks across the task. Additionally, we found that overall task performance on the monetary task was associated with fun-seeking and overall task performance on the social task was associated with fun-seeking and depressive symptoms. Initial findings suggest promise for the novel task in the examination of social avoidance learning.",2358477863.0, Journal Article,2020

Here, we review some historical aspects of this relationship and the progress that has been made in translating the neuroscientific study of fear conditioning to the conceptualization and treatment of mental disorders, especially anxiety-related disorders. We also address some conceptual and methodological challenges faced by this research, and offer some suggestions to support future progress in the field.",2348318096.0, Journal Article,2020
21,"Intrusive images of a distressing future: Links between prospective mental imagery, generalized anxiety and a tendency to suppress emotional experience in youth","Distressing intrusive images commonly occur in anxiety. Worry may function to reduce the emotional power of intrusive imagery, but this also prevents emotional processing. As worry is a future-orientated process, suppression of intrusive future imagery could be particularly pertinent to generalized anxiety. Here, we investigate whether youth high in symptoms of generalized anxiety (compared to depression and social anxiety) experience greater impact of future imagery (more intrusions, hyperarousal and avoidance), and whether this relationship varies as a function of the tendency to suppress or reappraise emotional experience. These relationships are important in adolescence, when generalized anxiety commonly begins and emotional regulation strategies develop. Participants (n = 352, age 11–16) completed measures of symptomatology, the impact of prospective personally-relevant imagery (IFES) and emotional regulation strategies. IFES scores correlated with an established measure of prospective imagery. Higher IFES scores were uniquely associated with more symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression, but not with social anxiety. A tendency to supress emotion was related to higher IFES scores and moderated the relationship between generalized anxiety and IFES (but not between depression and IFES). This provides initial impetus to develop novel approaches to investigate and intervene cognitively with negative prospective imagery in adolescent generalized anxiety.",2348317808.0, Journal Article,2020
22,Further characterization of relief dynamics in the conditioning and generalization of avoidance: Effects of distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty,"Avoidance behaviors are central to the anxiety disorders and implicated in many other forms of psychopathology, but the reinforcing mechanism of avoidance remains largely elusive. It has been suggested that subjective relief during successful omission of threat may serve as a reinforcer and contribute to the development of excessive avoidance. Also, relatively little is known about how avoidance behaviors generalize and what the role is of relief in generalization. The purpose of this experiment was three-fold: (1) to investigate the influence of anxiety-traits on the dynamics of relief during avoidance learning, (2) to characterize the dynamics of relief during avoidance generalization, and (3) to investigate the generalization of avoidance behavior over a dimension of avoidability. In a large sample of 101 participants, two lamp colors (CS+) were first associated with an aversive electrical stimulation (US), while a third color was not (CS-). Next, clicking a button during one CS + could effectively avoid the US (CS + av), but not during the other (CS + unav). Finally, avoidance generalization was tested via button clicks during morphed colors between CS + av and CS + unav (avoidability dimension), and to morphed colors between CS + av and CS- (safety dimension). Throughout the experiment, a relief rating scale appeared whenever a lamp color was not followed by the US. Results revealed that anxiety traits (distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty) were associated with higher levels of avoidance and subjective relief. In addition, gradients of avoidance generalization and relief were observed over dimensions of avoidability (CS + av → CS + unav) and safety (CS + av → CS-). Together, these results suggest a role for excessive relief in the development and generalization of maladaptive avoidance.",2348317769.0, Journal Article,2020
23,Devaluation of threat memory using a dual-task intervention does not reduce context renewal of fear,"Many patients who benefit from exposure-based therapy for anxiety disorders fail to maintain their gains. Learned fear may return when they encounter phobic stimuli in a different context than the one in which extinction occurred. In the current pre-registered experiment, we tested whether threat memory devaluation reduces context renewal of fear. A dual-task intervention was used to devalue threat memory. During this intervention, individuals recall the threat memory while simultaneously performing a demanding secondary task (e.g., making eye movements). On day 1, participants (N = 75) underwent fear acquisition with an aversive film clip in context A. On day 2, 25 participants were assigned to each group, namely a dual-task group, or one of two control groups: recall only task (without the dual-task) or no intervention. Afterwards, all participants underwent extinction training in context B and were then exposed to context A again in a test phase. The dual-task intervention effectively degraded threat memory compared to no intervention, but the recall only intervention was also partly effective. However, all three groups showed comparable fear renewal on subjective and physiological measures.

Inflexible negative interpretations encourage depression and social anxiety by dampening positive emotions","Research on emotion regulation difficulties has been instrumental in understanding hallmark features of depression and social anxiety. Yet, the cognitive mechanisms that give rise to maladaptive patterns of emotion regulation strategy use remain underspecified. This investigation examined the association of negative interpretation inflexibility and interpretation biases with the use of common emotion regulation strategies in response to negative and positive emotional experiences (repetitive negative thinking, positive reappraisal, and dampening). Study 1 (N = 250) found that inflexibility in revising negative interpretations in response to disconfirmatory positive information was related to the dampening of positive emotions, but not to repetitive negative thinking or positive reappraisal. Importantly, dampening mediated the relation between inflexible negative interpretations and symptoms of both depression and social anxiety. This mediation model was further supported by the data from Study 2 (N = 294). Across both studies, negative interpretation bias was related to repetitive negative thinking and dampening, whereas positive interpretation bias was related to positive reappraisal. Collectively, these results suggest that both interpretation inflexibility and interpretation biases may contribute to difficulties in emotion regulation related to depression and social anxiety.",2348311510.0, Journal Article,2020
15,A randomized controlled trial on the comparative effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and health qigong-based cognitive therapy among Chinese people with depression and anxiety disorders,"Background: The goal of this study was to investigate treatment outcome and related intervention processes of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus health qigong-based cognitive therapy versus waitlist control among individuals with mood disorders. Methods: A total of 187 individuals with mood disorders were randomized and allocated into mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, health qigong-based cognitive therapy, or waitlist control groups. All participants were assessed at three time points with regard to depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical and mental health status, perceived stress, sleep quality, and self-efficacy. Linear mixed models analysis was used to test the individual growth model by studying the longitudinal data. Results: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and health qigong-based cognitive therapy both produced greater improvements on all outcome measures as compared with waitlist control. Relatively, more reductions of mood symptoms were observed in the health qigong-based cognitive therapy group as compared with the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group. Health qigong-based cognitive therapy is more conducive to physical health status whereas mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has more favorable mental health outcomes. Individual growth curve models indicated that alterations in perceived stress was the common predictor of mood changes in both intervention groups. Conclusions: The predominant emphasis on physical health in health qigong-based cognitive therapy makes it more acceptable and effective than mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as applied in Chinese individuals with mood disorders. The influence of Chinese culture is discussed.

16,"Comparison of frontal alpha asymmetry among schizophrenia patients, major depressive disorder patients, and healthy controls","Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been observed in several psychiatric disorders. Dominance in left or right frontal alpha activity remains inconsistent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), patients with schizophrenia, and healthy controls. This study compared FAA among patients with MDD and schizophrenia, and healthy controls. Methods: We recruited 20 patients with MDD, 18 patients with schizophrenia, and 16 healthy individuals. The EEG alpha frequency ranged from 8 Hz to 12 Hz. FAA was expressed as the difference between absolute power values of right and left hemisphere electrodes in the alpha frequency range (common-log-transformed frontal right- and left-hemisphere electrodes: F4–F3, F8–F7, FP2–FP1, AF4–AF3, F6–F5, and F2–F1). Hamilton depression and anxiety rating scales were evaluated in patients with MDD. Positive and negative syndrome scales were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower left FAA than healthy controls (F4–F3, schizophrenia vs. healthy controls: − 0.10 ± 0.04 vs. -0.05 ± 0.05). There were no significant differences in FAA between patients with schizophrenia and MDD as well as between patients with MDD and healthy controls. Conclusions: The present study suggests that FAA indicates a relatively lower activation of left frontal electrodes in schizophrenia. The left-lateralized FAA could be a neuropathological attribute in patients with schizophrenia, but a lack of sample size and information such as medication and duration of illness might obscure the interpretation and generalization of our findings. Thus, further studies to verify the findings would be warranted.

17,Mental health status of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Background: To investigate the mental health status of Chinese residents during the epidemic of COVID-19, as well as to identify the positive and negative factors and regulatory effect of negative cognitive processing bias on mental health. Methods: A total of 60,199 residents in China were surveyed via an internet-based survey containing a general questionnaire, such as the self-rating depression scale, the state anxiety inventory, and the negative cognitive processing bias questionnaire. An ordered multiple logistic regression analysis model was used to analyze the collected data. Results: The survey revealed mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms in 62.65, 11.33, and 6.14% participants, respectively, and mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms in 33.21, 41.27, and 22.99% participants, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that factors, such as female gender, being older than 55 years, high school education level, medical staff, marital conflicts, negative attention bias, rumination, and death growth rate, positively affected depression and anxiety symptoms. The good family functionality, democratic working atmosphere, and a myriad of social activities negatively affected the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Chinese residents exhibited a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the epidemic. Thus, psychological interventions should focus on the vulnerable groups, and cognitive training should focus on reducing the negative cognitive processing bias. This might be an effective way to alleviate the mental stress of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.

18,"Low levels of soluble TWEAK, indicating on-going inflammation, were associated with depression in type 1 diabetes: A cross-sectional study","Background: Low levels of the soluble tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) and depression are linked to cardiovascular disease. Galectin-3, inadequate glycemic control and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels were previously linked to depression in these patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The main aim was to explore whether sTWEAK was associated with depression. A secondary aim was to explore diabetes related variables associated with low sTWEAK. Methods: Cross-sectional design. T1DM patients ( n = 283, men 56%, age18–59 years) were consecutively recruited from one specialist diabetes clinic. Depression was defined as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression sub scale ≥8 points. Blood samples, anthropometrics and blood pressure were collected, supplemented with data from electronic health records. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure sTWEAK and galectin- 3. Low sTWEAK was defined as &lt; 7.2 ng/ml and high galectin-3 as ≥2.6 ng/ml. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed, calibrated and validated for goodness of fit. We adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, galectin-3, metabolic variables, serum-creatinine, smoking, physical inactivity, medication, and cardiovascular complications. Results: For 29 depressed versus 254 non-depressed patients the prevalence rates were for low sTWEAK: 93 and 68% ( p = 0.003) and for high galectin-3: 34 and 13% ( p = 0.005) respectively. HDL-cholesterol levels were lower for the depressed ( p = 0.015). Patients with low sTWEAK versus high sTWEAK had lower usage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (6% versus 17%, p = 0.005). Low sTWEAK (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 9.0, p = 0.006), high galectin-3 (AOR 6.3, p = 0.001), HDL-cholesterol (per mmol/l) (AOR 0.1, p = 0.006), use of antidepressants (AOR 8.4, p &lt; 0.001), and age (per year) (AOR 1.05, p = 0.027) were associated with depression. CSII (AOR 0.3, p = 0.003) and depression (AOR 7.1, p = 0.009) were associated with low sTWEAK. Conclusions: Lower levels of sTWEAK and HDL-cholesterol and higher levels of galectin-3 were independently associated with depression in T1DM. These factors might all contribute to the increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality previously demonstrated in patients with depression. CSII (inversely) and depression were independently associated with low sTWEAK levels.

19,Determinants of anxiety and depression in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome,"Background: The aim of this cross-sectional study to assess the proportions of anxiety and depression in patients with CuTS, and to explore the associated demographic and clinical features. Methods: From May 2011 to January 2017, 246 patients diagnosed with CuTS were recruited. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess the proportions of depression and anxiety. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression were carried out to identify the variables that were independently associated with anxiety and depression. Results: The proportions of depression and anxiety were 17.9% ( n = 44) and 14.2% ( n = 35), respectively. Five patients had both possible/probable anxiety and depression. Logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus was independently associated with depression; and the modified McGowan grade was independently associated with anxiety. Conclusions: In patients with CuTS, the proportions of depression and anxiety were 17.9% and 14.2%, respectively. Early screening for anxiety and depression is beneficial for patients with CuTS.

20,Investigation of early and lifetime clinical features and comorbidities for the risk of developing treatment-resistant depression in a 13-year nationwide cohort study,"Background: To investigate the risk of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in patients with depression by examining their clinical features, early prescription patterns, and early and lifetime comorbidities. Methods: In total, 31,422 depressive inpatients were followed-up from diagnostic onset for more than 10-years. Patients were diagnosed with TRD if their antidepressant treatment regimen was altered ≥ two times or if they were admitted after at least two different antidepressant treatments. Multiple Cox regression model were used to determine whether physical and psychiatric comorbidities, psychosis, and prescription patterns increased the risk of TRD by controlling for relevant demographic covariates. Survival analyses were performed for important TRD-associated clinical variables. Results: Females with depression (21.24%) were more likely to suffer from TRD than males (14.02%). Early anxiety disorders were more commonly observed in the TRD group than in the non-TRD group (81.48 vs. 58.96%, p &lt; 0.0001). Lifetime anxiety disorders had the highest population attributable fraction (42.87%). Seventy percent of patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities developed TRD during follow-up. Cox regression analysis further identified that functional gastrointestinal disorders significantly increased TRD risk (aHR = 1.19). Higher doses of antidepressants and benzodiazepines and Z drugs in the early course of major depressive disorder increased TRD risk ( p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: Our findings indicate the need to monitor early comorbidities and polypharmacy patterns in patients with depression associated with elevated TRD risk.

21,"The safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation as add-on therapy to fluoxetine in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial","Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that causes impairment in daily activities. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as adjunctive therapy with fluoxetine in individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe OCD. Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial. Individuals with OCD who had baseline Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) of &gt; 15 were enrolled. Eligible cases were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either 20-min-period of stimulation with tDCS and fluoxetine (experimental arm) or fluoxetine only (sham control arm). The anodal electrode of tDCS was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Fp3) and the cathodal electrode was placed over the right orbitofrontal cortex (F8). Two mA electrical stimulation with the tDCS was used for 20 min in individuals of experimental group. In the control group, electrodes were placed and stimulation was administered for 30 s to induce the same skin sensation as in experimental group. This procedure was performed three times per week for 8 weeks. Y-BOCS test was assessed at baseline, week 4 (after 12th stimulation), week 8 (after 24th stimulation), and 1 month after the last stimulation. The primary endpoints were the mean changes in Y-BOCS total score from baseline to the last visit. The secondary endpoints were the mean changes in obsession and compulsion sub-scores from baseline to the last visit. Adverse events were also assessed. Mixed design repeated measures analysis of variance assessed the endpoints. Results: Sixty individuals (30 in each group) were participated. All individuals in control group and 28 cases in experimental arm completed the trial. The mean Y-BOCS (F (1.85) = 30.83; P &lt; 0.001), OCD obsession (F (2.23) = 25.01; P &lt; 0.001), and compulsion (F (2.06) = 10.81; P &lt; 0.001) scores decreased significantly during the study. No statistical differences were, however, detected between experimental and control groups ( P &gt; 0.05). The tDCS was well tolerated and no major adverse events were reported. Conclusion: This study showed that among individuals with moderate to severe OCD, there was no significant difference regarding OC symptoms between cases used tDCS as adjunctive therapy with fluoxetine and individuals used fluoxetine only.

22,Influences on participation in a programme addressing loneliness among people with depression and anxiety: Findings from the Community Navigator Study,"Background: Loneliness is associated with negative outcomes, including increased mortality and is common among people with mental health problems. This qualitative study, which was carried out as part of a feasibility trial, aimed to understand what enables and hinders people with severe depression and/or anxiety under the care of secondary mental health services in the United Kingdom to participate in the Community Navigator programme, and make progress with feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness. The programme consisted of up to ten meetings with a Community Navigator and three optional group sessions. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants ( n = 19) shortly after programme completion. A co-produced two-stage qualitative approach, involving narrative and reflexive thematic analysis, was undertaken by members of the study’s working group, which included experts by experience, clinicians and researchers. Results: The narrative analysis showed that individuals have varied goals, hold mixed feelings about meeting other people and define progress differently. From the thematic analysis, six themes were identified that explained facilitators and challenges to participating in the programme: desire to connect with others; individual social confidence; finding something meaningful to do; the accessibility of resources locally; the timing of the programme; and the participant’s relationship with the Community Navigator. Conclusions: We found that people with severe depression and/or anxiety supported by secondary mental health services may want to address feelings of loneliness but find it emotionally effortful to do so and a major personal challenge. This emotional effort, which manifests in individuals differently, can make it hard for participants to engage with a loneliness programme, though it was through facing personal challenges that a significant sense of achievement was felt. Factors at the individual, interpersonal and structural level, that enable or hinder an individual’s participation should be identified early, so that people are able to make the best use out of the Community Navigator or other similar programmes.

23,Psychometric properties of the moral injury symptom scale among Chinese health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Moral injury among physicians and other health professionals has attracted attention in the mainstream literature, this study aim to assess the psychometric properties of the 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional (MISS-HP) among healthcare professionals in China. Methods: A total of 583 nurses and 2423 physicians were recruited from across mainland China. An online survey was conducted from March 27 to April 26, 2020 (during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the Chinese version of the MISS-HP. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to determine scale structure. Results: Cronbach’s α of the scale for both samples was acceptable (0.71 for nurses and 0.70 for physicians), as was test-retest reliability (ICCs for the individual items ranged from 0.41 to 0.74, with 0.77 for the overall scale in physicians). EFA suggested three factors, and the CFA indicated good fit to the data. Convergent validity was demonstrated with the 4-item Expressions of Moral Injury Scale ( r = 0.45 for physicians, r = 0.43 for nurses). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by correlations with burnout and well-being ( r = 0.34–0.47), and concurrent validity was suggested by correlations with depression and anxiety symptoms ( r = 0.37–0.45). Known groups validity was indicated by a higher score in those exposed to workplace violence (B = 4.16, 95%CI: 3.21–5.10, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The MISS-HP demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity in a large sample of physicians and nurses in mainland China, supporting its use as a screening measure for moral injury symptoms among increasingly stressed health professionals in this country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

24,Should we increase the focus on diet when considering associations between lifestyle habits and deliberate self-harm?,"Background: Despite increasing awareness of high rates of physical illness and poor lifestyle behaviours among patients with a history of repeated deliberate self-harm (DSH), there is little research on specific lifestyle factors that are potentially problematic for this group. This paper aims to explore the relationship between lifetime repeated DSH and certain lifestyle factors, including balanced meals, eating breakfast, consumption of ‘junk’ food, weight, exercise, substance/alcohol use, smoking and social support, in a cohort of patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with suicidal ideation or DSH. Methods: From 2007 to 2016, data from lifestyle and mental health measures were collected from 448 attenders at an outpatient clinic for DSH or suicidal ideation following ED presentation. Lifestyle behaviours (Fantastic Lifestyle Checklist) and mental health (Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale), clinical diagnosis and number of previous DSH episodes were measured on arrival. The associations between lifestyle variables and the number of lifetime DSH episodes were examined. Results: Sex, age, depression symptoms, poor diet, and smoking were all associated with a higher average number of deliberate self-harm episodes across the lifespan. There were non-significant positive trends for the other poor lifestyle behaviours. There was no association between DSH episodes and diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder. In a multiple linear regression model, the only factors that remained significant were age, smoking and eating balanced meals, however, the relationship between smoking and lifetime DSH was moderated by more immediate DSH behaviours. Conclusion: In this sample of patients referred to a service following presentation to the ED with acute mental health concerns, balanced meals and smoking were the lifestyle behaviours that were found to have the strongest independent association with repeated DSH across the lifespan.

25,"Prevalence of symptoms, ever having received a diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety, and associations with health service use amongst the general population in two Russian cities","Background: Little is known about the burden of common mental disorders in Russia despite high levels of suicide and alcohol-related mortality. Here we investigated levels of symptoms, self-reports of ever having received a diagnosis and treatment of anxiety and depression in two Russian cities. Methods: The study population was men and women aged 35–69 years old participating in cross-sectional population-based studies in the cities of Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk (2015–18). Participants completed an interview which included the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales, questions on whether participants had ever received a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and health service use in the past year. Participants also reported current medication use and medications were coded in line with the WHO anatomical therapeutic classification (ATC). Depression was defined as PHQ-9 ≥ 10 and Anxiety as GAD-7 ≥ 10. Results: Age-standardised prevalence of PHQ-9 ≥ 10 was 10.7% in women and 5.4% in men (GAD-7 ≥ 10 6.2% in women; 3.0% in men). Among those with PHQ-9 ≥ 10 17% reported ever having been diagnosed with depression (equivalent finding for anxiety 29%). Only 1.5% of those with PHQ-9 ≥ 10 reported using anti-depressants and 0.6% of those with GAD-7 ≥ 10 reported using anxiolytics. No men with PHQ-9 ≥ 10 and/or GAD-7 ≥ 10 reported use of anti-depressants or anxiolytics. Use of health services increased with increasing severity of both depression and anxiety. Conclusion: There was a large gap between symptoms and reporting of past diagnosis and treatment of common mental disorders in two Russian cities. Interventions aimed at improving mental health literacy and reducing stigma could be of benefit in closing this substantial treatment gap.

26,"A cross-sectional study of gastrointestinal symptoms, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety in young adults","Background: Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have a high psychiatric co-morbidity. This study aimed to investigate and characterise gastrointestinal symptoms in relation to depressive symptoms and trait anxiety in a well-defined population of young adult psychiatric outpatients and healthy controls. Methods: Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale- Self assessment (MADRS-S). Trait anxiety was estimated with three of the Swedish universities of Personality (SSP) scales: Somatic trait anxiety, Psychic trait anxiety and Stress susceptibility. Self-ratings were collected from 491 young adult psychiatric outpatients and 85 healthy controls. Gastrointestinal symptom severity was compared between patients with and without current psychotropic medication and controls. Associations between gastrointestinal symptoms, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety were assessed using Spearman’s coefficients and generalized linear models adjusting for possible confounders (sex, body mass index, bulimia nervosa). Results: Patients, with and without current psychotropic medication, reported significantly more gastrointestinal symptoms than controls. In the generalized linear models, total MADRS-S score ( p &lt; 0.001), Somatic trait anxiety ( p &lt; 0.001), Psychic trait anxiety ( p = 0.002) and Stress susceptibility ( p = 0.002) were independent predictors of the total GSRS-IBS score. Further exploratory analysis using unsupervised learning revealed a diverse spectrum of symptoms that clustered into six groups. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal symptoms are both highly prevalent and diverse in young adult psychiatric outpatients, regardless of current psychotropic medication. Depressive symptom severity and degree of trait anxiety are independently related to the total gastrointestinal symptom burden.

27,Prospective prediction of PTSD diagnosis in a nationally representative sample using machine learning,"Background: Recent research has identified a number of pre-traumatic, peri-traumatic and post-traumatic psychological and ecological factors that put an individual at increased risk for developing PTSD following a life-threatening event. While these factors have been found to be associated with PTSD in univariate analyses, the complex interactions of these risk factors and how they contribute to individual trajectories of the illness are not yet well understood. In this study, we examine the impact of prior trauma, psychopathology, sociodemographic characteristics, community and environmental information, on PTSD onset in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, using machine learning methods to establish the relative contributions of each variable. Methods: Individual risk factors identified in Waves 1 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were combined with community-level data for the years concurrent to the NESARC Wave 1 ( n = 43,093) and 2 ( n = 34,653) surveys. Machine learning feature selection and classification analyses were used at the national level to create models using individual- and community-level variables that would best predict the new onset of PTSD at Wave 2. Results: Our classification algorithms yielded 89.7 to 95.6% accuracy for predicting new onset of PTSD at Wave 2. A prior diagnosis of DSM-IV-TR Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder conferred the greatest relative influence in new diagnosis of PTSD. Distal risk factors such as prior psychiatric diagnosis accounted for significantly greater relative risk than proximal factors (such as adverse event exposure). Conclusions: Our findings show that a machine learning classification approach can successfully integrate large numbers of known risk factors for PTSD into stronger models that account for high-dimensional interactions and collinearity between variables. We discuss the implications of these findings as pertaining to the targeted mobilization emergency mental health resources. These findings also inform the creation of a more comprehensive risk assessment profile to the likelihood of developing PTSD following an extremely adverse event.

28,Standardized multimodal intervention for stress-induced exhaustion disorder: An open trial in a clinical setting,"Background: Long-term sick-leave due to stress-related ill-health is increasing in several economically developed countries. Even though different forms of interventions are administered in regular care for stress-related disorders, such as Stress-induced Exhaustion disorder (SED), the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of such treatments is sparse. The objective of this study was to explore changes in SED-symptoms and return-to-work-rates in a large group of SED-patients participating in a standardized Multimodal intervention (MMI) in a clinical setting. Method: This open clinical trial tracked 390 patients who fulfilled the criteria for SED undergoing a 24-week MMI, including return-to-work-strategies. Before inclusion, all patients underwent a multi-professional assessment by a team of licensed physicians, licensed psychologists, and licensed physiotherapists. Self-rated questionnaires were administered before treatment, at treatment-start, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 12-month follow-up. Within-group change was evaluated over time with mixed-effects models. Beyond different symptoms, working time, sick-leave compensation, and adverse effects were also measured. Results: There were significant improvements in symptoms of SED, burnout, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, with large within-group effect sizes ( d = 0.91–1.76), improvements that were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in quality of life and large improvements in average working time and sick-leave compensation. Some adverse effects were reported, mainly concerning an increase in stress, anxiety, and worry. Conclusion: SED-patients participating in this standardized MMI reported large symptom alleviation, increased working time and reduced sick-leave compensation, indicating a beneficial treatment. There were some adverse effects, but no more so than other psychological treatments. This study confirms previous findings that high levels of depression and anxiety decrease to sub-clinical levels during treatment, while symptoms of SED also decline, yet still persists above sub-clinical levels at 12-month follow-up. On the whole, this open clinical trial suggests that a standardized MMI, administered in a clinical setting, improves symptoms and return-to-work rates in a clinically representative SED-population.

29,Borderline personality disorder and prior suicide attempts define a severity gradient among hospitalized adolescent suicide attempters,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and history of prior suicide attempt (SA) have been shown to be high predictors for subsequent suicide. However, no previous study has examined how both factors interact to modify clinical and suicide severity among adolescents. Methods: This study presents a comprehensive assessment of 302 adolescents (265 girls, mean age = 14.7 years) hospitalized after a SA. To test clinical interactions between BPD and history of prior SA, the sample was divided into single attempters without BPD (non-BPD-SA, N = 80), single attempters with BPD (BPD-SA, N = 127) and multiple attempters with BPD (BPD-MA, N = 95). Results: Univariate analyses revealed a severity gradient among the 3 groups with an additive effect of BPD on the clinical and suicide severity already conferred by a history of SA. This gradient encompassed categorical (anxiety and conduct disorders and non-suicidal-self-injury [NSSI]) and dimensional comorbidities (substance use and depression severity) and suicide characteristics (age at first SA). According to regression analyses, the BPD-MA group that was associated with the most severe clinical presentation also showed specific features: the first SA at a younger age and a higher prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and anxiety disorders. The BPD-MA group was not associated with higher impulsivity or frequency of negative life events. Conclusions: Based on these findings and to improve youth suicide prevention, future studies should systematically consider BPD and the efficacy of reinforcing early interventions for anxiety disorders and NSSI.

30,Urinary incontinence associated with anxiety and depression: The impact of psychotropic drugs in a cross-sectional study from the Norwegian HUNT study,"Background: Anxiety and depression are in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies associated with urinary incontinence (UI) in women, strongest for the urgency component of UI. The role of psychotropic drugs in this association, especially antidepressants, has been questioned, but not clarified. The present study aimed to explore the associations between UI and anxiety/depression and the possible impact of psychotropic drugs on these associations. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study with questionnaire data from 21,803 women ≥ 20 years in the Norwegian Nord-Trøndelag Health Study merged with the Norwegian Prescription Database, which contains information on all dispensed prescriptions. We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the association between UI (any UI, and by type and severity) and anxiety/depression (by different score on Hospital anxiety and depression scale), and the influence of psychotropic drugs on this association (by different volume of drug use). Results: Compared with normal anxiety- and depression score, having moderate/severe anxiety or depression (HADS ≥ 11) increased the prevalence of UI from 27.6 to 37.8% (OR 1.59 (1.40–1.81), p &lt; 0.001) for anxiety and from 28.0 to 43.7% (OR 1.79 (1.46–2.21), p &lt; 0.001) for depression. According to type of UI, mixed UI was most strongly associated with a high HADS-score with an odds ratio 1.84 (1.65–2.05) for anxiety and 1.85 (1.61–2.13) for depression. Compared to no UI, severe UI was associated with depression with odds ratios of 2.04 (1.74–2.40), compared with no UI. Psychotropic drug use did not influence the associations between UI and anxiety/depression. We found high prevalence of UI among users of various psychotropic drugs. After adjustments, only antidepressants were associated with UI, with OR 1.36 (1.08–1.71) for high defined daily dose of the drug. Anxiolytics were associated with less UI with OR 0.64 (0.45–0.91) after adjustments for anxiety. Conclusion: This study showed that anxiety, depression and use of antidepressants are associated factors with UI, strongest for urgency and mixed type of UI, with increasing ORs by increasing severity of the conditions and increased daily dose of the medication. Use of antidepressants did not influence the associations between UI and anxiety/depression.

31,"Exploring mediators of the recovery process over time among mental health service users, using a mixed model regression analysis based on cluster RCT data","Background: Personal recovery is associated with many significant health-related factors, but studies exploring associations between activity factors and personal recovery among service users are scarce. The aims of this study were hence to; 1) investigate if various aspects of activity may mediate change in recovery while also acknowledging clinical, sociodemographic and well-being factors; 2) explore the effects of two activity-based interventions, Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) or standard occupational therapy (SOT), on personal recovery among service users. Methods: Two-hundred-and-twenty-six service users were included in a cluster RCT, 133 from BEL units and 93 from SOT units. Participants commonly had a diagnosis of mood disorder and the mean age was 40. Instruments used targeted activity, mastery and functioning. A mixed-model regression analysis was employed. Results: The model tested was whether selected variables could be used to mediate the change in recovery from the start to a six-month follow-up after intervention. Participants’ personal recovery increased after treatment and increased further at the follow-up. The general level of recovery was negatively related to a diagnosis of depression/anxiety, both before and after treatment, but depressed/anxious service users still increased their recovery. There were no significant relations between recovery and sex or age. The interactions between change in recovery and changes in depression/anxiety, satisfaction with activities, sex, and age were all non-significant. All possible treatment mediators included were related to change in recovery, the strongest being occupational engagement and mastery, followed by activity satisfaction and symptoms. Mediation was shown by the decrease in the effect of the time factor (from intervention start to completion) when the covariates were introduced. In all cases the time variable was still significant. When testing a model with all variables simultaneously as covariates, occupational engagement and mastery were strongly significant. There was no difference between interventions regarding recovery improvement. Conclusion: The treatments were equally beneficial and were effective regardless of gender, age and diagnosis. Those who gained most from the treatment also gained in feelings of mastery and activity engagement. Activity engagement also moderated the level of recovery. To enhance recovery, interventions should facilitate meaningful activities and gaining control in life.

32,The immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder,"Background: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a distressing psychiatric disorder. Traumas may trigger or aggravate OCD symptoms. COVID-19 pandemic has coursed a global crisis and has been associated with onset of psychiatric disorders in adults. Little is known about children/adolescents with OCD. The present study aimed to examine how children/adolescents with OCD react towards COVID-19 crisis. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to two separate groups of children/adolescents. One group was a clinical group newly diagnosed at a specialized OCD clinic. All the children/adolescents had a current close contact to a therapist or doctor. The other group was a survey group identified through the Danish OCD Association. Most of these children/adolescents were diagnosed years ago, and their primary treatment was completed. For the clinical group, data from patient files was available. Results: In both groups, but most pronounced in the survey group, participants experienced a worsening of their OCD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The aggravation of OCD correlated with the worsening of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the extent of avoidance behavior. For both groups, OCD aggressive symptoms predicted a significant worsening. Poor baseline insight showed a trend to predict a symptom worsening. The worsening was most pronounced in children with early age of onset and a family history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies examining the effect of COVID-19 in children/ adolescents with OCD. The effect was examined in two separate populations strengthening the findings. The study points towards an influence of the OCD phenotype, baseline insight suggesting a continued vulnerability, and a family history of psychiatric disorders. Trial registration: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1–16–02-147-20) registered 1st of April 2020. Oral and written information was given to parents and patients and written consent from patients over 15 years and parents were received.

33,"""Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia"": Correction","Reports an error in ""Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia"" by Youdiil Ophinni, Adrian, Kristiana Siste, Martina Wiwie, Gina Anindyajati, Enjeline Hanafi, Reza Damayanti and Yoshitake Hayashi ( BMC Psychiatry , 2020[May][24], Vol 20[255]). An error was identified in the Results section of the Abstract. The updated result is provided, with the changes highlighted in bold typeface. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-36855-001). Background: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18–65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth’s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/μl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation ( M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/μl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5–123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02–24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.

34,Anxiety disorders and PTSD in Palestine: A literature review,"Background: The WHO reports that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders worldwide. Most people who experience such events recover from it; however, people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for several months or even years following the event. Palestinians are particularly at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to the continuous exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and other limitation on professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine. Methods: PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials for the critical analysis of empirical articles. The following aspects were taken into consideration: study type, sample, and key findings. Results: In this review, we included about twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza). Five studies relate to children, five relate to adolescents, three relate to women, three relate to physical diseases, and four relate to gender and age differences. Results show that anxiety disorders and PTSD are one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are mostly associated with low quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious issues that deal with several challenges, distinct barriers including; inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation. Conclusion: As primary prevention, the occupation has to have considered as the main source of anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine. Besides, there is a need to implement a mental health care system through multidisciplinary work and raising awareness regarding the prevalence of mental disorders.

35,Understanding the nature of association between anxiety phenotypes and anorexia nervosa: A triangulation approach,"Background: Evidence from observational studies suggests an association between anxiety disorders and anorexia nervosa (AN), but causal inference is complicated by the potential for confounding in these studies. We triangulate evidence across a longitudinal study and a Mendelian randomization (MR) study, to evaluate whether there is support for anxiety disorder phenotypes exerting a causal effect on AN risk. Methods: Study One assessed longitudinal associations of childhood worry and anxiety disorders with lifetime AN in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Study Two used two-sample MR to evaluate: causal effects of worry, and genetic liability to anxiety disorders, on AN risk; causal effects of genetic liability to AN on anxiety outcomes; and the causal influence of worry on anxiety disorder development. The independence of effects of worry, relative to depressed affect, on AN and anxiety disorder outcomes, was explored using multivariable MR. Analyses were completed using summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies. Results: Study One did not support an association between worry and subsequent AN, but there was strong evidence for anxiety disorders predicting increased risk of AN. Study Two outcomes supported worry causally increasing AN risk, but did not support a causal effect of anxiety disorders on AN development, or of AN on anxiety disorders/worry. Findings also indicated that worry causally influences anxiety disorder development. Multivariable analysis estimates suggested the influence of worry on both AN and anxiety disorders was independent of depressed affect. Conclusions: Overall our results provide mixed evidence regarding the causal role of anxiety exposures in AN aetiology. The inconsistency between outcomes of Studies One and Two may be explained by limitations surrounding worry assessment in Study One, confounding of the anxiety disorder and AN association in observational research, and low power in MR analyses probing causal effects of genetic liability to anxiety disorders. The evidence for worry acting as a causal risk factor for anxiety disorders and AN supports targeting worry for prevention of both outcomes. Further research should clarify how a tendency to worry translates into AN risk, and whether anxiety disorder pathology exerts any causal effect on AN.

36,Exploring nurses’ experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19: A qualitative study,"Background: COVID-19 infection is a new disease that infects a large number of people, killing a ratio of whom every day in the world. Healthcare staff, especially nurses, experience a great deal of psychological distress during care of COVID-19 patients. Detecting factors that disturb nurses’ mental health during care of these patients can help to reduce their psychological distress. Therefore, this study aimed to explore nurses’ experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. Methods: The present qualitative research was performed using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from March to May 2020. Participants in this study included the nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, and they were selected based on the purposeful sampling method. The data was collected through 20 phone call interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results: Qualitative data analysis revealed 11 categories including death anxiety, anxiety due to the nature of the disease, anxiety caused by corpse burial, fear of infecting the family, distress about time wasting, emotional distress of delivering bad news, fear of being contaminated, the emergence of obsessive thoughts, the bad feeling of wearing personal protective equipment, conflict between fear and conscience, and the public ignorance of preventive measures. Conclusion: The data showed that the nurses experienced a variety of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. Through proper planning by authorities, it is possible to manage the risk factors of mental health distress in nurses and improve their mental health status.

37,Psychological distress in Nepalese residents during COVID-19 pandemic: A community level survey,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented health and economic impact. Psychological stress, anxiety and depression are affecting not only COVID-19 patients but also health professionals, and general population. Fear of contracting COVID-19, forced restrictive social measures, and economic hardship are causing mental trauma. Nepal is a developing country from South Asia where the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving. This online survey has been carried out to understand impact of COVID- 19 on mental health of Nepalese community dwellers. Methods: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) questionnaire adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre was used for online data collection from 11 April-17 May 2020. Collected data were extracted to Microsoft excel-13 and imported and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version-22. An initial univariate analysis was conducted for all variables to assess the distribution. Logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the odds ratios of relevant predicting variables. Results: A total of 410 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Mean age of study participants was 34.8 ± 11.7 years with male preponderance. 88.5% of the respondents were not in distress (score less than 28) while, 11% had mild to moderate distress and 0.5% had severe distress. The prevalence of distress is higher among age group &gt; 45 years, female gender, and post-secondary education group. Health professional were more likely to get distressed. Respondents with post-secondary education had higher odds (OR = 3.32; p = 0.020) of developing distress as compared to respondents with secondary education or lower. Conclusion: There is lower rate of psychological distress in city dwellers and people with low education. Adequate intervention and evaluation into mental health awareness, and psychosocial support focused primarily on health care workers, female and elderly individuals is necessary.

38,"Are comparisons of mental disorders between Chinese and German students possible? An examination of measurement invariance for the PHQ-15, PHQ-9 and GAD-7","Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is one of the most commonly used instruments to assess mental disorders. However, research on its cross-cultural measurement invariance is not yet sufficient. This study examined the measurement invariance of the Chinese and German versions of the PHQ’s somatic symptom severity scale (PHQ-15), depressive symptom severity scale (PHQ-9) and seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale as a prerequisite for their use in cross-cultural comparisons. Methods: We used online data collected from groups of Chinese students in China ( n = 413) and German students in Germany ( n = 416). Separate measurement models for each group were examined using confirmatory factor analysis and measurement invariance testing was conducted to test the cross-cultural equivalence. Results: Findings demonstrated that the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 had partial scalar measurement invariance, but the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the PHQ-15 could not be confirmed. Comparisons of latent means did not indicate differences in the levels of depression and anxiety symptoms between Chinese and German samples. Conclusion: The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 can be used in cross-cultural comparison of prevalence, but the intercultural use of PHQ-15 is more problematic. Findings are discussed from intercultural and methodological perspectives.

39,Associated factors of REM sleep without atonia in younger (≤ 50 years) hospitalized psychiatric patients,"Background: Isolated REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) as a main polysomnograhic feature of REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is thought to be a prodromal or subclinical state of the disease. RSWA/RBD occurence in psychiatric population is much more frequent than in general population but its associated factors are still not known. Methods: We invited 88 psychiatry in-patients to undervent video-polysomnography. The visual scoring was focused on RSWA in submentales and flexores digitales superficiales muscles. This parametr was subsequently correlated mainly with age/gender, their medication and mental status. Results: The RWSA was mostly still in normal range despite the fact, that selected psychiatry patients (≤ 50 years) were taking several classes of psychoactive medication. 3,6% had convincingly RBD, although 35.7% reported rare lifetime occurence of dream-enacting behaviour and 62.8% sporadic nightmares. We found correlation between RSWA and SNRI medication class ( p = 0.015), specifically venlafaxine ( p = 0.029) as well as quetiapine ( p = 0.030). Another significant associated factors were current anxiety ( p &lt; 0.001) and depressive symptoms ( p = 0.05), but we found no relation between RSWA and given diagnosis. Conlucions: Isolated RSWA in younger psychiatry patients might be a result of multiple factors, including medication and current mental status but these factors are in most cases not sufficient to manifest RBD.

40,High place phenomenon: Prevalence and clinical correlates in two German samples,"Background: The high place phenomenon, that is, a sudden urge to jump when in a high place, is an experience known to many people, that has rarely been studied. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of the high place phenomenon in a non-clinical and a clinical German sample. Furthermore, clinical correlates of the experience were assessed. Methods: The study sample comprised 276 participants (67% female; M age = 32.08, SD age = 10.73) who took part in an online assessment and 94 patients (73.4% female; M age = 49.26, SD age = 13.32) suffering from clinically relevant fear of flying. Participants filled out questionnaires on experiences with the high place phenomenon, depression, anxiety, suicide ideation and anxiety sensitivity. Results: The high place phenomenon was known to nearly 60% of the online sample and to 45% of the patient sample. Suicide ideation as well as anxiety sensitivity were positively associated with experiences with the high place phenomenon in the online sample. Depression, anxiety and suicide ideation were unrelated to experiences with the phenomenon in the patient sample. Conclusion: The high place phenomenon is commonly reported by (lifetime/current) suicide ideators. However, it is also a common experience in individuals who have never suffered from suicide ideation. It is therefore cautioned not to interpret such experiences as an expression of a hidden death wish.

41,The Chinese version of obsessive compulsive drug use scale: Validation in outpatient methadone maintenance treatment program,"Background: The Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS) measures the overall craving level within a period from a multidimensional perspective. However, no studies have addressed the validity of the new OCDUS factor structure, presented in 2016, in China. Additionally, there is lack of evidence on the interaction among risk factors for relapse. We aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the scores of the Chinese version of the OCDUS in patients with heroin dependence receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Further, we aimed to assess the correlations of the OCDUS scores with withdrawal symptoms, depression, anxiety, and nicotine dependence. Methods: We enrolled 113 adults (age 32–64 years) and administered them with the OCDUS, Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Results: Exploratory factor analysis identified a 3-dimensional component that included “Frequency of craving,” “Inference of heroin,” and “Control of heroin.” These factors showed acceptable internal consistency, adequate itemtotal correlations, and significant item-subscale correlations. There was no correlation between the OCUDS scores and age, education, duration of receiving MMT, and MMT dosages. However, there was a significant correlation between the OCDUS total scores and the SOWS, STAI, BDI-II, and FTND scores. The scores of all the subscales were associated with the SOWS scores; further, the scores of the first two subscales were associated with BDI-II scores while only the scores of the first subscale were associated with the FTND scores. Conclusions: Our findings support the reliability and structure validity of the OCDUS scores. Heroin craving, withdrawal symptoms, negative emotions, and nicotine dependence, which are considered as risk factors for heroin relapse, might interact with each other. There is a need for further studies on the underlying mechanism of these clinical phenomena.

42,Mastery and self-esteem mediate the association between visual acuity and mental health: A population-based longitudinal cohort study,"Background: With deteriorating eyesight, people often become dependent on others for many aspects of their daily lives. As a result, they feel less ‘in control’ and experience lower self-esteem. Lower sense of mastery and self-esteem are known to predict depression, but their roles in people with visual impairment have only marginally been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of mastery and self-esteem on the relationship between visual acuity and mental health. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was performed using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), collected between 2001 and 2012. A community-based population of 2599 older adults were included, who were randomly selected from population registers. Outcomes of interest were the Pearl in Mastery Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression scale and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale—Anxiety subscale. Linear mixed models were used to establish the association between visual acuity and mental health over time. Results: Mean age was 72 years, 56% was female and 1.2% qualified as having low vision. Visual impairment was associated with a lower sense of mastery (β = − 0.477, p &lt; 0.001), lower self-esteem (β = −0.166, p = 0.008) and more depression (β = 0.235, p &lt; 0.001). No significant association between visual acuity and anxiety was found. The relationship between visual acuity and depression was mediated by self-esteem (25%) and sense of mastery (79%). Conclusions: Vision loss was associated with depression. This association was mediated by self-esteem and sense of mastery. This provides us with new possibilities to identify, support and treat those at risk for developing depression by aiming to increase their self-esteem and sense of mastery.

43,Decoding and reasoning mental states in major depression and social anxiety disorder,"Background: Major depression (MDD) and social anxiety (SAD) disorders are debilitating psychiatric conditions characterized by disturbed interpersonal relationships. Despite these impairments in social relationships, research has been limited in simultaneously evaluating the dysfunction in MDD or SAD within two aspects of theory of mind (ToM): decoding mental states (i.e., Affective ToM) and reasoning mental states (i.e., cognitive ToM). Taking this into consideration, the current study assesses both decoding and reasoning mental states abilities in MDD, SAD, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Subjects included 37 patients with MDD, 35 patients with SAD, and 35 HCs. ToM was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and the Faux Pas Task, which assess decoding and reasoning mental states, respectively. Results: Results revealed that in decoding of mental states, both the SAD and MDD groups had lower scores than the HC group; there was no significant difference between the SAD and MDD groups in decoding mental states. Conversely, in reasoning mental states, the SAD and HC groups had higher scores than the MDD group; no differences were found between the SAD and HC groups. Conclusions: Clinicians and researchers should further consider parsing generalized impairment in ToM into two aspects: decoding and reasoning of mental states by using the aforementioned measurements. By further understanding the two aspects, we can create a potentially new clinical profile for mental health disorders, such as in this context with both decoding and reasoning mental state impairment in MDD and just a decoding impairment in SAD.

44,"COVID-19 pandemic-knowledge, perception, anxiety and depression among frontline doctors of Pakistan","Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has become a major public health burden worldwide. With already fragile healthcare systems it can have long lasting effects in developing countries. Outbreaks especially a pandemic situation evokes fear related behaviors among healthcare professionals and there is always an increased risk of mental health disorders. Therefore, this study aims to determine knowledge and perception about this pandemic, prevalence and factors associated with anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan. Methods: Data were collected through an online survey released in the last week of March-2020. 389 frontline physicians from all four provinces and 65 cities of Pakistan participated. Survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts including informed consent section, demographic section, knowledge and perception about COVID-19 pandemic and assessment of depression through World Health Organization Self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). A score of 8 or above on SRQ-20 was used as cut-off to label the participant as depressed. Data was analyzed using SPSS version22. Results: A 43% prevalence of anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan was reported. Almost all the doctors had moderate to high knowledge score. Majority of participants marked N-95 mask as “essential” during aerosol generating procedures, assessing patients with respiratory symptoms, in COVID patient-care area, ER triage and direct care of COVID-19 patient. Only 12% of the doctors were fully satisfied with the provision of PPEs and almost 94% felt unprotected.In multivariable model, assessing more than five COVID suspects/day (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.65–4.52), working 20 h/week or less (aOR = 2.11, 1.27–3.49), having children among household members (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.00–2.50) and moderate to low knowledge of the infection (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.68–4.31) were found to be independent predictors of anxiety/depression among physicians. Conclusion: Anxiety/depression among more than a third of frontline doctors of Pakistan warrants the need to address mental health of doctors caring for patients during this pandemic; control modifiable factors associated with it and explore the effectiveness of interventions to promote psychological well-being of physicians.

45,Promotion of mental health in young adults via mobile phone app: Study protocol of the ECoWeB (emotional competence for well-being in young adults) cohort multiple randomised trials,"Background: Promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young people is a major global priority. Building emotional competence (EC) skills via a mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. However, few large-scale controlled trials have examined the efficacy of mobile apps in promoting mental health in young people; none have tailored the app to individual profiles. Method/design: The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) involves a longitudinal prospective cohort to examine well-being, mental health and EC in 16–22 year olds across 12 months. Within the cohort, eligible participants are entered to either the PREVENT trial (if selected EC scores at baseline within worst-performing quartile) or to the PROMOTE trial (if selected EC scores not within worst-performing quartile). In both trials, participants are randomised (i) to continue with usual practice, repeated assessments and a self-monitoring app; (ii) to additionally receive generic cognitive-behavioural therapy self-help in app; (iii) to additionally receive personalised EC self-help in app. In total, 2142 participants aged 16 to 22 years, with no current or past history of major depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited across UK, Germany, Spain, and Belgium. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 1, 3 and 12 months post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome for PREVENT is level of depression symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 3 months; primary endpoint and outcome for PROMOTE is emotional well-being assessed on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale at 3 months. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and cost-effectiveness are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored. Conclusions: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the causal role of learning EC skills using interventions delivered via mobile phone apps with respect to promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young people. This knowledge will be used to develop and disseminate innovative evidence-based, feasible, and effective Mobile-health public health strategies for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being.

46,Improving treatment decision-making in bipolar II disorder: A phase II randomised controlled trial of an online patient decision-aid,"Background: Many patients with bipolar II disorder (BPII) prefer to be more informed and involved in their treatment decision-making than they currently are. Limited knowledge and involvement in one’s treatment is also likely to compromise optimal BPII management. This Phase II RCT aimed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of a world-first patient decision-aid website (e-DA) to improve treatment decision-making regarding options for relapse prevention in BPII. The e-DA’s potential efficacy in terms of improving quality of the decision-making process and quality of the decision made was also explored. Methods: The e-DA was based on International Patient Decision-Aid Standards and developed via an iterative co-design process. Adults with BPII diagnosis ( n = 352) were recruited through a specialist outpatient clinical service and the social media of leading mental health organisations. Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive standard information with/without the e-DA (Intervention versus Control). At baseline (T0), post-treatment decision (T1) and at 3 months’ post-decision follow-up (T2), participants completed a series of validated and purpose-designed questionnaires. Self-report and analytics data assessed the acceptability (e.g., perceived ease-of-use, usefulness; completed by Intervention participants only), safety (i.e., self-reported bipolar and/or anxiety symptoms), and feasibility of using the e-DA (% accessed). For all participants, questionnaires assessed constructs related to quality of the decision-making process (e.g., decisional conflict) and quality of the decision made (e.g., knowledge of treatment options and outcomes). Results: Intervention participants endorsed the e-DA as acceptable and feasible to use (82.1–94.6% item agreement); most self-reported using the e-DA either selectively (51.8%; relevant sections only) or thoroughly (34%). Exploratory analyses indicated the e-DA’s potential efficacy to improve decision-making quality; most between-group standardised mean differences (SMD) were small-to-moderate. The largest potential effects were detected for objective treatment knowledge (−0.69, 95% CIs −1.04, −0.33 at T1; and −0.57, 95% CIs −0.99,-0.14 at T2), decisional regret at T2 (0.42, 95% CIs 0.01, 0.84), preparation for decision-making at T1 (−0.44, 95% CIs −0.81, −0.07), and the Decisional Conflict Scale Uncertainty subscale (0.42, 95% CIs 0.08, 0.08) and Total (0.36, 95% CIs 0.30, 0.69) scores, with all SMDs favouring the Intervention over the Control conditions. Regarding safety, e-DA use was not associated with worse bipolar symptoms or anxiety. Conclusion: The e-DA appears to be acceptable, feasible, safe and potentially efficacious at improving patients’ decision-making about BPII treatment. Findings also support the future adoption of the e-DA into patient care for BPII to foster treatment decisions based on the best available evidence and patient preferences.

47,"Relationship between sleep duration and sociodemographic characteristics, mental health and chronic diseases in individuals aged from 18 to 85 years old in Guangdong province in China: A population-based cross-sectional study","Background: Sleep is vital for maintaining individual’s physical and mental health. Prior studies have reported close relationships between sleep duration and chronic diseases. However, in China, the prevalence of aberrant sleep duration and the associations between sleep duration and chronic conditions still merit studying in Guangdong province. This study aimed at examining the relationship between sleep duration and multiple dimensions of sociodemographic characteristics, mental health and chronic diseases in Guangdong province in China, with a large population-based data of individuals aged from 18 to 85 years old. Methods: This study aimed at analyzing the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the population in Guangdong province. Multistage stratified cluster sampling was applied for this study. 13,768 participants from Guangdong province were interviewed with standardized assessment tools, including Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Basic socio-demographic information, mental health and chronic diseases information were collected. Self-reported sleep duration was classified as three types: short (&lt; 7 h), normative (7-9 h) and long (≥ 9 h). Results: The mean sleep duration was 6.75 ± 1.11 h. Short sleepers had a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, including anemia (6.2%, p = 0.024), gout (2.8%, p = 0.010), hyperlipidemia (3.9%, p = 0.003) and low back pain (5.6%, p = 0.020) than other types of sleeper. Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that short sleepers were more likely to have low income level, have depressive symptoms, be ex- or current drinkers and be overweight. Anemia, hyperlipidemia and low back pain were all risk factors for short sleep, while malignant tumor was risky for long sleep. Conclusions: Low income level, drinking status, being overweight, and chronic conditions may be associated with aberrant sleep duration in Guangdong province general population. Short sleepers have a higher risk of suffering from anemia, hyperlipidemia, and low back pain, while long sleepers are more likely to have malignant tumor. Health professionals should value the sleep patterns in general health care and attach importance to conduct further epidemiologic surveys to explore the relationship between sleep duration and health.

48,"The relations among worry, meta-worry, intolerance of uncertainty and attentional bias for threat in men at high risk for generalized anxiety disorder: A network analysis","Background: Improving the psychotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is dependent on a deeper understanding of the relations between GAD and its associated cognitive factors. In the present study, we investigate how the core feature of GAD (i.e., worry) and its associated cognitive factors, such as meta-worry, intolerance of uncertainty, and attention bias towards threat, relate to each other in men at high risk for GAD. Methods: We used network analysis to explore the relations among these variables in a cross-sectional sample of 122 men at high risk for generalized anxiety disorder. Specifically, we computed the expected influence and predictability of each variable. Results: In the final network, we found that worry and meta-worry had the highest expected influence and predictability. In contrast, attention bias towards threat showed the lowest expected influence and predictability. The estimates of the expected influence of the nodes were stable (correlation stability coefficient = 0.52). Conclusions: The present study is the first to investigate the relations among worry, meta-worry, intolerance of uncertainty, and attention bias towards threat in men at high risk for generalized anxiety disorder. These findings indicate that worry and meta-worry may play important roles in the present network. The implications for clinical interventions and future studies are discussed.

49,"A longitudinal cohort study to explore the relationship between depression, anxiety and academic performance among Emirati university students","Background: Many university students experience depression and anxiety, both of which have been shown to affect cognitive function. However, the impact of these emotional difficulties on academic performance is unclear. This study aims to determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in United Arab Emirates (UAE). It further seeks to explore the relationship between emotional difficulties and students’ academic performance. Methods: This longitudinal study recruited 404 students (aged 17–25 years) attending one UAE university (80.4% response rate). At baseline, participants completed a paper-based survey to assess socio-economic factors and academic performance, including most recent grade point average (GPA) and attendance warnings. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. At six-month follow-up, 134 participants (33.3%) provided details of their current GPA. Results: Over a third of students (34.2%; CIs 29.7–38.9%) screened for possible major depressive disorder (MDD; PHQ-9 ≥ 10) but less than a quarter (22.3%; CIs 18.2–26.3%) screened for possible generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 ≥ 10). The Possible MDD group had lower GPAs ( p = 0.003) at baseline and were less satisfied with their studies ( p = 0.015). The MDD group also had lower GPAs at follow-up ( p = 0.035). The Possible GAD group had lower GPAs at baseline ( p = 0.003) but did not differ at follow-up. The relationship between GAD group and GPA was moderated by gender with female students in the Possible GAD group having lower GPAs ( p &lt; 0.001) than females in the Non-GAD group. Male students in the Possible GAD group had non-significantly higher GPA scores. Higher levels of both depression and anxiety symptoms scores were associated with lower GPAs at baseline. PHQ-9 scores, but not GAD-7 scores, independently predicted lower GPA scores at follow-up ( p = 0.006). This relationship was no longer statistically significant after controlling for baseline GPA ( p &lt; 0.09). Conclusion: This study confirms previous findings that around a third of university students are likely to be experiencing a depressive disorder at any one time. Furthermore, it provides important evidence regarding the negative impacts of emotional difficulties on students’ academic performance. The results support the need to consider the mental health of students who are struggling academically and highlight the importance of signposting those students to appropriate support, including evidence-based therapies.

50,"The mental health of neurological doctors and nurses in Hunan Province, China during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak","Background: Neurological symptoms are increasingly being noted among COVID-19 patients. Currently, there is little data on the mental health of neurological healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and influencing factors on anxiety and depression in neurological healthcare workers in Hunan Province, China during the early stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among neurological doctors and nurses in early February 2020 in Hunan Province. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Chinese version of the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (defined as a total score ≥ 50) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (defined as a total score ≥ 53). The prevalences of probable anxiety and depression were compared between different groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to understand the independent influencing factors on anxiety and depression. Results: The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression in neurological nurses (20.3 and 30.2%, respectively) was higher than that in doctors (12.6 and 20.2%, respectively). Female healthcare workers (18.4%) had a higher proportion of anxiety than males (10.8%). Probable anxiety and depression were more prevalent among nurses, younger workers (≤ 40 years), and medical staff with junior titles. Logistic regression analysis showed that a shortage of protective equipment was independently associated with probable anxiety (OR = 1.980, 95% CI: 1.241–3.160, P = 0.004), while young age was a risk factor for probable depression (OR = 2.293, 95% CI: 1.137–4.623, P = 0.020) among neurological healthcare workers. Conclusions: Probable anxiety and depression were more prevalent among neurological nurses than doctors in Hunan Province. The shortage of protective equipment led to probable anxiety, and young age led to probable depression in healthcare workers in neurology departments, which merits attention during the battle against COVID-19.

51,Predictors of mental health problems in formal and informal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease,"Background: Caring for a person with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with significant mental burden e.g., depression and anxiety, and difficulties with social, familial, and professional functioning. To date, few studies have examined variables which would allow for a comprehensive and detailed study of the relationship between personal resources and caregiver health status, with a majority of studies focusing on factors that contribute to increased caregiver’s burden. Moreover, the available evidence fails to address differences in the functioning of formal and informal carers. Paying proper attention to the problems of nursing home staff can help identify important risk factors. Therefore, this study compared mental health problems in informal and formal caregivers and examined the relationship between mental resources and mental health problems in both groups of caregivers. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined 100 formal ( n = 50) and informal ( n = 50) caregivers of AD patients. Personal resources were measured with the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ), the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire (SCQ), while mental health was assessed with the Depression Assessment Questionnaire (DAQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Multivariate stepwise regression was performed separately for both investigated groups. Results: There were no significant differences between informal and formal caregivers in terms of psychological variables, i.e., sense of coherence, social support, self-efficacy, or mental health problems. In contrast, there were different significant predictors of mental health problems in both groups. Comprehensibility (SCQ) was a significant predictor of mental health problems measured by DAQ and self-efficacy (GSES) was a significant predictor of mental health problems measured by GHQ in informal caregivers. For formal caregivers, emotional support (SSQ) and comprehensibility (SCQ) were significant predictors of mental health problems measured by DAQ, while tangible support (SSQ) and meaningfulness (SCQ) were significant predictors of mental health problems measured by GHQ. Conclusions: Personal resources are significant predictors of mental health outcomes in caregivers of AD patients. Preventive actions should therefore include assessment of factors affecting caregivers’ mental health in order to provide them with necessary care and create appropriate support groups.

52,Prevalence of and risk factors for anxiety and depression in Chinese patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by endovascular intervention,"Background: Studies on anxiety and depression in unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) patients after treatment via endovascular intervention are rare and controversial. We aimed to explore the prevalence of anxiety and depression among Chinese patients with UIAs treated by endovascular intervention and to identify which factors contribute to the development of these symptoms. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study on anxiety and depression in patients who underwent endovascular treatment for UIAs using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The demographic, clinical and radiological data for all patients were retrospectively collected from the aneurysm database and medical records. Moreover, we utilized data from a large sample of 200 UIA patients and multivariate logistic regression analysis to investigate the risk factors for anxiety and depression in these patients. Candidate variables with P values less than 0.20 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Two hundred patients returned completed questionnaires in this study. Of these 200 patients, 34 (17.0%) suffered from anxiety and 31 (15.5%) suffered from depression 30.67 ± 8.6 months after being discharged. The multivariate analysis results indicated that shorter sleep times were statistically significantly associated with depression (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14 ~ 2.29, P = 0.007, Adjusted P = 0.02). Conclusion: The prevalences of anxiety and depression in UIA patients treated by endovascular intervention were 17.0 and 15.5%, respectively. Shorter sleep times were significantly associated with depression. Our findings provide evidence for the clinical and psychological management of these patients.

53,Emotion reactivity-related brain network analysis in generalized anxiety disorder: A task fMRI study,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is closely associated with emotional dysregulation. Patients with GAD tend to overreact to emotional stimuli and are impaired in emotional regulation. Using emotional regulation task, studies have found hypo-activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of GAD patients and concluded with inadequate top-down control. However, results remain inconsistent concerning PFC and limbic area’s reactivity to emotional stimuli. What’s more, only a few studies aim to identify how limbic area interacts with PFC in GAD patients. The current study aims to identify the difference in PFC-limbic circuitry response to emotional stimuli between GAD patients and healthy controls (HCs) from the perspective of brain network. Through brain network analysis, it revealed the connectivity between limbic area and PFC, and moreover, the orientation of connectivity, all of which gave a better test of inadequate top-down control hypothesis. Methods: During fMRI scanning, participants were required to complete an emotional face identification task (fearful, neutral, happy facial expression). 30 participants (16 GAD patients, 14 HCs) were included in the formal analysis. A Bayesian-network based method was used to identify the brain network consisting of several pre-hypothesized regions of interest (ROIs) under each condition (negative, positive, neutral). In total, six graphs were obtained. Each of them represented the brain network that was common to the group under corresponding condition. Results: Results revealed that GAD patients showed more bottom-up connection but less top-down connection regardless of condition, relative to HCs. Also, the insula was more connected but the amygdala was less connected regardless of condition, relative to HCs. the results also revealed a very different brain network response between GAD patients and HCs even under neutral condition. Conclusions: More bottom-up connection but less top-down connection may indicate that GAD patients are insufficient in top-down control, in keeping with inadequate top-down control hypothesis. The more connected insula may indicate GAD patients’ abnormality in interoception processing. Relative to HCs, distinct brain network response pattern in GAD patients under neutral condition suggests GAD patients’ abnormality in distinguishing safety from threat and intolerance of uncertainty.

54,Associations between (sub) clinical stress- and anxiety symptoms in mentally healthy individuals and in major depression: A cross-sectional clinical study,"Background: Responses to stressful circumstances have psychological and physiological dimensions, and are related to anxiety symptoms and mental disorders such as depression. Nonetheless, the relationship between subclinical stress and anxiety symptoms is still elusive. Methods: To explore possible associations between stress and anxiety symptoms, patients with major depression ( N = 77) and mentally healthy individuals of different age clusters and occupations ( N = 412) were enrolled into the study. Stress was assessed with the new subclinical stress symptom questionnaire (SSQ-25). Anxiety was studied with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), mainly focusing on clinical anxiety, whilst anxiety as a personality trait was assessed with the trait aspect of the State Τrait Αnxiety Ιnventory Y (STAI Y). Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Scheffe test, linear regression models and a two-step cluster analysis using Log-Likelihood Distance measure and fixed number of two clusters. Results: Age, stress symptoms and BAI scores differed significantly between among groups ( P &lt; 0.001), whilst STAI Y scores did not. Stress levels were found to be related to clinical anxiety ( P &lt; 0.001), while neither group identity nor age exerted any influence on anxiety levels ( P &gt; 0.05). The two Step Cluster analysis classified 76 out of 77 participants with milder stress (subclinical) symptoms into the cluster with moderate anxiety, as indicated by BAI scores, and all individuals with more severe stress into the severe anxiety cluster. Conclusions: The observed associations between stress and anxiety shed light on the interrelations between even very mild (subclinical) stress and anxiety symptoms and may point to the potential of mild stress to serve as a target for early interventions aiming to prevent anxiety morbidity.

55,Effects of ∆⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol on aversive memories and anxiety: A review from human studies,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may stem from the formation of aberrant and enduring aversive memories. Some PTSD patients have recreationally used Cannabis , probably aiming at relieving their symptomatology. However, it is still largely unknown whether and how Cannabis or its psychotomimetic compound Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) attenuates the aversive/traumatic memory outcomes. Here, we seek to review and discuss the effects of THC on aversive memory extinction and anxiety in healthy humans and PTSD patients. Methods: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Central Register for Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed published studies and randomized controlled trials in humans published in English between 1974 and July 2020, including those using only THC and THC combined with cannabidiol (CBD). The effect size of the experimental intervention under investigation was calculated. Results: At low doses, THC can enhance the extinction rate and reduce anxiety responses. Both effects involve the activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors in discrete components of the corticolimbic circuitry, which could couterbalance the low “endocannabinoid tonus” reported in PTSD patients. The advantage of associating CBD with THC to attenuate anxiety while minimizing the potential psychotic or anxiogenic effect produced by high doses of THC has been reported. The effects of THC either alone or combined with CBD on aversive memory reconsolidation, however, are still unknown. Conclusions: Current evidence from healthy humans and PTSD patients supports the THC value to suppress anxiety and aversive memory expression without producing significant adverse effects if used in low doses or when associated with CBD. Future studies are guaranteed to address open questions related to their dose ratios, administration routes, pharmacokinetic interactions, sex-dependent differences, and prolonged efficacy.

56,The role of borderline personality disorder symptoms on absenteeism &amp;amp; work performance in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Background: Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) were previously found to be associated with decreased work performance, even after controlling for depressive and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, co-occurrence of BPD and affective disorders is common. Therefore, we examined the effect of BPD symptoms on occupational functioning in workers with affective disorders. Methods: Healthy workers ( n = 287), workers with current depression/anxiety only ( n = 195), workers with BPD symptoms only ( n = 54), and workers with both depression/anxiety and BPD symptoms ( n = 103) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Both a categorical and dimensional approach were used to cross-sectionally study the effect of BPD symptoms on work performance and absenteeism. Results: Compared to healthy controls, all symptomatic groups had impaired occupational functioning. Workers with current depression/anxiety had higher long-term absenteeism (OR = 3.59; 95%CI:1.83–7.02) and impaired work performance (OR = 7.81; 95%CI:4.44–13.73), workers with BPD symptoms only had higher impaired work performance (OR = 6.02 95%CI:2.76–13.09), and workers with both depression/anxiety and BPD symptoms had higher long-term absenteeism (OR = 3.66 95%CI:1.69–7.91) and impaired work performance (OR = 10.41 95%CI:5.38–20.15). No difference was found between the (symptomatic) groups. In the dimensional analysis, all associations between BPD symptoms and occupational measures disappeared when depressive symptoms were added. Depressive and BPD symptoms were highly correlated (r = .67). Conclusions: Our findings confirm that both affective disorders and BPD symptoms are associated with occupational dysfunction. The effect of BPD symptoms however, seems mediated by depressive symptoms. This would suggest that focusing on affective symptoms in occupational health may be effective to improve occupational functioning in persons with BPD.

57,"Factors associated with resilience among non-local medical workers sent to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background: To investigate the resilience of non-local medical workers sent to support local medical workers in treating the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: In February 2020, non-local medical workers who had been sent to Wuhan as support staff to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak were asked to complete an online survey composed of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Results: Survey responses from 114 non-local medical workers were analyzed. CD-RISC scores were high (67.03 ± 13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48 ± 11.49), followed by support staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78 ± 12.43) and nurses (64.86 ± 13.46). Respondents differed significantly in the levels of education, training/support provided by the respondent’s permanent hospital (where he or she normally works), and in their feelings of being adequately prepared and confident to complete tasks ( P &lt; 0.05). Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety ( r = −.498, P &lt; 0.01) and depression ( r = −.471, P &lt; 0.01) but positively with active coping styles ( r = .733, P &lt; 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that active coping (β = 1.314, p &lt; 0.05), depression (β = −.806, p &lt; 0.05), anxiety (β = − 1.091, p &lt; 0.05), and training/support provided by the respondent’s permanent hospital (β = 3.510, p &lt; 0.05) were significant associated with resilience. Conclusion: Our data show that active coping, depression, anxiety, and training/support provided by the respondent’s permanent hospital are associated with resilience. Managers of medical staff should use these data to develop psychosocial interventions aimed at reinforcing the resilience of medical workers during highly stressful and prolonged medical emergencies, as seen during the COVID-19 outbreak.

58,The needs and service preferences of caregivers of youth with mental health and/or addictions concerns,"Background: Caregivers experience significant strains as a result of navigating the complex mental health and/or addiction (MHA) system for their youth with MHA issues. We examined the characteristics of Ontario families with youth with MHA issues and their service needs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study investigated the characteristics and service needs of families with youth with MHA issues across the province of Ontario, Canada. A total of 840 caregivers were recruited. Results: 259 participants (Mage = 45.94, SD = 7.11) identified as caregiving for at least one youth with MHA issues. The majority of the participants were female (70.7%), married (73.4%), and completed at least some college/Bachelor degree (59.1%). The mean age of youth was 16.72 years (SD = 5.33) and the most frequently reported diagnoses were Depression (30.1%), ADHD (27.8%) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (21.2%). Regression results demonstrated that presently accessing services, presently seeking services, and higher levels of barriers MHA services were significantly predictive of identifying navigation as helpful for finding appropriate MHA services (χ²(7) = 28.69, p &lt; .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .16). Furthermore, presently accessing services was significantly predictive of identifying case management as helpful (χ²(7) = 29.59, p &lt; .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .156), and of identifying a primary healthcare provider as helpful (χ²(7) = 38.75, p&lt; .001, Nagelkerke R² = .197) for finding appropriate MHA services. Conclusion: Identifying the nature and extent of youth MHA issues, service needs, and family preferences can inform the development of services that address families’ needs and lend vital support for accessing services within a complex system.

59,Comparison of the severity of psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population regarding COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused serious psychological problems, including panic attack, anxiety, stress, and depression. The main objective of this study was to measure the prevalence and compare the severity of this psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population. Method: In a cross-sectional survey, the mental health status of four groups of an Iranian society including community population, patients with COVID-19, medical staff, and medical students were investigated by the self-report questionnaire of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS-21 questionnaire and the demographic data sheet were filled out by the participants. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. ANOVA test was used to compare the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression between the four study groups. Results: Of the 886 participants in this survey, 554 (62.5%) were men and 332 (37.5%) were women, and the mean ± standard division of age was 40.91 ± 10.7 years. Among these participants, 241 (27.2%) were selected from community population, 221 (24.9%) were patients with COVID-19, 217 (24.5%) were medical staff, and 207 (23.4%) were medical students. The mean score of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in medical staff and community population (P &lt; 0.05). Overall, the anxiety score in men was higher than that in women (27.4 ± 4.6 vs. 26.48 ± 4.8, P = 0.006), and unmarried participants had a significantly higher depression score compared with the married group (27.5 ± 4.8 vs. 26.7 ± 4.6, P = 0.023). In addition, the score of depression was higher in female medical staff (27.08 ± 4.6 vs. 25.33 ± 4.3, P = 0.011) and community population (26.6 ± 4.3 vs. 25.3 ± 4.3, P = 0.02) than in male. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients and medical students in contact with these patients were at a high risk for mental illness due to lower experience compared with professional medical staff and community population. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of psychological distress for outbreaks should become a routine part of preparedness efforts worldwide.

60,"A multi-centre, double-blind, 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of adjunctive N-acetylcysteine for treatment-resistant PTSD: A study protocol","Background: Most patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) suffer residual symptoms following first-line treatment. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor of the brain’s primary antioxidant, glutathione, and may diminish oxidative cellular damage. An 8-week pilot study of NAC in veterans with PTSD found that symptoms were significantly reduced in the NAC group compared to placebo. This study aims to confirm these findings with a larger sample in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial to further explore the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant PTSD. Methods: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for adult patients who still meet criteria for PTSD following first-line treatment. The intervention comprises either NAC as a fixed dose regime of 2.7 g/day (900 mg three times daily) administered orally for 12 weeks, or placebo. Standard care for PTSD will continue in addition, including other pharmacotherapies. Detailed clinical data will be collected at randomisation and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 64 post-randomisation, with self-report measures completed weekly from baseline to 16 weeks and at 64 weeks post-randomisation. Blood-based biomarkers will be collected at baseline and 12 weeks to assess the mechanism of effect. The primary outcome measure will be change in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes will be change in quality of life, depression, anxiety, substance use and craving, and somatic symptoms. With 126 completed participants (63 per arm), the study is powered at 80% to detect a true difference in the primary outcome measure using a two-tailed analysis with alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2. Discussion: This is the first multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive NAC for treatment-resistant PTSD. NAC has an established safety profile, is readily available and easy to administer, and has a favourable tolerability profile, therefore making it an attractive adjunctive therapy. Inclusion of blood analyses to assess potential target engagement biomarkers of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation may help gauge the biological mechanisms of effect of NAC.

61,Prevalence and predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients diagnosed with oral cancer in China: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common mental health problems among patients with cancer. While many psychological variables have been proven to influence anxiety and depressive symptoms, the variables are not mutually exclusive and their integrated effects on patients with oral cancer are yet unknown. The present study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients with oral cancer, to find out key potentially predictive factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out for Chinese patients with oral cancer between May 2016 and October 2017 in two Grade-A Tertiary Hospitals in Shenyang, China. Two hundred thirty patients with oral cancer were interviewed with questionnaires on demographic variables, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Herth Hope Index (HHI), Social Impact Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and General Perceived Self-efficacy Scale(GSE). Chi-square test, nonparametric test, t-test and logistic regression analyses were conducted where appropriate to explore predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in the sample population was 36.96% (85/230) and 65.21% (150/230), respectively. Social isolation dimension of stigma (β = 0.436, OR = 1.547, CI:1.211 ~ 1.975), optimism (β = − 0.276, OR = 0.759, CI:0.624 ~ 0.922), and perceived stress (β = 0.217, OR = 1.243, CI:1.092 ~ 1.414) were predictors of anxiety symptoms. Marriage (β = 1.648, OR = 5.198, CI:1.427 ~ 18.924), positive readiness and expectancy dimension of hope (β = − 0.505, OR = 0.604, CI:0.395 ~ 0.923), social isolation dimension of stigma (β = 0.314, OR = 1.368, CI:1.054 ~ 1.776) and perceived stress (β = 0.273, OR = 1.314, CI:1.134 ~ 1.524) were predictors of depressive symptoms among oral cancer patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was high among oral cancer patients in China. The communal predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with oral cancer were levels of perceived stress and social isolation of stigma. In addition, optimism was a predictor of anxiety symptoms and hope was a predictor of depressive symptoms.

62,Cortisol and DHEA-S levels in pregnant women with severe anxiety,"Background: A complex interaction between cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) is crucial in the stress system balance; several studies have reported increased cortisol levels during chronic stress and a weak counterregulation by DHEA-S. During pregnancy, scarce information about this system is available, although cortisol and DHEA-S play an important role in the initiation and acceleration of labor. We conducted the present study in order to determine both cortisol and DHEA-S levels during the last trimester of pregnancy in patients exhibiting severe anxiety. Methods: Pregnant women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy were evaluated by using the self-reported version of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). According to the scores obtained from the psychometric scale, participants were divided into two groups: 1) patients exhibiting a cutoff score &gt; 15 were considered with severe anxiety (ANX) (n = 101), and control pregnant subjects (CTRL) ( n = 44) with a cutoff score &lt; 5. Morning cortisol, DHEA-S and Cortisol/DHEA-S index were measured in all participants. Comparisons between groups were performed; additionally, correlations between clinical variables, biochemical data and HARS were calculated. Results: Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the ANX group ( p &lt; 0.001), whereas those of DHEA-S were significantly lower in the same group ( p &lt; 0.01) when compared to healthy pregnant subjects. An increased cortisol/ DHEA-S index was observed in the ANX group ( p &lt; 0.05). A significant association between cortisol and HARS scores ( p = 0.03), was observed even after adjusting by gestational weeks ( p = 0.004). Conclusions: Our data support that the cortisol/DHEA-S index is higher in pregnant women with high anxiety levels as compared with healthy pregnant women.

63,A psychometric evaluation of the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health instruments (ChYMH) anxiety scale in children with and without developmental disabilities,"Background: With 10 to 20% of Canadian children suffering with mental illness, the importance of early identification and accurate assessment systems is clear. Unfortunately, many do not receive the mental health treatment necessary and wait-times for assessment can span up to a year. In response, the interRAI suite of assessments were designed to comprehensively assess early signs of mental health impairments in children from birth to 18 years. Methods: This study assesses the psychometric properties of the Anxiety Scale and addresses the identification of anxiety within children diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD); a commonly underrepresented sample in mental health psychometric studies. Data was collected from children aged 4–18 years in three different samples. Results: Results indicated reliable internal consistency and factor structure, as well as moderate-to-strong convergent validity. Conclusions: We conclude that the Anxiety Scale exhibits psychometric qualities which demonstrate its clinical utility for use within a child sample, as well as in children with IDD. The findings provide support to a larger body of research which show consistent psychometric rigour of the interRAI measures.

64,Effect of self-care counselling on depression and anxiety in women with endometriosis: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Considering the prevalence of endometriosis and consequent depression and anxiety as well as the resultant effects on the body, mind, and quality of life of patients, this study aimed to determine the effects of self-care counselling on depression and anxiety (primary outcome) and on quality of life (secondary outcome) among women with endometriosis. Method: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 76 women with endometriosis who were treated at Al-Zahra Teaching and Treatment Center of Tabriz within the 2015–2019 period. The random blocking method was employed to divide the patients into intervention (counselling) and control groups. In the intervention group, seven self-care group counselling sessions were held on a weekly basis. The control group received routine care. A sociodemographic questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire were completed by the researcher through an interview before and 4 weeks after the intervention. Results: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of sociodemographic characteristics ( p &gt; 0.05). After the intervention, the mean scores of state anxiety (mean difference: −0.12, 95% confidence interval: −9.6 to −14.4, p &lt; 0.001) and trait anxiety (mean difference: −10.9: 95% confidence interval: −9.1 to −12.7, p = 0.001) were significantly lower in the counselling group than those of the control group. The mean score of depression was lower in the counselling group than in the control group; however, it was not significant ( p = 0/565). The mean score of quality of life for physical health (mean difference = 17.2, 95% confidence interval: 13.8 to 20.5, p &lt; 0.001) and for mental health (mean difference = 12.0, 95% confidence interval: 9.0 to 14.9, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the counselling group than in the control group. Conclusion: Self-care counselling affects the anxiety and quality of life of women with endometriosis. Therefore, in addition to other therapies, this method is proposed to improve quality of life and mental health of patients with endometriosis.

65,Potential metabolic monitoring indicators of suicide attempts in first episode and drug naive young patients with major depressive disorder: A cross-sectional study,"Backgrounds: Major depressive disorder is an ordinary mental disorder, and suicide is considered to be a major concern among patients with MDD. Previous studies focused on the relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in elderly patients with MDD, while ignore the young people. The aim of this study is to find the potential relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in young patients with MDD to find a way to prevent and ultimately reduce suicide in young patients with MDD. Methods: Cross-sectional design was employed in the study.740 patients aged between 18 and 45 years old with MDD had been consecutively recruited in this study between 2011 and 2017, 128 of whom had suicide attempts. Their serum samples used to monitor fasting blood glucose, serum lipids as well as socio-demographic characteristics were collected. Besides, some clinical scales were also employed to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and other conditions. Results: This study indicated that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters in young patients with MDD showed higher levels of FBG, TC, LDL-C (all p &lt; 0.05) and lower levels of HDL-C(p &lt; 0.001). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that suicide attempts were associated with increased FBG, decreased HDL-C, the course of disease, HAMD scores and obvious anxiety. Conclusions: Suicide attempts in young patients with MDD may be predicted by metabolic levels in the future. And our findings suggested that the level of FBG and HDL-C can be promising biomarkers to predict the occurrence of this event.

66,Patient-reported outcomes in major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: A real-world data analysis using PatientsLikeMe platform,"Background: The current analysis utilized data collected via an online patient community platform, PatientsLikeMe (PLM) to compare patient-reported experiences in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal ideation (MDSI) to those with MDD but without suicidal ideation. Methods: PLM members who joined PLM between May-2007 and February-2018 and reported a diagnosis of MDD were included. The MDSI cohort included patients with MDD who reported at least one suicide-related symptom at a severity greater than “none”. Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and side-effects were compared between MDSI and MDD cohorts. Factors correlated with suicidal ideation (SI) were determined by a random forest procedure. Results: Patients in the MDSI cohort ( n = 266) were younger (median age, 36 vs 44 years) with an earlier disease onset (before 30 years, 83% vs 71%), and a longer diagnosis latency (median, 4 vs 2 years) vs patients in the MDD cohort ( n = 11,963). Majority of patients were women in both cohorts (73% vs 83%). Median number of psychiatric comorbidities was higher in the MDSI cohort (4 vs 3). Unprompted symptoms (e.g., loneliness, feeling of hopelessness, social anxiety, impulsivity, and self-hating thoughts) were more frequent in the MDSI cohort. Hopelessness, loneliness, anhedonia, social anxiety, and younger age were highly correlated with suicidal ideation. Conclusions: This analysis utilized patient-reported data to better understand symptoms, experiences, and characteristics of patients with MDSI compared to patients with MDD. The results identified various risk factors correlated with suicidal ideation that may help guide clinical judgement for patients with MDD who may not voluntarily report suicidal ideation.

67,"Viewing an alpine environment positively affects emotional analytics in patients with somatoform, depressive and anxiety disorders as well as in healthy controls","Background: Patients with somatoform, depressive or anxiety disorders often don’t respond well to medical treatment and experience many side effects. It is thus of clinical relevance to identify alternative, scientifically based, treatments. Our approach is based on the recent evidence that urbanicity has been shown to be associated with an increased risk for mental disorders. Conversely, green and blue environments show a dose-dependent beneficial impact on mental health. Methods: Here we evaluate the effect of viewing stimuli of individuals in an alpine environment on emotional analytics in 183 patients with psychiatric disorders (mostly somatoform, depressive and anxiety disorders) and 315 healthy controls (HC). Emotional analytics (valence: unhappy vs happy, arousal: calm vs excited, dominance: controlled vs in control) were assessed using the Self-Assessment Manikin. Further parameters related to mental health and physical activity were recorded. Results: Emotional analytics of patients indicated that they felt less happy, less in control and had higher levels of arousal than HC when viewing neutral stimuli. The comparison alpine&gt;neutral stimuli showed a significant positive effect of alpine stimuli on emotional analytics in both groups. Patients and HC both felt attracted to the scenes displayed in the alpine stimuli. Emotional analytics correlated positively with resilience and inversely with perceived stress. Conclusions: Preventive and therapeutic programs for patients with somatoform, depressive and anxiety disorders should consider taking the benefits of natural outdoor environments, such as alpine environments, into account. Organizational barriers which are preventing the implementation of such programs in clinical practice need to be identified and addressed.

68,Sinhala translation of the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale: A valid and reliable tool to detect anxiety disorders among antenatal women,"Background: Anxiety disorders during pregnancy are not routinely assessed in Sri Lanka despite being common and being associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Screening can facilitate early detection and management of anxiety and improve pregnancy outcomes. Our aim was to determine the validity of the Sinhala translation of the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) to detect anxiety among Sri Lankan pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in antenatal clinics of a teaching hospital in Colombo District. The PASS was translated to Sinhala using the standard translation/ back-translation method. Pregnant women ( n = 221) were sequentially recruited and assessed by a psychiatrist until 81 women with anxiety disorder were diagnosed using the International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria (gold standard). The Sinhala translation of the PASS (PASS-S) was administered to all recruited women, including 140 women without anxiety. Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, the optimal cut-off score for PASS-S was determined, and its validity was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability for PASS-S score and anxiety classification were assessed using intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen’s kappa (k), respectively. Results: The mean age (± SD) of women was 30(± 5.8) years, and 53.7% were multiparous. A psychiatrist diagnosed anxiety disorder was made in 37.0% of women, while the PASS-S, at its optimal cut-off of ≥ 20, classified 37.5% of women as having anxiety disorders. The area under the ROC curve for the PASS-S was 0.96 (95%CI 0.94–0.99). Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the PASS-S were 0.93 (95% CI 0.84–0.97), 0.90 (95% CI 0.83–0.94), 0.85 (95% CI 0.75–0.90) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.89–0.98), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 8.8 (95% CI 5.3–14.5) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04–0.18), respectively, and the internal consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0.95). Four-factor structures obtained by exploratory factor analysis were “acute anxiety and adjustment”, “social anxiety, specific fears and trauma”, “perfectionism and control” and “general anxiety”.Test-retest reliability was high for the PASS-S score (ICC 0.85[95% CI 0.65–0.96]) and anxiety classification (k 0.77[95% CI 0.34–1.2]). Inter-interviewer reliability was also high (ICC 0.92[95% CI 0.81–0.97] for the PASS-S score and (k0.86 [95% CI 0.59–1.1] for anxiety classification). Conclusion: The Sinhala translation of the PASS is a valid and reliable instrument to screen for anxiety disorders among antenatal women in Sri Lanka.

The author group has been updated in the erratum and the original article has been corrected.] Background: To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Methods: Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53–36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27–32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants’ self-reported safety scores for HCW’s protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.

70,Efficacy and clinical predictors of response to rTMS treatment in pharmacoresistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): A retrospective study,"Background: Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been promising and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2018, but effects differ between patients. Knowledge about clinical predictors of rTMS response may help to increase clinical efficacy but is not available so far. Methods: In a retrospective study, we investigated the efficacy of rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or supplementary motor area (SMA) in 65 pharmaco-resistant OCD outpatients recruited for rTMS treatment from July 2015 to May 2017. Patients received either SMA rTMS ( n = 38) or bilateral DLPFC rTMS ( n = 27) in case of reporting higher affective and depressive symptoms in addition to the primary OCD symptoms. OCD symptoms and depression/anxiety states were measured at baseline (before the 1st session) and after the 20th session of rTMS. Additionally, we performed a binary logistic regression analysis on the demographic and clinical variables based on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) 3-factor and 2-factor models and individual items to investigate potential predictors of rTMS response. Results: Patients’ scores in Y-BOCS and Beck anxiety/depression inventories were significantly decreased following rTMS treatment. 46.2% of all patients responded to rTMS, based on the criterion of at least a 30% reduction in YBOCS scores. There was no significant difference between response rates of patients in DLPFC and SMA groups. No significant demographic predictors of rTMS efficacy were identified. The factors “obsession severity”, “resistance” and “disturbance” and the “interference due to obsessions” and “resistance against compulsions” items of the Y-BOCS significantly predicted response to rTMS. Conclusions: In patients with less intrusive/interfering thoughts, and low scores in the “obsession severity”, “disturbance”, and “resistance” factors, rTMS might have superior effects. Identifying clinical and non-clinical predictors of response is relevant to personalize and adapt rTMS protocols in pharmaco-resistant OCD patients. Interpretation of rTMS efficacy should be done with caution due to the lack of a sham intervention condition.

71,Anxiety symptoms and preventive measures during the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan,"Background: It is hypothesized that anxiety and behavioral responses are intense at the beginning of an epidemic. The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. Results: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4–53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2–50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [inter-quartile range] 36.7–53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7–53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0–30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0–28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28–8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak. Conclusions: Anxiety and preventive measures scores were high and increased with the epidemic rate. Higher anxiety was associated with an increased use of preventive measures against COVID-19.

In the original article, multiple errors were identified in the Results Text of the Abstract and the Diagnostic agreement for DSM-5 disorder categories section. The text has been changed to correspond to the correct results reported in Table 4 and are highlighted in bold typeface in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-41172-001). Background: There is a need of comprehensive standardized diagnostic assessment tools of psychopathology that match recent changes in diagnostic classification systems, such as the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Therefore, the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 was developed and its test-retest reliability was explored. The DIA-X-5 is based on the DIA-X/M-CIDI (Diagnostisches Expertensystem für psychische Störungen/Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) which referred to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Methods: A convenience sample ( N = 60, age: 15–67) was interviewed twice with the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 interview, on average nine days apart, by trained and blinded interviewers. The DIA-X-5 is a standardized instrument for research purposes covering symptoms, syndromes and diagnoses from eleven classes of mental disorders according to the DSM-5 with matching F codes of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Results : Kappa values ranged from 0.90 for post-traumatic stress disorder to 0.30 for social anxiety disorder. For age of onset and age of recency, test-retest reliability as measured by intra-class correlation was satisfying with values above 0.90 for most disorders. Conclusions: Test-retest reliability of the DIA-X-5 syndromes and diagnoses were comparable to those of previous DSM-IV/DIA-X diagnoses for most disorders. Due to low case numbers for some diagnoses, further research in larger samples is required.

73,The prevalence and risk factors for mental distress among Syrian refugees in Germany: A register-based follow-up study,"Background: Mental disorders among refugees as well as their risk factors are already well documented in cross-sectional reports. However, longitudinal follow-up designs are widely lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the change of the prevalence of mental disorders among Syrian refugees with German residence permission, taking into account their increasing length of stay in Germany, and to uncover the change in their relationship to pre- and post-migration risk factors. Methods: This study formed part of a register-based follow-up study with two measurement points in Erlangen (Germany). At the first time of recruitment in 2017, 200 of the 518 Syrian refugees with residence permission living in Erlangen took part. During the second survey timeframe 1.5 years later, in 2019, 108 of the former 200 Syrian refugees participated again and formed the total sample for this follow-up study. The survey instruments included demographics, migration-related variables and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (Essen Trauma Inventory, ETI), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire - PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7). Results: At the time of the first survey, 26.9% of the participants exceeded the cut-off for a clinically relevant depression diagnosis, 16.7% for an anxiety disorder and 13.9% for a PTSD diagnosis. At the second measurement point, it was 30.6% for depression, 15.7% for an anxiety disorder and 13.0% for PTSD. No significant changes between the measurement points were found for any of the disorders. In multiple linear regression analyses, higher perceived discrimination, a higher number of traumatic experiences and a shorter duration of residence permission were shown to be the most important pre- and post-migration predictors of psychological stress independent of the time of measurement. Conclusions: There is strong empirical evidence that the prevalence rates of mental distress among refugees are significantly higher compared to the overall population. However, it has not yet become clear how these prevalence rates change with an increasing length of stay in the host countries. The results of our study indicate that the psychological burden on this refugee population remains consistently high over time, despite partly improved living conditions, and confirm the importance of therapeutic interventions.

74,"Resilience, trauma, and hopelessness: Protective or triggering factor for the development of psychopathology among migrants?","Background: Recently, many studies have investigated the role of migration on mental health. Nonetheless, only few focused on the consequences of childhood trauma, hopelessness, and resilience on migrants’ psychopathology, including psychiatric disorders and symptoms. Method: 119 migrants were recruited between May 2017 and April 2018, among those applying for assessment to the Mental Health Operational Unit of the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (NIHMP) in Rome, Italy. Assessment included the following: Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck’s Suicide Intent Scale (SIS), Brief Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ), Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). Results: 53.39% of migrants scored above the PCL-5 cut-off score (mean score was 39.45). SDS scores below the cutoff suggested the presence of depression in 42.37%, while According to SAS scores anxiety levels were low in 38.98% of migrants. During childhood, physical abuse and neglect were reported respectively by 56.78 and 69.49% of migrants. Conclusion: We found that Post Traumatic Stress Disorders play the role of mediators for the relation between the childhood traumatic experiences and aggressiveness, anxious and depressive symptomatology, while hopelessness is a mediator between the childhood traumatic experiences and the development of depression in adulthood. Hopelessness seems to influence the strength of the relation between childhood traumatic experiences and the individual’s current intensity of suicidal attitudes, plans, and behaviors. Further developments and future perspectives of the research project are to address key gaps in the field of resilience by means of a longitudinal evaluation study in migrants, including a native population control group, acceding to NIHMP.

75,"The role of reassurance seeking in obsessive compulsive disorder: The associations between reassurance seeking, dysfunctional beliefs, negative emotions, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms","Background: This study investigates the association of reassurance seeking with obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, and negative emotions. Methods: Reassurance Seeking Questionnaire, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire, Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and Guilt Inventory were applied to 53 obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and 591 non-clinical participants. Results: The results showed that the severity of the OC symptoms significantly predicted the carefulness of OCD patients during reassurance seeking, indicating increased carefulness during reassurance seeking as the severity of OC symptoms increased. Moreover, feelings of guilt increased with increasing intensity of reassurance seeking. In addition, carefulness during reassurance seeking significantly predicted the level of anxiety. Responsibility/threat estimation, perfectionism/need for certainty, and importance/control of thoughts significantly predicted the OC symptoms. Moreover, the dysfunctional beliefs directly associated with an increased need to seek reassurance from different sources and seek reassurance more carefully. In terms of mediational effect, the results revealed that the individuals who had distorted beliefs were more likely to have OC symptoms and, in turn, the OC symptoms increased carefulness during reassurance seeking. The analysis of the model test revealed mostly similar results to those obtained for the clinical sample. Conclusions: The findings revealed a close relationship between OC symptoms and reassurance-seeking behaviors.

76,Antipsychotic treatment experiences of people with bipolar I disorder: Patient perspectives from an online survey,"Background: Oral antipsychotic (AP) medications are frequently prescribed to people with bipolar I disorder (BD-I). A cross-sectional online survey examined the experiences of people living with BD-I with a history of recent AP use. Methods: Adults with self-reported physician-diagnosed BD-I ( N = 200) who received oral APs during the prior year completed a survey on AP-related experiences, including side effects and their perceived burden on social functioning, adherence, and work. Items also assessed preferences for trade-offs (balancing symptom management and side effects) when considering a hypothetical new AP. The perceived impact of specific, prevalent side effects on adherence, work, and preferences for a hypothetical AP were also examined. Analyses were descriptive. Results: The survey sample had a mean age of 43.2 (SD = 12.4) years, was 60% female, and 31% nonwhite. Almost all participants (98%) had experienced AP side effects. Common self-reported side effects were feeling drowsy or tired (83%), lack of emotion (79%), anxiety (79%), dry mouth (76%), and weight gain (76%). Weight gain was cited as the most bothersome side effect, rated by most participants (68%) as “very” or “extremely bothersome.” Nearly half of participants (49%) reported that AP side effects negatively impacted their job performance; almost all (92%) reported that side effects – most commonly anxiety and lack of emotion – negatively impacted social relationships (e.g., family or romantic partners). The most commonly-reported reason for stopping AP use was dislike of side effects (48%). Side effects most likely to lead to stopping or taking less of AP treatment included “feeling like a ‘zombie’” (29%), feeling drowsy or tired (25%), and weight gain (24%). When considering a hypothetical new AP, the most common side effects participants wanted to avoid included AP-induced anxiety (50%), weight gain (48%), and “feeling like a ‘zombie’” (47%). Conclusions: Side effects of APs were both common and bothersome, and impacted social functioning, adherence, and work. Findings highlight the prevailing unmet need for new APs with more favorable benefit-risk profiles.

77,Bipolar disorder in megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts: A case report,"Background: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), or Van der Knaap disease, is a rare spongiform leukodystrophy that is characterized by macrocephaly, progressive motor dysfunction, and mild mental retardation. It is very rare for mental illness such as psychotic disorders, affective disorders and anxiety disorders to occur in MLC. Case presentation: A 17-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital after he developed symptoms of depressive state with catatonia after being diagnosed as having MLC with confirmed MLC1 mutation. His catatonic symptoms were improved with administration of olanzapine and sertraline and he was discharged after 4 months. Several months later, he became hypomanic. He was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. Mood swings were controlled with the administration of carbamazepine. Conclusions: This case is the first report of bipolar disorder during the clinical course of MLC. This case indicate the possibility that MLC influences the development of bipolar disorder in MLC, however, further studies involving more patients are required to clarify this.

78,"The effects of emergency medical service work on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of ambulance personnel: A systematic review of qualitative research","Background: High rates of mental distress, mental illness, and the associated physical effects of psychological injury experienced by ambulance personnel has been widely reported in quantitative research. However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. Methods: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. Results: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. Conclusions: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement. Policy, programmes and interventions, and education need to occur at an individual, peer, organisational, and government level.

79,"Earthquake-related stressors associated with suicidality, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress in adolescents from Muisne after the earthquake 2016 in Ecuador","Background: The Ecuadorian earthquake in April 16th was the second strongest and deadliest in 2016 worldwide, with approximately one million people affected. In this paper, we analyzed the psychological impact and the relationship between mental health events and various earthquake-related stressors related to the earthquake, 9months after the event. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study, applying an anonymous survey to 316 adolescents (13–19 years old) from Muisne, Ecuador. Suicidal tendency, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) were evaluated via the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale, Okasha Suicidality Scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the adapted seven-questions earthquake-related stressors survey. Results: We found a high prevalence of suicidal ideations and behavior, posttraumatic stress, depression and anxiety compared to international studies. Even though adolescents currently living in shelters had higher levels of anxiety, their suicidal tendency was significantly lower than those living in their own or their relatives’ home. Finally, the earthquake-related stressors were not associated with suicidality and mental health events, with the exception of economic damage suffered by the family. Conclusions: High levels of depression, post-traumatic stress and anxiety among high-school students were found, especially among those who have suffered serious economic damage. The economic impact in their families and high unemployment rates among their parents seems to be related to lack of hope and favorable perspectives for their future, situation that might lead to lead to emotional disturbances and psychological disorders. Although prolonged homelessness experience in shelters may be a stressful occurrence, might also be related with spiritual growth among adolescents, and may work as a protective factor against suicidal ideations and attempts.

80,Association between suicide risk severity and sarcopenia in non-elderly Chinese inpatients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disorder. Recent studies have shown an association between muscle health and suicide. However, there have been no previous studies on the relationship between suicide risk severity and sarcopenia in major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to explore the association between suicide risk severity and sarcopenia in non-elderly Chinese inpatients with MDD. Methods: The first-episode drug-naïve MDD inpatients aged 20–59 years with the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24) scores of &gt;20 were included, who were then classified into low, intermediate, high and very high suicide risk groups according to the Nurses’ Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR). The HAMD-24, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and the SARC-F questionnaire were used to assess depression severity, anxiety severity and sarcopenia, respectively. The plasma levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured. Results: A total of 192 MDD inpatients (122 females, 70 males; aged 39.3 ± 11.7 years) were included, with 12.5% meeting criteria for sarcopenia. There were significant differences in gender, HAMD score and prevalence of sarcopenia among the suicide risk groups. Adjusted ordinal regression analysis showed that sarcopenia was significantly associated with more severe suicide risk (OR = 2.39, 95%CI 1.02–5.58, p = 0.044) independent of depression severity. Conclusions: This study revealed that sarcopenia was significantly associated with higher suicide risk in non-elderly Chinese MDD inpatients after adjustment for depression severity. Intervention of sarcopenia might be effective in reducing the risk of suicide in non-elderly MDD patients.

81,A systematic review of validated screening tools for anxiety disorders and PTSD in low to middle income countries,"Background: Anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) contribute significantly to disability adjusted life years in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Screening has been proposed to improve identification and management of these disorders, but little is known about the validity of screening tools for these disorders. We conducted a systematic review of validated screening tools for detecting anxiety and PTSD in LMICs. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and PsychINFO were searched (inception-April 22, 2020). Eligible studies (1) screened for anxiety disorders and/or PTSD; (2) reported sensitivity and specificity for a given cut-off value; (3) were conducted in LMICs; and (4) compared screening results to diagnostic classifications based on a reference standard. Screening tool, cut-off, disorder, region, country, and clinical population were extracted for each study, and we assessed study quality. Accuracy results were organized based on screening tool, cut-off, and specific disorder. Accuracy estimates for the same cut-off for the same screening tool and disorder were combined via meta-analysis. Results: Of 6322 unique citations identified, 58 articles including 77 screening tools were included. There were 46, 19 and 12 validations for anxiety, PTSD, and combined depression and anxiety, respectively. Continentally, Asia had the most validations (35). Regionally, South Asia (11) had the most validations, followed by South Africa (10) and West Asia (9). The Kessler-10 (7) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7) (6) were the most commonly validated tools for anxiety disorders, while the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (3) and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (3) were the most commonly validated tools for PTSD. Most studies (29) had the lowest quality rating (unblinded). Due to incomplete reporting, we could meta-analyze results from only two studies, which involved the GAD-7 (cut-off ≥10, pooled sensitivity = 76%, pooled specificity = 64%). Conclusion: Use of brief screening instruments can bring much needed attention and research opportunities to various at-risk LMIC populations. However, many have been validated in inadequately designed studies, precluding any general recommendation for specific tools in LMICs. Locally validated screening tools for anxiety and PTSD need further evaluation in well-designed studies to assess whether they can improve the detection and management of these common disorders.

82,How do worry and clinical status impact working memory performance? An experimental investigation,"Background: Previous research has suggested that worry is negatively associated with working memory performance. However, it is unclear whether these findings would replicate across different worry levels and in individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders (i.e. clinical statuses). Method: One-hundred-thirty-eight participants performed a two-block working memory task (150 trials per block). Based on participants`current clinical status, four groups were considered (generalised anxiety disorder group: n = 36; clinical group with another anxiety or mood disorders: n = 33; subclinical group: n = 27; control group: n = 42). Trait worry levels were collected from all of the participants. Working memory performance was measured as accuracy and reaction time. Results: During the first block, higher worry scores were significantly associated with longer reaction times. Moreover, the generalised anxiety disorder group, clinical group, and subclinical groups demonstrated significantly longer reaction times compared to the control group in Block 1, when age was controlled for. From Block 1 to Block 2, all of the participants demonstrated a significant decrease in accuracy and reaction time, regardless of worry level or clinical status. Conclusion: The results indicate that higher worry levels negatively impact WM processing efficiency. Moreover, when age was controlled for, we found participants` clinical status to be linked with WM impairments. The results highlight the relevance of investigating the impact of different worry levels on cognitive processes across clinical and non-clinical populations.

83,The psychometric properties of PHQ-4 anxiety and depression screening scale among out of school adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Literature suggests that most mental disorders have their onset in childhood and adolescence, but go undiagnosed until adulthood. Shorter versions of the screening tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire with four items (PHQ-4) may help to improve screening coverage. This study assessed the psychometric properties of the PHQ-4 in screening for core symptoms of depression and anxiety among out of school adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted among AGYW between June and July 2018 in North-West Tanzania. Two thousand four hundred twenty-six out-of-school AGYW aged 15 to 23 years were included. Data were collected on tablets using audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI). Cronbach’s α was used to measure the reliability of the PHQ-4 while confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were used for construct validity assessment. In CFA, three criteria were used to assess how well the model fits the data: Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and 90% confidence interval for RMSEA. Results: Of the 2426 participants, 33.8 and 35.5% screened positive for core symptoms of anxiety (GAD-2 ≥ 3) and depression (PHQ-2 ≥ 3), respectively. Cronbach’s α of the PHQ-4 was 0.81. Both items-correlation and corrected items-correlation of the PHQ-4 had total correlations above 0.5 (p &lt; 0.01). CFA showed that all items loaded significantly onto the single factor, and loadings were strong, ranging from 0.67 to 0.77 (p &lt; 0.01). CFA indicates that the PHQ-4 scale stand for a unidimensional construct with good model fit (CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.013, RMSEA = 0.054 and 90% CI for RMSEA (0.031–0.079)). PCA confirmed two distinct components; GAD-2 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression). Those who reported having suicidal thoughts and social function problems had significantly higher scores on PHQ-2, GAD-2, and PHQ-4 screening items (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The findings suggest that the PHQ-4 scale can reliably and validly screen for core symptoms of depression and anxiety among out of school AGYW. This tool is short and easy to administer. Thus, the PHQ-4 scale can be very useful in screening for anxiety and depression symptoms in the community, primary health facilities, research and programmatic settings.

84,Effect of fecal microbiota transplant on symptoms of psychiatric disorders: A systematic review,"Background: The Gut-Brain-Axis is a bidirectional signaling pathway between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain. The hundreds of trillions of microorganisms populating the gastrointestinal tract are thought to modulate this connection, and have far reaching effects on the immune system, central and autonomic nervous systems, and GI functioning. These interactions Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders have also been linked to various psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, autism spectrum disorder, and eating disorders. It is hypothesized that techniques aimed at strengthening and repopulating the gut microbiome, such as Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT), may be useful in the prevention and treatment of psychiatric illnesses. Methods: A systematic search of five databases was conducted using key terms related to FMT and psychiatric illnesses. All results were then evaluated based on specific eligibility criteria. Results: Twenty-one studies met the eligibility criteria and were analysed for reported changes in mood and behavioural measures indicative of psychiatric wellbeing. The studies included were either entirely clinical ( n = 8), preclinical with human donors ( n = 9), or entirely preclinical ( n = 11). All studies found a decrease in depressive and anxiety-like symptoms and behaviours resulting from the transplantation of healthy microbiota. The inverse was also found, with the transmission of depressive and anxiety-like symptoms and behaviours resulting from the transplantation of microbiota from psychiatrically ill donors to healthy recipients. Conclusion: There appears to be strong evidence for the treatment and transmission of psychiatric illnesses through FMT. Further research with larger sample sizes and stronger scientific design is warranted in order to fully determine the efficacy and safety of this potential treatment.

85,"Depression, anxiety, and burnout among medical students and residents of a medical school in Nepal: A cross-sectional study","Background: Medical students and residents were found to have suffered from depression, anxiety, and burnout in various studies. However, these entities have not been adequately explored in the context of Nepal. We proposed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, burnout, their associated factors, and identify their predictors in a sample of medical students and residents in a Nepalese medical school. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study with 651 medical students and residents chosen at random between December 2018 and February 2019. The validated Nepali version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, and Medical Students’ Stressor Questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, burnout, and stressors respectively. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify the correlation of predictor variables with depression, anxiety, and burnout. Results: The overall prevalence of burnout (48.8%; 95% CI 44.9–52.7) and anxiety (45.3%; 95% CI 41.4–49.2) was more than that of depression (31%; 95% CI 27.5–34.7). Burnout and depression were more prevalent in residents than in medical students (burnout: 64.5% vs 37.6%, P-value &lt; 0.0001; depression: 33.7% vs 29.1%, P-value 0.21). Whereas, medical students were found more anxious than residents (46.3% versus 43.96%, P-value 0.55). Academic related stressors caused high-grade stress to participants. Multivariable model for depression significantly showed anxiety, personal burnout, and work-related burnout as risk enhancing correlates; satisfaction with academic performance as a protective correlate. Similarly, the multivariate model for anxiety significantly identified female gender, depression, personal burnout, teaching and learning related stressors, and past history of mental illness as risk enhancing correlates; being satisfied with academic performance, getting adequate sleep, and being a second-year resident as protective correlates. The logistic model for burnout significantly showed being a first-year resident, depression, anxiety, and drive and desire related stressors as positive predictors. None of the variables were identified as significant negative predictors of burnout. Conclusions: A high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and burnout was seen among medical students and residents. Most of them were stressed with academic-related factors. A strong correlation between teaching and learning-related stressors with depression and anxiety may be a call for an efficient and more student-friendly curriculum.

86,Two-way messaging therapy for depression and anxiety: Longitudinal response trajectories,"Background: Telemedicine is a strategy for overcoming barriers to access evidence-based psychotherapy. Digital modalities that operate outside session-based treatment formats, such as ongoing two-way messaging, may further address these challenges. However, no study to date has established suitability criteria for this medium. Methods: A large outpatient sample ( n = 10,718) engaged in daily messaging with licensed clinicians from a telemedicine provider. Patients consisted of individuals from urban and rural settings in all 50 states of the US, who signed up to the telemedicine provider. Using a longitudinal design, symptoms changes were observed during a 12 week treatment course. Symptoms were assessed from baseline every three weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics and engagement metrics, such as word count for both patients and therapists, were also assessed. Growth mixture modeling was used to tease apart symptoms trajectories, and identify predictors of treatment response. Results: Two subpopulations had GAD-7 and PHQ-9 remission outcomes (Recovery and Acute Recovery, 30.7% of patients), while two others showed amelioration of symptoms (Depression and Anxiety Improvement, 36.9% of patients). Two subpopulations experienced no changes in symptoms (Chronic and Elevated Chronic, 32.4% of patients). Higher use of written communication, patient characteristics, and engagement metrics reliably distinguished patients with the greatest level of remission (Recovery and Acute Recovery groups). Conclusions: Remission of depression and anxiety symptoms was observed during delivery of psychotherapy through messaging. Improvement rates were consistent with face-to-face therapy, suggesting the suitability of two-way messaging psychotherapy delivery. Characteristics of improving patients were identified and could be used for treatment recommendation. These findings suggest the opportunity for further research, to directly compare messaging delivery with a control group of treatment as usual.

87,Frequency and correlates of violence against patients with schizophrenia living in rural China,"Background: Violence against patients with schizophrenia is very common, however it is rarely studied in China, especially in primary health care institutions of rural areas. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of violence against patients with community-living schizophrenia in rural China and examined its associated factors and impact on quality of life (QoL) and social function. Method: A survey was conducted among 487 patients with schizophrenia living in rural communities. Data about violent victimization experiences in the past 6 months, demographic information, and clinical characteristics were collected by questionnaires. Results: We found that 92 (18.9%) of 487 subjects experienced at least one type of violent event in the past 6 months. Logistic regression analysis suggested that a history of conducting dangerous behaviors(OR = 1.702, P = 0.02, 95%CI: 1.05–2.73), higher Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (anxiety domain) score (OR = 1.15, P = 0.02, 95%CI: 1.01–1.304) and lower hospitalization rates (OR = 0.89, P = 0.04, 95%CI: 0.81–0.99) were significantly associated with violent victimization in patients with schizophrenia. Analysis of covariance showed the victims of violence tended to have worse social function in patients with schizophrenia living in rural communities of China ( P = 0.04). Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia living in rural China had a high risk of being exposed to violence and violent victimization of patients with schizophrenia had adverse consequences for social function. More attention is needed for those patients experiencing violent events, because they are simultaneously possible to conduct dangerous behaviors.

88,Test-retest reliability of the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 interview for mental disorders,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20[364] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2020-51341-001). In the original article, multiple errors were identified in the Results Text of the Abstract and the Diagnostic agreement for DSM-5 disorder categories section. The text has been changed to correspond to the correct results reported in Table 4 and are highlighted in bold typeface in the erratum.] Background: There is a need of comprehensive standardized diagnostic assessment tools of psychopathology that match recent changes in diagnostic classification systems, such as the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Therefore, the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 was developed and its test-retest reliability was explored. The DIA-X-5 is based on the DIA-X/M-CIDI (Diagnostisches Expertensystem für psychische Störungen/Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) which referred to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Methods: A convenience sample ( N = 60, age: 15–67) was interviewed twice with the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 interview, on average nine days apart, by trained and blinded interviewers. The DIA-X-5 is a standardized instrument for research purposes covering symptoms, syndromes and diagnoses from eleven classes of mental disorders according to the DSM-5 with matching F codes of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Results: Kappa values ranged from 0.90 for post-traumatic stress disorder to 0.30 for social anxiety disorder. For age of onset and age of recency, test-retest reliability as measured by intra-class correlation was satisfying with values above 0.90 for most disorders. Conclusions: Test-retest reliability of the DIA-X-5 syndromes and diagnoses were comparable to those of previous DSM-IV/DIA-X diagnoses for most disorders. Due to low case numbers for some diagnoses, further research in larger samples is required.

89,Association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) and depression and anxiety in the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) study population,"Background: Systemic inflammation is emerging as an important factor in the etiology of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Therefore, the inflammatory potential of the diet may also be an etiological factor for these conditions, and this may be estimated by calculating the dietary inflammatory index (DII®) score. We aimed to investigate the association between DII score and incidence of depression and anxiety among a representative sample in northeastern Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study undertook in a sub-sample of 7083 adults aged 35 to 65 years recruited as part of Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder (MASHAD) cohort study population, and after excluding subjects with incomplete data. All participants completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and a validated 65-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between DII score and depression/anxiety score. Results: Of the study participants, 37.1% ( n = 2631) were found to have mild to severe depression, and 50.5% ( n = 3580) were affected by mild to severe anxiety. After adjusting for confounding factors, in women, the third (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.06–1.88, p -values &lt; 0.05) and fourth quartiles (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03–1.83, p -values &lt; 0.05) of DII score were associated with increased risk of a high depression score compared to the first quartile of DII score. Conclusion: There was a significant association between DII score and severe depression among women but not men in this Iranian population.

In the original article, the authors identified a mistake in the last author’s name. Originally published name: Fatemeh Rahnemaie, Correct name: Fatemeh Alsadat Rahnemaei. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-31680-001). Background: Women in perimenopausal and postmenopausal period are at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Physiologic changes in menopause can change body’s appearance and function that may disturb body and then lead to anxiety and depression. This study aims to assess the relationship between body image with anxiety and depression among postmenopausal women. Methods: This descriptive study was performed on 307 women attending to the health centers in Tehran- Iran. Sampling was performed by a multi-staged randomized method. Data were collected by using Beck Depression questionnaire, Spielberger Anxiety Questionnaire, Fisher Body Image Questionnaire and Socio-demographic questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 and using t-test, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests and multiple linear regression methods. Results: The average age of the participants was 55.19 ± 4.034 years. Mean scores for body image, anxiety and depression were 163.26 ± 20.38, 12.00 ± 7.71 and 42.70 ± 8.40 respectively. Fifty five percent of women had mild to severe depression and 83.7% of them had mild to severe anxiety. Total score and all domains of body image had a negative correlation with depression and anxiety scores ( P &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear correlation showed that body image is a predictor for depression and anxiety (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Body image of women can be effective on occurrence of depression and anxiety in menopause. Therefore, women’s health policies should consider body image to control cognitive problems including depression and anxiety in menopause.

91,The ACCEPT-study: Design of an RCT with an active treatment control condition to study the effectiveness of the Dutch version of PEERS® for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,"Background: Social skills interventions are commonly deployed for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Because effective and appropriate social skills are determined by cultural factors that differ throughout the world, the effectiveness of these interventions relies on a good cultural fit. Therefore, the ACCEPT study examines the effectiveness of the Dutch Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®) social skills intervention. Methods/design: This study is a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which adolescents are randomly assigned (after baseline assessment) to one of two group interventions (PEERS® vs. active control condition). In total, 150 adolescents are to be included, with multi-informant involvement of their parents and teachers. The ACCEPT study uses an active control condition (puberty psychoeducation group training, focussing on social-emotional development) and explores possible moderators and mediators in improving social skills. The primary outcome measure is the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills (CASS). The CASS assesses social skills performance in a face to face social interaction with an unfamiliar, typically developing peer, making this a valuable instrument to assess the social conversational skills targeted in PEERS®. In addition, to obtain a complete picture of social skills, self-, parent- and teacher-reported social skills are assessed using the Social Skills improvement System (SSiS-RS) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2). Secondary outcome measures (i.e. explorative mediators) include social knowledge, social cognition, social anxiety, social contacts and feelings of parenting competency of caregivers. Moreover, demographic and diagnostic measures are assessed as potential moderators of treatment effectiveness. Assessments of adolescents, parents, and teachers take place at baseline (week 0), intermediate (week 7), post intervention (week 14), and at follow-up (week 28). Conclusion: This is the first RCT on the effectiveness of the PEERS® parent-assisted curriculum which includes an active control condition. The outcome of social skills is assessed using observational assessments and multiinformant questionnaires. Additionally, factors related to social learning are assessed at several time points, which will enable us to explore potential mediators and moderators of treatment effect.

92,The role of social support and emotional exhaustion in the association between work-family conflict and anxiety symptoms among female medical staff: A moderated mediation model,"Background: Limited work has been done to explain how work-family conflict is related to anxiety symptoms and the roles of emotional exhaustion and social support may play. Methods: Based on a sample of 764 female nurses and physicians, a model was tested in which emotional exhaustion served as a mediator and social support was regarded as a moderator between work-family conflict and anxiety symptoms. Results: This current study supported a moderated mediation model where the relationship between work-family conflict and anxiety symptoms via emotional exhaustion was weakest for female medical staff who reported high levels of social support. Conclusions: This study contribute to providing an understanding of how and when work-family conflict affects anxiety symptoms. The results implicate a wide range of interventions aimed at promoting mental wellbeing among female medical staff for policymakers and individuals.

93,The relation between dietary intakes and psychological disorders in Iranian adults: A population-based study,"Background: Previous studies showed an association between dietary intakes and psychological disorders. This study aimed to assess the association between dietary intakes and psychiatric disorders in Iran. Methods: In this cross sectional research, the data on 9965 adults were extracted from enrollment phase of Yazd Health Study (YaHS); a population-based cohort study on Iranian adults which was conducted during 2014 to 2016. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, tobacco use, history of chronic disease, and dietary assessment were collected using a validated researcher-made questionnaire. Moreover, anthropometric measurement was conducted. Psychological and physical activity assessments were also performed by depression, anxiety and stress scale questionnaire (DASS 21 items) and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) respectively. Finally, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate relation between dietary intakes and psychological disorders. Results: After adjusting for the confounders, egg (depression: OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.52–0.98; anxiety: OR = 0.72, CI: 0.55–0.94), fruits (depression: OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43–0.82; anxiety: OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53–0.91), milk (depression: OR = 0.72, CI: 0.58–0.89; anxiety: OR = 0.73, CI: 0.61–0.87), and yogurt (depression: OR = 0.67, CI: 0.47–0.97; anxiety: OR = 0.54, CI: 0.4–0.73) were found to have protective effects on depression and anxiety. Higher fish consumption was associated with greater depression odds (OR = 1.54, CI: 1.18–2.04). Vegetables’ intake had an inverse relationship with anxiety (OR = 0.74, CI = 0.58–0.93) and stress (OR = 0.59, CI: 0.42–0.82). Fruits (OR = 0.6, CI: 0.43–0.85) and milk consumption (OR: 0.61, CI: 0.47–0.77) were found to have protective effects on stress. Conclusions: Egg, fruits, milk, yogurt, and vegetables’ consumption had an inverse relationship with psychiatric disorders; whereas, higher fish intake was associated with higher depression chance. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

94,"Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20[510] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2020-79766-001). An error was identified in the Results section of the Abstract. The updated result is provided in the erratum, with the changes highlighted in bold typeface.] Background: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18–65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth’s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/μl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation ( M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/μl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5–123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02–24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.

95,Prevalence and factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms among Palestinian medical students,"Background: Co-existence of depression and anxiety can be associated with severe detrimental consequences to the physical, mental and social wellbeing of the affected populations. This study was conducted to determine prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Palestinian medical students and to investigate associations between sociodemographic factors of the students with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: This study was conducted in a cross-sectional observational design using a questionnaire in the period between September 2018 and April 2019 in a major university in the West Bank of Palestine. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The questionnaire also collected the sociodemographic characteristics of the students. Reliability of the questionnaire was tested using the test re-test method. A total of 425 medical students were invited to participate in the study. Results: Of those invited, 286 students completed the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 67.3%. More than half (56.6%) of the students had minimal depression, 20.3% had mild depression, 14.0% had moderate depression, 9.1% had severe depression, 23.4% had no anxiety, 29.7% had mild to moderate anxiety, 25.5% had moderate to severe anxiety, and 21.3% had severe anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that academic stage ( p -value &lt; 0.01), Grade Point Average ( p -value &lt; 0.01), mental health status ( p -value &lt; 0.001), ever attempted suicide ( p -value &lt; 0.05), and religious commitment ( p -value &lt; 0.01) were predictors of BDI-II scores. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that academic stage ( p -value &lt; 0.05) and mental health status ( p -value &lt; 0.001) were predictors of BAI scores. Conclusions: Depressive and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among Palestinian medical students in a major university in the West Bank of Palestine. Interventions might be designed to improve self-rated mental health of medical students in their academic years, ameliorate study conditions, and provision of counseling services to improve spirituality might be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among medical students in Palestine. Future studies are still needed to investigate if these interventions could be useful in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms among Palestinian medical students.

96,Validity and reliability of social anxiety disorder diagnoses in the Swedish National Patient Register,"Background: Population-based administrative registers are often used for research purposes. However, their potential usefulness depends on the validity of the registered information. This study assessed the validity of the recorded codes for social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, in the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR). Methods: The personal identification numbers of 300 randomly selected individuals with a diagnosis of SAD recorded in the NPR were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The medical files of these individuals were then requested from clinics nationally. A total of 117 files were received and two independent raters reviewed each file to assess the presence or absence of SAD, according to the definition of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) and the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). When disagreements between the two raters were found, a third rater reviewed the file to establish a best estimate diagnosis. Positive predictive values (PPV) and agreement between the two initial raters (using Cohen’s kappa) were calculated. Additionally, raters completed the Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) rating scales for each file. Inter-rater agreement for the CGI-S and the GAF was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: After exclusion of files not containing sufficient information, 95 files were included in the analyses. Of these, 77 files (81.05%) were considered to be ‘true positive’ cases (PPV = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.72–0.88). Inter-rater agreement regarding the presence or absence of SAD was substantial (κ = 0.72). CGI-S and GAF scores indicated that patients were in the moderate range of severity and functional impairment. Inter-rater agreement for the CGI-S and the GAF was moderate to good (ICC = 0.72 and ICC = 0.82, respectively). Conclusions: The ICD-10 codes for SAD in the Swedish NPR are generally valid and reliable, but we recommend sensitivity analyses in future register-based studies to minimise the impact of potential diagnostic misclassification. Most patients were moderately severe and impaired, suggesting that results from register-based studies of SAD may be generalizable.

97,"Depression, anxiety and associated factors among housemaids working in Addis Ababa Ethiopia","Background: Housemaids are part of women with low socioeconomic status and most of them are migrant from rural to central part of Ethiopia, less educated, either with poor, separated, single or divorced family and/or dead parents. Housemaid may experience problems like depression and anxiety more than other groups of women. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and determinants of those problems among housemaids. Objective: To assess the magnitude and determinants of depression &amp; anxiety among housemaids in Addis Ababa; Ethiopia; 2018. Methods: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2018 among housemaids working in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Multistage sampling technique was applied with a total of 826 samples. Quantitative data was employed by using structured questionnaires. The collected data was coded, entered in to Epi-Info version 7 and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Descriptive, analytical statistical procedures; bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval was employed. The statistical significance was declared at p value &lt; 0.05. Results: This study enrolled 862 participants with response rate 99.5%, 99.5% refers to the number of people who actually completed the interview. The result showed prevalence of depression and anxiety among housemaids 27.5% and 32.3% respectively. Among all participants 44.6% (95% CI = 41.0 – 47.9) have mild, 18.5% (95% CI = 15.7 – 21.2) have moderate and 6.1% (95% CI = 4.5 – 7.8) have severe form of comorbid anxiety with depression. Depression (44.9%) and anxiety (41.9%) found more prevalent among the age group 16 to 20. In this study history of parental divorce, participant’s divorce, physical violence and sexual violence are positively associated. Other factors; being less educated and living with relatives; were associated negatively. Conclusion: The prevalence of Depression and Anxiety is found high among housemaid; its prevalence is more among age group 16 to 20 than other age groups. Violence, participant’s divorce, history of parental divorce and contraceptive use has positively associated with depression and anxiety.

98,A cross-sectional study on spouse and parent differences in caregiving experiences of people living with schizophrenia in rural China,"Background: Conflicting evidence exists on whether parent or spouse caregivers experience better outcomes when caring for family members with schizophrenia. The current study aims to examine relative caregiving experiences and impacts of spouse and parent caregivers for people living with schizophrenia (PLS) in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 264 community-dwelling primary family caregivers of PLS. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect information on family caregiving activities; negative caregiving impacts including objective and subjective burden, and caregiver psychological distress such as depression and anxiety; positive caregiving impacts including caregiving rewarding feelings, and family functioning for spouse and parent caregivers. Results: Both types of caregivers report engaging in similar caregiving activities and report comparable levels of objective burden. However, parent caregivers report significantly higher subjective burden than spouse caregivers ( b = 7.94, 95%CI:2.08, 13.80, P &lt; 0.01), which is also reflected in significantly higher depression ( b = 3.88, 95%CI:1.35, 6.41, P &lt; 0.01) and anxiety ( b = 2.53, 95%CI: 0.22, 4.84, P &lt; 0.05), and lower family functioning ( b = − 1.71, 95%CI: − 2.73, − 0.49, P &lt; 0.01). Despite these differences, both groups of caregivers report comparable rewarding feelings about caregiving. Conclusions: Our findings have implications for family caregivers globally, but especially for countries that adhere to Confucian cultural values and provide guidance for future family intervention programs. Such programs may do well to incorporate cultural values and beliefs in understanding caregiving and kinship family dynamics so as to support family caregivers, and in particular, the specific vulnerabilities of parent caregivers.

99,The impact of parental psychopathology and sociodemographic factors in selective mutism—A nationwide population-based study,"Background: Selective mutism (SM) is nowadays considered a relatively rare anxiety disorder characterized by children failing to speak in certain situations. Research on risk factors for SM are limited in comparison to other psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to examine several potential risk factors for SM in a large nationwide cohort, namely parental psychopathology, parental age, maternal SES, urbanicity, maternal marital status and parental immigration status. Methods: This nested case-control study comprised 860 cases with SM, identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register and 3250 controls matched for sex and age from the Finnish Central Population Register. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between the risk factors and SM. Results: If both parents had any psychiatric disorder, this almost tripled their odds of having a child with SM (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.0–4.0). There were increased rates of all types of psychiatric disorders in the parents of the children with SM, with a wider range of diagnoses among the mothers than fathers. Fathers over 35 years (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.8) were significantly more likely to have children with SM. Offspring of a single mother had a 2-fold (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–3.0) increased odds of SM than mothers who were married or in a relationship. Conclusions: Several parental psychiatric disorders were associated with offspring SM. This points towards a shared aetiology of psychiatric disorders. Findings on paternal age and single motherhood help to improve our understanding of risk factors for SM.

100,"Post traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in patients after intensive care unit discharge—A longitudinal cohort study from a LMIC tertiary care centre","Background: Data on intensive care unit (ICU) related psychiatric morbidity from Low Middle-Income Countries are sparse. We studied the ICU related posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety, and depression symptoms in a cohort of patients from Eastern India. Methods: We included adults admitted more than 24 h to a mixed ICU. PTSS, anxiety, and depression symptoms were assessed by telephonic or face to face interviews by using the Impact of Events-r (IES-r) and Hospital anxiety and depression (HADS), respectively, at 0, 7,14, 30, 90 and 180 days from ICU discharge. The loss to follow up was minimal. Demographic, socioeconomic, quality of life (QOL), and critical care related variables were studied. Results: Of 527 patients, 322 (59.4%) completed 6 months’ follow up. The majority were male (60%), mechanically ventilated &gt; 48 h (59.4%), mean age of 48 (+/− 16), mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) at admission 9.4 (+/− 4.6), median length of stay 3 (2–28 days). The rates of ICU related clinical PTSS was &lt; 1 and &lt; 3% for anxiety/depression at any point of follow up. Data were analyzed by linear mixed (random effects) models. There was a significant drop in all scores and association with repeated measures over time. Poor QOL at discharge from the ICU showed significant association with PTSS, anxiety, and depression (β = − 2.94, − 1.34, − 0.7 respectively) when corrected for gender and education levels. Younger age, greater severity of illness, and prior stressful life experiences predicted worse PTSS (β = − 0.02, 0.08, 3.82, respectively). Benzodiazepines and lower sedation scores (better alertness) predicted lower depression symptoms. (β = − 0.43, 0.37 respectively). Conclusion: ICU related psychiatric morbidity rates in our population are low compared with reported rates in the literature. Poor QOL at ICU discharge may predict worse long-term mental health outcomes. Further research on the impact of ICU and sociocultural factors on mental health outcomes in patients from different backgrounds is needed.

101,"Depression, anxiety, and associated factors in patients with diabetes: Evidence from the anxiety, depression, and personality traits in diabetes mellitus (ADAPT-DM) study","Background: Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric complications affecting patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and associated factors among Malaysian diabetic patients is scarce. The Anxiety, Depression, and Personality Traits in Diabetes Mellitus (ADAPT-DM) study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and their associated factors in the Malaysian diabetic population. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 300 diabetic patients via convenience sampling from the Endocrine outpatient clinic of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a tertiary referral healthcare facility in Kuala Lumpur. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical history were obtained from each participant. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was administered to assess anxiety symptoms, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depressive symptoms, the Big Five Inventory (BFI) to evaluate personality traits, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) to measure quality of life (QOL). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between various factors, and depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression was 20% ( n = 60) while anxiety was 9% ( n = 27). Co-morbid depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 9.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.63–37.14, p = 0.001) and neuroticism (adjusted OR = 11.66, 95% CI = 2.69–50.47, p = 0.001) increased the odds of developing anxiety, while conscientiousness (adjusted OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.23–0.80, p = 0.004) and greater psychological-related QOL (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.29–0.75, p = 0.002) were protective. Co-morbid anxiety (adjusted OR = 19.83, 95% CI = 5.63–69.92, p &lt; 0.001) increased the odds of depression, while older age (adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93–0.98, p = 0.002), social relationship-related QOL (adjusted OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71–.0.99, p = 0.047), and physical health-related QOL (adjusted OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.58–0.83, p &lt; 0.001) were protective. Conclusions: The study findings signify the need to screen for co-morbid depression and anxiety, as well as personality traits and QOL, and to include psychosocial interventions when planning a multidisciplinary approach to managing diabetes.

102,Severity and prevalence of various types of mental ill-health in a general adult population: Age and sex differences,"Background: Taking a broad approach, the aim of this study was to better understand severity and prevalence of various types of mental ill-health across age and sex groups in the general adult population. A first objective was to determine symptom severity of anxiety, depression, insomnia, burnout and somatization in combinations of different age groups and sex. A second objective was to determine prevalence of caseness of these types of mental ill-health in both absolute and relative terms in the combinations of age groups and sex. Methods: Cross-sectional data based on validated questionnaire instruments were used from the Västerbotten Environmental Health Study in Sweden. In total, 3406 participants, aged 18 to 79 years, constituted a random sample stratified for age and sex. Results: Severity and prevalence of anxiety, insomnia and burnout were high in women, in particular young women, and lower in older age groups. The prevalence rates for insomnia, burnout and somatization were particularly high based on the used cut-off scores. Men aged 30–49 years had the highest prevalence of mental ill-health compared to other age groups among men. Men and women aged 60–69 years had generally the lowest symptom severity and caseness. The prevalence of depression was similar in men and women in all age groups, whereas sex-related differences in extent in general were largest in the youngest age group, and gradually decreased with age. Conclusion: The results suggest that focus in primary healthcare regarding mental ill-health should to be directed more towards insomnia, burnout and somatization, in particular in young women.

103,The biological classification of mental disorders (BeCOME) study: A protocol for an observational deep-phenotyping study for the identification of biological subtypes,"Background: A major research finding in the field of Biological Psychiatry is that symptom-based categories of mental disorders map poorly onto dysfunctions in brain circuits or neurobiological pathways. Many of the identified (neuro) biological dysfunctions are “transdiagnostic”, meaning that they do not reflect diagnostic boundaries but are shared by different ICD/DSM diagnoses. The compromised biological validity of the current classification system for mental disorders impedes rather than supports the development of treatments that not only target symptoms but also the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The Biological Classification of Mental Disorders (BeCOME) study aims to identify biology-based classes of mental disorders that improve the translation of novel biomedical findings into tailored clinical applications. Methods: BeCOME intends to include at least 1000 individuals with a broad spectrum of affective, anxiety and stress-related mental disorders as well as 500 individuals unaffected by mental disorders. After a screening visit, all participants undergo in-depth phenotyping procedures and omics assessments on two consecutive days. Several validated paradigms (e.g., fear conditioning, reward anticipation, imaging stress test, social reward learning task) are applied to stimulate a response in a basic system of human functioning (e.g., acute threat response, reward processing, stress response or social reward learning) that plays a key role in the development of affective, anxiety and stress-related mental disorders. The response to this stimulation is then read out across multiple levels. Assessments comprise genetic, molecular, cellular, physiological, neuroimaging, neurocognitive, psychophysiological and psychometric measurements. The multilevel information collected in BeCOME will be used to identify data-driven biologically-informed categories of mental disorders using cluster analytical techniques. Discussion: The novelty of BeCOME lies in the dynamic in-depth phenotyping and omics characterization of individuals with mental disorders from the depression and anxiety spectrum of varying severity. We believe that such biology-based subclasses of mental disorders will serve as better treatment targets than purely symptom-based disease entities, and help in tailoring the right treatment to the individual patient suffering from a mental disorder. BeCOME has the potential to contribute to a novel taxonomy of mental disorders that integrates the underlying pathomechanisms into diagnoses.

However, the association between adults with IDA and psychiatric disorders has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychiatric disorder morbidity of an IDA group in comparison with a non-IDA group and to examine the risk of psychiatric disorders in IDA patients treated with iron supplementation. Methods: All study subjects were 20 years of age or over with newly diagnosed IDA enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2012. We matched IDA and non-IDA subjects according to age and gender in a 1:2 ratio. Our primary outcome was diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the patients were monitored until the end of 2013. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to explore the risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with IDA after adjustment for confounders, including demographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results: The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of psychiatric disorders was 1.52 (95% CI = 1.45–1.59) in the IDA group compared with the non-IDA group. Among the different types of psychiatric disorders, the IDA group was associated with significantly higher incidence and risks of anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and psychotic disorders ( p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, iron supplementation in IDA subjects was associated with a significantly lower risk of psychiatric disorders compared to non-iron supplementation in IDA patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that IDA subjects had an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, regardless of other confounders. In IDA patients, iron supplementation was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, IDA patients receiving iron supplementation also had a lower risk of sleep disorders.

105,"Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 as a potential marker for MDD diagnosis, its clinical characteristics, and treatment efficacy validation: Data from an open-label vortioxetine study","Background: IGF-1 is an essential neurotrophin produced peripherally and in the brain. Impairments in the brain IGF-1 concentrations might be responsible for some aspects of major depressive disorder (MDD) pathogenesis, whereas peripheral IGF-1 could have the marker value. We aimed: 1) to compare serum IGF-1 levels in MDD patients and healthy controls (HC); 2) to elucidate possible associations between changes in IGF-1 expression and crucial characteristics of the current depressive episode, MDD course; 3) to evaluate IGF-1 dynamics after 8 weeks` vortioxetine treatment. Methods: Seventy-eight MDD patients (according to DSM-5) and 47 HC were enrolled. Serum IGF-1, psychopathological (MADRS, CGI) and neuropsychological parameters (PDQ-5, RAVLT, TMT-B, DSST) were analyzed in all subjects at admission and 48 patients after 8 weeks` vortioxetine treatment. AUC-ROCs were calculated to determine if the value of serum IGF-1 could separate MDD patients from HC. Multiple regression models were performed to explore relationships between IGF-1 and depressive episode’s symptoms. Results: MDD patients had significantly higher serum IGF-1 levels than HC (228 (183–312) ng/ml vs 153 (129–186) ng/ml, p &lt; 0.0001). IGF-1 had a good diagnostic value for predicting MDD in the whole sample with AUC of 0.820 ( p &lt; 0.0001). For a cutoff of 178.00 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 83 and 71%, respectively, and the number needed to misdiagnose was 5, indicating that only 1 of 5 tests give an invalid result. Among MADRS items, only reported sadness, inner tension, and concentration difficulties were significantly positively associated with serum IGF-1 concentrations. Vortioxetine treatment significantly attenuated IGF-1 levels and improved all psychopathological, neuropsychological parameters. Conclusions: Significant associations between IGF-1 levels and hypothymia, anxiety, and cognitive disturbances may indicate a pathogenic role of IGF-1 for the mentioned symptoms. We assume that the activity of the cerebral-hepatic axis increases in response to insufficient IGF-1 brain expression in MDD patients, whereas, vortioxetine treatment restores cerebral IGF-1 concentrations and, consequently, decreases its compensatory production by the liver.

106,Is body image a predictor of women’s depression and anxiety in postmenopausal women?,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20[278] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2020-40922-001). In the original article, the authors identified a mistake in the last author’s name. Originally published name: Fatemeh Rahnemaie, Correct name: Fatemeh Alsadat Rahnemaei. The original article has been corrected.] Background: Women in perimenopausal and postmenopausal period are at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Physiologic changes in menopause can change body’s appearance and function that may disturb body and then lead to anxiety and depression. This study aims to assess the relationship between body image with anxiety and depression among postmenopausal women. Methods: This descriptive study was performed on 307 women attending to the health centers in Tehran- Iran. Sampling was performed by a multi-staged randomized method. Data were collected by using Beck Depression questionnaire, Spielberger Anxiety Questionnaire, Fisher Body Image Questionnaire and Socio-demographic questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 and using t-test, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests and multiple linear regression methods. Results: The average age of the participants was 55.19 ± 4.034 years. Mean scores for body image, anxiety and depression were 163.26 ± 20.38, 12.00 ± 7.71 and 42.70 ± 8.40 respectively. Fifty five percent of women had mild to severe depression and 83.7% of them had mild to severe anxiety. Total score and all domains of body image had a negative correlation with depression and anxiety scores ( P &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear correlation showed that body image is a predictor for depression and anxiety (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Body image of women can be effective on occurrence of depression and anxiety in menopause. Therefore, women’s health policies should consider body image to control cognitive problems including depression and anxiety in menopause.

107,Evaluation of an internet-based intervention for service members of the German armed forces with deployment-related posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Background: The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a therapist-guided internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention for service members of the German Armed Forces with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The iCBT was adapted from Interapy, a trauma-focused evidence-based treatment based on prolonged exposure and cognitive restructuring. It lasted for 5 weeks and included 10 writing assignments (twice a week). The program included a reminder function if assignments were overdue, but no multimedia elements. Therapeutic written feedback was provided asynchronously within one working day. Methods: Male active and former military service members were recruited from the German Armed Forces. Diagnoses were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Psychopathology was assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month followup. Severity of PTSD was the primary outcome and anxiety was the secondary outcome. Participants were randomly allocated to a treatment group that received iCBT immediately or to a waitlist group that received iCBT after 6 weeks. Due to the overall small sample size ( n = 37), the two groups were collapsed for the statistical analyses. Change during the intervention period was investigated using latent-change score models. Results: Improvements in the CAPS-5 were small and not statistically significant. For anxiety, small significant improvements were observed from pre- to follow-up assessment. The dropout rate was 32.3%. Conclusions: The low treatment utilization and the high dropout rate are in line with previous findings on treatment of service members. The interpretation of the current null results for the efficacy of iCBT is limited due to the small sample size, however for military samples effect estimates were also smaller in other recent studies. Our results demonstrate the need to identify factors influencing treatment engagement and efficacy in veterans.

108,Anxiety symptoms and burnout among Chinese medical staff of intensive care unit: The moderating effect of social support,"Background: Social support can be a critical resource to help medical staff cope with stressful events; however, the moderating effect of social support on the relationship between burnout and anxiety symptoms has not yet been explored. Methods: The final sample was comprised of 514 intensive care unit physicians and nurses in this cross-sectional study. Questionnaires were used to collect data. A moderated model was used to test the effect of social support. Results: The moderating effect of social support was found to be significant (b = − 0.06, p = 0.04, 95%CI [− 0.12, − 0.01]). The Johnson-Neyman technique indicated that when social support scores were above 4.26 among intensive care unit medical staff, burnout was not related to anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: This is the first study to test the moderating effect of social support on the relationship between burnout and anxiety symptoms among intensive care unit staff.

109,Life review therapy for Holocaust survivors (LRT-HS): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: The Holocaust was one of the most traumatic catastrophes in recorded human history. Survivors seeking psychotherapeutic help today, now in their seventies and older, often show symptoms of a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or prolonged grief disorder. Established psychological treatments for PTSD (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy, psychodynamic therapies) have been tested and assessed mainly with young and middle-aged adults; only very few studies examined them in old age. There is no therapy outcome study known to us for any treatment mode for Holocaust survivors. Moreover, there is a need for an age group-specific treatment of PTSD and other stress-related mental disorders. A narrative approach including life-review and narrative exposure seems to meet very well the natural need of older people to review their lives and is highly effective. However, most studies on the efficacy of life review therapy (LRT) focus on late-life depression. There is a lack of efficacy studies evaluating the effect of LRT on PTSD symptoms in older individuals that have experienced traumatic events. Methods: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of LRT for Holocaust survivors (LRT-HS) on symptoms of PTSD and related mental health problems (depression, anxiety, prolonged grief), compared to a supportive control group. A secondary goal is to identify the characteristics of participants that seem to especially benefit from the treatment. The proposed study is a randomised, controlled follow-up trial including Holocaust survivors with one or more trauma-related disorders. The LRT treatment consists of 20–25 sessions. Before and after the treatment phase, participants in both conditions will be assessed. Follow-up will take place 6 months after the treatment. A sample size of 80 is required (drop-out rate included). Discussion: Efficacious treatments for trauma-related disorders in older people are of high importance, also because the probability of traumatisation and loss increases with age. Because this study is conducted with this specific group of multiply traumatised people, we are convinced that the results can easily transfer to other samples.

110,"Association of ADHD symptoms, depression and suicidal behaviors with anxiety in Chinese medical college students","Background: Anxiety is one of the most common psychiatric disorder and imposes a great burden on both the individual and the society. Previous studies indicate a high comorbidity of anxiety disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, few studies have examined the comorbidity of anxiety and ADHD among medical college students in mainland China. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety and the associated risk factor of anxiety disorder as well as to explore the association between ADHD symptoms, depression, suicidal behaviors and anxiety. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed among 4882 medical college students who were recruited and enrolled with convenience sampling. Self-reported demographic information and clinical characteristics were collected online on a computer or through a social media app named Wechat. Results: The prevalence of anxiety in this study was 19.9%. Students with anxiety were more likely to have a poor relationship with parents, be of Han nationality, have smoking or drinking habits, have an extensive physical disorder history and have engaged in suicidal behaviors. The independent risk factors for anxiety were: smoking, physical disorder history, suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, inattention and hyperactivity. Significant associations were observed between anxiety and depression, inattention, hyperactivity, suicide plans and suicide attempts. Conclusions: Nearly one in five medical students suffered from anxiety. The findings of this study indicate the importance of addressing both anxiety and ADHD symptoms in order to better promote mental health and the well-being of medical students as well as reduce suicidal behaviors.

111,"Reliability, validity and cut-off score of the Chinese version of the panic disorder severity scale self-report form in patients with panic disorder","Background: Panic disorder (PD) is often undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or untreated in non-psychiatric clinical settings. Therefore, a cost-effective, accurate and easy-to-administer instrument for PD assessment is still needed. For that reason, the self-report version of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS-SR) has been developed and suggested to be a reliable and useful tool in clinical and research settings. The current study aims to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the PDSS-SR and determine the cut-off score of the PDSS-SR. Methods: A total of 133 patients with PD in Shanghai were assessed by the PDSS-SR, PDSS and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Moreover, 117 patients with non-PD anxiety and 51 healthy subjects also completed the PDSS-SR to construct a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the scores of PD patients. Results: The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of the PDSS-SR was 0.72–0.80, and the interrater correlation coefficient was 0.78. The results of principal component analysis and varimax rotation indicated that the PDSS-SR had a two-factor structure, with all seven items having salient loadings. The cut-off score was 4, which was associated with high sensitivity (96.03%) and specificity (61.31%). Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that these items and the total score of the PDSS-SR have acceptable reliability and validity in patients with PD and that the PDSS-SR can be used by general doctors for clinical screening in China.

112,"Minocycline as adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant depression: Study protocol for a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (MINDEP2)","Background: Available evidence suggests that adjunctive treatment with immunomodulatory medications may be effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). A pilot trial of the tetracycline minocycline as adjunctive treatment in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), produced promising results, however, a larger scale trial is needed to confirm the antidepressant actions of this drug. Methods: This is a 12-week double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of minocycline as an add-on to standard antidepressants for adults (age &gt; 18) with DSM-5 major depressive episode, who have failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressant treatment. It is a parallel-arm study with 50 participants in each group. The primary outcome measure is change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17) total scores from baseline to week 12. Secondary measures include the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Version (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers will be collected at baseline, week 6 and 12. Discussion: If minocycline is well tolerated and effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with TRD, it would warrant genuine consideration as a treatment option for TRD. Additionally, if results demonstrate that minocycline has antidepressant properties, and that changes in inflammatory status are associated with its antidepressant action, it will inform the development of individualized treatment for a subset of patients with MDD.

113,Rapid and temporary improvement of depression and anxiety observed following niraparib administration: A case report,"Background: Cancer patients are disproportionately affected by generalized anxiety and major depression. For many, current treatments for these conditions are ineffective. In this case report, we present a serendipitous case of anxiety and depression improvement following administration of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib. Case presentation: A 61-year old woman with a 20-year history of mild depression developed recurrent ovarian carcinoma and was placed on niraparib for maintenance chemotherapy. With the original onset of ovarian cancer, she experienced an episode of major depression that was resolved with sertraline. After recurrence of ovarian cancer, she experienced a recurrence of major depression and a new onset of generalized anxiety that failed to completely respond to multiple medications. After beginning niraparib therapy the patient noticed a rapid resolution of the symptoms of her anxiety and depression, an effect that was limited to 10–14 days. Due to bone marrow suppression, the patient was taken off and restarted on niraparib several times. Each discontinuation of niraparib resulted in return of her depression and anxiety, while each recontinuation of niraparib resulted in an improvement in her mood and anxiety. Conclusions: This case demonstrates rapid and temporary improvement of anxiety and depression following niraparib administration. There is ample preclinical data that PARP signaling may play a role in psychiatric illness. A small amount of indirect data from clinical trials also shows that niraparib may have psychiatric benefits. Further research on PARP inhibition and its potential psychoactive effects is sorely needed.

114,"Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress in patients with multiple sclerosis in Kermanshah-Iran: A cross-sectional study","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that decreases the physical ability and affects the mental health of the patients. This descriptive-analytical study investigated the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in MS patients. Methods: A total of 87 MS patients were recruited in this study through simple random sampling method using a random number table. Data were collected by Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics. Results: The mean age of the patients was 35.5 ± 9.2 years. Of them, 41 (47.1%) had moderate depression, 34 (39.1%) had moderate anxiety, and 39 (44.8%) had moderate stress. There was a significant relationship between depression and job, education, and economic status of the participants. There was also a significant association between the participants’ economic status and anxiety. There was no significant relationship between stress and any of the variables. Conclusion: Given the relatively high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress in MS patients as well as the significant relationship between their economic status and depression and anxiety, interventional measures are required to be taken to decrease their problems and to provide a favorable ground for their employment. Periodic examinations by psychologists / psychiatrists and treatment of patients with symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression are also essential.

115,Explicit and implicit attachment and the outcomes of acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for depression,"Background: Attachment theory predicts that patients who are not securely attached may benefit less from psychological treatment. However, evidence on the predictive role of attachment in the effectiveness of treatment for depression is limited. Methods: Explicit attachment styles, levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, as well as implicit relational self-esteem and implicit relational anxiety were assessed in 67 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) receiving Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). ANOVA and hierarchical regression analyses were performed to investigate the predictive power of explicit and implicit attachment measures on treatment outcome. Results: Explicit attachment avoidance at pre-treatment significantly predicted reduction of depressive symptoms following treatment. Reductions in attachment anxiety and avoidance from pre- to post-treatment predicted better treatment outcomes. Neither one of the implicit measures, nor change in these measures from pre- tot posttreatment significantly predicted treatment outcome. Conclusions: Our findings show that attachment avoidance as well as reductions in avoidant and anxious attachment predict symptom reduction after psychological treatment for depression. Future research should use larger sample sizes to further examine the role of attachment orientation as moderator and mediator of treatment outcome.

116,Current heterosexual marriage is associated with significantly decreased levels of anxiety symptoms among Chinese men who have sex with men,"Background: The high heterosexual marriage rate could be a ‘double-edge’ sword for the emotional health of Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). The aim of this study was to determine if current marriage and breakdown of marriage (divorce) have different effects on the mental health of Chinese MSM. Methods: Eight hundred seven MSM were recruited using respondent-driven sampling from four cities in northeastern China. Gay-related stressful events (GRSE) were measured using the Gay Related Stressful Life Events Scale; social support was measured by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS); and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), respectively. Results: Of the study participants, 13.4% were married to women and 4.5% were divorced. The rates of marriage or divorce were 35.3 and 75.8% for participants 30–39 and &gt; 40 years of age, respectively. The current married MSM had the highest SDS (50.0 ± 10.9) and SSRS (35.8 ± 8.6) levels, but the lowest SAS (38.7 ± 12.1) levels. Divorced MSM had the highest SAS (44.4 ± 9.6) and lowest SSRS (30.8 ± 8.1) levels. Age, GESE number, and HIV infection were predictors for SDS and SAS, and current marriage was associated with significantly decreased level of SAS (β = − 0.136, P = 0.001) based on multiple linear analysis. Conclusions: Current marriage is associated with significantly decreased levels of anxiety symptoms among Chinese MSM. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of different marriage status on the emotional distress of Chinese MSM.

117,Sleep quality improves during treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with cocaine use disorder: A retrospective observational study,"Background: Sleep disturbance is a prominent and common complaint in people with cocaine use disorder (CUD), either during intake or withdrawal. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown promise as a treatment for CUD. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between self-perceived sleep quality and cocaine use pattern variables in outpatients with CUD undergoing an rTMS protocol targeted at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study including 87 patients diagnosed with CUD according to the DSM-5 criteria. Scores in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Symptoms checklist 90-Revised (outcome used: Global Severity Index, GSI) were recorded at baseline, and after 5, 30, 60, and 90 days of rTMS treatment. Cocaine use was assessed by self-report and regular urine screens. Results: Sleep disturbances (PSQI scores &gt; 5) were common in patients at baseline (mean ± SD; PSQI score baseline: 9.24 ± 3.89; PSQI &gt; 5 in 88.5% of patients). PSQI scores significantly improved after rTMS treatment (PSQI score Day 90: 6.12 ± 3.32). Significant and consistent improvements were also seen in craving and in negative-affect symptoms compared to baseline. Considering the lack of a control group, in order to help the conceptualization of the outcomes, we compared the results to a wait-list group (n = 10). No significant improvements were observed in the wait-list group in any of the outcome measures. Conclusions: The present findings support the therapeutic role of rTMS interventions for reducing cocaine use and accompanying symptoms such as sleep disturbance and negative-affect symptoms.

118,Efficacy of a self-applied online program to promote resilience and coping skills in university students in four Spanish-speaking countries: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: There is evidence of a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students. Therefore, college time is a key period where prevention of mental disorders through interventions that promote resilience and mental health can be relevant. Currently, there are interventions available, but these are insufficient for those who need them. Online interventions are tools that can facilitate global accessibility and are easy for young people to use. CORE (Cultivating Our Resilience) is a self-administered online program, based on Ryff’s psychological well-being model, to promote resilience and coping skills in university students at risk of developing symptoms of depression or anxiety. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention protocol in comparison with an active control condition targeting healthy lifestyle, and a waiting list control condition. The study will be conducted in four populations of Spanish-speaking university students (Spain, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico). Methods: The study design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At least 324 university students will be randomly assigned to three conditions: 1) CORE, a 6-week training program to improve resilience; 2) HLP, a 6-week training to promote a healthy lifestyle; and 3) WL, waiting list control condition. The primary outcome measure will be the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. Additionally, measures of anxiety, depression, quality of life and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, incomes, marital status, among others) will be collected. Participants will be evaluated at pre-treatment, after each module, 6 weeks after allocation, and at 3-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed. Discussion: The results of this study will contribute to research on Internet-administered interventions and the implementation of a protocol that includes a series of components designed to improve resilience and coping skills, increase psychological well-being, and prevent depression and anxiety disorders in Spanish-speaking university students. In addition, avenues will be opened up for new research on the effectiveness of these interventions focused on the prevention and promotion of mental health in Spanish-speaking countries.

119,Comparison of neurocognitive changes among newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients with and without dysglycaemia,"Background: Diabetes often occurs together with tuberculosis (TB) and both may affect each other negatively. Diabetes may be associated with neurocognitive dysfunctioning in affected patients and may negatively impact treatment adherence and outcomes. This study compared the neurocognitive status between newly diagnosed smear positive tuberculosis patients with dysglycaemia and those with normoglycaemia. Methods: The current study was a cross-sectional study involving one hundred and forty-six (146) newly diagnosed smear positive TB patients. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and the results were categorized as either normoglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or diabetes.Neurocognitive functioning among study participants was assessed at the time of TB diagnosis using Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ), Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (QLI). Results: he mean age of the participants ( n = 146) was 38.7 years with 78.8% being males and 21.2% females. Using the fasting blood glucose test, the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and diabetes were 5.5 and 3.4% respectively, both representing a total of 13 out of the 146 participants; whilst the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes using 2-h post-glucose values were 28.8 and 11.6% respectively, both representing a total of 59 out of the 146 participants.There were no significant differences in the mean scores on the neurocognitive measures between the dysglaycaemia and normoglycamic groups using fasting plasma glucose (FPG). However, there were significant differences in the mean scores between the dysglycaemia and normal groups using 2-h postprandial (2HPP) glucose values on Phobic Anxiety (Normal, Mean = 0.38 ± 0.603; dysglycaemia, Mean = 0.23 ± 0.356; p = 0.045), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (17.26 ± 5.981 vs. 15.04 ± 5.834, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Newly diagnosed smear positive patients with dysglycaemia were associated with significantly lower mean cognitive scores and scores on phobic anxiety than those with normoglyacaemia. The latter finding must be further explored.

120,“Objectively terrifying”: A qualitative study of youth’s experiences of transitions out of child and adolescent mental health services at age 18,"Background: Mental health issues presenting in childhood often persist into adulthood, usually requiring youth to transition from child and adolescent mental health services to adult mental health services at 18 years. Discontinuity of care during this transition period is well-documented and can leave youth vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes. There is growing recognition of the need to improve transition-related care for youth leaving the child and adolescent mental health system. However, the perspectives and experiences of youth have not always been forefront in these discussions, and in particular, the perspectives of youth in the pre-transition period. This study qualitatively explores transition-related knowledge and experiences of youth both prior-to and after transition. Methods: A purposive sample of youth aged 16–19 years was recruited from two child and adolescent mental health programs. Youth were enrolled as part of a longitudinal follow-up study and had the opportunity to opt into this study. Interviews were transcribed and coded using NVivo11 software. Main themes were distilled through descriptive analysis following the principles of directed content analysis. The study followed the principles of participatory action research, engaging youth with lived experience navigating transitions in each stage of the study. Results: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 pre-transition and 8 post-transition youth. All youth reported having either a mood and/or anxiety disorder for which the majority were receiving treatment at the time of the interview. The participants’ experiences were distilled into six major themes. Youth advocated for being considered partners in transition planning and to have increased control over transition-related decisions. Youth also made specific recommendations on how to improve continuity of care during the transition process. Conclusions: Transition planning should be individualized for each youth based on their developmental needs, transition readiness and ongoing mental health needs. Transition pathways, co-designed with youth and caregivers, should be developed to guide providers in transition best practices. Obtaining both the pre- and post-transition experiences of youth is crucial for developing a more complete of understanding of youth perspectives and implementing guidelines that improve transition quality and experiences.

The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of these three anxieties dimensions and to quantify the relevance of specific fears particularly associated with anesthesia. Methods: This study was part of a cross-sectional survey in patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery. Anxiety levels were measured with the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). Modified numeric rating scales (mNRS, range 0–10) were used to assess the severity of eight selected specific fears which were predominantly analyzed descriptively. Multivariate stepwise linear regression was applied to determine independent predictors of all three anxiety dimensions (APAIS anxiety subscales). Results: 3087 of the 3200 enrolled patients were analyzed. Mean (SD) total preoperative anxiety (APAIS-A-T, range 4–20) was 9.9 (3.6). High anxiety (APAIS-A-T &gt; 10) was reported by 40.5% of subjects. Mean (SD) levels of concern regarding the eight studied specific fears ranged from 3.9 (3.08) concerning “Anesthesiologist error” to 2.4 (2.29) concerning “Fatigue and drowsiness” with an average of 3.2 (2.84) concerning all specific fears. Ranking of all specific fears according to mean mNRS scores was almost identical in patients with high versus those with low anxiety. Among nine independent predictors of anxiety, only 3 variables (female gender, negative and positive anesthetic experience) independently predicted all three APAIS anxiety subscales. Other variables had a selective impact on one or two APAIS anxiety subscales only. Female gender had the strongest impact on all three APAIS anxiety subscales. Adjusted r2 values of the three models were all below 13%.ConclusionsThe high variability of importance assigned to all specific fears suggests an individualized approach is advisable when support of anxious patients is intended. Considering independent predictors of anxiety to estimate each patient’s anxiety level is of limited use given the very low predictive capacity of all three models. The clinical benefit of dividing patients into those with high and low anxiety is questionable.Trial registrationGerman Registry of Clinical Trials (DRKS00016725), retrospectively registered.

122,Recognizing states of psychological vulnerability to suicidal behavior: A Bayesian network of artificial intelligence applied to a clinical sample,"Background: This study aimed to determine conditional dependence relationships of variables that contribute to psychological vulnerability associated with suicide risk. A Bayesian network (BN) was developed and applied to establish conditional dependence relationships among variables for each individual subject studied. These conditional dependencies represented the different states that patients could experience in relation to suicidal behavior (SB). The clinical sample included 650 mental health patients with mood and anxiety symptomatology. Results: Mainly indicated that variables within the Bayesian network are part of each patient’s state of psychological vulnerability and have the potential to impact such states and that these variables coexist and are relatively stable over time. These results have enabled us to offer a tool to detect states of psychological vulnerability associated with suicide risk. Conclusion: If we accept that suicidal behaviors (vulnerability, ideation, and suicidal attempts) exist in constant change and are unstable, we can investigate what individuals experience at specific moments to become better able to intervene in a timely manner to prevent such behaviors. Future testing of the tool developed in this study is needed, not only in specialized mental health environments but also in other environments with high rates of mental illness, such as primary healthcare facilities and educational institutions.

123,"""Study protocol for a randomized control trial to investigate the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) transdiagnostic group intervention for primary care patients"": Correction","Reports an error in ""Study protocol for a randomized control trial to investigate the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) transdiagnostic group intervention for primary care patients"" by Sarah Frances, Frances Shawyer, Bruno Cayoun, Joanne Enticott and Graham Meadows ( BMC Psychiatry , 2020[Jan][6], Vol 20[7]). In the original article, one of the authors names has been incorrectly spelled. Sarah Frances should be Sarah Francis. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-01228-001). Background: Effective transdiagnostic treatments for patients presenting with principal or comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression enable more efficient provision of mental health care and may be particularly suitable for the varied population seen in primary healthcare settings. Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) is a transdiagnostic intervention that integrates aspects of CBT, including exposure skills targeting avoidance, with training in mindfulness meditation skills adopted from the Vipassana or insight tradition taught by the Burmese teachers U Ba Khin and Goenka. MiCBT is distinguished from both cognitive therapy and mindfulnessbased cognitive therapy by the use of a theoretical framework which proposes that the locus of reinforcement of behavior is the interoceptive experience (body sensations) that co-arises with self-referential thinking. Consequently, MiCBT has a strong focus on body scanning to develop interoceptive awareness and equanimity. Designed for clinical purposes, the four-stage systemic approach of MiCBT, comprising intra-personal (Stage 1) exposure (Stage 2), interpersonal (Stage 3), and empathic (Stage 4) skillsets, is a distinguishing feature among other mindfulnessbased interventions (MBIs). The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how group MiCBT decreases depression and anxiety symptoms for patients with a range of common mental health conditions. Methods: Participants ( n = 120) recruited via medical practitioner referral will be randomized to MiCBT or a wait-list control. Inclusion criteria are age 18–75; fluent in English and having a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score of 20 or more. The MiCBT treatment group receive an 8-week MiCBT intervention delivered in a private psychology practice. Participants complete a suite of online self-report measures and record the amount of meditation practice undertaken each week. The control group receive usual treatment and complete the measures at the same time points. Primary outcome measures are the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and K10. Analysis will use mixed-model repeated measures. Discussion: The potential ability of MiCBT to provide a comprehensive therapeutic system that is applicable across diagnostic groups would make it an attractive addition to the available MBIs.

124,The effect of dialectical behaviour therapy in autism spectrum patients with suicidality and/ or self-destructive behaviour (DIASS): Study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"Background: Many persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are treated in long-term specialised care. In this population, suicidal behaviour troubles patients, families, and specialists in the field because it is difficult to treat. At present, there is no documented effective therapy for suicidal behaviour in ASD (Autism Research 7:507-521, 2014; Crisis 35:301-309, 2014). Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an efficacious treatment programme for chronically suicidal and/or self-harm behaviour in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (J Psychiatry 166:1365-1374, 2014; Linehan MM. Cognitive behavioural therapy of borderline personality disorder. 1993). This study will evaluate the efficacy of DBT in persons with ASD and suicidal/ self- destructive behaviour in a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. Method: One hundred twenty-eight persons with autism and suicidal and/or self-harming behaviour will be recruited from specialised mental healthcare services and randomised into two conditions: 1) the DBT condition in which the participants have weekly individual cognitive behavioural therapy sessions and a 2.5 h skills training group session twice per week during 6 months, and 2) the treatment as usual condition which consists of weekly individual therapy sessions of 30–45 min with a psychotherapist or social worker. Assessments will take place at baseline, at post-treatment (6 months), and after a follow-up period of 12 months. The mediators will also be assessed at 3 months. The primary outcome is the level of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The secondary outcomes are anxiety and social performance, depression, core symptoms of ASD, quality of life, and cost-utility. Emotion regulation and therapeutic alliance are hypothesised to mediate the effects on the primary outcome. Discussion: The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the efficacy of DBT treatment in persons with ASD on suicidal and self-harming behaviour. The study is conducted in routine mental health services which enhances the generalisability of the study results to clinical practice.

125,"Clinical judgement, case complexity and symptom scores as predictors of outcome in depression: An exploratory analysis","Background: Clinical guidelines for depression in adults recommend the use of outcome measures and stepped care models in routine care. Such measures are based on symptom severity, but response to treatment is likely to also be influenced by personal and contextual factors. This observational study of a routine clinical sample sought to examine the extent to which “symptom severity measures” and “complexity measures” assess different aspects of patient experience, and how they might relate to clinical outcomes, including disengagement from treatment. Methods: Subjects with symptoms of depression (with or without comorbid anxiety) were recruited from people referred to an established Primary Care Mental Health Team using a stepped care model. Each participant completed three baseline symptom measures (the Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD) and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE-10)), and two assessments of “case complexity” (the Minnesota-Edinburgh Complexity Assessment Measure (MECAM) and a local complexity assessment). Clinician perception of likely completion of treatment and patient recovery was also assessed. Outcome measures were drop out and clinical improvement on the PHQ. Results: 298 subjects were recruited to the study, of whom 258 had a sufficient dataset available for analysis. Data showed that the three measures of symptom severity used in this study (PHQ, GAD and CORE-10) seemed to be measuring distinct characteristics from those associated with the measures of case complexity (MECAM, previous and current problem count). Higher symptom severity scores were correlated with improved outcomes at the end of treatment, but there was no association between outcome and complexity measures. Clinicians could predict participant drop-out from care with some accuracy, but had no ability to predict outcome from treatment. Conclusions: These results highlight the extent to which drop-out complicates recovery from depression with or without anxiety in real-world settings, and the need to consider other factors beyond symptom severity in planning care. The findings are discussed in relation to a growing body of literature investigating prognostic indicators in the context of models of collaborative care for depression.

126,Bouldering psychotherapy is more effective in the treatment of depression than physical exercise alone: Results of a multicentre randomised controlled intervention study,"Background: Recent scientific studies have suggested that climbing/bouldering is effective in alleviating depression when the comparison group was a waitlist control group, even when physical activity and other therapeutic approaches were controlled for. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a manualised psychotherapeutic bouldering intervention for depressed individuals, compared with an active control group performing physical exercise alone. Methods: In a multicentre randomised controlled intervention trial, 133 outpatients with depression were assigned to either a bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) group or a home-based supervised exercise programme (EP). Severity of depression as the primary outcome was assessed at baseline and directly after a ten-week intervention period using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes included anxiety, coping skills, self-esteem, body image, and interpersonal sensitivity. We applied t-tests to test for differences within the groups (t0 vs. t1) and between the BPT and the EP and a multiple regression analysis with the post-intervention MADRS score as the dependent variable. The robustness of estimates was investigated with a sensitivity analyses. Results: Patients in the BPT group showed a significantly larger decrease in depression scores compared with the EP on the MADRS (drop of 8.4 vs. 3.0 points, p = .002, Cohen’s d = 0.55). In the confounder-adjusted regression analyses, group allocation was found to be the only significant predictor of the post-intervention MADRS score (β = − 5.60, p = .001) besides the baseline MADRS score. Further significant differences in change scores between the BPT and the EP were found for anxiety ( p = .046, d = 0.35), body image ( p = .018, d = 0.42), and global self-esteem ( p = .011, d = 0.45). Conclusions: The study provides evidence that the manualised BPT is not only effective in alleviating depressive symptoms but even goes beyond the effect of mere physical exercise. Based on these findings, the BPT should be considered as a complementary therapeutic approach.

127,Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based intervention versus relaxation to reduce emotional exhaustion in medical students in France: The “Must prevent” study,"Background: Medical students are exposed to an emotionally exhausting training/work environment and to stressful academic demands. Consequently, psychopathologies, burnout and suicidal ideation are frequent in this population. These factors can also affect their empathy and quality of care. Therefore, the development and implementation of programs to promote resilience to stress specifically in medical students and the evaluation of their efficiency are a priority. Here, we describe the protocol of the first French study to assess the long-term effectiveness and acceptability of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) compared with relaxation training (RT) to reduce emotional exhaustion in medical students. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial (“Must prevent”) plans to enroll 612 students in the fourth and fifth year of medical studies from nine French universities. After inclusion, they will be assigned randomly to the MBI or RT group. Both interventions are structured around an 8-week program that includes one group class per week and daily at-home exercises. The primary endpoint is the emotional exhaustion score assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory at month 12 of the follow-up. Secondary endpoints include anxiety-depressive symptomatology, suicidality, psychoactive substance use, depersonalization, psychological and physical pain, empathy, emotional regulation, self-compassion, mindfulness, quality of life, and program acceptability. Evaluations will be done before and immediately after the 8-week intervention, and at month 6 and 12 of the post-intervention follow-up. Discussion: If the proposed interventions are well accepted and useful to decrease negative emotions and/or increase wellbeing among medical students, they should be disseminated among this population and even included as part of the training on emotional skills needed for the routine medical practice.

128,A comparison of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of migrant and Australian-born users of a national digital mental health service,"Background: To explore the characteristics and compare clinical outcomes of non-Australian born (migrant) and Australian-born users of an Australian national digital mental health service. Methods: The characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who completed online treatment at the MindSpot Clinic between January 2014 and December 2016 and reported a country of birth other than Australia were compared to Australian-born users. Data about the main language spoken at home were used to create distinct groups. Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 Item (GAD-7), respectively. Results: Of 52,020 people who started assessment at MindSpot between 1st January 2014 and 22nd December 2016, 45,082 reported a country of birth, of whom 78.6% ( n = 35,240) were Australian-born, and 21.4% ( n = 9842) were born overseas. Of 6782 people who completed the online treatment and reported country of birth and main language spoken at home, 1631 (24%) were migrants, 960 (59%) were from English-speaking countries, and 671 (41%) were from non-English speaking countries. Treatment-seeking migrant users reported higher rates of tertiary education than Australian-born users. The baseline symptom severity, and rates of symptom reduction and remission following online treatment were similar across groups. Conclusions: Online treatment was associated with significant reductions in anxiety and depression in migrants of both English speaking and non-English speaking backgrounds, with outcomes similar to those obtained by Australian-born patients. DMHS have considerable potential to help reduce barriers to mental health care for migrants.

129,Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents in a middle-income Latin American country,"Background: Child and adolescent mental health has scarcely been studied in developing countries, though it is an important aspect of health. Mental health problems in youth often continue into adulthood if not diagnosed or treated in time. Methods: The Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA ) [Child and Adolescent Evaluation System] was used to evaluate mental health indicators in a sample of students in Northern Chile. Two age-appropriate versions of the assessment were applied to a total sample of 5043 students, which included an elementary education sample of 1953 schoolchildren from fourth grade through sixth grade (ages 8 to 13 years), and a Secondary School sample of 3090 schoolchildren from seventh grade (the last year of elementary school) through the last year of Secondary school (senior high school) (ages 12 to 19 years). For each group, the version of the assessment used was determined by the students’ grade level. Both samples included municipal, government-subsidized, and private schools. Results: In this student population, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders were the main mental health problems identified, and indicators revealed a progressive increase in cases over the years, coinciding with the global epidemiological scenario. Males showed a greater presence of externalizing behaviors related to mental health problems associated with aggression and defiant behavior. However, females showed the highest number of mental health issues overall, especially regarding problems related to internalization. There are significant differences between school types. Conclusions: Our sample population analysis indicates that early intervention is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of youth, with the goal of reducing the probability that psychiatric disorders will be prolonged, evolving, and worsening in adulthood.

130,Norms for Zung’s Self-rating Anxiety Scale,"Background: Zung’s Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) is a norm-referenced scale which enjoys widespread use a screener for anxiety disorders. However, recent research (Dunstan DA and Scott N, Depress Res Treat 2018:9250972, 2018) has questioned whether the existing cut-off for identifying the presence of a disorder might be lower than ideal. Method: The current study explored this issue by examining sensitivity and specificity figures against diagnoses made on the basis of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in clinical and community samples. The community sample consisted of 210 participants recruited to be representative of the Australian adult population. The clinical sample consisted of a further 141 adults receiving treatment from a mental health professional for some form of anxiety disorder. Results: Mathematical formulas, including Youden’s Index and the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve, applied to positive PHQ diagnoses (presence of a disorder) from the clinical sample and negative PHQ diagnoses (absence of a disorder) from the community sample suggested that the ideal cut-off point lies between the current and original points recommended by Zung. Conclusions: Consideration of prevalence rates and of the potential costs of false negative and false positive diagnoses, suggests that, while the current cut-off of 36 might be appropriate in the context of clinical screening, the original raw score cut-off of 40 would be most appropriate when the SAS is used in research.

Methods: Our study included 147 adolescents (ages 12–17, 92 girls), 93 with major depressive disorder and 54 as controls. Participants were evaluated using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), SCARED, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Disruptive Behavioral Disorder Scale (DBD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Pearson’s r and Cronbach’s α values of the SCARED were calculated, and exploratory factor analysis was conducted.ResultsThe Korean SCARED scores were correlated with the total anxiety scores of K-SADS-PL ( r = 0.74) and the CBCL anxious/depressed subscale scores ( r = 0.35). Results showed a five-factor structure with good internal consistency, in which some items were loaded on different factors compared to previous studies. Conclusions: The Korean SCARED demonstrated promising psychometric properties, and could be a valid scale for screening anxiety symptoms in primary care. The fact that different items comprised the factors may reflect the cultural difference between United States and Korea in experiencing anxiety.

132,"Self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress in Portuguese primary school-aged children","Background: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress experienced during childhood might have a negative impact on development. This study explores factors associated with such symptoms among Portuguese primary school-aged children. Methods: A sample of children ( n = 1022, mean age = 8.77 years old) was recruited in public and private schools from the cities of Coimbra, Lisbon and Porto, Portugal. The children’s version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-C) was self-administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to measure associations (expressed as Odds Ratio, OR and 95% Confidence Intervals, CI) between each DASS-C subscale, dichotomized by its 4th vs. 3rd or less quartiles (symptoms increase with scores), and covariates: child sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), sports activity beyond school, children self-assessed health status, child and mother’s body mass index and mother’s DASS scores. Results: Age was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.57–0.87) and girls, compared to boys, presented lower odds of depressive and stress symptoms (adjusted OR, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.47–0.92 and 0.57, 0.41–0.80, respectively). A low socioeconomic status was associated with more frequent symptoms of stress (adjusted OR, 95%CI for low compared to high SES: 1.61, 1.01–2.56). Children with poorer self-assessed health status and whose mothers scored higher in the DASS also presented significantly higher odds of scoring in the 4th quartile (vs. 3rd or less) of the three DASS-C subscales. Conclusions: These results suggest the need to tailor preventive efforts targeting childhood mental health symptoms.

133,Psychometric properties of the Persian Version of Postpartum Distress Measure Scale,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to determine psychometric properties of the Persian version of Postpartum Distress Measure Scale (PDM Scale). Methods: In this psychometric explorative study, the data were collected using a questionnaire containing demographic information, PDM Scale, and Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The content, face and construct validity of the questionnaire was examined with participation of ten experts, 10 and 150 women referring to health care centers, who were under common care during their postpartum period, respectively. The concurrent validity of the tool was evaluated using DASS-21. The reliability of the items was evaluated with the participation of 30 women, calculating Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and intra-class correlation coefficient. Results: The Content Validity Index, Content Validity Ratio and Impact Score of the Persian version of the PDM were 0.94, 0.73, and 2.97, respectively. The ten items of the questionnaire were loaded in two factors (general distress and obsessive compulsive symptoms subscale). Those two factors explained 50.78% of the total variance of women’s distress. Internal consistency of the items and stability of the results were confirmed by Cronbach’s alpha of 0.72 and Intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.75. Conclusion: According to the study results, the Persian version of PDM Scale has acceptable psychometric properties. Care providers and researchers can use it as a tool for screening anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder in women.

134,Maternal antenatal anxiety and electrophysiological functioning amongst a sub-set of preschoolers participating in the GUSTO cohort,"Background: Antenatal maternal anxiety is a risk for offspring psychological and cognitive difficulties. The preschool years represent an important time for brain development, and so may be a window for intervention. However, electrophysiological investigations of maternal anxiety and preschoolers’ brain functioning are lacking. We ask whether anxiety symptoms predict neurophysiology, and consider timing specificity (26-weeks antenatal or 24-months postnatal), form of insult (anxiety symptoms, per se, or also depression symptoms), and offspring gender. Methods: The sample consisted of a subset of 71 mothers and their 3 year old children taking part in the prospective birth cohort, GUSTO. Mothers provided antenatal (26 weeks) and postnatal (2 years) anxiety and depressive symptomatology data, respectively via the “State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire” and the “Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale.” Offspring provided electrophysiological data, obtained while they indicated the emotional expression of actors whose facial expressions remained consistent throughout a pre-switch block, but were reversed at “post-switch.” Results: Three electrophysiological components linked to different information processing stages were identified. The two earliest occurring components (i.e., the N1 and P2) differed across blocks. During post-switch, both were significantly predicted by maternal anxiety, after controlling for pre-switch neurophysiology. Similar results were observed with depression. Antenatal mental health remained a significant predictor after controlling for postnatal mental health. Conclusion: In combination with past work, these findings suggest the importance of reducing symptoms in women prior to and during pregnancy, and offering support to offspring early in development.

135,Development of ‘learn to dare!’: An online assessment and intervention platform for anxious children,"Background: Many children and adolescents suffer from problematic levels of anxiety, but the multitude of these children do not receive an intervention. It is of importance to increase the accessibility and availability of child anxiety interventions, as to identify and treat anxious children early and successfully. Online platforms that include information, assessments and intervention can contribute to this goal. Interventions for child anxiety are frequently based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, because of its strong theoretical and empirical basis. However, the working mechanisms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in children are poorly studied. To our knowledge, mediation studies on child anxiety are non-existent regarding online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Methods: We will aim at children aged 8–13 years with problematic anxiety. We recruit these children via the community setting, and refer them to our online platform ‘Learn to Dare!’ (in Dutch: ‘Leer te Durven!’), https://leertedurven.ou.nl, where information about child anxiety and our research is freely accessible. After an active informed consent procedure, the participants can access the screening procedure, which will select the children with problematic anxiety levels. Thereafter, these children will be randomized to an online intervention based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (n = 120) or to a waitlist control (WL, n = 120). The intervention consists of 8 sessions with minimal therapist support and contains psycho-education, exposure (based on inhibitory learning), cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Child anxiety symptoms and diagnoses, cognitions, avoidance behavior and level of abstract reasoning are measured. Assessments are the same for both groups and are performed before and after the proposed working mechanisms are offered during the intervention. A follow-up assessment takes place 3 months after the final session, after which children in the waitlist control group are offered to take part in the intervention. Discussion: This protocol paper describes the development of the online platform ‘Learn to Dare!’, which includes information about child anxiety, the screening procedure, anxiety assessments, and the online intervention. We describe the development of the online intervention. Offering easy accessible interventions and providing insight into the working mechanisms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy contributes to optimizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for anxious youth.

136,Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Psychometric properties of the online Spanish version in a clinical sample with emotional disorders,"Background: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is the most widely and frequently used scale to assess positive and negative affect. The PANAS has been validated in several languages, and it has shown excellent psychometric properties in the general population and some clinical samples, such as forensic samples, substance users, and adult women with fibromyalgia. Nevertheless, the psychometric properties of the scale have not yet been examined in clinical samples with anxiety, depressive, and adjustment disorders. In addition, the proliferation of Internet-based treatments has led to the development of a wide range of assessments conducted online with digital versions of pen and paper self-report questionnaires. However, no validations have been carried out to analyze the psychometric properties of the online version of the PANAS. The present study investigates the psychometric properties of the online Spanish version of the PANAS in a clinical sample of individuals with emotional disorders. Methods: The sample was composed of 595 Spanish adult volunteers with a diagnosis of depressive disorder ( n = 237), anxiety disorder ( n = 284), or adjustment disorder ( n = 74). Factor structure, construct validity, internal consistency, and sensitivity to change were analyzed. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a latent structure of two independent factors, consistent with previous validations of the instrument. The analyses showed adequate convergent and discriminant validity, good internal consistency as well as sensitivity to change. Conclusions: Overall, the results obtained in this study show that the online version of the PANAS has adequate psychometric properties for the assessment of positive and negative affect in a Spanish clinical population.

137,"Feasibility and acceptability of a novel community-based mental health intervention delivered by community volunteers in Maharashtra, India: The Atmiyata programme","Background: Many community-based intervention models for mental health and wellbeing have undergone robust experimental evaluation; however, there are limited accounts of the implementation of these evidence-based interventions in practice. Atmiyata piloted the implementation of a community-led intervention to identify and understand the challenges of delivering such an intervention. The goal of the pilot evaluation is to identify factors important for larger-scale implementation across an entire district in India. This paper presents the results of a feasibility and acceptability study of the Atmiyata intervention piloted in Nashik district, Maharashtra, India between 2013 and 2015. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the Atmiyata intervention. First, a pre-post survey conducted with 215 cases identified with a GHQ cut-off 6 using a 3-month interval. Cases enrolled into the study in one randomly selected month (May–June 2015). Secondly, a quasi-experimental, pre-post design was used to conduct a population-based survey in the intervention and control areas. A randomly selected sample (panel) of 827 women and 843 men age between 18 to 65 years were interviewed to assess the impact of the Atmiyata intervention on common mental disorders. Finally, using qualitative methods, 16 Champions interviewed to understand an implementation processes, barriers and facilitators. Results: Of the 215 participants identified by the Champions as being distressed or having a common mental disorder (CMD), n = 202 (94.4%) had a GHQ score at either sub-threshold level for CMD or above at baseline. Champions accurately identified people with emotional distress and in need of psychological support. After a 6- session counselling provided by the Champions, the percentage of participants with a case-level GHQ score dropped from 63.8 to 36.8%. The second sub-intervention consisted of showing films on Champions’ mobile phones to raise community awareness regarding mental health. Films consisted of short scenario-based depictions of problems commonly experienced in villages (alcohol use and domestic violence). Champions facilitated access to social benefits for people with disability. Retention of Atmiyata Champions was high; 90.7% of the initial selected champions continued to work till the end of the project. Champions stated that they enjoyed their work and found it fulfilling to help others. This made them willing to work voluntarily, without pay. The semi-structured interviews with champions indicated that persons in the community experienced reduced symptoms and improved social, occupational and family functioning for problems such as depression, domestic violence, alcohol use, and severe mental illness. Conclusions: This study shows that community-led interventions using volunteers from rural neighbourhoods can serve as a locally feasible and acceptable approach to facilitating access social welfare benefits, as well as reducing distress and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a low and middle-income country context. The intervention draws upon social capital in a community to engage and empower community members to address mental health problems. A robust evaluation methodology is needed to test the efficacy of such a model when it is implemented at scale.

138,"Post-traumatic stress disorder, psychiatric comorbidities and associated factors among refugees in Nakivale camp in southwestern Uganda","Background: Armed conflict in Africa has led to displacement of over 24.2 million people, more than 1.4 million of whom are living in Uganda. Studies show that refugees living in Ugandan refugee settlements are at increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder. However data on the prevalence of other mental health problems among refugees including depression, anxiety and substance use disorder among refugees in Uganda is lacking. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder, its main psychiatric comorbidities and perceived psychosocial needs among refugees in Nakivale refugee camp. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of refugee camp residents ( n = 387) from nine different countries of origin. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and perceived needs by the Humanitarian Emerging Settings Perceived Needs Scale (HESPER). Results: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was high among refugees as was the level of perceived needs. The most prevalent psychiatric disorders were generalized anxiety disorders (73%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (67%), major depressive disorder (58%) and substance use disorders (30%). There was a higher level of comorbidity between PTSD and substance use disorder (OR = 5.13), major depressive disorder (OR = 4.04) and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 3.27).In multivariate analysis, PTSD was positively associated with the perception of stress as a serious problem (OR = 6.52; P -value = 0.003), safety and protection for women in the community (OR = 2.35; P-value = 0.011), care for family (OR = 2.00; P-value = 0.035) and Place to live in (OR = 1.83; P-value = 0.04). After applying the Bonferroni correction, the perception of stress remained significantly associated with PTSD. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a strong association between PTSD, its main comorbidities and basic needs in Nakivale refugee camps. Mental health support should include psychological interventions as well as social assistance to improve the health of refugees.

139,Psychometric evaluation of two short versions of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common in children and adolescents, which can be detected via selfreport questionnaires in non-clinical settings like the school environment. Two short versions of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (i.e., RCADS-25 and RCADS-20) seem to be feasible for administering at schools. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 used as screening instruments for anxiety and depression in a general population of schoolchildren and adolescents. Methods: The RCADS-25 was completed by 69,487 schoolchildren and adolescents aged 8 to 18. The RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 broad anxiety scales are equal (15 items), but there are two versions of the major depressive disorder (MDD) scale: the RCADS-25 MDD scale (10 items) and the RCADS-20 MDD scale (5 items). The three scales were assessed on structural validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and hypotheses for construct validity. Results: The RCADS-25/RCADS-20 broad anxiety scale demonstrated a sufficient structural validity (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03, SRMR = 0.03), internal consistency (alpha = 0.82), test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.73), criterion validity (AUC = 0.79), and all four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed. The RCADS-25 MDD scale demonstrated a sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.70) and three out of four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed, but its structural validity was suspect (CFI = 0.89, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.06). The RCADS-20 MDD scale demonstrated a sufficient structural validity (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.04) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.72). Two out of four hypotheses concerning construct validity were confirmed. The test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.60) was insufficient. Since both MDD scales showed shortcomings, the shortening of the RCADS-25 MDD scale was re-examined post hoc by principal component and reliability analyses. The result was an MDD scale with seven items. Conclusions: The RCADS-25/RCADS-20 broad anxiety scale is valid and reliable for screening schoolchildren and adolescents, but the RCADS-25 and RCADS-20 MDD scales showed shortcomings. An MDD scale of seven items showed acceptable psychometric properties.

140,Validity and clinical utility of the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Child Version: Further evaluation in clinical samples,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. Currently, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Child Version (OCI-CV) is the only self-report measure that fully captures this symptom heterogeneity in children and adolescents. The psychometric properties of the OCI-CV are promising but evaluations in large clinical samples are few. Further, no studies have examined whether the measure is valid in both younger and older children with OCD and whether scores on the measure are elevated in youths with OCD compared to youths with other mental disorders. Methods: To address these gaps in the literature, we investigated the psychometric properties and validity of a Swedish version of the OCI-CV in a large clinical sample of youth aged 6–18 years with OCD ( n = 434), anxiety disorders ( n = 84), and chronic tic disorders ( n = 45). Results: Internal consistency coefficients at the total scale and subscale level were consistent with the English original and in the acceptable range. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed an adequate fit for the original six-factor structure in both younger and older children with OCD. Correlations between total scores on the OCI-CV and the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) were small at pre-treatment ( r = 0.19) but large at post-treatment ( r = 0.62). Youth with OCD scored higher than those with anxiety and chronic tic disorders, and the OCI-CV was sensitive to symptom change for youth undergoing treatment for OCD. Conclusions: This Swedish version of the OCI-CV appears to be a valid and reliable measure of the OCD symptom dimensions across age groups and has good clinical utility.

141,Factor structure and measurement invariance of the problematic mobile phone use questionnaire-short version across gender in Chinese adolescents and young adults,"Background: Problematic mobile phone use (PMPU) has become a public health issue in China, particularly in adolescents and young adults. The Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire-Short Version (PMPUQ-SV) is a validated instrument that measures multiple aspects of PMPU. The current study aimed to test the psychometric characteristics of a Chinese adaption of the PMPUQ-SV and examine its measurement invariance across gender. Methods: A total of 2086 participants were recruited form nine schools (six undergraduate colleges and three vocational colleges) through an online platform. Measures included socio-demographic variables, patterns of mobile phone use, the Chinese version of the PMPUQ-SV (C-PMPUQ-SV), the Chinese version of the Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (C-SAPS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted in two independent subsamples confirmed that the postulated dimensions fit the data well. Four items, judged as either outdated or not adapted to the Chinese context, performed poorly and were removed, resulting in a shorter 11-item scale. Convergent validity was established through correlations between emotional symptoms and the C-PMPUQ-SV and addictive smartphone use. Additional measurement invariance analyses showed that the scale performed largely similarly in male and female participants. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the C-PMPUQ-SV is an adequate instrument to study various types of PMPU in Chinese adolescents and young adults. The updated 11-item scale shortens the evaluation time and is adapted to assess contemporary smartphone use.

142,STUDY PROTOCOL: EXPOSURE IN VIRTUAL REALITY FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER—A randomized controlled superiority trial comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with virtual reality based exposure to cognitive behavioral therapy with in vivo exposure,"Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by an intense fear of negative judgement by others. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is recommended for treatment, but a substantial part of individuals with SAD either do not seek treatment or drop-out. CBT with Virtual Reality (VR)-based exposure has several advantages compared to traditional exposure methods, mainly due to increased control of situational elements. The aim of the current study is to develop a CBT program containing VR-based exposure. The intervention is targeted to adult patients suffering from SAD and treatment effect will be assessed by changes in SAD symptoms. Methods: This article describes the study protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial with three arms: 1) CBT with VR exposure based on 360° videos 2) CBT with in vivo exposure and 3) VR relaxation therapy. There will be 30 participants in each arm with a crossover at the end of the treatment period during which the participants in the third group will be randomly re-allocated to one of the two former groups. The treatment program consists of 10 weekly individual sessions with a psychologist, and a six month follow-up consisting of a questionnaire. The primary outcome measure is reduction in SAD symptoms which will be assessed with the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Discussion: There are currently no published studies on CBT with VR exposure based on 360° videos for SAD treatment. Furthermore, the current study will be the first Danish SAD treatment program that includes VR technology.

143,Factors associated with mental distress among undergraduate students in northern Tanzania,"Background: Mental distress is a major public health problem which includes anxiety, depression and somatic symptoms such as sleeping problems, fatigue and headache. University students are consistently reported to have higher levels of mental distress compared to the general population. Although university students with mental distress have significantly impaired cognitive functioning, learning disabilities and poor academic performance, the burden of this problem in Tanzania is unknown. This study aimed to determine prevalence and factors associated with mental distress among undergraduate students in northern Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College from April–July 2018. Simple random sampling technique using probability proportional to size was used to sample students from their respective classes. Mental distress was screened using the self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). Data was analyzed using Stata version 15.1. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables while mean and standard deviation for numeric variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with mental distress adjusted for potential confounders. Results: A total of 402 undergraduate students participated in this study, 14% screened positive for mental distress. Residing off-campus (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.20–0.96) and perceived availability of social support (OR = 0.22, 95%CI 0.11– 0.45) reduced the odds of mental distress while students with family history of mental distress (OR = 2.60, 95%CI 1.04–6.57) and those with decreased grades than anticipated (OR = 3.61, 95%CI 1.91–6.83) had higher likelihood of mental distress. Conclusion: One in every ten students screened was positive for mental distress. Those who reported a family history of mental illness and lower grades than anticipated had higher response of mental distress. To relieve students from stress and frustrations related to studies and their lives in general, this study recommends awareness creation, counselling to help those with mental health issues, establishment of student drop-in centers for such services and promotion of social and recreational activities at the college.

144,Medicinal cannabis for psychiatric disorders: A clinically-focused systematic review,"Background: Medicinal cannabis has received increased research attention over recent years due to loosening global regulatory changes. Medicinal cannabis has been reported to have potential efficacy in reducing pain, muscle spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Yet its potential application in the field of psychiatry is lesser known. Methods: The first clinically-focused systematic review on the emerging medical application of cannabis across all major psychiatric disorders was conducted. Current evidence regarding whole plant formulations and plant-derived cannabinoid isolates in mood, anxiety, sleep, psychotic disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is discussed; while also detailing clinical prescription considerations (including pharmacogenomics), occupational and public health elements, and future research recommendations. The systematic review of the literature was conducted during 2019, assessing the data from all case studies and clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis or plant-derived isolates for all major psychiatric disorders (neurological conditions and pain were omitted). Results: The present evidence in the emerging field of cannabinoid therapeutics in psychiatry is nascent, and thereby it is currently premature to recommend cannabinoid-based interventions. Isolated positive studies have, however, revealed tentative support for cannabinoids (namely cannabidiol; CBD) for reducing social anxiety; with mixed (mainly positive) evidence for adjunctive use in schizophrenia. Case studies suggest that medicinal cannabis may be beneficial for improving sleep and post-traumatic stress disorder, however evidence is currently weak. Preliminary research findings indicate no benefit for depression from high delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) therapeutics, or for CBD in mania. One isolated study indicates some potential efficacy for an oral cannabinoid/ terpene combination in ADHD. Clinical prescriptive consideration involves caution in the use of high-THC formulations (avoidance in youth, and in people with anxiety or psychotic disorders), gradual titration, regular assessment, and caution in cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, pregnancy and breast-feeding. Conclusions: There is currently encouraging, albeit embryonic, evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders. Supportive findings are emerging for some key isolates, however, clinicians need to be mindful of a range of prescriptive and occupational safety considerations, especially if initiating higher dose THC formulas.

145,A suicide prevention strategy for youth presenting to the emergency department with suicide related behaviour: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents in North America. Youth who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute suicidality are at increased risk for eventual death by suicide, thereby presenting an opportunity for secondary prevention of suicide. The current study evaluates the effectiveness of a standardized individual and family-based suicidal behaviour risk reduction intervention targeting adolescents at high-risk for suicide. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a manualized youth- and family- based suicide prevention strategy (SPS) as compared with case navigation (NAV) among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years of age who present to the ED with acute suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide risk behaviours (SRB). We will recruit 128 participants and compare psychiatric symptoms including SI/SRB, family communication, and functional impairment at baseline and follow-ups (post-intervention [6 weeks], 24 weeks). The primary outcome is change in suicidal ideation measured with the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire- Junior. SRBs are measured with the Suicide Behaviour Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are change in depressive and anxious symptoms measured with semi-structured psychiatric interview and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders; acute mental health crises measured by urgent medical (including ED) visits; family communication measured with Conflict Behaviour Questionnaire, functional impairment measured by Columbia Impairment Scale; cost effectiveness, and fidelity of implementation measured by audio recording and fidelity checklist. Discussion: Results of this study will inform a larger multi-centre RCT that will include both community and academic hospitals in urban and rural settings. Study results will be shared at international psychiatry and emergency medicine meetings, in local rounds, and via publication in academic journals and clinician-oriented newsletters. If effective, the intervention may provide a brief, scalable, and transportable treatment program that may be implemented in a variety of settings, including those in which access to children’s mental health care services is challenging.

146,Study protocol for a randomized control trial to investigate the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) transdiagnostic group intervention for primary care patients,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20[136] of BMC Psychiatry (see record 2020-22897-001). In the original article, one of the authors names has been incorrectly spelled. Sarah Frances should be Sarah Francis.] Background: Effective transdiagnostic treatments for patients presenting with principal or comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression enable more efficient provision of mental health care and may be particularly suitable for the varied population seen in primary healthcare settings. Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) is a transdiagnostic intervention that integrates aspects of CBT, including exposure skills targeting avoidance, with training in mindfulness meditation skills adopted from the Vipassana or insight tradition taught by the Burmese teachers U Ba Khin and Goenka. MiCBT is distinguished from both cognitive therapy and mindfulnessbased cognitive therapy by the use of a theoretical framework which proposes that the locus of reinforcement of behavior is the interoceptive experience (body sensations) that co-arises with self-referential thinking. Consequently, MiCBT has a strong focus on body scanning to develop interoceptive awareness and equanimity. Designed for clinical purposes, the four-stage systemic approach of MiCBT, comprising intra-personal (Stage 1) exposure (Stage 2), interpersonal (Stage 3), and empathic (Stage 4) skillsets, is a distinguishing feature among other mindfulnessbased interventions (MBIs). The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how group MiCBT decreases depression and anxiety symptoms for patients with a range of common mental health conditions. Methods: Participants ( n = 120) recruited via medical practitioner referral will be randomized to MiCBT or a wait-list control. Inclusion criteria are age 18–75; fluent in English and having a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score of 20 or more. The MiCBT treatment group receive an 8-week MiCBT intervention delivered in a private psychology practice. Participants complete a suite of online self-report measures and record the amount of meditation practice undertaken each week. The control group receive usual treatment and complete the measures at the same time points. Primary outcome measures are the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and K10. Analysis will use mixed-model repeated measures. Discussion: The potential ability of MiCBT to provide a comprehensive therapeutic system that is applicable across diagnostic groups would make it an attractive addition to the available MBIs.

Wormwood, Madeleine Devlin, Yu-Ru Lin, Lisa Feldman Barrett and Karen S. Quigley ( Frontiers in Psychology , 2018[Aug][2], Vol 9[1333]). The original article has been retracted. The authors recently discovered a clerical error in how the data were merged across time points. Specifically, data collected during the final longitudinal time point (wave 3) were incorrectly assigned to the wrong participants when merging data files. The authors have corrected this error and re-conducted the analyses and the pattern of findings reported in the paper are no longer supported by the analyses. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-39770-001). Media exposure influences mental health symptomology in response to salient aversive events, like terrorist attacks, but little has been done to explore the impact of news coverage that varies more subtly in affective content. Here, we utilized an existing data set in which participants self-reported physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and completed a potentiated startle task assessing their physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli at three time points (waves) over a 9-month period. Using a computational linguistics approach, we then calculated an average ratio of words with positive vs. negative affective connotations for only articles from news sources to which each participant self-reported being exposed over the prior 2 weeks at each wave of data collection. As hypothesized, individuals exposed to news coverage with more negative affective tone over the prior 2 weeks reported significantly greater physical and depressive symptoms, and had significantly greater physiological reactivity to aversive stimuli.

2,Relationship of physical activity with anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese college students during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 outbreak, many citizens were asked to stay at home in self-quarantine, which can pose a significant challenge with respect to remaining physically active and maintaining mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of inadequate physical activity, anxiety, and depression and to explore the relationship of physical activity with anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students during quarantine. Method: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,396 Chinese college students. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. The data on physical activity were collected by types of physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). Results: During the COVID-19 outbreak, about 52.3% of Chinese college students had inadequate physical activity. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 31.0 and 41.8%, respectively. A high level of physical activity (β = −0.121, P &lt; 0.001) was significantly closely associated with low anxiety, while a moderate (β = −0.095, P = 0.001), or high (β = −0.179, P &lt; 0.001) level of physical activity was significantly closely associated with reduced depression after adjusting confounding demographic factors. Moreover, specific types of physical activity, such as stretching and resistance training, were negatively correlated with both anxiety and depression; doing household chores was negatively correlated with depression. Conclusion: Our findings highlight specific levels and types of home-based physical activities that need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental health of college students during the COVID-19 epidemic.

3,Physical exercise and fitness level are related to cognitive and psychosocial functioning in adolescents,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationships among physical exercise and fitness with selective attention, concentration, processing speed, general self-efficacy, self-rated health, and satisfaction with life. 208 adolescents between 14 and 16 years, from the city of Malaga (Spain), participated in the study. A comparative and predictive design was used to carry out this research. The instruments used for the evaluation were the Tanita® BC-601 Body Composition Monitor, the Eurofit Physical Condition Test Battery, the D2 Test of Attention, the WISC-IV Symbol Search and Coding tests, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal–Wallis test, correlation analysis and linear regression were used to contrast the research objectives. The results indicated that adolescents who practiced more hours of physical exercise per week and were in better physical fitness achieved higher scores in selective attention, concentration, processing speed, general self-efficacy, self-rated health, and satisfaction with life. In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness was the physical fitness variable most closely related to and predictive of cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Cardiorespiratory fitness was predictor of all the variables analyzed, except the factor anxiety and insomnia (self-rated health), and life satisfaction that were predicted by horizontal jump measurements and fat mass, respectively. Thus, the study findings indicate that adolescents who practiced more weekly physical exercise and had a higher level of physical fitness scored better on the cognitive functioning and psychosocial tests evaluated. The data suggest that engaging in physical exercise and fitness in adolescence may be appropriate to improve health and well-being, contributing to better development at this stage.

4,Behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of dogs’ individual sensitivities to being observed by their owners while performing a repetitive fetching task,"Ample evidence suggests that dogs possess enhanced skills in reading human visual attention, but it remains to be explored whether they are sensitive to the audience effect in their interactions with humans. The present study aimed to investigate how dogs’ behavior is affected by their owners’ visual attention while performing a repetitive task (bringing an object back to an unfamiliar experimenter while the owner waited passively). We assumed that if dogs are susceptible to the audience effect, their task persistence and task performance would vary according to their owners’ attentiveness. A group of adult pet dogs ( N = 27) were repeatedly presented with an object retrieval task by the experimenter ( N = 20 trials) while owners either ignored their dogs (Inattentive Owner condition) or paid attention to their dogs’ actions (Attentive Owner condition). Behavioral observations were complemented with the owner’s reports of their relationships with their dogs (assessed by means of an owner–pet attachment questionnaire) and dogs’ spectral EEG sleep profile (recorded during 3-h-long daytime sleep). Although dogs, independently of their owners’ attentional state, were generally willing to comply with the fetching task, they were faster to approach the toy object and gazed significantly longer at their owners when he/she was paying attention. This finding is reminiscent of peer influence observed in humans. Further, characteristics of relationship insecurity (relationship anxiety and avoidance) were associated with dogs’ task persistence and performance. Dogs of owners with higher relationship anxiety tended to approach the toy object less frequently, and dogs of owners with higher relationship avoidance and anxiety were more hesitant to approach the toy object. We also found that dogs’ individual susceptibilities to the audience effect is related to EEG spectral power of both REM and non-REM sleep as well as in pre-sleep (drowsiness) in a trait-like manner. These results, in line with previous findings, support the notion that dogs have a somewhat human-like susceptibility to the audience effect, a trait which might be linked to more complex mechanisms, such as self-presentation or reputation management, helping the two species to become effective social partners.

5,Efficacy of a computer-based learning program in children with developmental dyscalculia. What influences individual responsiveness?,"This study presents the evaluation of a computer-based learning program for children with developmental dyscalculia and focuses on factors affecting individual responsiveness. The adaptive training program Calcularis 2.0 has been developed according to current neuro-cognitive theory of numerical cognition. It aims to automatize number representations, supports the formation and access to the mental number line and trains arithmetic operations as well as arithmetic fact knowledge in expanding number ranges. Sixty-seven children with developmental dyscalculia from second to fifth grade (mean age 8.96 years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups (Calcularis group, waiting control group). Training duration comprised a minimum of 42 training sessions à 20 min within a maximum period of 13 weeks. Compared to the waiting control group, children of the Calcularis group demonstrated a higher benefit in arithmetic operations and number line estimation. These improvements were shown to be stable after a 3-months post training interval. In addition, this study examines which predictors accounted for training improvements. Results indicate that this self-directed training was especially beneficial for children with low math anxiety scores and without an additional reading and/or spelling disorder. In conclusion, Calcularis 2.0 supports children with developmental dyscalculia to improve their arithmetical abilities and their mental number line representation. However, it is relevant to further adapt the setting to the individual circumstances.

The sample was composed by 444 athletes (age: 24.7 ± 8.8 years, body mass: 72.4 ± 12.1 kg, height: 1.82 ± 0.3 m, and practice time: 13.1 ± 7.4 years) separated by sex (male n = 273, female n = 171) from different combat sports (jiu-jitsu n = 142, judo n = 137, karate n = 57, kendo n = 63, taekwondo n = 25, and freestyle wrestling n = 20) of three levels (high-level n = 57, intermediate n = 137 and low-level n = 142). Inventory of situations and anxiety response (ISRA) provided an independent evaluation for the three systems: cognitive, motor and physiological, as well as a total with four factors of analysis (anxiety before the evaluation, interpersonal, phobic and before habitual, and daily situations). Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) verified emotional intelligence scales. Descriptive results are demonstrated by percentage or median (first quartile Q1; third quartile Q3), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to compare groups, p ≤ 0.05. The main results demonstrated 10% more total anxiety for wrestling and judo compared to the other groups ( p ≤ 0.05). Female athletes showed 15% more anxiety than men, while emotional attention demonstrated 10% better results for women. Significant differences were observed between high- versus low-level athletes in the total anxiety with 85 (44; 143) versus 122 (69; 186) of ISRA index and emotional repair with 30 (25; 34) versus 27 (22; 32) of TMMS-24 index. Emotional intelligence seems to be higher in female and in higher level, while anxiety appears to be prevalent in judo and wrestling, low-level and in female athletes. These outcomes provide support for the hypothesis that emotional abilities are an important contributor to emotional intelligence, particularly differentiating high level athletes than other levels. Results can be incorporated into strategies for reducing anxiety and improving emotional intelligence, considering particularities of gender and level groups.

In the original paper, the author Tao Xiao was given the wrong affiliation. The author should have affiliation 2 instead of affiliation 3. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-20878-001). The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) is an instrument in the assessment of mental health status. The current study recruited 1,532 Chinese hospital workers [74.4% female; mean age = 31.97 (SD = 9.70) years] to examine the reliability, latent structure, and measurement invariance of the DASS-21 between genders. The Cronbach’s α values were greater than 0.90 for total score. This study examined four possible models of the DASS-21 using the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in Chinese hospital workers. The results from CFA revealed that the latent structure of the DASS-21 in medical staffs is best represented by a one-factor model. Then we used the one-factor model to examine measurement invariance across genders by using a multiple-group categorical CFA. All values of root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) were less than 0.08, all Comparative Fix Index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis Index values were greater than 0.90, all ΔCFI (changes in CFI) values were less than 0.010, and ΔRMSEA (the changes in RMSEA) were less than 0.015. These findings supported the gender invariance of the DASS-21 among Chinese hospital workers.

8,Lifestyle variables do not predict subjective memory performance over and above depression and anxiety,"The diagnostic value of subjective cognitive complaints for cognitive functioning in a clinical setting remains unresolved today. However, consensus exists on the relation between subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) and mood variables such as anxiety and depression. Hence, SCC have also been discussed as potential proxies of psychopathology rather than representing cognitive functioning. In order to shed more light on yet still unexplained variance in subjective cognitive complaints, the relation between lifestyle variables (such as nutrition habits, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking, quality of sleep, and Body Mass Index) and subjective complaints of selective attention as well as subjective memory performance were assessed, additionally to the influence of objective memory performance, measures of anxiety, and depression. A sample of 877 (554 women) healthy, middle-aged individuals (51 years on average, age range 35–65) was assessed in the present study. In a logistic regression framework results revealed that the effect of lifestyle variables on subjective complaints of selective attention as well as subjective memory performance was rendered non-significant. Instead, subjective complaints of selective attention and subjective memory performance were significantly determined by measures of both, anxiety and depression. One unit increase in anxiety or depression led to an increase of 6 or 15% in subjective memory performance complaints, respectively. For subjective complaints of selective attention, a one unit increase in anxiety or depression led to an increase of 11 or 26%, respectively. The strong relation between SCC and measures of depression and anxiety corroborates the notion of SCC being indicative of mental health and general well-being.

9,Profiles of women with fibromyalgia and social comparison processes,"Background: Due to uncertainty regarding chronic pain in Fibromyalgia (FM) patients, there has been a growing interest in social comparison and its influence on emotional responses. Aims: to analyze profiles in FM patients according to pain perception, social comparison strategies and anxiety and depression. Methods: The sample consisted of 131 FM outpatients (Mean age: 50.15, SD = 11.1). Two scales were used: the Social Comparison Illness Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Two profiles were found by cluster analysis (K-means method): one (66%) with a higher level of pain perception, anxiety and depression and greater use of upward contrast and downward identification social comparison; and another (34%) with lower levels of pain perception, anxiety and depression and greater use of upward identification and downward contrast . Conclusion: These profiles underline the interest in social comparison strategies and their role in FM.

10,No need to worry? Anxiety and coping in the entrepreneurship process,"Understanding experiences of and responses to anxiety is foundational to developing robust theories of entrepreneurial behavior. Using open-ended, vignette and graphical elicitation interviews with 77 entrepreneurs, we inductively investigate the experience of and coping responses to anxiety during the entrepreneurship process. We develop a comprehensive and dynamic goal-striving model to explain experiencing and coping with entrepreneurial anxiety by integrating empirical findings with appraisal and control theories. In doing so, we theorize that entrepreneurial anxiety is endogenous to a cyclical conception of goal-striving, such that various sources of anxiety make sense only in consideration of the goals, standards or values to which they pertain. In this regard, entrepreneurs’ coping responses influence four different points of an iterative goal-striving cycle—an insight that moves beyond problematic static and binary coping classifications.

11,Burnout Stigma Inventory: Initial development and validation in industry and academia,"Although burnout is a risk factor for various negative mental and physical outcomes, its prevention is hampered by the stigma associated with burnout. The current research therefore reports on the initial development and validation of a novel measure of perceived burnout stigma. Study 1 ( n = 318) describes the construction and initial evaluation of scale items derived from established mental health stigma and burnout scales. Study 2 ( n = 705) then replicated the burnout stigma factor structure established in the initial study. Additionally, it evaluates relationships between occupational and school burnout stigma and indicators of mental health. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that burnout stigma accounted for variance in depression, anxiety, and stress over and beyond that of burnout. Study 3 ( n = 682) extended these findings via cross-lagged and bidirectional models, demonstrating that burnout stigma predicted mental health indicators 6 weeks later. Study 4 ( n = 717) supplemented earlier exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using item response theory to further demonstrate that perceived burnout stigma is a unidimensional construct potentially applicable to both work and school settings. Overall, the current research resulted in an eight-item burnout stigma instrument (BSI-8) with excellent psychometric properties that predicts indicators of mental health.

12,Perspectives on early screening and prompt intervention to identify and treat maternal perinatal mental health. Protocol for a prospective multicenter study in Italy,"Background: The most common mental disorders in women during the perinatal (antenatal and postnatal) period are depressive syndromes and anxiety syndromes. The global prevalence of maternal perinatal depression ranges from 10 to 20%, while the prevalence of perinatal anxiety ranges from 10 to 24%. The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders in perinatal women is common, reaching 40%. In Italy, a few studies have been undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety, and there is still a scarcity of research and intervention programs regarding primary prevention. Three of the main aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate the prevalence of maternal perinatal depression and anxiety in a large sample of women attending healthcare centers in Italy; (2) to investigate the psychosocial risks and protective factors associated with maternal perinatal depression and anxiety; (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of a manualized psychological intervention (Milgrom et al., 1999) to treat perinatal depression; (4) to evaluate the psychometric properties of both the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in detecting perinatal depression; and (5) to evaluate the influence of maternal depression and anxiety on the development of infant temperament. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study, which merges an observational design and a pre-post intervention design. The study includes a 1-year recruitment period and a one-year follow-up period. The methodological strategy includes: (1) self-report questionnaires on maternal depression, anxiety, health status, quality of life and psychosocial risks; (2) a self-report questionnaire to measure the infant’s temperament; (3) a clinical interview; (4) a structured diagnostic interview; and (5) a psychological intervention. Discussion: The results of this study may contribute to our knowledge about prevalence of antenatal and postnatal depression and anxiety (during both the trimesters of pregnancy and the first six trimesters after birth) and about the effectiveness of early psychological intervention in the perinatal health services.

13,Wellbeing in and through performance: Perspectives from sports and music,"This article draws insight and inspiration from sports to focus on how elite performers from other fields—and in particular, music—can come to integrate healthy approaches to performing alongside their drive to succeed. Wellbeing is a multidimensional phenomenon and refers to emotional and cognitive dimensions of subjective experiences resulting from the individual evaluation of several facets of life. Considering the link between performance and wellbeing established in sports, some researchers have focused on implications for other performance domains. A particular emphasis has been placed on the arts, and music specifically, for the parallels between sport and music performance across a wide array of psychosocial demands that performers in both fields must manage. A growing body of research shows that specific stressors and demands that musicians face in their training can manifest in performance-related pain and discomfort, performance anxiety, and occupational stress, all of which can be detrimental to wellbeing and pose significant barriers to performing effectively. Recently, studies have focused on a more positive psychological approach to performance in order to encourage and reinforce health-promoting behaviors in conservatoires and schools of music. Further studies are now underway, for instance examining pre-performance routines and effective methods for recovering from acute stress, with the principal aim of developing musician-tailored mental skills training programs.

15,From mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Implications for clinical practice and disease management: A mini-review,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive disease characterized by partially irreversible chronic airflow limitation. Current literature highlights that COPD patients also have an increased risk to develop Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Chronic patients with cognitive impairment experience a worsening of health-related quality of life, mainly because it could affect treatment self-management, medication adherence and personal independence. Moreover, they also report high levels of anxiety and depression, which are associated with disease severity, poor quality of life, poor adherence to rehabilitation programs and difficulties in self-management. In current literature, there is a lack of studies describing simultaneously the associations between cognitive impairment, dysfunctional psychosocial factors, self-management abilities and their impact on pharmacological/non-pharmacological adherence. Therefore, the aim of the present short review is to describe the implications of cognitive impairment and psychosocial factors for clinical practice and disease management in COPD patients. Due to the interaction of these factors on adherence to rehabilitation programs, self-management and rehabilitation completion, future research should investigate simultaneously the role of all these different aspects to individuate a specific clinical approach that might include specific screening tools to evaluate cognitive impairment and psychosocial difficulties. A timely specific evaluation, within an interdisciplinary approach, could help to implement a more individualized and personalized treatment.

16,"Respiratory variability, sighing, anxiety, and breathing symptoms in low- and high-anxious music students before and after performing","Music performance anxiety (MPA) is a major problem for music students. It is largely unknown whether music students who experience high or low anxiety differ in their respiratory responses to performance situations and whether these co-vary with self-reported anxiety, tension, and breathing symptoms. Affective processes influence dynamic respiratory regulation in ways that are reflected in measures of respiratory variability and sighing. This study had two goals. First, we determined how measures of respiratory variability, sighing, self-reported anxiety, tension, and breathing symptoms vary as a function of the performance situation (practice vs. public performance), performance phase (pre-performance vs. post-performance), and the general MPA level of music students. Second, we analyzed to what extent self-reported anxiety, tension, and breathing symptoms co-vary with the respiratory responses. The participants were 65 university music students. We assessed their anxiety, tension, and breathing symptoms with Likert scales and recorded their respiration with the LifeShirt system during a practice performance and a public performance. For the 10-min periods before and after each performance, we computed number of sighs, coefficients of variation (CVs, a measure of total variability), autocorrelations at one breath lag (ARs(1), a measure of non-random variability) and means of minute ventilation (V’ E ), tidal volume (V T ), inspiration time (T I ), and expiration time (T E ). CVs and sighing were greater whereas AR(1) of V’ E was lower in the public session than in the practice session. The effect of the performance situation on CVs and sighing was larger for high-MPA than for low-MPA participants. Higher MPA levels were associated with lower CVs. At the within-individual level, anxiety, tension, and breathing symptoms were associated with deeper and slower breathing, greater CVs, lower AR(1) of V’ E , and more sighing. We conclude that respiratory variability and sighing are sensitive to the performance situation and to musicians’ general MPA level. Moreover, anxiety, tension, breathing symptoms, and respiratory responses co-vary significantly in the context of music performance situations. Respiratory monitoring can add an important dimension to the understanding of music performance situations and MPA and to the diagnostic and intervention outcome assessments of MPA.

17,Response: Commentary: Measuring counterintuitiveness in supernatural agent dream imagery,"Reply by the current author to the comments made by Robert Eugene Sears (see record 2020-00757-001) on the original article (see record 2019-50802-001). Sears comment partly addresses the main purpose of our article (Nordin and Bjälkebring, 2019) about counterintuitiveness in dreaming. In sum, Sears’s remarks offer some constructive suggestions and discussion, but we take issue with the overly dismissive comments on the article. We consider the criticism of vagueness to be exaggerated, while the criticism that we lack evidence of threat/anxiety in the empirical data is simply irrelevant, given the aim of the article. The charge of the article’s limited value also has low credibility, even from the commenter’s point of view, because (a) references to our most important concepts and to the entire research field of minimal counterintuitive (MCI) and counterintuitiveness are omitted from Sears’s criteria; (b) it overestimates a priori the explanatory value of other less well-established concepts in the field; and (c) it wrongly suggests that the article lacks any description of “unexpectedness”-type phenomena, when in fact it does describe them.

18,Social networks use disorder and associations with depression and anxiety symptoms: A systematic review of recent research in China,"Background: An increasing number of studies have investigated Social Networks Use Disorder (SNUD) among Western samples. In this context, the investigation of SNUD in Asia and especially in China has been much neglected. This poses a gap in the literature; it has been estimated that more than one billion Chinese people are using Chinese social networking sites (SNSs). Of note, many of these Chinese SNSs are rather unknown to researchers in Western countries. Aims: The primary objective of the present systematic review was to identify and evaluate studies that investigated Chinese SNS use and associations between SNUD and depression and anxiety symptoms. Method: A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, MEDLINE, ProQuest, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI). Results: The search strategy identified 35 potential studies, 13 studies were identified after shortlisting and full-text reviews of the studies, and finally 10 studies were included in the full review. Associations between SNUD, depression, and anxiety were reported in 10 studies. In eight (of the 10) studies, symptom severity of SNUD was associated with depression. Four studies reported associations between SNUD and anxiety. Most studies had utilized cross-sectional survey designs. Conclusions: Most associations were found between SNUD and depression symptoms, but effect sizes were higher between SNUD and anxiety symptoms. The results have the potential to inform prevention and interventions on SNUD in Eastern cultures, although we explicitly state that our work focuses on China, the transfer of the present observations to other Asian countries (and their cultures) still needs to be established.

19,A multidimensional perspective on individual differences in multilingual learners’ L2 Chinese speech production,"To date, research has been undertaken to reveal factors contributing to learners’ second/foreign language (L2) speaking and/or learning at particular points in time in separate studies from cognitive, affective, and socio-cultural perspectives as individual variables. Nonetheless, little research has concurrently investigated L2 speaking with the same cohort of learners as participants from these perspectives in a single study, to obtain comprehensive and systematic understandings of how the three dimensions of factors work together in influencing individuals’ L2 speaking. This study, utilizing Segalowitz’s (2010) L2 speech production framework as the theoretical lens, examined a group of L2 Chinese multilinguals’ perceptions toward their speech performance and production ability development, attempting to comprehensively and systematically uncover the factors influencing L2 speaking from the three perspectives mentioned above. We collected data through focus groups and semi-structured interviews from 17 advanced level L2 Chinese multilinguals. The findings of the study revealed that factors that influenced the L2 Chinese multilinguals’ speech performance and their development of such an ability included the following: (1) age of acquisition, cognitive fluency, learning styles, and speaking strategies; (2) motivation, anxiety, speaking self-efficacy, and willingness-to-communicate; (3) L2 cultural interest, L2 communities, and L2 classes; and (4) multilingualism. We conclude that the development of L2 Chinese speech production ability could be the result of the synergies gained from the cognitive, affective, and socio-cultural dimensions of L2 learning and use. Insights into L2 Chinese teachers and learners in terms of how to support and sustain the improvement of L2 Chinese speech production ability are also discussed.

20,Relationship between psychological distress and cognitive function differs as a function of obesity status in inpatient heart failure,"Heart failure (HF) is a chronic medical condition rapidly growing in prevalence. Evidence links HF to cognitive decline, obesity, and psychological distress. The current study examined the association between cognitive function and ejection fraction (EF%), anxiety, depression, and obesity in inpatient HF. Patients completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), and Mini-Cog while hospitalized for HF. Additional demographic and medical information was gathered via chart review. All models controlled for age. Of 117 patients assessed (49% male), 55% ( n = 64) were obese. ANCOVA analyses were conducted comparing those with obesity and without on cognitive function: model A included EF%, model B included depression, and model C included anxiety. All three models were significantly related to cognitive function. There was a significant interaction effect of EF% and obesity and of anxiety and obesity to predict Mini-Cog scores. Post hoc partial correlational analyses revealed that anxiety was negatively associated with Mini-Cog scores among only patients without obesity. Depression was not significantly related to cognitive function in either group. However, patients with obesity demonstrated higher depression and anxiety than patients without. Results suggest that at lower EF%, and with higher anxiety, patients without obesity may be at greater risk of cognitive dysfunction than those with obesity. Cognitive dysfunction among HF patients with obesity may be independent of psychological distress. These findings may reflect the “obesity paradox” observed among HF patients, in that patients with obesity may have a different biopsychosocial presentation, which may lead to unexpected clinical outcomes. Further research is necessary to articulate the relationship of obesity and cognitive function in HF.

21,Metacognitive therapy for adjustment disorder in a patient with newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension: A case report,"Adjustment disorders (ADs) belong to the worldwide most diagnosed mental disorders and are particularly frequent in patients with an underlying physical illness. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe and disabling disease, which significantly impacts on quality of life and has high mortality rates. The authors here present the case of a young female who developed a severe adjustment disorder with both anxious and depressive symptoms after a diagnosis of PAH requiring intensive care treatment due to right heart failure. Psychosocial functioning was severely impaired, and physical health reduced. Following hemodynamic stabilization and the establishment of PAH treatment, the patient was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and received metacognitive therapy (MCT). AD with mixed anxiety and depressed mood was diagnosed according to DSM-V criteria. At the start of treatment, she reported significant mental distress, indicated by a total sum score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) of 20 points. The 6-min walking distance was only 358 m before the patient was exhausted. She then was treated with MCT without further psychopharmacological drugs. After only four MCT sessions, she fully remitted from AD which was accompanied by an 11-point reduction in the HADS (to 9 points). MCT specific scores also improved (MCQ-30 sum score decreased from 77 to 35). Notably, physical capacity improved as well, documented by an improved walking distance (439 m; +22%). This is the first case of a patient with AD in the context of PAH treated with MCT. The case report suggests that MCT is a possible psychotherapeutic treatment option for AD in the context of a potentially life-threatening disease. The study design does not permit an attribution of outcome to MCT but it suggests MCT is a potentially viable and acceptable treatment option.

22,Early exposure to cardiac treatment and distress among patients and their caregiving partners,"Background: The experience of an acute coronary event (ACE), including early care and evaluation, can be a distressing and traumatic experience for patients and their romantic partners, who also act as caregivers. We hypothesized that, among partners who were present during the ACE, those who were also present during (1) transportation to the hospital and (2) initial medical treatment would experience greater (a) anxiety early post-event and (b) posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) related to the event 4 months later. The associations between partner presence with patient anxiety and PSS were also explored. Methods: Participants were ACE patients and their partners recruited between March 2015 and December 2016 from the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) of the Sheba Medical Center in Israel ( N = 143; all patients were males and partners were females). Partners self-reported whether or not they were present during the cardiac event, the hospital drive, and initial care. Patients and partners self-reported anxiety in-hospital and PSS, keyed to the ACE, an average of 4 months later. Data were analyzed using General Estimating Equations (GEE) and Multilevel Modeling. Results: Neither patient anxiety nor PSS differed according to partner presence during the drive to the hospital. In contrast, partners had higher anxiety when they were not present at all (difference = 3.65, p = 0.019) and when present during the event and during the drive (difference = 2.93, p = 0.029) as compared to when they were present for the event but not for the drive. Partners who were present during the event, but not the drive, had lower PSS than those who were present for both the event and the drive (difference = −4.64, p = 0.026). Conclusions: Partners who accompany patients on the drive to the hospital may inadvertently put themselves at risk for greater distress following their loved one’s cardiac event. Future research should enroll couples in an acute care context to inform couple-targeted tailored interventions to reduce distress in patients and their caregiving partners.

23,Investigating the role of interpretation bias in mindfulness-based treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder,"Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have garnered empirical support for a wide range of psychological conditions, the psychological processes that mediate the relationship between MBIs and subsequent symptomatic improvement are less well-understood. In the present study we sought to examine, for the first time, the relationship between mindfulness, negative interpretation bias as measured by the homophone task, and anxiety among adults with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Forty-two individuals with GAD completed measures of mindfulness, interpretation bias, and anxiety before and after treatment with Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Contrary to prior research, we did not find evidence of an indirect relationship between baseline levels of mindfulness and anxiety via negative interpretation bias. MBSR did result in significant reductions in negative interpretation bias from baseline to post-treatment; however, we did not find evidence of an indirect relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in anxiety via changes in interpretation bias. Taken together, these results provide minimal support for the hypothesized relationship between mindfulness, negative interpretation bias, and anxiety among adults with GAD. Limitations and specific suggestions for further inquiry are discussed.

24,Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 in women diagnosed with breast cancer,"Background: Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a trait-like predisposing factor for the prevalence of anxiety in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) has been widely used in both general and clinical samples for measuring AS. However, the data about its psychometric properties in women with breast cancer are deficient. In addition, there is no evidence proving the measure equivalence of ASI- 3 across sociodemographic variables in the specific sample. Thus, the present study examined the psychometric properties and conducted measure equivalence testing of ASI-3 in Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: This study included 815 Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer. Single group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was administrated to detect the factorial validity of ASI-3, and multigroup CFAs were conducted to test the measurement equivalence of ASI-3 across various sociodemographic variables. The reliability of ASI-3 was tested by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, Guttman split-half coefficient, McDonald’s omega coefficient, and test–retest coefficient. The standardized factor loadings, construct reliability, and the average variance extracted of factors were used to measure the construct validity of ASI-3, and the partial correlations were conducted to examine the criterion-related validity of ASI-3. Results: The ASI-3 had satisfactory reliability and validity in Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer; three-factor model fitted the data well in CFA and reached partial strict invariances across age, education, and residence groups. Conclusion: This study explored the psychometric properties and measurement invariance across sociodemographic variables of ASI-3 in Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer. Our results not only proved that the ASI-3 is an appropriate instrument for measuring AS but also deepened the understanding of ASI-3 in Chinese women with malignancy.

25,The relationship between resilience and mental health in Chinese college students: A longitudinal cross-lagged analysis,"The relationship between resilience and mental health was examined in three phases over 4 years in a sample of 314 college students in China. The present study aimed to gain insight into the reciprocal relationship of higher levels of resilience predicting lower levels of mental ill-being, and higher levels of positive mental health, and vice versa, and track changes in both resilience, mental ill-being and positive mental health over 4 years. We used the Depression Anxiety Stress, the Positive Mental Health, and the Resilience Scales. Results revealed that first-year students and senior year students experienced higher negative mental health levels and lower positive mental health levels than junior year students. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling analyses showed that resilience could significantly predict mental health status in the short term, namely within 1 year from junior to senior year. However, the predicting function of resilience for mental health is not significant in the long term, namely within 2 years from freshman to junior year. Additionally, the significant predicting function of individuals’ mental health for resilience is fully verified for both the short and long term. These results indicate that college mental health education and interventions could be tailored based on students’ year in college.

26,"Anxiety and emotional intelligence: Comparisons between combat sports, gender and levels using the trait meta-mood scale and the inventory of situations and anxiety response","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 11[889] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record 2020-35633-001). In the original article, there were errors in affiliations 1 and 2. Instead of: ¹ Department of Sports, Faculty of Physical Activity and Sports, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Madrid, Spain and ² Faculty of Education and Humanities, Francisco de Vitoria University, Madrid, Spain, it should be: ¹ Department of Sports, Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences-INEF, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), Madrid, Spain and ² Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV), Madrid, Spain. The original article has been updated.] The present study compared emotional intelligence and anxiety between six combat sports of lower, intermediate and high-level female and male athletes. The sample was composed by 444 athletes (age: 24.7 ± 8.8 years, body mass: 72.4 ± 12.1 kg, height: 1.82 ± 0.3 m, and practice time: 13.1 ± 7.4 years) separated by sex (male n = 273, female n = 171) from different combat sports (jiu-jitsu n = 142, judo n = 137, karate n = 57, kendo n = 63, taekwondo n = 25, and freestyle wrestling n = 20) of three levels (high-level n = 57, intermediate n = 137 and low-level n = 142). Inventory of situations and anxiety response (ISRA) provided an independent evaluation for the three systems: cognitive, motor and physiological, as well as a total with four factors of analysis (anxiety before the evaluation, interpersonal, phobic and before habitual, and daily situations). Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) verified emotional intelligence scales. Descriptive results are demonstrated by percentage or median (first quartile Q1; third quartile Q3), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to compare groups, p ≤ 0.05. The main results demonstrated 10% more total anxiety for wrestling and judo compared to the other groups ( p ≤ 0.05). Female athletes showed 15% more anxiety than men, while emotional attention demonstrated 10% better results for women. Significant differences were observed between high- versus low-level athletes in the total anxiety with 85 (44; 143) versus 122 (69; 186) of ISRA index and emotional repair with 30 (25; 34) versus 27 (22; 32) of TMMS-24 index. Emotional intelligence seems to be higher in female and in higher level, while anxiety appears to be prevalent in judo and wrestling, low-level and in female athletes. These outcomes provide support for the hypothesis that emotional abilities are an important contributor to emotional intelligence, particularly differentiating high level athletes than other levels. Results can be incorporated into strategies for reducing anxiety and improving emotional intelligence, considering particularities of gender and level groups.

27,"Emotional intelligence, belongingness, and mental health in college students","Mental health problems are prevalent amongst today’s college students and psychosocial stress has been identified as a strong contributing factor. Conversely, research has documented that emotional intelligence (EQ) is a protective factor for depression, anxiety and stress (mental health problems). However, the underlying mechanism whereby EQ may support stronger mental health is currently not well understood. This study used regression analyses to examine the hypothesis that belongingness (inclusion, rejection) partially mediates the effects of EQ (attention, clarity, repair) on psychological well-being in a large sample ( N = 2,094) of undergraduate students. Results supported the mediation hypotheses for all three EQ components and highlighted that the effects of rejection on psychological well-being were particularly strong. In line with prior research, our results indicate that prevention and intervention efforts with college students could explicitly target EQ skills in an effort to reduce perceived rejection and promote student well-being.

28,Perceived teacher autonomy support and school engagement of Tibetan students in elementary and middle schools: Mediating effect of self-efficacy and academic emotions,"School engagement (SE) refers to the intensity and quality of emotions experienced by students when commencing and carrying out learning activities, and includes behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. A high SE level promotes academic achievement, reduces students’ behavioral problems, and prevents school dropout. This study, whose participants were 819 students from Tibetan areas, explored the impact of teacher autonomy support (TAS) on students’ SE and the mechanisms involved in this relationship. The results showed that TAS had a positive impact on SE, while students’ self-efficacy had a mediating effect between TAS and SE. On the one hand, TAS affected self-efficacy through academic interest and ultimately influenced SE; moreover, TAS negatively affected academic anxiety, indirectly inhibiting the negative effect of academic anxiety on SE through self-efficacy. The theoretical and practical implications of the study findings are discussed.

29,Anxiety and depression after a cardiac event: Prevalence and predictors,"Introduction: Patients who are anxious or depressed after an acute cardiac event are at increased risk of a subsequent event and premature death. It is therefore important to identify these patients early in order to initiate supportive or even preventive measures. In the present study, we report on the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first 12 months after an acute cardiac event, and the patient characteristics predictive of increased anxiety and depression risk in early and late convalescence. Methods: We recruited a sample of 911 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and/or unstable angina (UA), and/or undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS). Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) close to the time of their event, and again during early (2–4 months post-event) and late (6–12 months post-event) convalescence. Using HADS-A and HADS-D cut-offs of 8+, prevalence rates for anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety and depression were determined for each timepoint. Chi-square tests and odds ratios were used to identify baseline patient characteristics associated with increased anxiety and depression risk over 12 months. Results: Anxiety rates were 43, 28, and 27% at the time of the event, early, and late convalescence. Depression rates were 22, 17, and 15%, respectively. Factors consistently associated with increased anxiety and depression risk were history of depression, financial strain, poor self-rated health, low socioeconomic status, younger age (&lt; 55 years), and smoking. Obesity, diabetes, and social isolation (living alone or being unpartnered) were identified as important albeit less significant risk factors. Neither sex nor event type were predictive of anxiety or depression. Conclusion: This large patient sample provided the opportunity to identify rates of anxiety and depression during the 12 months after a cardiac event and key patient characteristics for increased risk. These risk factors are easily identifiable at the time of the event, and could be used to guide the targeting of support programs for patients at risk.

30,Gender differences in mathematics motivation: Differential effects on performance in primary education,"In addition to attempting to verify gender differences, this study aims to examine the explanatory potential of boys’ and girls’ attitudes toward mathematics on their performance. The sample comprised 897 students in the 5th and 6th years of primary education (450 boys and 447 girls). The results confirm what previous research has suggested, that girls tended to exhibit less positive attitudes about mathematics than their male classmates, in particular lower motivation, worse perception of competence, and higher rates of anxiety, although in all cases the effect sizes were small. Even though there no significant gender differences in academic performance, as expected, the explanatory power of attitudes toward mathematics was clearly more significant in boys than in girls ( R ² = 0.194 and R ² = 0.103, respectively). The results of the regression analysis for each sample reinforce the well-known positive impact of perceived self-efficacy on mathematics performance and introduce the effect of achievement emotions of academic performance. Test anxiety in mathematics seems to only have a negative effect on boys’ grades, as this variable does not appear in the regression equation when explaining girls’ performance. In the light of control-value theory, we discuss the contingency of perceived competence and its involvement in anxiety and academic performance. Boys’ results could be affected by the levels of anxiety inasmuch as they tend to be confident in their abilities, motivated to stand out, and interested in mathematics. Whereas despite girls reporting high rates of anxiety, what may have a negative impact on their results might have more to do with a higher value placed on mathematics, as their perception of control may be low.

31,"Traumatic stress, attachment style, and health outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation patients","Objective: Research on psychosocial risk factors in cardiovascular disease (CVD) has identified traumatic stress and attachment style as independent risk factors for the development of CVD and poor prognosis for those with established CVD. Exploring the interrelationships between these variables will inform psychosocial risk factor modeling and potential avenues for intervention. Therefore, the hypothesis that attachment style is related to health outcomes among CR patients and that traumatic stress mediates this relationship was tested. Methods: Patients in a cardiac rehabilitation program ( n = 201) completed validated self-report measures of traumatic stress and attachment style at baseline (program intake). Health outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months, including anxiety, depression, quality of life, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and cholesterol (HDL ratio). Multivariate structural equation modeling was used to fit the data. Results: Of the 201 participants, 42 (21%) had trauma scores indicating the probable presence of posttraumatic stress disorder. Via greater levels of traumatic stress, greater attachment anxiety at baseline was indirectly related to greater anxiety, depression, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c, and poorer physical and mental quality of life. There were no significant indirect effects on HDL ratios. Conclusion: Greater attachment anxiety predicted greater traumatic stress; this, in turn, predicted poorer health outcomes. Screening and treatment for these constructs in CVD patients is warranted.

32,An animal model for mammalian attachment: Infant titi monkey ( &lt;i&gt;Plecturocebus cupreus&lt;/i&gt;) attachment behavior is associated with their social behavior as adults,"Close social bonds are integral for good health and longevity in humans and non-human primates (NHPs), yet we have very little understanding of the neurobiological differences between healthy and unhealthy relationships. Our current understanding of social bonding is grounded in Bowlby’s theory of attachment. Work done with human infants and adult couples has suggested that attachment behavior developed in infancy remains stable through development into adulthood. Unfortunately, knowledge of the neurobiological correlates of attachment behavior has been limited due to a lack of animal models with both infant and adult attachments similar to humans. To address this, we measured behavioral responses to separation from their primary attachment figure in infant and adult titi monkeys ( Plecturocebus cupreus ). In Experiment 1, we tested for a linear relationship between the subject’s response to separation as an infant and their response to separation as an adult. We found greater decreases in infant locomotor behavior in the presence, as opposed to absence, of their primary attachment figure to be indicative of decreased anxiety-like behavior in the presence, as opposed to absence, of their adult pair mates during a novelty response task. In Experiment 2, we increased our sample size, accounted for adverse early experience, and tested a different outcome measure, adult affiliative behavior. We hypothesized that the level of intensity of an infant’s response to separation would explain affiliative behavior with their mate as an adult, but adverse early experience could change this relationship. When we compared infant response to separation to adult affiliative behavior during the first 6 months of their first adult pair bond, we observed a linear relationship for infants with typical early experience, but not for infants with adverse early experience. Infants with a greater change in locomotive behavior between the father and alone conditions were more affiliative with their first adult pair mate. These data support the use of titi monkeys as an appropriate animal model for further investigation of the neurobiology underlying attachment behavior.

33,Body-centered interventions for psychopathological conditions: A review,"World-wide, billions of dollars are spent each year on body-centered interventions to alleviate both physical and psychological pathologies. Given the high demand and increasing popularity of body-centered interventions, there is need for a systematic organization of empirical evidence associated with body-centered therapies. This article reviews the psychological effects of body-centered interventions on emotional well-being, including both self and other-administered (receptive) therapies. Theory behind body-centered interventions rely upon the bidirectional communication pathway between the brain and body. We investigated the bidirectional communication pathway between the brain and body by evaluating evidence across multiple body-centered therapies. The research reviewed includes studies that investigate effects of massage therapy, reflexology, acupuncture, functional relaxation, emotional freedom technique, Rolfing, yoga, tai-chi, and dance/movement therapy on psychological conditions across the lifespan. Results demonstrated that overall, massage therapy, tai-chi, dance/movement therapy, functional relaxation, reflexology, acupuncture and emotional freedom technique seem to alleviate stress, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and facilitate pain reduction. Of these, the most robust evidence available was for massage therapy, indicating it is an effective intervention for numerous age groups and populations. Rolfing and reflexology had the least amount of support, with few studies available that had small sample sizes. Although these conclusions are limited by scarcity of high-quality empirical data and contradictory findings, available evidence indicates that body-centered interventions can be effective in reducing psychopathology and supports the proposed mechanism of the bidirectional pathway between the brain and body: the body holds the potential to influence the mind. Integrating body-centered therapies in both clinical settings and as self-care could lead to better outcomes. Lastly, we propose the first taxonomy of body-centered interventions and empirical evidence of their effectiveness for clinicians and researchers.

34,"Scared to trust?—Predicting trust in highly automated driving by depressiveness, negative self-evaluations and state anxiety","The advantages of automated driving can only come fully into play if these systems are used in an appropriate way, which means that they are neither used in situations they are not designed for (misuse) nor used in a too restricted manner (disuse). Trust in automation has been found to be an essential psychological basis for appropriate interaction with automated systems. Well-balanced system use requires a calibrated level of trust in correspondence with the actual ability of an automated system. As for these far-reaching implications of trust for safe and efficient system use, the psychological processes, in which trust is dynamically calibrated prior and during the use of automated technology, need to be understood. At this point, only a restricted body of research investigated the role of personality and emotional states for the formation of trust in automated systems. In this research, the role of the personality variables depressiveness, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and locus of control for the experience of anxiety before the first experience with a highly automated driving system were investigated. Additionally, the relationship of the investigated personality variables and anxiety to subsequent formation of trust in automation was investigated. In a driving simulator study, personality variables and anxiety were measured before the interaction with an automated system. Trust in the system was measured after participants drove with the system for a while. Trust in the system was significantly predicted by state anxiety and the personality characteristics self-esteem and self-efficacy. The relationships of self-esteem and self-efficacy were mediated by state anxiety as supported by significant specific indirect effects. While for depression the direct relationship with trust in automation was not found to be significant, an indirect effect through the experience of anxiety was supported. Locus of control did not show a significant association to trust in automation. The reported findings support the importance of considering individual differences in negative self-evaluations and anxiety when being introduced to a new automated system for individual differences in trust in automation. Implications for future research as well as implications for the design of automated technology in general and automated driving systems are discussed.

35,The vicissitudes of homophobic victimization in adolescence: An explorative study,"This study investigates the role of parental and peer relationships’ quality on homophobic victimization and possible consequences on mental health during adolescence. Participants were 394 adolescents, (41.6% male and 58.4% female) aged 15–20 years ( M = 16.55; SD = 0.85), attending the third and fourth classes of public high schools in Italy. Participants completed the Homophobic Bullying Scale to evaluate homophobic victimization toward gays and lesbians or assumed homosexuals, the Symptom Check-list-90 to evaluate mental health, and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment to investigate the quality of peer and parental relationships (in terms of communication, disaffection, and trust). Results show how the quality of peer relationships is not connected with victimization, but the quality of parental relationships is linked with homophobic victimization. Finally, the victimization is connected with anxiety and somatization problems. Theoretical and educational implications were discussed.

36,Cyberbullying in the university setting. Relationship with emotional problems and adaptation to the university,"Little scientific attention has been paid to the problem of cyberbullying in the university environment, compared to similar studies conducted on adolescents. This study attempts to analyze the predictive capacity of certain emotional problems (anxiety, depression, and stress) and university adaptation with respect to cyberbullying in victims and aggressors. The European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire were administered to a sample of 1282 university students (46.33% male) aged between 18 and 46. The results suggest that high levels of depression and stress increase the probability of being a cyberbullying victim, while high levels of depression increase the probability of being a cyberbullying aggressor. Similarly, the personal–emotional and social adaptation of students are found to be predictor variables of being a cyberbullying victim, in that high levels of personal–emotional and social adaptation decrease the probability of being a victim, while high levels of personal–emotional, academic and institutional adaptation decrease the probability of being a cyberbullying victim. The results of this study are of special relevance, since they indicate that intervention programs should consider the influence of emotional intelligence, as well as the relevance students’ adaptation to university.

37,Personality predictors of yips and choking susceptibility,"The ability to perform under heightened levels of pressures is one of the largest discriminators of those who achieve success in competition and those who do not. There are several phenomena associated with breakdowns in an athlete’s performance in a high-pressure environment, collectively known as paradoxical performances. The two most prevalent and researched forms of paradoxical performance are the yips and choking. The aim of the current study is to investigate a range of psychological traits (fear of negative evaluation, individual differences, anxiety sensitivity, self-consciousness, perfectionistic self-presentation, and perfectionism) and their ability to predict susceptibility to choking and the yips in an experienced athlete sample. 155 athletes (Golfers n = 86; Archers n = 69) completed six trait measures and a self-report measure of yips or choking experience. The prevalence rate for choking and yips in both archers and golfers was 67.7 and 39.4%, respectively. A 2 × 2 × 2 MANOVA and discriminant function analysis revealed that a combination of 11 variables correctly classified 71% of choking and non-choking participants. Furthermore, analysis confirmed that a combination of four variables correctly classified 69% of the yips and non-yips affected participants. In this first study to examine both paradoxical performances simultaneously, these findings revealed that for the yips, all predictors stemmed from social sources (i.e., perfectionistic self-presentation), whereas choking was associated with anxiety and perfectionism, as well as social traits. This important distinction identified here should now be tested to understand the role of these traits as development or consequential factors of choking and the yips.

38,Validation of a short-form five facet mindfulness questionnaire instrument in China,"The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) developed by Baer and colleagues has been widely used owing to its satisfactory psychometric properties. Because there was not yet a short-form version of the FFMQ (SF-FFMQ) that could be utilized in work settings available in China, we developed a Chinese SF-FFMQ. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a five-factor structure of our Chinese SF-FFMQ in two Chinese samples (Sample 1, N = 535; Sample 2, N = 391). The internal consistencies of the facets and the whole scale were acceptable. The predictive validity of this questionnaire was affirmed. Overall, the mindfulness facets correlated with related constructs including depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, employee life well-being, employee workplace well-being, and employee psychological well-being. In sample 2, which consisted of participants employed by local companies, we found that mindfulness mediated a positive relationship between servant leadership and employees' satisfaction with work-family balance. In conclusion, our Chinese SF-FFMQ was found to be a valid and reliable measurement tool and our results support its use in both research and practice in clinical and work settings in China.

39,"Workplace bullying, anxiety, and job performance: Choosing between “passive resistance” or “swallowing the insult”?","Anxiety arising from workplace bullying is a key concern for job performance. Anxiety can explain the effects of workplace bullying: individuals may seek to deal with their anxiety by applying specific behaviors. However, anxiety research does not carefully distinguish between state anxiety and trait anxiety, and so the impact of anxiety in general has been seen as complex and contradictory. Individuals may respond to bullying and anxiety through “passive resistance” or by “swallowing the insult.” However, under what circumstances do individuals choose between these options? This paper summarizes the mechanisms of state anxiety and trait anxiety and uses cognitive balance theory to measure loss of self-control and the strategic choices. A moderated mediation model is presented for the relationship between workplace bullying and job performance using key variables of state anxiety and trait anxiety. Employee-supervisor pairs from 20 organizations and institutions from Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Hainan participated in a two-point longitudinal survey in 2019, 82.67% effective. Analysis verified that trait anxiety is the decisive perspective for choosing between “passive resistance” and “swallowing the insult.” This provides theoretical and practical contributions to psychology and organizational behavior research.

40,Metacognitive therapy for individuals at high risk of developing psychosis: A pilot study,"Developing effective interventions for preventing first episode psychosis have been an important research focus in the last decade. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a currently indicated treatment for people at ultra-high risk of psychosis, however, access and resource issues limit its delivery within the NHS. Treatments which partial out potential active ingredients and are aimed at a range of psychological difficulties seen within this population have the potential to be more efficacious and efficient. We conducted a single-arm exploratory pilot trial, designed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of Metacognitive therapy for individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis. Trial uptake was good, with 11 out of 12 referred individuals meeting for an eligibility assessment (one individual was excluded prior to the assessment). Of these, 10 individuals were eligible and included in the trial. Retention to treatment was high with 80% treatment adherence gained and an overall average of 8 sessions completed. All participants were offered follow-up assessments immediately post-treatment and at 6 months, which comprised measures of psychotic like experiences, anxiety and depression, and metacognitive processes implicated in the model. Retention to the post-treatment (12-week) follow-up was good, with 80% completion; however retention to the 6-month follow-up was lower at 60%. Clinically significant results were observed in psychotic like experiences, anxiety, depression and functioning with medium to large effect sizes. Measures related to beliefs and processes targeted within MCT showed clinically significant change with medium to large effect sizes. Our results suggest that MCT based upon a specific metacognitive model for individuals meeting ARMS criteria may be an important treatment target and warrants further attention. Limitations and possible focuses for future research are discussed. Registration: ISRCTN53190465 http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN53190465.

41,OCB-work-family facilitation: Is it positive for all attachment orientations?,"The present study seeks to expand on research concerning the benefits of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) to work-family facilitation (WFF) by integrating the theoretical framework of the attachment personality perspective (Bowlby, 1982). We hypothesized that OCB would enhance WFF for employees having lower levels of avoidance and anxious orientations but reduce WFF for employees with higher levels of avoidance and anxiety orientations. Two studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. Study 1 adopted a cross-sectional design, and Study 2 implemented a diary procedure. In Study 1, employees from a pharmaceutical company completed attachment orientations and WFF questionnaires, whereas their direct supervisors assessed the participants’ OCB. In Study 2, attachment orientations of 108 participants were assessed, with OCB and WFF measures collected over 10 days. Findings from both studies supported our hypotheses relating to avoidance orientations. Performing OCB can enhance WFF, with the effect stronger for employees having lower avoidance orientations. However, findings regarding anxiety orientations were non-significant. A better understanding of the role that attachment orientations play in the OCB—WFF association may facilitate implementing possible interventions that could benefit both the organization and the family.

42,"Minimum time dose in nature to positively impact the mental health of college-aged students, and how to measure it: A scoping review","Background: Across the U.S., college and university students exhibit high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. While counseling, medications and, in more severe cases, hospitalization are all appropriate treatments for such conditions, an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that spending time in nature can provide tangible benefits for mental health and well-being. The aim of this study was to define a “dose” of time in nature that could be prescribed to college-age students, as a preventative and supportive mental health and well-being intervention. The specific objectives of this scoping review were thus: to define the minimum amount of time in nature that results in positive impact on mental health and well-being for college-aged students; to describe the types of engagement with nature that elicited the impact; and to describe and explore the most commonly used measure of effect pre- and post-time in nature. Methods: This scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. A review protocol was developed but not registered. Fourteen bibliographic databases were searched and all results were blindly screened using established inclusion criteria. All titles and abstracts were screened by at least two reviewers, a third being used as a tie-breaker if needed. Studies were included if: subjects were of average college age; they examined a treatment of time (hours or minutes) in nature; they examined change in measures of mental health and well-being pre- and post-exposure; they compared participants across at least two environments; the study was published in English or French; and if the study was &lt; 20 years old. Results: Initially, 11,799 titles were identified and once de-duplicated, 10,917 titles were screened. One hundred fifty-five papers were given full text reviews, of which 14 studies were included in this review. In summary, 13 of the 14 papers explicitly noted that the participants were college students. Two-thirds of the studies ( n = 10) took place in Japan. One study took place in Sweden, and the remaining studies took place in the United States ( n = 3). These studies show that, when contrasted with equal durations spent in urbanized settings, as little as 10 min of sitting or walking in a diverse array of natural settings significantly and positively impacted defined psychological and physiological markers of mental well-being for college-aged individuals. Within the included studies, 22 different measures were used to assess the effects of nature doses on mental health and well-being. Conclusions: This review provides time-dose and activity-type evidence for programs looking to use time in nature as a preventative measure for stress and mental health strain, and also demonstrates opportunities in six specific foci for more research in this area.

43,Social transmission of leadership preference: Knowledge of group membership and partisan media reporting moderates perceptions of leadership ability from facial cues to competence and dominance,"While first impressions of dominance and competence can influence leadership preference, social transmission of leadership preference has received little attention. The capacity to transmit, store and compute information has increased greatly over recent history, and the new media environment may encourage partisanship (i.e., “echo chambers”), misinformation and rumor spreading to support political and social causes and be conducive both to emotive writing and emotional contagion, which may shape voting behavior. In our pre-registered experiment, we examined whether implicit associations between facial cues to dominance and competence (intelligence) and leadership ability are strengthened by partisan media and knowledge that leaders support or oppose us on a socio-political issue of personal importance. Social information, in general, reduced well-established implicit associations between facial cues and leadership ability. However, as predicted, social knowledge of group membership reduced preferences for facial cues to high dominance and intelligence in out-group leaders. In the opposite-direction to our original prediction, this “in-group bias” was greater under less partisan versus partisan media, with partisan writing eliciting greater state anxiety across the sample. Partisanship also altered the salience of women’s facial appearance (i.e., cues to high dominance and intelligence) in out-group versus in-group leaders. Independent of the media environment, men and women displayed an in-group bias toward facial cues of dominance in same-sex leaders. Our findings reveal effects of minimal social information (facial appearance, group membership, media reporting) on leadership judgments, which may have implications for patterns of voting or socio-political behavior at the local or national level.

44,A systematic review of metacognitive beliefs in chronic medical conditions,"Background: Psychological functioning plays an important role in medical conditions and impacts patients' quality of life. Previously, many studies have highlighted the association of metacognition to both the development and maintenance of emotional disorders. Recently, several researchers pointed out the relevant role of dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs in the context of chronic diseases. Hence, dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs could be directly related to anxiety and depression, regardless of the medical condition's expression. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available evidence regarding the association of metacognition with anxiety, depression, and perceived quality of life, in the context of medical conditions, according to Wells' theory. Methods: A systematic review based on electronic bibliographic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Web of Knowledge) of scientific literature was carried out. Studies involving patients evaluated in clinical settings were included in the analysis. Results: Our findings indicated that metacognition appears to be related to anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with medical chronic conditions. Therefore, dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs might be a relevant factor associated with the process of adapting to illness. Conclusions: The additional evaluation of metacognitive factors in the context of several medical chronic conditions appears valuable. Due to the rising interest in the study of metacognition, suggestions for future research have also been provided.

Participants reported relatively higher levels of depression, stress and anxiety in comparison to pre-COVID-19 samples from previous research, with respondents who had lost their jobs during the pandemic reporting higher levels of negative affective states. Despite this, mentally tough individuals appeared to report lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, moderation analyses identified some interaction between MT and employment status when predicting depression, anxiety and stress. Our findings suggest that MT may have some utility in reducing the adverse mental health effects of the pandemic on individuals, however, further longitudinal research is needed to support these implications.",2492279665.0, Journal Article,2020
8,Co-developing a Mental Health and Wellbeing Chatbot With and for Young People.,"There are many young people who experience mental health and wellbeing challenges. A potential negative mental health trigger for some youth is a struggle to cope with stress at school, feelings of depression and anxiety and availability of adequate help for these stressors. In response to youth needs a mental health and wellbeing Chatbot has been co-developed with youth, technology partners and expert stakeholders. An element of the Chatbot is powered by artificial intelligence and rules based AI using natural language processing. It is created to communicate evidence based resources, wellbeing support, educational mental health information and adaptive coping strategies. This paper will discuss how the Chatbot has been developed, highlighting its participatory, co-design process with youth who are the key stakeholders to benefit from this digital tool. Research from interviews and surveys informed the creation of the Chabots personality and its character design. Examples of the conversation design and content development are provided. The paper finishes with how, if at all, digital tools such as Chatbot applications could support the mental health of young people in secondary schools or health care settings in conjunction with the wellbeing or health care team, concluding with lessons learned and cautions.",2491073354.0, Journal Article,2020
9,"Perceived Stress, Hope, and Health Outcomes Among Medical Staff in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","This study investigated the buffering role of hope between perceived stress and health outcomes among front-line medical staff treating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen, China. In the cross-sectional study with online questionnaires, medical staff's perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and hope were measured by the 10-item Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Locus-of-Hope Scale, respectively. A total of 319 eligible front-line medical staff participated. The prevalence of anxiety (29.70%), depression (28.80%), poor sleep quality (38.90%) indicated that a considerable proportion of medical staff experienced mood and sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal locus-of-hope significantly moderated the effects of stress on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. Moreover, external family locus-of-hope and external peer locus-of-hope significantly moderated the association between perceived stress and depression. The prevalence of symptoms indicates that both mental and physical health outcomes of front-line medical staff deserve more attention. Internal and external locus-of-hope functioned differently as protective factors for medical staffs' health and might be promising targets for intervention.",2489597982.0, Journal Article,2020
10,"Evidence for Specific Associations Between Depressive Symptoms, Psychotic Experiences, and Suicidal Ideation in Chilean Adolescents From the General Population.","Associations between psychotic experiences and suicidal ideation are not yet fully understood, and the potential role of depressive symptoms in this relationship remains unclear. The current study examined relationships between depressive symptoms (DS), psychotic experiences (PE) and suicidal ideation (SI) using two complementary approaches on cross-sectional data from a community sample of adolescents aged 13-19 years (N = 1,591). First, we investigated the association between the three domains using mediation analysis, showing that depressive symptoms partly mediate the relationship between psychotic experiences and suicidal ideation. Second, we looked at associations between the three domains at item level using network analysis. Specific associations between symptoms of the three domains were found, indicating depressive symptoms of sadness, avolition, pessimism, and self-criticalness/worthlessness as the most central symptoms in the network. Suicidal ideation was associated with the depressive symptoms pessimism and worthlessness, to social anxiety, and to perceptual anomalies. Our results show that the mediating effect of depressive symptoms between psychotic experiences and suicidal ideation may be due to associations between specific aspects of SI, depressive symptoms and psychotic experiences. These findings can contribute to the planning of health services and programs aimed at the timely detection of psychopathology and suicidal risk in young people.",2489596077.0, Journal Article,2020
11,"Psychological Resilience, Mental Health, and Inhibitory Control Among Youth and Young Adults Under Stress.","Psychological resilience allows one to cope successfully with adversities occurring during stressful periods, which may otherwise trigger mental illness. Recent models suggest that inhibitory control (IC), the executive control function which supports our goal-directed behavior and regulates our emotional response, may underlie resilience. However, the ways in which this is manifested during stressful situations in real life is still unclear. Here, we examined the relationship between IC, psychological resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety among 138 female and male participants in a stressful situation: during their initial combat training in the military. Using a mobile app, we assessed IC using emotional and non-emotional variations of the Go/No-Go task. Psychological resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety were assessed using mobile versions of self-report questionnaires. We found that psychological resilience is significantly correlated with non-emotional IC (r = 0.24, p &lt; 0.005), but not with emotional IC; whereas, psychological distress and anxiety are correlated with emotional IC (r = -0.253, p &lt; 0.005 and r = -0.224, p &lt; 0.01, for psychological distress and anxiety, respectively), but not with non-emotional IC. A regression model predicting emotional IC confirmed non-emotional IC and distress as unique contributors to the variance, but not psychological distress. In addition, associations between psychological distress and emotional IC were found only for female participants. Collectively, the results clarify the link between IC, resilience, and mental health in real-life stressful situations, showing separate mechanisms of IC involved in resilience on the one hand, and mental health on the other hand. These results have implications for building mobile resilience interventions for youth and young adults facing stressful situations.",2489595106.0, Journal Article,2020
12,Study of the SCL-90 Scale and Changes in the Chinese Norms.,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the Chinese norms for the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) scale and its application. Methods: In total, 7,489 adults from Tianjin and Qingdao in China were included. Their data were compared with the norm data of 1,388 people published by Jin et al., the combined norms published by Tang et al., the data of 2,808 adults published by Chen and Li, and the data of 1,890 adults from Tong in China. Results: In five different periods, notable changes were observed in each factor of the SCL-90 that significantly differed from the previous norms. The scores of each factor showed an increasing annual trend. Compulsion consistently obtained the highest scores, and phobia consistently obtained the lowest scores. The scores tended to decrease from compulsion to anxiety, and psychosis scored lower than paranoia. There was a significant difference in the detection rate between the critical screening value of two points and the standard score. Using the standard score as the critical value, the detection rate ranged between 13 and 16% and was relatively concentrated. Using two points as the critical value, the detection rate ranged between 38 and 50%. Conclusion: The usual model in China is not consistent with social development. Using two points as the critical value is no longer suitable for the SCL-90. New Chinese norms and measurement standards should be developed. The mean value plus one standard deviation could be used as the new measurement standard.",2489595085.0, Journal Article,2020
13,Problematic Smartphone Use-Comparison of Students With and Without Problematic Smartphone Use in Light of Personality.,"Background: As a device with multiple functions, a smartphone become more and more relevant in everyday life. However, this goes along with an increase in reports about smartphone addiction and its unwanted consequences. One of the most important variables in the etiopathogenesis of addictive smartphone use is personality. Objective: This study aimed to investigate predictors of problematic smartphone use. Clinically relevant differences in personality, psychopathology, and social support between students with and without problematic smartphone use were investigated. Method: All currently enrolled students at the Sigmund Freud University in Vienna (N = 1,836) were surveyed. Response rate was 27.07% (N = 497, age: M = 19.6, SD = 8.04). The Smartphone Addiction Scale (SPAS), the 10-Item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), and a questionnaire on social support (F-SozU-K-14) were used. Results: A total of 75 students (15.1% of the total sample) showed problematic smartphone use. In terms of personality, respondents with problematic smartphone use showed significantly higher values for extraversion and neuroticism compared than non-addicted users. Students with problematic smartphone use showed significantly higher levels in terms of depression and anxiety. Contrary to expectations, individuals with problematic smartphone use showed significantly higher values for perceived social support than with individuals without problematic smartphone use. Discussion: Therapy for problematic smartphone use should be carried out taking into account discussed, important etiological factors, such as personality.",2489594927.0, Journal Article,2020
14,Depressive-Like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Social Defeat Stress Are Associated With HDAC7 Reduction in the Nucleus Accumbens.,"Persistent symptoms of depression indicate the adaptive involvement of stable molecules in the brain that may be manifested at the level of chromatin remodeling, such as histone acetylation. Former studies have identified alterations in histone acetylation and deacetylation in several animal models about depression. However, the specific histone deacetylases related with depression are needed to be explored. Here, social avoidance behaviors, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors were all found in mice suffered from chronic social defeat stress. Moreover, we also discovered that the amount of the class II histone deacetylase, HDAC7 rather than HDAC2, was significantly decreased in the nucleus accumbens of defeated mice, which suggested that HDAC7 might be a crucial histone deacetylase in a chronic social defeat stress model. Our data showed that the depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic social defeat stress were associated with HDAC7 reduction in nucleus accumbens. HDAC7 might be a promising therapeutic target for depression.",2489252992.0, Journal Article,2020
15,Early-Life Neglect Alters Emotional and Cognitive Behavior in a Sex-Dependent Manner and Reduces Glutamatergic Neuronal Excitability in the Prefrontal Cortex.,"Early-life neglect in critical developmental periods has been associated with emotional and cognitive consequences. Maternal separation (MS) has been commonly used as a rodent model to identify the developmental effects of child neglect. However, reports have shown considerable variability in behavioral results from MS studies in both mice and rats. Difficulties in developing reliable child neglect models have impeded advances in identifying the effects of early-life stress. Accumulating evidence shows that neuronal intrinsic excitability plays an important role in information processing and storage in the brain. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) integrates information from many cortical and subcortical structures. No studies to date have examined the impact of early-life stress on glutamatergic neuronal excitability in the PFC. This study aimed to develop a reliable child neglect rat model and observe glutamatergic neuronal excitability in the PFC. An MS with early weaning (MSEW) rat model was developed. Rats were separated from the dam for 4 h per day on postnatal days (PNDs) 2-5 and for 8 h per day on PNDs 6-16 and then weaned on PND 17. A battery of behavioral tests was used to assess anxiety-like behavior, coping behavior, working memory, spatial reference memory, and fear memory. The action potentials (APs) of glutamatergic neuronal membranes were recorded. MSEW resulted in anxiety-like behavior, a passive coping strategy and increased fear memory in male rats and decreased locomotor activity in both sexes. MSEW slightly impaired working memory during non-stressful situations in female rats but did not change spatial reference memory or associative learning under stressful circumstances in either sex. MSEW reduced the number of glutamatergic neuron APs in male rats. Our findings showed that MS with early weaning induced anxiety-like behavior in male rats. The reduced glutamatergic neuronal excitability may be associated with the emotional alteration induced by MSEW in male rats. In addition, MSEW induced adaptive modification, which depended on a non-stressful context.",2489252937.0, Journal Article,2020
16,"Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, and Debts in Online Gambling Disorder.","Background and Objectives: Gambling disorder (GD) is a recurrent and persistent problematic gambling behavior that impairs multiple areas of an individual's life. GD can persist through two modes: online or offline. This study aims to compare sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics between treatment-seeking online and offline gamblers and analyze the effect of the gambling mode (online or offline) on anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and debts. Methods: Seventy-nine treatment-seeking gamblers (96.2% males), who were simultaneously receiving treatment at a specialized Pathological Gambling and Behavioral Addictions Unit, participated in this study. The sample was divided into two subsamples: online (n = 29, 100% males) and offline (n = 50, 94% males); the characteristics of these two groups were compared and analyzed using Chi-Square test (χ2), t-Test or Mann-Whitney U-test (p &lt; 0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effects of gambling mode on significant variables (lack of premeditation and debts). Results: The online sample with a mean age of 29.4 years mainly chose to engage in sports betting (45%, p &lt; 0.05) and showed a higher lack of premeditation levels (25.8 points, p &lt; 0.05) than the offline sample. In addition, the online sample was younger with respect to their onset to gambling (20.2 years, p &lt; 0.05) and the beginning of their gambling problems (25 years, p &lt; 0.05) compared to the offline sample. Online gambling increased the levels of lack of premeditation by an average of 5.43 points compared to offline gambling (p &lt; 0.05). Accumulated debts of the online sample were lower (€11,000) than those of the offline sample (€12,000). However, the interaction between age and gambling mode revealed that online gamblers increased their debt amounts with age at an average increase of €2,726.33 per year compared to offline gamblers (p &lt; 0.05). No significant influence of gambling mode was found on GD severity, anxiety, and depression levels. Conclusions: Gambling mode has a significant relationship with lack of premeditation-a component of impulsivity-and accumulation of debts in treatment-seeking people with GD; however, no relationship was found with the rest of the variables analyzed. Future research with larger samples is needed to confirm these findings.",2487433256.0, Journal Article,2020
17,A Virtual Reality Game to Assess OCD Symptoms.,"Background: Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are often underreported by patients and mainly triggered in the patients private domain, making it harder for clinicians to recognize OCD. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to assess OCD symptoms in the clinician's office. We developed a VR game in order to provoke subjective and physiological OCD symptoms. We hypothesize that (1) the VR game provokes more OCD symptoms in patients compared to healthy controls, (2) performing virtual compulsions leads to a reduction in emotional responses in OCD patients and that (3) the severity of VR game provoked symptoms correlates with severity of OCD symptoms. Methods: Participants played the VR game on a laptop while physiological measures were recorded simultaneously. We measured emotional responses, virtual compulsions and physiological arousal in response to our VR game in 26 OCD patients and 26 healthy controls. We determined correlations between emotional responses, virtual compulsions and OCD severity. Results: We found higher levels of VR-provoked anxiety (U = 179.5, p = 0.004) and virtual compulsions in OCD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001). There was a significant reduction in emotional responses after performing virtual compulsions in the OCD patients. The emotional responses and virtual compulsions did not correlate significantly with Y-BOCS scores. A baseline difference between patients and healthy controls was found in heart rate variability (HRV), but no significant change in HRV, heartrate and skin conductance was found during the VR game Conclusions: Our study clearly shows our OCD VR game is capable of provoking more anxiety and virtual compulsions in patients with OCD compared to healthy controls. Providing a direct patient-rated measurement in the clinicians room, the VR game could help in assessing core OCD symptoms and recognizing OCD.

18,The Mental Well-Being of Frontline Physicians Working in Civil Wars Under Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Conditions.,"Background and Objective: Emergency medical physicians are regarded as essential frontline staff in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These health-care workers are faced with significant stressors in addition to the usual stress felt in their regular work. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and burnout among emergency physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Using a cross-sectional study methodology, we surveyed physicians active on April 2020 to study depression and anxiety [using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and burnout [using the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) scale]. Results: A total of 154 emergency physicians completed the survey. We found that about 65.6% of patients were experiencing anxiety (based on a HADS score ≥ 11), and 73.4% were displaying depressive symptoms. For burnout, three subscales indicated that 67.5% endured emotional exhaustion, and 48.1% experienced depersonalization (defined as a score of ≥10 on aMBI). A total of 21.4% of respondents perceived a sense of personal underachievement, defined as a score of &lt;10 via aMBI. Conclusion: Physicians' psychological status is crucial and plays a major role in their well-being, affecting their work satisfaction. Therefore, implementing strategies aimed at decreasing the impact of stressful events is crucial to alleviate the distress experienced by physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2487156771.0, Journal Article,2020
19,A Key Factor for Psychosomatic Burden of Frontline Medical Staff: Occupational Pressure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China.,"The global outbreak of COVID-19 has severely affected the entire population, especially healthcare staff on the frontline, who bear heavy psychosomatic burdens. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 723 participants in China from April 26 to May 9, 2020. We evaluated the psychosomatic status, including depression, anxiety, quality of life, somatic symptoms, stress, sleep disturbances, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in different exposure groups. We explored the risk factors that affect psychosomatic burdens and analyzed the relationship between psychosomatic problems and medical occupations. We found that the psychosomatic burdens of medical staff were significantly greater than those of non-medical staff (p &lt; 0.01) and were positively related with the number of COVID-19 patients they came in contact with. Occupational pressure was a key factor for healthcare staff's psychosomatic problems (p &lt; 0.01 for quality of life, somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress; p = 0.012 for sleep disturbances), and it had a strong canonical correlation (p &lt; 0.01). Workload and time allocation (WTA), one of the subdimensional indicators of occupational pressure, was strongly correlated with psychosomatic indicators. We suggest that rationalization of WTA is a desirable approach for anti-epidemic medical employees to alleviate psychosomatic burdens. Public health interventions should be undertaken to reduce the occupational pressure on this special population, which is critical for mitigation. This study presents results regarding the psychosomatic burdens of the healthcare workforce related to occupational pressure and provides multilevel data with groups of different exposure risks for policymakers to protect medical personnel. These findings draw attention to the working environments of healthcare workers and provide applicable results for clinical practice.",2486462002.0, Journal Article,2020
20,Mental Health Outcomes Amongst Health Care Workers During COVID 19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia.,"Objectives: The study aimed to assess the mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers during COVID 19 in Saudi Arabia. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care workers from tertiary care and ministry of health Centers across the Central, Eastern, and Western regions of Saudi Arabia. There were 1,130 participants in the survey, and we collected demographic and mental health measurements from the participants. Primary Outcomes and Measures: The magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was measured using the original version of 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), and 7-item insomnia severity index (ISI). We use the multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the associated risk factors of individual outcomes. Results: The scores on the PHQ-9 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (76.93%) experienced only normal to mild depression (50.83 and 26.1%, respectively). The scores on the GAD-7 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (78.88%) experienced minimal to mild anxiety (50.41 and 28.47%, respectively). The scores on the ISI showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (85.83%) experienced absence to subthreshold insomnia (57.08 and 28.75%, respectively). The risk factors for depression in health care workers were Saudi, living with family, working from an isolated room at home and frontline worker. For anxiety, being female was risk factor and for insomnia, being frontline worker was risk factor. Conclusion: It was observed that the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reported in a lower proportion of health care workers in our study. The participants who were female, frontline workers, Saudi, living with family, and working from home in isolated rooms were predisposed to developing psychological disorders.",2484167361.0, Journal Article,2020
21,Prenatal Cannabinoid Exposure: Emerging Evidence of Physiological and Neuropsychiatric Abnormalities.,"Clinical reports of cannabis use prevalence during pregnancy vary widely from 3% to upwards of 35% in North America; this disparity likely owing to underestimates from self-reporting in many cases. The rise in cannabis use is mirrored by increasing global legalization and the overall perceptions of safety, even during pregnancy. These trends are further compounded by a lack of evidence-based policy and guidelines for prenatal cannabis use, which has led to inconsistent messaging by healthcare providers and medically licensed cannabis dispensaries regarding prenatal cannabis use for treatment of symptoms, such as nausea. Additionally, the use of cannabis to self-medicate depression and anxiety during pregnancy is a growing medical concern. This review aims to summarize recent findings of clinical and preclinical data on neonatal outcomes, as well as long-term physiological and neurodevelopmental outcomes of prenatal cannabis exposure. Although many of the outcomes under investigation have produced mixed results, we consider these data in light of the unique challenges facing cannabis research. In particular, the limited longitudinal clinical studies available have not previously accounted for the exponential increase in (-)-Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; the psychoactive compound in cannabis) concentrations found in cannabis over the past two decades. Polydrug use and the long-term effects of individual cannabis constituents [Δ9-THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD)] are also understudied, along with sex-dependent outcomes. Despite these limitations, prenatal cannabis exposure has been linked to low birth weight, and emerging evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to Δ9-THC, which crosses the placenta and impacts placental development, may have wide-ranging physiological and neurodevelopmental consequences. The long-term effects of these changes require more rigorous investigation, though early reports suggest Δ9-THC increases the risk of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disease, including psychosis, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. In light of the current trends in the perception and use of cannabis during pregnancy, we emphasize the social and medical imperative for more rigorous investigation of the long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure.",2484167338.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
22,Social Media Usage and Development of Psychiatric Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Review.,"Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, are now part of almost everyone's social life, especially for the newer generations. Children and teenagers grew up together with these Internet-based services, which have become an integral part of their personal and social life. However, as reported in various studies, psychological and psychiatric problems are sometimes associated with problematic usage of social media. The primary purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the cognitive, psychological, and social outcomes correlated with a problematic use of social media sites during the developmental stages, from age 10 to 19 years. With a specific focus on depression, anxiety, eating, and neurodevelopmental disorders, the review also discusses evidence related to genetic and neurobiological issues, together with the implications in clinical work and future directions under a multidisciplinary perspective. While the scientific community has made significant progress in enhancing our understanding of the impact of social media on teenagers' lives, more research integrating biological and environmental factors is required to fully elucidate the development of these disorders.",2484167333.0, Systematic Review,2020
23,"Assessing the Mental Health of Fathers, Other Co-parents, and Partners in the Perinatal Period: Mixed Methods Evidence Synthesis.","Introduction: Five to 10 percentage of fathers experience perinatal depression and 5-15% experience perinatal anxiety, with rates increasing when mothers are also experiencing perinatal mental health disorders. Perinatal mental illness in either parent contributes to adverse child and family outcomes. While there are increasing calls to assess the mental health of both parents, universal services (e.g., maternity) and specialist perinatal mental health services usually focus on the mother (i.e., the gestational parent). The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize evidence on the performance of mental health screening tools and the acceptability of mental health assessment, specifically in relation to fathers, other co-parents and partners in the perinatal period. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Maternity, and Infant Care Database and CINAHL). Articles were eligible if they included expectant or new partners, regardless of the partner's gender or relationship status. Accuracy was determined by comparison of screening tool with diagnostic interview. Acceptability was predominantly assessed through parents' and health professionals' perspectives. Narrative synthesis was applied to all elements of the review, with thematic analysis applied to the acceptability studies. Results: Seven accuracy studies and 20 acceptability studies were included. The review identified that existing evidence focuses on resident fathers and assessing depression in universal settings. All accuracy studies assessed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale but with highly varied results. Evidence on acceptability in practice is limited to postnatal settings. Amongst both fathers and health professionals, views on assessment are mixed. Identified challenges were categorized at the individual-, practitioner- and service-level. These include: gendered perspectives on mental health; the potential to compromise support offered to mothers; practitioners' knowledge, skills, and confidence; service culture and remit; time pressures; opportunity for contact; and the need for tools, training, supervision and onward referral routes. Conclusion: There is a paucity of published evidence on assessing the mental health of fathers, co-mothers, step-parents and other partners in the perinatal period. Whilst practitioners need to be responsive to mental health needs, further research is needed with stakeholders in a range of practice settings, with attention to ethical and practical considerations, to inform the implementation of evidence-based assessment.",2483812611.0, Systematic Review,2020
24,Anxiety and Depression Comorbidities in Moroccan Patients With Breast Cancer.,"Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide with more than 1. 7 million new cases annually. Major advances have been made in the therapeutic management of this condition in many countries. However, neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with breast cancer constitute a significant concern due to their negative impact on patient's life and on the success of therapy itself. Methodology: In this study we aimed to evaluate psychological disorders in a population of 212 Moroccan women treated for breast cancer within the Mohammed VI Center for the Treatment of Cancers of Casablanca. A questionnaire was designed to this end on the basis of different validated scales, including the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Body Image Scale (BIS). Results: Data analysis has shown that 69.3% of participants had significant sleep disorders; 87% suffer from an anxiety-depressive syndrome (ADS), and 83.0% had significant body image dissatisfaction. A positive correlation was shown between ADS and both patients' national health insurance coverage and patients or husbands' education. Analysis further revealed that anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with different types of treatment. Similarly, both BIS and PSQI scores were positively associated with anxiety and depression disorders. Conclusion: The present investigation highlights the need to generalize and strengthen the psychological approach of patients treated for breast cancer in Morocco. We anticipate that such a strategy will alleviate suffering and promote therapy success in these patients and will diminish or prevent conjugal and familial impacts of the illness.",2483811912.0, Journal Article,2020
25,Suicide Attempt in Patients With Gambling Disorder-Associations With Comorbidity Including Substance Use Disorders.,"Background: Gambling disorder is known to be associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. However, relatively little is known about how the risk of suicide attempts in gambling disorder is influenced by comorbid alcohol or drug use disorders, as well as other psychiatric conditions. Methods: The present study is a nationwide, diagnostic register study assessing the risk of suicide attempts (including fatal ones) in gambling disorder in Sweden in 2005-2016. Results: In a total of 2,099 individuals (23 percent women) with gambling disorder, 417 individuals had a suicide attempt (including 10 fatal cases of suicide) during the study period. Suicidal behavior was more common in patients with substance use disorders at any time during the study period (50 percent if both alcohol and drug use disorders were present, and 10 percent if none of these were present). In logistic regression, suicidal behavior was significantly associated with female gender (OR 2.13 [1.63-2.78]), mood disorders (OR 2.65 [2.00-3.50]), anxiety disorders (OR 1.78 [1.34-2.35]), and with alcohol (OR 1.95 [1.51-2.51]) or drug use disorders (OR 3.60 [2.76-4.69]), respectively. Conclusions: Suicidal behavior in clinical gambling disorder patients is common, but markedly more common in the presence of substance use and other comorbid disorders.",2483407988.0, Journal Article,2020
26,"Behavioral Implications of the Covid-19 Process for Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Individuals' Comprehension of and Reactions to the Pandemic Conditions.","During disasters and pandemics, vulnerable populations such as patients with mental conditions are known to be overly influenced. Yet, not much is known about how the individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one of the most common neurodevelopmental conditions globally with a prevalence of 1%, are affected from health-related disasters, especially the current Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conducted an investigation of how individuals with ASD responded to Covid-19 in terms of comprehension and adherence to implemented measures; changes in their behavioral problems; and how their caregivers' anxiety levels relate with these behavioral changes. Our sample consisted of 87 individuals with ASD (15 girls; ages ranged from 3-29, with an average of 13.96 ± 6.1). The majority of our sample had problems understanding what Covid-19 is and the measures it requires. They also had challenges in implementing social distance and hygiene-related regulations of the pandemic. The majority stopped receiving special education during this period. We observed a Covid-19-related clinical presentation that resembled PTSD in individuals with ASD in terms of increased stereotypies, aggression, hypersensitivity, behavioral problems, and sleep and appetite alterations. All subscales of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) differed significantly between before and after the pandemic conditions. The number of hours the children slept significantly decreased from before to during Covid-19. The anxiety levels of caregivers were high and correlated with the current behavioral problem levels of their children, but not with the level of their behavioral problems before the pandemic. The difference in ABC total score and specifically the lethargy/social withdrawal subscale score predicted parents' anxiety score. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 period inflicts specific challenges to individuals with ASD and their caregivers, underlining the need for targeted, distance special education interventions and other support services for this population.",2483407668.0, Journal Article,2020
27,Antecedents of Public Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation of Pandemic-Related Knowledge and Self-Efficacy and Moderation of Risk Level.,"Background: COVID-19 affects not only patients' physical health but also their mental health. For the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by COVID-19. Controlling the pandemic should focus on not only physical health but also mental health. For the general public, mental health is even more important, as good mental health at the individual level can form a positive social mentality conducive to pandemic prevention and control. Therefore, it is important to assess mental health during the pandemic, and analyze risk and protective factors. Methods: A self-compiled COVID-19 Social Mentality Questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey. A total of 16,616 participants responded, with 13,511 valid questionnaires. Results: Results showed that 10.7% of participants rated their mental health as ""worse than usual"" during the pandemic, and there were gender, age, and educational differences. Social support was positively correlated with pandemic-related knowledge and self-efficacy, and could indirectly predict mental health. Pandemic-related knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy and mental health, and risk level was negatively correlated with mental health. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that pandemic-related knowledge played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social support and self-efficacy, while self-efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between social support and mental health. Logistic regression analysis showed that risk level moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mental health. Conclusions: Social support can increase pandemic-related knowledge, thus improving self-efficacy and maintaining/promoting mental health. High risk levels can undermine the role of self-efficacy in promoting mental health. Therefore, in the fight against the COVID-19, people need to support and cooperate with each other, to improve self-efficacy and reduce risk, thus maintaining and promoting mental health.",2483406500.0, Journal Article,2020
28,From Emotional Intelligence to Self-Injuries: A Path Analysis in Adolescents With Conduct Disorder.,"Objective: Self-harm acts are highly prevalent among adolescents with conduct disorder. It has been shown that low level of emotional intelligence (EI) might be related to a higher risk of self-injuries. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether psychopathological symptoms and selected psychological processes mediate the association between EI and self-harm risk in adolescents with conduct disorders. Method: Out of 162 adolescents with conduct disorder approached for participation, 136 individuals (aged 14.8 ± 1.2 years, 56.6% females) were enrolled and completed the questionnaires evaluating the level of EI, depression, anxiety, impulsiveness, empathy, venturesomeness, self-esteem, and disgust. Results: Individuals with a lifetime history of self-injuries had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity as well as significantly lower levels of EI and self-esteem. Higher levels of EI were associated with significantly higher levels of self-esteem, venturesomeness and empathy as well as significantly lower levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity. Further analysis revealed that trait and state anxiety as well as self-esteem were complete mediators of the association between EI and self-harm risk. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that anxiety and self-esteem might mediate the association between EI and a risk of self-injuries in adolescents with conduct disorder. However, a cross-sectional design of this study limits conclusions on the direction of causality. Longitudinal studies are needed to test validity of our model.",2480739920.0, Journal Article,2020
29,"Loneliness, Emotion Dysregulation, and Internalizing Symptoms During Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach.","Background: Our study aimed to test the hypotheses that an increased level of loneliness experienced during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement was predictive of internalizing symptoms and that this pathway was mediated by emotion dysregulation levels. Methods: To reach this aim, we performed an online longitudinal survey recruiting 1,330 participants at Time 1 (at the beginning of the lockdown) and 308 participants at Time 2 (few days before the end of the lockdown). All filled out a set of questionnaires: demographic data, University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-18 items, and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in two steps and controlling for age. First, hypotheses were tested on cross-sectional data. Then, a cross-lagged panel analysis was performed on longitudinal data. Results: Models obtained a good fit and evidenced the predictive role of loneliness levels on the three outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Moreover, we found that emotion dysregulation levels partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between loneliness and both depression and stress but not between loneliness and anxiety levels. Conclusions: This study points out that a central goal of clinical intervention could be the ability to regulate negative emotional states.",2480736876.0, Journal Article,2020
30,Counterfactual Thinking-Related Emotional Responses in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.,"Objective: To explore the emotional characteristics of counterfactual thinking (CT)-related emotion responses in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) via the ""counterfactual thinking gambling task (CTGT)."" Method: Twenty-five patients with MDD (the MDD group) and twenty-five healthy controls (the HC group) with matched demographic features were included. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. The counterfactual thinking gambling task was applied to assess the situation-focused- and behavior-focused-CT-related emotion responses in the MDD group and the HC group. Results: There was no significant difference in general demographic data between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with the HC group, the MDD group experienced higher levels of ""disappointment"" and lower levels of ""joy"" in the situation-focused CT paradigm (p &lt; 0.05). However, the experience of ""regret"" and ""relief"" in the behavior-focused CT paradigm were not significantly different between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: MDD is associated with an impaired situation-focused-CT-related emotion responses, and is often accompanied by increased disappointment and decreased joy; however, behavior-focused-CT-related emotion responses are not significantly affected in MDD. This pattern may represent the characteristic CT-related emotion responses of MDD.",2480736798.0, Journal Article,2020
31,"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Problems Among Caregivers of People Living With Neurocognitive Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems among caregivers of persons living with neurocognitive disorders (PLWND) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and investigate whether the COVID-19-related experiences were associated with the presence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. Methods: From March 1 to 31, 2020, 160 caregivers of PLWND participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Questions on sleep duration and sleep quality enquired about sleep problems. Six items were used to explore the COVID-19-related experiences, including community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. We computed the prevalence rate of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with these mental health problems. Results: The prevalence rate of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.9%, 36.3%, and 9.4%. Approximately 55 participants (34.4%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Women had a higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms (OR, 5.284; 95% CI, 2.068-13.503; p = 0.001). Having a mental disorder (OR, 5.104; 95% CI, 1.522-17.114; p = 0.008) was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Caregivers who preferred to access positive information (OR, 0.215; 95% CI, 0.058-0.793; p = 0.021) was associated with decreased risk of sleep problems. Conclusion: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were common among caregivers of older adults with dementia or mild cognitive impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being female was an independent risk factor for experiencing anxiety symptoms. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of depressive symptoms among caregivers, while caregivers who prefer to access positive media information decreased sleep problems.",2480736793.0, Journal Article,2020
32,Association Analysis of Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase 1 Gene Polymorphism With Psychopathological Symptoms in Chronic Ketamine Users.,"Objective: We previously found that chronic ketamine usages were associated with various psychotic and cognitive symptoms mimicking schizophrenia. The blockade of the NMDA receptor and subsequent nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) dysfunction were found to be closely correlated with schizophrenia including NOS1 gene polymorphisms. We examined the allelic variants of the gene coding neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) in chronic ketamine users in the Chinese population and analyzed the association between NOS1 gene polymorphism and psychopathological symptoms in chronic ketamine users. The association between the NOS1 polymorphism and ketamine use characteristics was also examined. Methods: One hundred ninety seven male chronic ketamine users and 82 controls were recruited. Four common SNPs of the NOS1 gene, rs6490121, rs41279104, rs3782206, and rs3782219, were examined by real-time PCR with the TaqMan® assay system. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: The genotype distribution of rs6490121 and rs41279104 in chronic ketamine users was significantly different from that in the control (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.002). The G allele frequency of rs6490121 in ketamine users was higher than that in the control (p = 2.23 * 10-6, OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.93-4.90). The T allele frequency of rs41279104 in chronic ketamine users was higher than that in the control (p = 0.01, OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.14-2.72). The BAI score was significantly different among the three genotypic groups of rs6490121 (F = 6.21, p = 0.002) in ketamine users; subjects of genotype AG and GG had a lower score than subjects of genotype AA. The score of the negative symptom subscale of PANSS was significantly different among the three genotypic groups of rs41279104 (F = 5.39, p = 0.005); in ketamine users, subjects of genotype CT and TT had a higher score than subjects of genotype CC. There was no difference in drug use characteristics in different genotypes of the four NOS1 gene polymorphisms tested in ketamine users (p &gt; 0.05).",2476852130.0, Journal Article,2020
33,Assessment of Depression Severity During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Among the Palestinian Population: A Growing Concern and an Immediate Consideration.,"Background: Aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures were implemented as protective public health actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Assessing the psychological effects associated with these measures is an important attempt to inform local policymakers in an early stage. Yet little is known about these effects, specifically depression, among the Palestinians. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression among the Palestinian community during this pandemic. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram) was carried out using an anonymous online questionnaire. The validated and standardized depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) was used to measure depression severity. A snowball technique recruiting the general public living in Palestine was conducted. Data were collected between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to the middle interval of strict massive lockdown in Palestine on 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multinomial logistic regression model was developed to predict depression severity. Results: About 2,819 respondents filled out the questionnaire. Depression prevalence was (57.5%; n = 1,621). Out of them, 66% had mild/moderate severity, and 34% had severe/extremely severe degree. Depression severity was negatively associated with age {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.98 (0.97-0.99)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.94-0.97)]} degrees compared with normal degree. Males were significantly less likely to have higher depression than females {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.57-0.85)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.40-0.86)]} degree. However, those who reported having inadequate food supply and lesser monthly incomes were more likely to have a higher degree of depression as compared with normal degree. Single persons were significantly more likely to have mild/moderate depression than those in a relationship [OR (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.05-1.64)]. Conclusions: High depression prevalence (57.5%) among the Palestinian community during the COVID-19 pandemic is a growing public health concern. It is essential to provide psychological counseling and treatment during and after the pandemic for the targeted people at high risk (young age/female gender) who were affected psychologically. Strategic long-term policy to address pandemic ramifications, including depression, by implementing comprehensive interventions taking into account socioeconomic disparities, vulnerability, and inequities, is crucial to emerge from this crisis in Palestine.",2476852119.0, Journal Article,2020
34,Are Changes in Personality Traits and Alcohol Use Associated? A Cohort Study Among Young Swiss Men.,"Objective: It is well known that certain personality traits are associated with alcohol use. Because less is known about it, we wished to investigate whether changes in alcohol use were longitudinally associated with changes in personality and in which direction the influence or causation might flow. Methods: Data came from the self-reported questionnaire answers of 5,125 young men at two time points during the Cohort study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). Their average ages were 20.0 and 25.4 years old at the first and second wave assessments, respectively. Four personality traits were measured: (a) aggression-hostility; (b) sociability; (c) neuroticism-anxiety; and (d) sensation seeking. Alcohol use was measured by volume (drinks per week) and binge drinking (about 60+ grams per occasion). Cross-lagged panel models and two-wave latent change score models were used. Results: Aggression-hostility, sensation seeking, and sociability were significantly and positively cross-sectionally associated with both alcohol use variables. Drinking volume and these three personality traits bidirectionally predicted each other. Binge drinking was bidirectionally associated with sensation-seeking only, whereas aggression-hostility and sociability only predicted binge drinking, but not vice versa. Changes in alcohol use were significantly positively associated with changes in aggression-hostility, sensation seeking, and sociability. Associations reached small Cohen's effect sizes for sociability and sensation seeking, but not for aggression-hostility. Associations with neuroticism-anxiety were mostly not significant. Conclusion: The direction of effects confirmed findings from other studies, and the association between changes in personality and alcohol use support the idea that prevention programs should simultaneously target both.",2476852044.0, Journal Article,2020
35,Pharmacotherapy of Anxiety Disorders: Current and Emerging Treatment Options.,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability. While there continues to be expansive research in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and schizophrenia, there is a relative dearth of novel medications under investigation for anxiety disorders. This review's first aim is to summarize current pharmacological treatments (both approved and off-label) for panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and specific phobias (SP), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), azapirones (e.g., buspirone), mixed antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine), antipsychotics, antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine), alpha- and beta-adrenergic medications (e.g., propranolol, clonidine), and GABAergic medications (benzodiazepines, pregabalin, and gabapentin). Posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are excluded from this review. Second, we will review novel pharmacotherapeutic agents under investigation for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults. The pathways and neurotransmitters reviewed include serotonergic agents, glutamate modulators, GABAergic medications, neuropeptides, neurosteroids, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents, cannabinoids, and natural remedies. The outcome of the review reveals a lack of randomized double-blind placebo- controlled trials for anxiety disorders and few studies comparing novel treatments to existing anxiolytic agents. Although there are some recent randomized controlled trials for novel agents including neuropeptides, glutamatergic agents (such as ketamine and d-cycloserine), and cannabinoids (including cannabidiol) primarily in GAD or SAD, these trials have largely been negative, with only some promise for kava and PH94B (an inhaled neurosteroid). Overall, the progression of current and future psychopharmacology research in anxiety disorders suggests that there needs to be further expansion in research of these novel pathways and larger-scale studies of promising agents with positive results from smaller trials.",2476851993.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
36,Improved Rehabilitation Outcomes for Persons With and Without Problematic Substance Use After 2 Years With Assertive Community Treatment-A Prospective Study of Patients With Severe Mental Illness in 12 Norwegian ACT Teams.,"Background: Persons with severe mental illness often face difficulties in accessing and receiving adequate services enabling them to live independently. Many have co-occurring substance use problems that increase the risk of adverse outcomes. Community-based service models have been implemented around the world, including assertive community treatment (ACT), but the knowledge of rehabilitation outcomes in different subgroups is limited. We aimed to explore rehabilitation outcomes among patients suffering severe mental illness with and without substance use problems who had received ACT services for at least 2 years. Additionally, we compared differences in changes between the two groups. Methods: A total of 142 patients who received services for 2 years from the first 12 Norwegian ACT teams were included. Eighty-four (59%) had problematic substance use, while 58 (41%) did not. Data regarding housing, activity, symptoms, functioning, and subjective quality of life were collected upon enrollment into ACT and at 2 years of follow-up. Clinician-rated scales and self-report questionnaires were used. Changes within the two groups and differences in change between the groups were assessed using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Both groups were more likely to have good housing, higher level of functioning, and less anxiety and depressive symptoms after 2 years. The odds of good housing among participants with problematic substance use increased only after adjusting for age and gender. Participants with problematic substance use had less severe symptoms, particularly negative and manic symptoms, while participants without problematic substance use reported improved satisfaction with life in general. Neither group experienced a change in having a meaningful daily activity, positive symptoms, practical and social functioning, or subjective quality of life. The reduction of manic symptoms in the substance use group was the only difference between the groups. Conclusion: After 2 years, patients with and without problematic substance use experienced improvements in several important domains. Furthermore, the improvements were similar in both groups for most outcomes. This may suggest that ACT has a place in the continued effort toward integrated and comprehensive community services empowering patients with severe mental illness to achieve and sustain an independent life, including marginalized groups with severe substance use.",2476851984.0, Journal Article,2020
37,Occupational Stress and Mental Health: A Comparison Between Frontline Medical Staff and Non-frontline Medical Staff During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak.,"Background: During an epidemic, both frontline and non-frontline medical staff endure stressful work circumstances that render their mental health a major public health concern. This study aims at investigating and comparing the prevalence and severity of mental health symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression and insomnia) between frontline medical staff and non-frontline medical staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. It also seeks to evaluate the association of their mental health with occupational stress. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Wenzhou, China from 2020 February 16th to 2020 March 2th. A total of 524 medical staff responded to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Occupational stress Questionnaire, and a demographic data form. Data were principally analyzed with logistic regression. Results: Of the 524 participants, 31.3% reported depression, 41.2% reported anxiety, and 39.3% reported insomnia. Compared with the citizens during the COVID-19 epidemic, medical staff experienced higher level of anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially the frontline medical staff. Furthermore, male, married medical staff with poorer physical health reported lower mental health. Frontline medical staff endorsed higher self-reported occupational stress, especially higher occupational hazards, than non-frontline medical staff. In addition, four indicators on occupational stress (working intensity, working time, working difficulty and working risk) were correlated positively with mental health symptoms. Regression analyses found a significant association between occupational stress and mental health symptoms in both frontline and non-frontline medical staff during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion: The results indicated that during the COVID-19 epidemic, medical staff experienced higher levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia than citizens, and their occupational stress had positive effects on their psychological distress. These findings emphasize the importance of occupational stress management interventions to decrease the risk of developing mental health problems among the medical staff during a biological disaster.",2476851940.0, Journal Article,2020
38,Threats to Belonging-Stressful Life Events and Mental Health Symptoms in Aging Men-A Longitudinal Cohort Study.,"Objectives: Stressful life events, especially relationship events, are frequent in adult life. We investigated the impact of a variety of stressful life events on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Methods: We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort study of men (n = 1,437) in the Boston area (assessed in 1985, 1988, and 1991). Main outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms. We used the Elders Life Stress Inventory (ELSI) to measure stressful life events in the past 12 months and examine their association with symptoms of depression, anxiety and hostility. First, we analyzed the association of stressful life events with symptom changes; second, we categorized stressful life events into finance/work, health, relationships, loss, living situations events; and third, we estimated the specific association between relationship events and depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms using multilevel models. Results: The most frequent stressful life events were health, relationship, and financial events. Depression, anxiety, and hostility symptoms were relatively stable among men who did not experience these life events. However, those who reported life events in the past 12 months had a greater increase in symptoms of depression (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and of hostility (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.09) than those who did not. Additionally, we found a significant decrease in hostility (-0.05; 95% CI: -0.08 to -0.01) in those experiencing no life events. Conclusion: Relationship events were more important than any other type of events, and were significantly associated with increased depression and hostility in aging men. Although the effects were small, the results point to a need to understand better the impact of relationships on psychopathology in the aging population.",2476851916.0, Journal Article,2020
39,Altered Local Gyrification Index and Corresponding Functional Connectivity in Medication Free Major Depressive Disorder.,"A lot of previous studies have documented that major depressive disorder (MDD) is a developmental disorder. The cortical surface measure, local gyrification index (LGI), can well reflect the fetal and early postnatal neurodevelopmental processes. Thus, LGI may provide new insight for the neuropathology of MDD. The previous studies only focused on the surface structural abnormality, but how the structural abnormality lead to functional connectivity changes is unexplored. In this study, we investigated LGI and corresponding functional connectivity difference in 28 medication-free MDD patients. We found significantly decreased LGI in left lingual gyrus (LING) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (bSTS), and the changed LGI in bSTS was negatively correlated with disease onset age and anxiety scores. The following functional connectivity analyses identified decreased functional connectivities between LING and right LING, precentral gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. The decreased functional connectivities were correlated with disease duration, onset, and depression symptoms. Our findings revealed abnormal LGI in LING and bSTS indicating that the abnormal developmental of visual and social cognition related brain areas may be an early biomarker for depression.",2476851898.0, Journal Article,2020
40,"Association of Sedentary Behavior With Anxiety, Depression, and Suicide Ideation in College Students.","Objectives: To investigate the association of sedentary behavior with anxiety, depression, and suicide ideation in multi-centered college students in China. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the first-year college student population. The students underwent a questionnaire survey inquiring about sedentary behavior (hours per day) and physical activity (minutes per week) during the past year. Anxiety, depression, and sleep quality were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Mixed models were used to estimate the associations, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were presented as the effect size. Mediation effect analysis was conducted to test the mediation effect of PSQI. Results: A total of 28,298 participants (response rate: 82%) completed the survey and were included in the final analyses. Crude and adjusted estimates consistently showed that both sedentary behavior and physical activity were significantly associated with mental illnesses. Sedentary behavior was positively associated with anxiety, depression, and suicidal behavior in a dose-response manner (AOR: 0.54-0.24; ≥7 h/day as reference), independent from the effect of physical activity (AOR: 0.78-0.41; no physical activity as reference). The association of sedentary behavior with mental health was partly mediated by sleep quality (25-71%). Conclusions: There is an independent dose-response association of sedentary behavior with mental well-being among college students in China, and this association may be partially attributable to impaired sleep quality. Attention should be drawn and actions should be taken by college educators and mental health providers.",2476851874.0, Journal Article,2020
41,Mental Health Outcomes and Associations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study in the United States.,"Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. We performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race-stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (standard deviation) age of the respondents was 45 (16) years, and 494 (48.8%) were male. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met the criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%), meeting the clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.49, 0.87]), identification as Black (OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.31, 0.77]), and living in a larger home (OR = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR = 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]) were associated with increased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria. Two hundred thirty-two subjects (23.6%) met the criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), identifying as Black (OR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.40, 0.97]), increased time outdoors (OR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR = 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]) were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR = 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR = 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]) were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria. Income, media consumption, and religiosity were not associated with mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are common in the US general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and are associated with potentially modifiable factors.",2476851863.0, Journal Article,2020
42,Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Mothers and Fathers Following Childbirth: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Introduction: Up to 30% of women view their childbirth as traumatic. This experience can lead to acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. The negative impact of maternal post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth reaches beyond the mother, potentially affecting her child's development and the couple's relationship. Research on paternal post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth is scarce. Acute stress disorder is suggested to be an important predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder in mothers, but little is known about paternal acute stress disorder following childbirth. Furthermore, there is limited information about the comparison or relation of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth between parents. Aim: [1] To compare the prevalence rates and severity of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms between parents following childbirth by taking anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as obstetric variables and previous traumatic events into account and [2] To determine if acute stress disorder is a predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder. Method: A prospective population-based design was used. N = 647 participants were recruited from future parents who attended appointments at the Obstetrics and Gynecology unit at a Swiss university hospital. Self-report questionnaires were used: Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale in the third trimester of pregnancy (T1) and 1 month post-partum (T3), Acute Stress Disorder Scale at 1 week post-partum (T2), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at all time points. Obstetric and neonatal variables were retrieved from hospital records. Results: At T2, 63.9% of mothers and 51.7% of fathers presented symptoms of acute stress disorder. At T3, 20.7% of mothers and 7.2% of fathers had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder was a predictor of post-partum post-traumatic stress disorder (Odds ratio: 8.6, IC 95% [1.85; 40.42]). Depression symptoms was a significant confounder in the prediction of post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth, but not anxiety or previous perinatal loss. Conclusion: Little is known about parental differences in acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms following childbirth. Results indicate that both parents may suffer from acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms after childbirth and that acute stress disorder is a predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder after childbirth for both parents. Sensitization of maternity staff to these results may assist in earlier identification of and appropriate treatment for at-risk parents.",2476568833.0, Journal Article,2020
43,Comparing the Impact of COVID-19-Related Social Distancing on Mood and Psychiatric Indicators in Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) and Non-SGM Individuals.,"Empirical evidence demonstrates mental health disparities between sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM) compared with cisgender heterosexual individuals. SGM individuals report elevated rates of emotional distress, symptoms related to mood and anxiety disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Social support is inversely related to psychiatric symptoms, regardless of SGM status. The COVID-19 pandemic-with its associated limited social interactions-represents an unprecedented period of acute distress with potential reductions in accessibility of social support, which might be of particular concern for SGM individuals' mental well-being. In the present study, we explored the extent to which potential changes in mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, worry, perceived stress, positive and negative affect) throughout the duration of the pandemic were related to differences in perceptions of social support and engagement in virtual social activity, as a function of SGM status. Utilizing a large sample of US adults (N = 1,014; 18% reported SGM status), we assessed psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of social isolation, and amount of time spent socializing virtually at 3 time windows during the pandemic (between March 21 and May 21). Although SGM individuals reported greater levels of depression compared with non-SGM individuals at all 3 time points, there was no interaction between time and SGM status. Across all participants, mental health outcomes improved across time. Perceived social isolation was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Further, time spent engaging in virtual socialization was associated with reduced depression, but only for those in self-reported quarantine. We discuss these results in terms of the nature of our sample and its impact on the generalizability of these findings to other SGM samples as well as directions for future research aimed at understanding potential health disparities in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2476568272.0, Journal Article,2020
44,Early Psychiatric Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the General Population and Healthcare Workers in Italy: A Preliminary Study.,"Introduction: Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread to several countries worldwide, including Italy. In this study, we aimed to assess the psychopathological impact of the pandemic across the general population of Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, and to compare the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms between the general public and healthcare workers. Methods: Four hundred and thirty-two participants completed an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI). Healthcare workers were also asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results: At the DASS-21, 33.3% of the responders presented pathological levels of stress, 25.5% of anxiety, and 35.9% of depression. At the IES-R, 13.9% appeared at risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the PSQI, 57.6% presented sleep disturbances. Female gender and younger age predicted higher scores of distress. Healthcare workers presented higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the general public. Moreover, working in contact with COVID-19 patients predicted higher scores at the IES-R subscale Intrusion. Conclusion: Our results showed that about a third of our sample presented symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Lombardy; more than half of the responders presented sleep disturbances, and 13% appeared at risk of PTSD. Italian authorities should develop specific strategies to guarantee psychological support to the population of Lombardy, with particular attention to women, young people, and healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients.",2476568243.0, Journal Article,2020
45,Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms of High School Students in Shandong Province During the COVID-19 Epidemic.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has brought physical risks as well as psychological challenges to the whole world. High school students are a special group suffering from both the academic pressure and the threat of the epidemic. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the psychological status of high school students in Shandong Province. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, data was collected from 1,018 voluntary high school students assessed with demographic information, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and a self-designed online-study effect survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and study effect. Result: The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 52.4, 31.4, and 26.8%, respectively, among high school students in Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. And from moderate to severe severity level, the rates of depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were 17.6 and 4.6%. Female students exhibited a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than male, and grade one senior high school students got a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than the other two grades. Nearly half of the students were not satisfied with their online-study effect. The PHQ-9 score had a strong positive correlation with the GAD-7 score. Both the PHQ-9 score the GAD-7 score had a negative correlation with the study-effect survey score. Conclusion: Quite a number of high school students suffered from depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sufficient attentions should be paid, and necessary supports should be provided, to protect the mental health of this special group.",2476128276.0, Journal Article,2020
46,"The Association Between Adolescent Residential Mobility and Adult Social Anxiety, BDNF and Amygdala-Orbitofrontal Functional Connectivity in Young Adults With Higher Education.","Background: Large-scale epidemiological studies demonstrate that house moves during adolescence lead to an increase in anxiety and stress-sensitivity that persists into adulthood. As such, it might be expected that moves during adolescence have strong negative and long-lasting effects on the brain. We hypothesized that moves during adolescence impair fear circuit maturation, as measured by the connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Methods: We examined young adults with middle and high economic status recruited from the community using clinical interviews, self-report questionnaires, functional magnetic resonance imaging during an emotional faces task and during a 10 min rest phase, and serum BDNF serum concentration. Results: Out of 234 young adults, 164 did not move between ages 10 and 16 (i.e., moves with change of school), 50 moved once, and 20 moved twice or more than twice. We found relationships between adolescent moving frequency and social avoidance (pcorr = 0.012), right amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex connectivity (pcorr = 0.016) and low serum BDNF concentrations in young adulthood (pcorr = 0.012). Perceived social status of the mother partly mitigated the effects of moving on social avoidance and BDNF in adulthood. Conclusions: This study confirms previous reports on the negative and persistent effects of residential mobility during adolescence on mental health. It suggests that these effects are mediated by impairments in fear circuit maturation. Finally, it encourages research into protecting factors of moving during adolescents such as the perceived social status of the mother.",2476127951.0, Journal Article,2020
47,COVID-19 Suicide Survivors-A Hidden Grieving Population.,"Present time has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. People are grieving several non-death related situations: the loss of a job, of a status, of a role, of their life. Restrictive measures and uncertainty about the future makes individuals vulnerable to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Mental health support has been hindered and teams are reinventing themselves to reach people in need. Nevertheless, decompensation of previous psychiatric disorders, increasing levels of depression and anxiety, economical handicaps and fear of the infection, are prompting several cases of COVID-19 related suicides worldwide. Every suicide affects between 5 and 80 individuals, which are known as suicide survivors. Suicide grief is particularly challenging, with rates of complicated grief as high as 40%. Suicide survivors are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders and of suicidal behaviors. Moreover, feelings of guilt and shame, as well as social stigma, are major obstacles for them to reach form help. This article aims to review the existing literature on COVID-19 related suicides, complicated grief in suicide survivors and highlight modifiable risk factors for both conditions, as well as propose some public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic context on self-inflicted harm and its consequences on families, friends and the community. Obstacles to access to mental health support need to be overcome through the use of technology. Technicians should actively approach populations more vulnerable to develop suicidal ideation. Social media have the obligation to provide accurate an non-sensationalistic information. Families and friends should maintain social proximity, despite the need for physical distancing. When a suicide death occurs, police forces and health staff should be prepared to share the news with the family using an empathic and humane approach and providing psychological support. Funerals, memorials and other services should be held as much as possible. Closer contacts should be signalized and closely followed in order to detect the need for specific interventions. Help seeking behaviors should be promoted. Additionally, people should be educated on suicide and its impacts, in order to reduce stigma.",2476127602.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
48,Impact of Baseline Characteristics on the Effectiveness of Disorder-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) and Supportive Psychotherapy in Outpatient Treatment for Persistent Depressive Disorder.,"Importance: In the treatment of persistent depressive disorder (PDD), disorder-specific Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) has been shown to be superior to Supportive Psychotherapy (SP) in outpatients. It remains to clear which subgroups of patients benefit equally and differentially from both psychotherapies. Objective: To identify those patient-level baseline characteristics that predict a comparable treatment effectiveness of CBASP and SP and those that moderate the differential effectiveness of CBASP compared to SP. Design, setting and participants: In this analysis of a 48-week multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing CBASP to SP in adult antidepressant-free outpatients with early-onset PDD, we evaluated baseline variables from the following domains as potential predictors and moderators of treatment effectiveness: socio-demography, clinical status, psychosocial and global functioning, life quality, interpersonal problems, childhood trauma, treatment history, preference for psychotherapy, and treatment expectancy. Interventions: A 48-week treatment program with 32 sessions of either CBASP or SP. Main outcomes and measures: Depression severity measured by the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) at week 48. Results: From N = 268 randomized outpatients, N = 209 completed the 48-week treatment program. CBASP completers had significantly lower post-treatment HRSD-24 scores than SP completers (meanCBASP=13.96, sdCBASP= 9.56; meanSP= 16.69, sdSP= 9.87; p = 0.04). A poor response to both therapies was predicted by higher baseline levels of clinician-rated depression, elevated suicidality, comorbid anxiety, lower social functioning, higher social inhibition, moderate-to-severe early emotional or sexual abuse, no preference for psychotherapy, and the history of at least one previous inpatient treatment. Moderator analyses revealed that patients with higher baseline levels of self-rated depression, comorbidity of at least one Axis-I disorder, self-reported moderate-to-severe early emotional or physical neglect, or at least one previous antidepressant treatment, had a significantly lower post-treatment depression severity with CBASP compared to SP (all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions and relevance: A complex multifactorial interaction between severe symptoms of depression, suicidality, and traumatic childhood experiences characterized by abuse, social inhibition, and anxiety may represent the basis of non-response to psychotherapy in patients with early onset PDD. Specific psychotherapy with CBASP might, however, be more effective and recommendable for a variety of particularly burdened patients compared to SP.",2476127477.0, Journal Article,2020
49,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Risk Factors for Relapse.,"Background: The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups like patients suffering from substance use disorders is expected to be tremendous, and corresponding concerns were raised early on by many experts around the world. Psychosocial distress, financial insecurities and physiological problems associated with the COVID-19 crisis could be especially challenging for this group of patients. Methods: In the current study data was collected from a clinical sample of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD; N = 127) during the initial stage of the pandemic. The impact of various COVID-19 related factors (physiological, psychosocial, economic and others) on patients' personal life was evaluated. Alcohol consumption, craving, and potential posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed using different scales and their associations were analyzed. Furthermore, differences regarding these variables between comparably sized groups of patients who remained abstinent (N = 37), relapsed (N = 41), or reported unaltered drinking behavior (consuming subgroup, N = 49) were investigated. The impact of sociodemographic and COVID-19 factors on relapse (in comparison to abstinence) was evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Our results confirmed the expected positive associations between alcohol consumption, craving, and PTSD symptoms, respectively, among patients with AUD. Furthermore, group differences indicate significantly lower levels on all three scales for abstinent patients. Although generally low PTSD scores were observed, 8% of our participants were found to be at risk of PTSD. Results of a binary logistic regression analysis indicated the presence of psychosocial COVID-19 factors (e.g., isolation, anxiety, and depression) as well as living alone as two major risk factors for relapse. Discussion: Our findings based on actual patient data support the anticipated negative consequences of the pandemic on persons with AUD. Crucially, our results regarding relapse emphasized psychosocial COVID-19 factors and isolation as especially challenging circumstances for persons with AUD, whereas economic and physiological health aspects seemed of minor impact on relapse. Our results reflect the initial stage of the pandemic, whereas long-term developments should be closely monitored.",2475087200.0, Journal Article,2020
50,Psychometric Evaluation and Comparison of Two Gaming Disorder Measures Derived From the DSM-5 and ICD-11 Frameworks.,"Gaming disorder was listed as a condition for further study in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013, and measures of the disorder have mushroomed in the years since. The Gaming Disorder Test (GDT) was developed after gaming disorder was officially included in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in 2018. However, it remains unknown whether the GDT, which is based on the ICD-11 framework, is psychometrically similar to or different from the popular nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF) based on the DSM-5 framework. To address this important but unexplored issue, the present study evaluated and compared the psychometric properties of the GDT and IGDS9-SF in a sample of 544 adult gamers (56.2% men; mean age = 28.8, SD = 8.55). The results revealed both measures to have good reliability, structural validity, and criterion validity, with the exception of one IGDS9-SF item with a low factor loading. Moreover, the IGDS9-SF exhibited scalar measurement invariance for gender and age but only partial metric invariance for employment status, whereas the GDT exhibited scalar measurement invariance for all three demographic characteristics. Finally, the GDT displayed incremental validity over the IGDS9-SF in explaining gaming time, but not social anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study thus contributes to the literature by comparing measures derived from distinct gaming disorder diagnostic frameworks empirically. Recommendations for the selection of gaming disorder measures by researchers and practitioners are discussed.",2475085699.0, Journal Article,2020
51,Alcohol Use and COVID-19: Can we Predict the Impact of the Pandemic on Alcohol Use Based on the Previous Crises in the 21st Century? A Brief Review.,"The enormous health and economic challenges precipitated by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are comparable or even greater than those associated with previous historical world crises. Alcohol use, especially drinking to cope with stress, is a concern, as an increase in its sales has been reported in some countries during the quarantine. This study aims to provide a better understanding of what to expect in terms of alcohol consumption, risk factors for excessive use, and its potential consequences during this pandemic based on previous experiences. We investigated how traumatic events related to alcohol consumption. Studies on mass traumatic events (i.e., terrorism as 9/11), epidemic outbreaks (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003), economic crises (such as 2008's Great Recession), and COVID-19 were selected. The main keywords used to select the studies were alcohol use, drinking patterns, alcohol use disorders, and alcohol-related consequences. Previous studies reported increases in alcohol use associated with those events mediated, at least partially, by anxiety and depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Being male, young, and single also seems to be associated with a higher vulnerability to develop risky drinking behavior after those tragic events. The discussion of previous risk and protective factors can contribute to elaborate more specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic on people's mental health, especially alcohol-related problems.",2475085532.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
52,Impact of a Combined Philosophy and Mindfulness Intervention on Positive and Negative Indicators of Mental Health Among Pre-kindergarten Children: Results From a Pilot and Feasibility Study.,"Background: Fostering greater resiliency to stress, optimal psychosocial development and promoting better mental health and well-being in youth is an important goal of the Canadian and American elementary school systems (1, 2). Recent research on mindfulness and philosophy for children (P4C) has yielded promising results regarding innovative interventions that may be implemented in elementary school settings to foster greater child resiliency and well-being (3-5). Goal: The goal of this feasibility study was to pilot a new intervention, which combines mindfulness meditation and P4C activities, with the goal of improving mental health in pre-kindergarten children, assessed with positive (i.e., social skills and adaptability) and negative (i.e., internalized symptoms, comprises depression, anxiety, inattention; and hyperactivity) indicators. Methods: A randomized cluster trial with a wait-list control group was employed to evaluate the impact of the combined MBI and P4C intervention on child mental health. Two classrooms of pre-kindergarten children (N = 38, mean age = 4.6 years old) took part in this study and were randomly allocated to the experimental or wait-list control conditions. Teachers completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Results: ANCOVAs did not reveal a significant effect of condition on internalized symptoms, controlling for baseline levels. Sensitivity analyses indicated that for the whole sample, internalized symptom scores were statistically significantly lower at post-intervention, when compared to pre-intervention scores. No impact of group on levels of hyperactivity was found, however, sensitivity analyses indicated that for both the experimental and control groups, hyperactivity scores were statistically significantly lower at post-intervention, when compared to pre-intervention scores. Finally, no impact of group on levels of social skills and adaptability were found. Sensitivity analyses conducted using paired t-tests did not indicate statistically significant pre-to-post changes in scores for both variables. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that mindfulness and philosophy for children may not be the most effective intervention to foster short-term resiliency, well-being and better mental health in children. Yet, group differences were often small and past research suggested the effectiveness of this type of intervention. Further research considering the impact of moderators such as age or baseline levels of psychopathology, using longer time frames and comparing the effectiveness of this combined intervention with other types of school-based interventions with similar aims (such as, e.g., P4C or MBI alone) is warranted, to evaluate if mindfulness and P4C interventions have an added value compared to other types of interventions implemented in school settings.",2474502395.0, Journal Article,2020
53,The Psychological Pressures of Breast Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China-A Comparison With Frontline Female Nurses.,"Objective: During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, breast cancer (BC) patients and healthcare workers faced several challenges, resulting in great psychological stress. We measured the psychological status of BC patients and female nurses and compared the severity within the two groups at the peak time-point of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 207 BC patients and 684 female nurses were recruited from Wuhan. They completed an anonymous questionnaire online using the most popular social media software in China, WeChat. The psychological status of BC patients and of female nurses was measured using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The differences between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The scores of BC patients and frontline female nurses for the four scales were significantly higher than those of non-frontline female nurses (P &lt; 0.001). There were similar scores between BC patients and frontline female nurses for PHQ-9, GAD-7, and IES-R (P = 0.789, P = 0.101, P = 0.158, respectively). Notably, the scores of BC patients for ISI were significantly higher than those of the frontline female nurses (P = 0.016). A considerable proportion of BC patients reported symptoms of depression (106/207, 51.2%), anxiety (130/207, 62.8%), insomnia (106/207, 51.2%), and PTSD (73/207, 35.5%), which was more severe than that of female nurses. Conclusions: BC patients experienced great psychological pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incidents of symptomatic anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and PTSD were significantly comparable to that of frontline female nurses, and episodes of insomnia among BC participants were more serious than for frontline female nurses.",2474502374.0, Journal Article,2020
54,Insomnia in the Italian Population During Covid-19 Outbreak: A Snapshot on One Major Risk Factor for Depression and Anxiety.,"Objectives: One of the largest clusters of Covid-19 infections was observed in Italy. The population was forced to home confinement, exposing individuals to increased risk for insomnia, which is, in turn, associated with depression and anxiety. Through a cross-sectional online survey targeting all Italian adult population (≥18 yrs), insomnia prevalence and its interactions with relevant factors were investigated. Methods: The survey was distributed from 1st April to 4th May 2020. We collected information on insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, sleep hygiene behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, circadian preference, emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility, perceived stress, health habits, self-report of mental disorders, and variables related to individual difference in life changes due to the pandemic's outbreak. Results: The final sample comprised 1,989 persons (38.4 ± 12.8 yrs). Prevalence of clinical insomnia was 18.6%. Results from multivariable linear regression showed that insomnia severity was associated with poor sleep hygiene behaviors [β = 0.11, 95% CI (0.07-0.14)]; dysfunctional beliefs about sleep [β = 0.09, 95% CI (0.08-0.11)]; self-reported mental disorder [β = 2.51, 95% CI (1.8-3.1)]; anxiety [β = 0.33, 95% CI (0.25-0.42)]; and depression [β = 0.24, 95% CI (0.16-0.32)] symptoms. Conclusion: An alarming high prevalence of clinical insomnia was observed. Results suggest that clinical attention should be devoted to problems of insomnia in the Italian population with respect to both prevention and treatment.",2474502309.0, Journal Article,2020
55,"#Everything Will Be Fine. Duration of Home Confinement and ""All-or-Nothing"" Cognitive Thinking Style as Predictors of Traumatic Distress in Young University Students on a Digital Platform During the COVID-19 Italian Lockdown.","On March 10, 2020, Italy announced its lockdown caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and home confinement exposed individuals to a stressful situation of unknown duration. Our study aimed to analyze the emotional and cognitive experiences and the psychopathological symptoms of young Italian University students seeking help from our University student Counseling and Consultation Service during the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, our study aimed to identify the predictors of traumatic psychological distress, investigating variables that could influence the students' well-being, related to their socio-demographic and clinical condition, to the ""exposition"" to the social distancing, and related to their cognitive thinking style. One-hundred and three University students were included in our study. The traumatic impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A digital platform was used in our study, focused on narrative dimensions analyses. Our results showed that 21.4% of our help-seeking students experienced lockdown as a traumatic experience. The main stressful factors reported by students were: adjustment to the new academic activities (23.3 %), lack of autonomy (19.4%), and conflicts with family members (6.8%). The three main areas impaired were: changes in the sleeping pattern (68%), difficulty in concentration (67%), and loss of energy (58.6%). Furthermore, 36% of our student sample reported being suffering from anxiety symptoms, whereas 26% showed depressive symptomatology. Students having previous psychological and psychiatric contacts with mental health services (23%) showed a more severe traumatic and depressive symptomatology. The problematic thinking style ""all or nothing"" was predominantly associated with psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms. ""Everything Will Be Fine"" could be identified by the ""optimistic style"" (27.2%), inversely correlated with the psychopathological measures and concentration problems. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that the length of home confinement (second month) seemed to increase by over 3 times the likelihood of experience posttraumatic symptomatology, and a thinking style ""all or nothing"" was the final strongest predictor increasing the risk by over 5 times. The implementation of psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable young subgroups to contain the structuring of psychopathological profiles represent a fundamental challenge.",2474502259.0, Journal Article,2020
56,Young Adults With Higher Motives and Expectancies of Regular Cannabis Use Show Poorer Psychosocial Functioning.,"Background: Young adults regularly using cannabis represent a uniquely vulnerable yet heterogeneous cohort. Few studies have examined user profiles using cannabis use motives and expectations. The association between user profiles and psychosocial functioning among only regular users remains unexplored. This exploration is important to improve public education efforts and design tailor treatment approaches. Methods: Regular cannabis users (at least weekly; n = 329) completed an online survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey measured levels of cannabis use, other substance use, motives and expectations of cannabis use, symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety and stress, and reckless behavior such as getting high before work or driving under the influence of cannabis. Latent class analysis was performed using motives and expectations to identify data driven patterns of regular cannabis use. Classes were then used to investigate mental health and behavioral correlates of differences in motives and expectations. Results: A 2-class solution provided the best fit to the data; Class 1: Low Motives and Expectancies (n = 158) characterized by lower endorsement across all motivation and expectation variables, and Class 2: High Motives and Expectancies (n = 171) characterized by endorsing multiple motivations, and higher positive and negative expectations of cannabis use. Classes differed in a range of cannabis use variables; e.g., greater proportion of peer use in Class 2. The High Motives and Expectancies users reported higher symptoms of psychosis (positive and negative symptoms), depression, anxiety, and stress. A higher proportion met the criteria for a cannabis use disorder compared with Low Motives and Expectancies users. High Motives and Expectancies users reported higher mean problems with nicotine dependence and illicit drug use other than cannabis and were more likely to get high before work and drive under the influence of cannabis. Conclusions: There is heterogeneity among young regular cannabis users in their motivations and expectancies of use and associated psychosocial functioning. Understanding motives and expectancies can help segregate which users are at higher risk of worse functioning. These findings are timely when designing targeted assessment and treatment strategies, particularly as cannabis is further decriminalized and accessibility increases.",2474502234.0, Journal Article,2020
57,"Acceleration of Anxiety, Depression, and Suicide: Secondary Effects of Economic Disruption Related to COVID-19.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to increasing levels of anxiety, depression and other symptoms of stress around the globe. Reasons for this increase are understandable in the context of individual level factors such as self-isolation, lockdown, grief, survivor guilt, and other factors but also broader social and economic factors such as unemployment, insecure employment and resulting poverty, especially as the impacts of 2008 recession are still being felt in many countries further accompanied by social isolation. For those who are actively employed a fear of job and income loss and those who have actually become ill and recovered or those who have lost family and friends to illness, it is not surprising that they are stressed and feeling the psychological impact. Furthermore, multiple uncertainties contribute to this sense of anxiety. These fears and losses are major immediate stresses and undoubtedly can have long-term implications on mental health. Economic uncertainty combined with a sense of feeling trapped and resulting lack of control can contribute to helplessness and hopelessness where people may see suicide as a way out. Taking a macro view, we present a statistical model of the impact of unemployment, and national income declines, on suicide, separately for males and females over the life cycle in developed countries. This impact may reflect a potent combination of social changes and economic factors resulting in anomie. The governments and policymakers have a moral and ethical obligation to ensure the physical health and well-being of their populations. While setting in place preventive measures to avoid infections and then subsequent mortality, the focus on economic and social recovery is crucial. A global pandemic requires a global response with a clear inter-linked strategy for health as well as economic solutions. The models we have constructed represent predictions of suicide rates among the 38 highly industrialized OECD countries over a period of 18 years (2000-2017). Unemployment has a major effect on increasing suicide, especially in middle-aged groups. However, the impact of economic decline through losses of national income (GDP per capita) are substantially greater than those of unemployment and influence suicide throughout the life course, especially at the oldest ages.",2474502049.0, Journal Article,2020
58,"Impulsivity and Venturesomeness in an Adult ADHD Sample: Relation to Personality, Comorbidity, and Polygenic Risk.","While impulsivity is a basic feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), no study explored the effect of different components of the Impulsiveness (Imp) and Venturesomeness (Vent) scale (IV7) on psychiatric comorbidities and an ADHD polygenic risk score (PRS). We used the IV7 self-report scale in an adult ADHD sample of 903 patients, 70% suffering from additional comorbid disorders, and in a subsample of 435 genotyped patients. Venturesomeness, unlike immediate Impulsivity, is not specific to ADHD. We consequently analyzed the influence of Imp and Vent also in the context of a PRS on psychiatric comorbidities of ADHD. Vent shows a distinctly different distribution of comorbidities, e.g., less anxiety and depression. PRS showed no effect on different ADHD comorbidities, but correlated with childhood hyperactivity. In a complementary analysis using principal component analysis with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ADHD criteria, revised NEO Personality Inventory, Imp, Vent, and PRS, we identified three ADHD subtypes. These are an impulsive-neurotic type, an adventurous-hyperactive type with a stronger genetic component, and an anxious-inattentive type. Our study thus suggests the importance of adventurousness and the differential consideration of impulsivity in ADHD. The genetic risk is distributed differently between these subtypes, which underlines the importance of clinically motivated subtyping. Impulsivity subtyping might give insights into the organization of comorbid disorders in ADHD and different genetic background.",2474467794.0, Journal Article,2020
59,Manifestation and Associated Factors of Pregnancy-Related Worries in Expectant Fathers.,"Background: During the last decades, fathers have increasingly participated in prenatal care, birth preparation classes, and childbirth. However, comparably little is known about the prenatal emotional well-being of fathers, particularly content and extent of broader paternal concerns that may arise during pregnancy beyond those focusing on childbirth. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the manifestation of paternal pregnancy-related worries in a population-based sample and to identify relevant associated factors. Materials and Methods: As part of a longitudinal pregnancy cohort at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, N = 129 expectant fathers were assessed once during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related worries centering around medical procedures, childbirth, health of the baby, as well as socioeconomic aspects were assessed with the Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS). Additionally, paternal socioeconomic background and maternal obstetrical history, symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression, and level of hostility were investigated, as well as perceived social support. The cross-sectional data were analyzed based on multiple regression analyses. Results: The level of reported worries was overall low. Some fathers reported major worries for individual aspects like the health of a significant other (10.9%) and the baby (10.1%), as well as the current financial (6.2%) and employment situation (8.5%). Pregnancy-related worries were negatively associated with household income and positively associated with anxious and depressive symptoms and low perceived social support. Associations varied for specific pregnancy-related worries. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional data examined in this study, a causal interpretation of the results is not possible. The sample was rather homogeneous regarding its socioeconomic background. More research needs to be done in larger, more heterogeneous samples. Conclusion: Though overall worries were rather low in this sample, specific major worries could be identified. Hence, addressing those fathers reporting major worries regarding specific aspects already in prenatal care might support their psychosocial adjustment. Fathers with little income, those with elevated levels of general anxious and depressive symptoms, and those with less social support reported higher pregnancy-related worries. Our results indicate the relevance of concerns beyond health- and birth-related aspects that could be relevant for fathers. Measurements developed specifically for expectant fathers are needed to properly capture their perspective already during pregnancy.",2473411740.0, Journal Article,2020
60,Anxiety Level of University Students During COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.,"COVID-19 is the worst pandemic of this millennium, and it is considered to be the ""public enemy number one."" This catastrophe has changed the way we live in the blink of an eye. Not only has it threatened our existence and health status, but the damage associated with it could equally affect our economic, social, and educational systems. The focus of this study was on the anxiety level of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted between March and June 2020. A questionnaire was administered online, and 400 completed questionnaires were returned. In this study, the Zung self-rating anxiety scale was used to determine the anxiety levels among the respondents. The results indicated that about 35% of the students experienced moderate to extreme levels of anxiety. Anxiety was highly associated with age, sex, and level of education. These findings can enlighten government agencies and policy makers on the importance of making prompt, effective decisions to address students' anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers are encouraged to focus their future studies on how to develop strategies to boost students' resilience and enhance their adaptability skills for similar disasters in the future.",2473411267.0, Journal Article,2020
61,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Nurses in China: A Nationwide Survey During the Outbreak.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health issue and challenge to health professionals. In similar epidemics, nurses experienced more distress than other providers. Methods: We surveyed both on-duty nurses caring for infected patients and second-line nurses caring for uninfected patients from Hubei and other provinces throughout China. Results: We received completed surveys from 1,364 nurses from 22 provinces: 658 front-line and 706 second-line nurses. The median (IQR) GHQ-28 score of all nurses was 17 (IQR 11-24). The overall incidence of mild-to-moderate distress (GHQ score &gt; 5) was 28%; that for severe distress (GHQ score &gt; 11) was 6%. The incidence of mild-to-moderate distress in the second-line nurses was higher than that in the front-line nurses (31 vs. 25%; OR, 0.74; 95 CI, 0.58-0.94). Living alone (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.86) and feeling supported (OR, 0.82, 95% CI, 0.74-0.90) independently predicted lower anxiety. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological problems of all nurses were generally serious. The interviewed second-line nurses face more serious issues than the front-line nurses.",2473405915.0, Journal Article,2020
62,Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Variations in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder Before and After Antidepressant Treatment.,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) had been identified as a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the mechanism of antidepressant treatment. The primary aim of the present study was to examine the serum TNF-α levels in Chinese inpatients with MDD during the acute phase and to explore the changes in TNF-α levels after effective clinical treatment. Fifty-seven consecutive inpatients with MDD and 30 healthy controls were recruited. The serum TNF-α levels were detected using ELISA. Symptoms of depression were evaluated using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24). TNF-α levels and HAM-D-24 scores were assessed at baseline and after 2 and 12 weeks of follow-up. The serum TNF-α levels were higher in the MDD group than in the control group. After 2 and 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment, there were significant improvements in the patients' symptoms and significant decreases in the TNF-α levels. The baseline TNF-α levels significantly correlated with the decreased HAM-D-24 scores, particularly for the depressive symptoms of anxiety/somatization and weight loss. The present findings indicate that depression is accompanied by activation of TNF-α, which also has a predictive value for the antidepressant treatment response in patients with MDD.",2473400190.0, Journal Article,2020
63,Facing Loneliness and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Isolation: The Role of Excessive Social Media Use in a Sample of Italian Adults.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prompted people to face a distressing and unexpected situation. Uncertainty and social distancing changed people's behaviors, impacting on their feelings, daily habits, and social relationships, which are core elements in human well-being. In particular, restrictions due to the quarantine increased feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Within this context, the use of digital technologies has been recommended to relieve stress and anxiety and to decrease loneliness, even though the overall effects of social media consumption during pandemics still need to be carefully addressed. In this regard, social media use evidence risk and opportunities. In fact, according to a compensatory model of Internet-related activities, the online environment may be used to alleviate negative feelings caused by distressing life circumstances, despite potentially leading to negative outcomes. The present study examined whether individuals who were experiencing high levels of loneliness during the forced isolation for COVID-19 pandemic were more prone to feel anxious, and whether their sense of loneliness prompted excessive social media use. Moreover, the potentially mediating effect of excessive social media use in the relationship between perceived loneliness and anxiety was tested. A sample of 715 adults (71.5% women) aged between 18 and 72 years old took part in an online survey during the period of lockdown in Italy. The survey included self-report measures to assess perceived sense of loneliness, excessive use of social media, and anxiety. Participants reported that they spent more hours/day on social media during the pandemic than before the pandemic. We found evidence that perceived feelings of loneliness predicted both excessive social media use and anxiety, with excessive social media use also increasing anxiety levels. These findings suggest that isolation probably reinforced the individuals' sense of loneliness, strengthening the need to be part of virtual communities. However, the facilitated and prolonged access to social media during the COVID-19 pandemic risked to further increase anxiety, generating a vicious cycle that in some cases may require clinical attention.",2473398632.0, Journal Article,2020
64,Personality Traits and Disorders in Adolescents at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis: Toward a Clinically Meaningful Diagnosis.,"Aims: Recent meta-analytic data show that approximately 40% of individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) receive at least one personality disorder (PD) diagnosis. Personality pathology could significantly influence CHR patients' prognosis and response to treatment. We aimed at exploring the PD traits of CHR adolescents, in order to outline a prototypic description of their most frequently observed personality characteristics. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three psychiatrists and psychologists used a Q-sort procedure [i.e., the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 for Adolescents (SWAP-200-A)] to assess personality traits and disorders in 58 (30 male; mean age = 16 years, range = 13-19 years) CHR adolescents and two gender- and age-matched samples, respectively, with (n = 60) and without PDs (n = 59). Results: Differences between the CHR, PD, and clinical groups showed that CHR adolescents had pervasive and more clinically relevant schizoid, schizotypal, borderline, and avoidant traits, as well as poorer adaptive functioning. Moreover, by collecting the highest mean SWAP-200-A items, we empirically outlined a prototypic description of CHR youths, comprised of avoidance of social relationships; suspiciousness; obsessional thoughts; lack of psychological insight; dysphoric and overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression; odd and anomalous reasoning processes or perceptual experiences; symptoms of depersonalization and derealization; and negative symptoms of avolition, abulia, blunted affects, and impaired role functioning. Conclusions: The results suggest that avoidant interpersonal strategies, impaired mentalization, and difficulties in emotional regulation could become important targets for psychosocial interventions with CHR adolescent populations.",2473398616.0, Journal Article,2020
65,Tele-Psychiatry Assessment of Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms in 100 Patients With Bipolar Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Social-Distancing Measures in Italy.,"The acute phase of the COrona VIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) emergency determined relevant stressful burdens in psychiatric patients, particularly those with chronic mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), not only for the threat of being infected but also for the strict lock-down and social-distancing measures adopted, the economic uncertainty, and the limited possibilities to access psychiatric services. In this regard, telepsychiatry services represented a new important instrument that clinicians could adopt to monitor and support their patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate acute post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) reported by patients with BD followed in the framework of a telepsychiatry service, set up in the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak at the psychiatric clinic of the University of Pisa (Italy). A sample of 100 patients were consecutively enrolled and assessed by the IES-r, GAD-7, HAM-D, and YMRS. Patients reported a mean (±SD) IES-r total score of 18.15 ± 13.67. Further, 17% of the sample reported PTSS (IES-r &gt; 32), 17% depressive symptoms (HAM-D &gt; 17), and 26% anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 &gt; 10). Work and financial difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and anxiety symptoms appeared to be positively associated with the development of acute PTSS. Acute manic symptoms appeared to be protective. The data of the present study suggest the relevance of monitoring patients with BD exposed to the burden related to the COVID-19 outbreak for prompt assessment and treatment of PTSS.",2471536481.0, Journal Article,2020
66,The Effect of Subjective Perception of Work in Relation to Occupational and Demographic Factors on the Mental Health of Polish Nurses.,"Introduction: Nursing is considered one of the most stressful professions in the world. The high emotional burden associated with excessive workload in qualitative and quantitative terms, exposure to existing and emerging infectious diseases, daily confrontation with the suffering of individuals and their families and low social support leads to the development of numerous stress reactions among nurses, resulting in the development of anxiety, insomnia, social dysfunction and depression. Indeed, somatic and mental stress-related disease rates are higher among nurses than in the general population. Aim: To determine the impact of subjective work characteristics on the mental health of nurses in relation to demographic and occupational factors. Material and method: The research was carried out among 558 nurses working in hospitals in Podlaskie Voivodeship, and used the Subjective Work Evaluation Questionnaire (SWEQ) and Goldberg's GHQ-28 Questionnaire. Results: As measured by SWEQ, and as self-assessed by means of the GHQ-28 questionnaire, overall stress negatively affects the nurses' health (R 2 = 18.7%). Among the partial measures of the SWEQ questionnaire, work overload had strong and the lack of rewards, social relations and lack of support had weak negative effect on the overall mental health assessment of nurses (R 2 = 19.2%). The responsibility measure was an exception that had a positive impact on the nurses' well-being. Among occupational and demographic factors, only higher education in relation to secondary education in interactions with the overall stress measure and unpleasant work conditions had a positive effect on the overall mental health self-assessment of nurses (R 2 = 20.7%). Conclusions: The results of our study provide a clear message to the hospital management that improving the work organization and atmosphere of nurses by reducing perceived work overload and increasing the responsibility of nurses can have a positive impact on their mental health. Encouraging nurses to improve their education can result not only in an obvious improvement in staff qualifications, but also in better resistance to stressors in the workplace and, consequently, in better staff well-being. Both measures can have a positive impact on the quality of care provided by nurses and on reducing staff turnover.",2471535871.0, Journal Article,2020
67,Interaction Between Smoking and Internet Gaming Disorder on Spontaneous Brain Activity.,"Converging lines of evidence indicates that smoking and internet gaming disorder (IGD) affect spontaneous brain activity, respectively. However, little is known about whether these two factors work together on the human brain. In this study, we investigated the interaction between smoking and IGD on local spontaneous brain activity using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Forty-six cigarette smokers, 38 IGD individuals, 34 participants with both IGD and cigarette smoking (IGD-Smoking), and 60 healthy individuals involved in the study. Voxel-wise analysis of covariance of ALFF revealed that there were significant interactions between IGD by smoking in the right medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC)/ventral striatum, bilateral cerebellar, and visual-related regions as well as the left temporal gyrus. In the right MPFC/ventral striatum and left temporal gyrus, ALFF in smoking group was significantly higher than healthy group while there were no significant ALFF differences between IGD-Smoking group and IGD group. While in the bilateral cerebellar and visual-related regions, ALFF in the smoking group was significantly lower than healthy group while ALFF in IGD-Smoking group did not show significant difference with IGD group. In addition, in the smoking group, ALFF of the right MPFC/ventral striatum was associated positively with anxiety and depression scores while the ALFF value in the smoking group had a trend toward negative correlation with SDS scores in the bilateral cerebellar and visual-related regions. The ALFF value in the smoking group was associated positively with anxiety score in the left temporal gyrus. These findings indicate that smoking and IGD interacted with each other in the human brain. Our results, in terms of spontaneous brain activity, may imply the fact that IGD people are more tended to get smoking. Moreover, it is possible to predict that smokers may be more easily to get internet addiction than healthy people.",2471535792.0, Journal Article,2020
68,"Psychological Status Among Anesthesiologists and Operating Room Nurses During the Outbreak Period of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) posed a major threat to public health. Anesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses are at high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19. We conducted a single-center survey to investigate the psychological status and perceived social support among operation room (OR) medical staffs during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 197 OR medical staffs were enrolled in the survey. The authors performed a cohort study during the period of Wuhan lockdown and then conducted a longitudinal follow-up after lifting of lockdown. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess perceived social support. We compared the psychological status of OR medical staffs before and after lifting of Wuhan lockdown. Results: During the period of city lockdown, 177 (89.8%) had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in OR medical staffs was 41.6 and 43.1% under Wuhan lockdown, while 13.2 and 15.7% after lifting of lockdown (P = 0.002, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, living in suburb areas, shortage of protective equipment and close contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety severity in the OR medical staffs (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: OR medical staffs exhibited high incidence of anxiety and depression faced with the high risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients. More social support and social recognition for anesthesiologists and OR nurses might potentially help them relieve their psychological pressure.",2471534883.0, Journal Article,2020
69,A Narrative Review of Stigma Related to Infectious Disease Outbreaks: What Can Be Learned in the Face of the Covid-19 Pandemic?,"Infectious disease pandemics are associated with social consequences and stigma that are noticeably similar in various health conditions, health systems, and cultures. Stigma impacts health-related outcomes, not only as a barrier to receiving the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment but also as an important variable that increases mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with stigma too. Studying similarities as well as differences in the features of stigma observed in each outbreak can provide us with the knowledge and deeper understanding of the situation, which is necessary for approaching the issue comprehensively. The stigma needs to be addressed rigorously by professionals and health care providers as well as authorities. Here, we narratively review stigma due to some well-known infectious diseases and how it parallels to the current COVID-19 situation. After discussing its effects on both individuals and societies, we provide solutions to manage this important issue.",2471534818.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
70,Influencing Factors and Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Side Effects in Psychotherapy.,"Background: Side effects in psychotherapy are a common phenomenon, but due to insufficient understanding of the relevant predictors of side effects in psychotherapy, many psychotherapists or clinicians fail to identify and manage these side effects. The purpose of this study was to predict whether clients or patients would experience side effects in psychotherapy by machine learning and to analyze the related influencing factors. Methods: A self-compiled ""Psychotherapy Side Effects Questionnaire (PSEQ)"" was delivered online by a WeChat official account. Three hundred and seventy participants were included in the cross-sectional analysis. Psychotherapy outcomes were classified as participants with side effects and without side effects. A number of features were selected to distinguish participants with different psychotherapy outcomes. Six machine learning-based algorithms were then chosen and trained by our dataset to build outcome prediction classifiers. Results: Our study showed that: (1) the most common side effects were negative emotions in psychotherapy, such as anxiety, tension, sadness, and anger, etc. (24.6%, 91/370); (2) the mental state of the psychotherapist, as perceived by the participant during psychotherapy, was the most relevant feature to predict whether clients would experience side effects in psychotherapy; (3) a Random Forest-based machine learning classifier offered the best prediction performance of the psychotherapy outcomes, with an F1-score of 0.797 and an AUC value of 0.804. These numbers indicate a high prediction performance, which allowed our approach to be used in practice. Conclusions: Our Random Forest-based machine learning classifier could accurately predict the possible outcome of a client in psychotherapy. Our study sheds light on the influencing factors of the side effects of psychotherapy and could help psychotherapists better predict the outcomes of psychotherapy.",2471534737.0, Journal Article,2020
71,Psychological Symptoms and Behavioral Changes in Children and Adolescents During the Early Phase of COVID-19 Quarantine in Three European Countries.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced the home confinement of the majority of population around the world, including a significant number of children and adolescents, for several weeks in 2020. Negative psychological effects have been identified in adults, but research about the impact of this type of social distancing measure on children and adolescents is scarce. The present study aimed to describe and compare the immediate psychological and behavioral symptoms associated with COVID-19 quarantine in children and adolescents from three southern European countries with different levels of restrictions (Italy, Spain, and Portugal). Parents of 1,480 children and adolescents (52.8% boys) between 3 and 18 years old (M = 9.15, SD = 4.27) participated in the study. An online survey using snowball sampling techniques was conducted during 15 days between March and April 2020, representing the early phase of the quarantine associated with COVID-19 outbreak. Parents answered questionnaires about sociodemographic data, housing conditions, immediate psychological responses during quarantine (e.g., anxiety, mood, sleep, and behavioral alterations), patterns of use of screens, daily physical activity, and sleep hours before and during the quarantine. The results revealed an increase in children's psychological and behavioral symptoms, increased screen-time, reduced physical activity, and more sleep hours/night. Italian children presented less psychological and behavioral symptoms compared with Portuguese and Spanish children. In general, hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that having an outdoor exit in the house (e.g., garden, terrace) contributed to lower levels of psychological and behavioral symptomatology. Future studies are needed to identify family and individual variables that can better predict children and adolescents' well-being during and after quarantine. Recommendations for families and implications for practice are discussed.",2471534466.0, Journal Article,2020
72,Connecting During COVID-19: A Protocol of a Volunteer-Based Telehealth Program for Supporting Older Adults' Health.,"Introduction: Social-distancing due to COVID-19 has led to social isolation, stress, and mental health issues in older adults, while overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. Telehealth involving phone calls by trained volunteers is understudied and may be a low-cost, scalable, and valuable preventive tool for mental health. In this context, from patient participatory volunteer initiatives, we have adapted and developed an innovative volunteer-based telehealth intervention program for older adults (TIP-OA). Methods and analysis: To evaluate TIP-OA, we are conducting a mixed-methods longitudinal observational study. Participants: TIP-OA clients are older adults (age ≥ 60) recruited in Montreal, Quebec. Intervention: TIP-OA volunteers make weekly friendly phone calls to seniors to check in, form connections, provide information about COVID-19, and connect clients to community resources as needed. Measurements: Perceived stress, fear surrounding COVID-19, depression, and anxiety will be assessed at baseline, and at 4- and 8-weeks. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to assess the experiences of clients, volunteers, and stakeholders. Results: As of October 15th, 2020, 150 volunteers have been trained to provide TIP-OA to 305 older clients. We will consecutively select 200 clients receiving TIP-OA for quantitative data collection, plus 16 volunteers and 8 clinicians for focus groups, and 15 volunteers, 10 stakeholders, and 25 clients for semi-structured interviews. Discussion: During COVID-19, healthcare professionals' decreased availability and increased needs related to geriatric mental health are expected. If successful and scalable, volunteer-based TIP-OA may help prevent and improve mental health concerns, improve community participation, and decrease healthcare utilization.

73,Measuring Clinical Efficacy Through the Lens of Audit Data in Different Adult Eating Disorder Treatment Programmes.,"Background: Audit data is important in creating a clear picture of clinical reality in clinical services, and evaluating treatment outcomes. This paper explored the data from an audit of a large national eating disorder (ED) service and evaluated the outcome of inpatient and day treatment programmes for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) with and without autistic traits. Methods: Four hundred and seventy-six patients receiving treatment for AN at inpatient (IP), day-care (DC) and step-up (SU) programmes were assessed at admission and at discharge on the following measures: autistic traits, body-mass-index (BMI), ED symptoms, depression and anxiety symptoms, work and social functioning, and motivation for change. Outcomes were analyzed first at a within-group level based on change in mean scores and then at an individual level based on the clinical significance of improvement in eating disorder symptoms. Outcomes were compared between patients with high autistic traits (HAT) and low autistic traits (LAT) in each programme. Results: The findings suggest that 45.5% of DC and 35.1% of IP patients showed clinically significant changes in ED symptoms following treatment. Co-occurring high autistic traits positively predicted improvement in ED symptoms in IP setting, but was a negative predictor in DC. In IP, more HAT inpatients no longer met the BMI cut-off for AN compared to LAT peers. In terms of general psychopathology, patients with AN and HAT exhibited more severe depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and social functioning impairment than their LAT peers, and these symptoms stayed clinically severe after treatment. Conclusions: Patients with AN and hight autistic traits are more likely than their peers with low autistic traits to show weight restoration and improvement in ED systems after inpatient treatment. This reverses in DC, with high autistic trait patients less likely to improve after treatment compared to low autistic trait patients. Our results suggest that inpatient treatment with individualized and structured routine care may be an effective model of treatment for patients with AN and high autistic traits.",2471465206.0, Journal Article,2020
74,Loneliness and Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk Factors and Associations With Psychopathology.,"Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. This study investigates (a) potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic and (b) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for 2 weeks. The resulting sample of 10,061 respondents was unproportionate in terms of gender and educational level and thus sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Among the stable factors, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with small effect sizes. Among the state risk factors, more rumination and worry in general were associated with stronger loneliness, showing a medium effect size. Among the coping behaviors examined, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a small effect size. Loneliness was associated with both depression and anxiety with small effect sizes when all potential confounders and psychiatric diagnosis were controlled for. The relationship to depression was more marked than the relationship to anxiety. Conclusions: The findings suggest that singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected by loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety symptoms. The results of the analysis of potential risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.",2470904016.0, Journal Article,2020
75,"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd? Maternal and Paternal Talk About Their Infant Differs in Associations With Wellbeing, Couple Relationship Quality, and Caregiving Sensitivity.","Problems of depression and anxiety are common in early parenthood and adversely affect parenting quality (1). Rumination is closely linked to poor wellbeing (2), suggesting that self-focus may be one mediator of the association between wellbeing and caregiving [e.g., (3)]. Framed within an international study of first-time mothers and fathers (4), the current study included 396 British mothers and fathers (in 198 heterosexual cohabiting couple relationships) of first-born 4-month-old infants. Parents reported on their symptoms of depression, anxiety and satisfaction in their couple relationship. Five-minute speech samples were transcribed and coded for parents' pronoun use (i.e., ""I"" and either infant- or partner-inclusive use of ""We""), whilst observations in the Still-Face paradigm were coded for parental sensitivity to infants' cues. Our first goal was to test whether new parents' self-focus was associated with wellbeing and couple relationship quality. We also examined whether (i) self-focus mediated the expected association between wellbeing and caregiving sensitivity and (ii) couple relationship quality moderated the expected association between self-focus and caregiver sensitivity. Finally, we compared results for mothers and fathers. Our results illustrate gender-specific associations. First, although mean levels of self-focus and partner-inclusive talk were similar for mothers and fathers, infant-inclusive use of the ""we"" pronoun was higher in mothers than fathers. Second, self-focus was unrelated to either mothers' or fathers' wellbeing, but was associated with fathers' report of reduced couple relationship quality. In addition, poor perinatal wellbeing was associated with reduced partner-inclusive talk for fathers, but with reduced use of infant-inclusive talk for mothers. Third, mediation models suggest that reduced infant-inclusive talk underpins the association between poor wellbeing and reduced sensitivity in mothers, but not fathers. Fourth, in the context of good couple relationship quality, mothers' elevated partner-inclusive talk was associated with reduced caregiving sensitivity. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for interventions to support new mothers and fathers, who may benefit from distinct strategies to foster attention to their developing infant.",2470904012.0, Journal Article,2020
76,"Impact of Social Isolation on the Behavioral, Functional Profiles, and Hippocampal Atrophy Asymmetry in Dementia in Times of Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19): A Translational Neuroscience Approach.","The impact of COVID-19 on the elderly is devastating, and nursing homes are struggling to provide the best care to the most fragile. The urgency and severity of the pandemic forces the use of segregation in restricted areas and confinement in individual rooms as desperate strategies to avoid the spread of disease and the worst-case scenario of becoming a deadly trap. The conceptualization of the post-COVID-19 era implies strong efforts to redesign all living conditions, care/rehabilitation interventions, and management of loneliness forced by social distance measures. Recently, a study of gender differences in COVID-19 found that men are more likely to suffer more severe effects of the disease and are over twice as likely to die. It is well-known that dementia is associated with increased mortality, and males have worse survival and deranged neuro-immuno-endocrine systems than females. The present study examines the impact of long-term isolation in male 3xTg-AD mice modeling advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and as compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging. We used a battery of ethological and unconditioned tests resembling several areas in nursing homes. The main findings refer to an exacerbated (two-fold increase) hyperactivity and emergence of bizarre behaviors in isolated 3xTg-AD mice, worrisome results since agitation is a challenge in the clinical management of dementia and an important cause of caregiver burden. This increase was consistently shown in gross (activity in most of the tests) and fine (thermoregulatory nesting) motor functions. Isolated animals also exhibited re-structured anxiety-like patterns and coping-with-stress strategies. Bodyweight and kidney weight loss were found in AD-phenotypes and increased by isolation. Spleen weight loss was isolation dependent. Hippocampal tau pathology was not modified, but asymmetric atrophy of the hippocampus, recently described in human patients with dementia and modeled here for the first time in an animal model of AD, was found to increase with isolation. Overall, the results show awareness of the impact of isolation in elderly patients with dementia, offering some guidance from translational neuroscience in these times of coronavirus and post-COVID-19 pandemic. They also highlight the relevance of personalized-based interventions tailored to the heterogeneous and complex clinical profile of the individuals with dementia and to consider the implications on caregiver burden.",2470903988.0, Journal Article,2020
77,"Jie-Yu Pill, A Proprietary Herbal Medicine, Ameliorates Mood Disorder-Like Behavior and Cognitive Impairment in Estrogen-Deprived Mice Exposed to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress: Implication for a Potential Therapy of Menopause Syndrome.","Jie-Yu Pill (JYP) is a proprietary herbal medicine initially developed to treat menstrual mood disorders. This study sought to determine whether JYP could alleviate menopausal psychiatric symptoms in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, an animal model of estrogen deprivation, exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and the underlying mechanisms in comparison with estrogen therapy. The OVX+CUMS mice were treated with 0.3 mg/kg estradiol (E2), 2.5 g/kg or 5 g/kg JYP for 36 days, and tested in multiple behavioral paradigms. Serum, uterus, and brain tissues were collected for the measurement of hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO) and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, neurotrophins, and estrogen receptors. JYP and E2 had comparable efficacy in reducing anxiety- and depression-like behavior and cognitive impairment of the OVX+CUMS mice. E2 strikingly increased ratio of uterus to body weight of the OVX+CUMS mice, but JYP did not. Both agents suppressed HPO-axis upstream hormones, inhibited HPA-axis hyperactivity by reinstating hypothalamic GABA, restored hippocampal and prefrontal glutamate contents and its receptor expression in the OVX+CUMS mice. While JYP and E2 protected against decreases in hippocampal and prefrontal neurotrophins and estrogen receptors of the OVX+CUMS mice, unlike E2, JYP had no significant effects on these biomarkers in the uterus. These results suggest that JYP has comparable efficacy in ameliorating mood disorder-like behavior and cognitive impairment induced by a combination of estrogen deprivation and chronic stress in association with certain differential uterus-brain mechanisms compared to estrogen therapy. JYP may be a potential therapy for menopause-associated psychiatric disorders.",2470903952.0, Journal Article,2020
78,High-Dose Dependence and Cognitive Side Effects to Medical Prescription of Etizolam.,"Introduction: The use of novel designer drugs has increased worldwide over the years. Etizolam is a designer benzodiazepine (BZD) that has raised concern because of its growing non-medical use, liability to tolerance and dependence, and related harms. Studies exploring the abuse liability and cognitive effects of etizolam outside the therapeutic doses are lacking. Aims: To explore the abuse liability of etizolam and the characteristics of patients affected by etizolam high-dose dependence in a nationwide tertiary referral addiction unit. To document the cognitive changes to etizolam high-dose use. Design and Methods: Sociodemographic and clinical data on subjects with etizolam high-dose use were retrospectively collected from a database of 1,293 patients consecutively admitted to the Addiction Medicine Unit, Verona University Hospital, Italy for detoxification from high-dose BZDs or Z-drugs dependence. Thorough neuropsychological testing explored the cognitive side effects of high-dose etizolam use. Results: We found eleven etizolam high-dose users, of which eight used etizolam only, and three used etizolam with other BZDs/zolpidem. All the patients were prescribed etizolam for medical reasons, i.e., anxiety and/or insomnia. Neuropsychological evaluation showed deficits of working memory, visuospatial memory and executive function in a 27-year-old woman who used etizolam 15 mg daily. Discussion: Our findings suggest that abuse and dependence liability of etizolam should be considered a public health and social problem. They offer preliminary evidence on the cognitive side effects of etizolam high-dose use. Conclusions: This report offers new information on the potential harms of etizolam in patients who are prescribed this drug for medical reasons.",2470903893.0, Journal Article,2020
79,Curcumin in Depression: Potential Mechanisms of Action and Current Evidence-A Narrative Review.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating disorders. Current available treatments are somehow limited, so alternative therapeutic approaches targeting different biological pathways are being investigated to improve treatment outcomes. Curcumin is the main active component in the spice turmeric that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of conditions, including anxiety and depressive disorders. In the past decades, curcumin has drawn researchers' attention and displays a broad range of properties that seem relevant to depression pathophysiology. In this review, we break down the potential mechanisms of action of curcumin with emphasis on the diverse systems that can be disrupted in MDD. Curcumin has displayed, in a number of studies, a potency in modulating neurotransmitter concentrations, inflammatory pathways, excitotoxicity, neuroplasticity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal disturbances, insulin resistance, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and endocannabinoid system, all of which can be involved in MDD pathophysiology. To date, a handful of clinical trials have been published and suggest a benefit of curcumin in MDD. With evidence that is progressively growing, curcumin appears as a promising alternative option in the management of MDD.",2470903861.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
80,Psychological Health Issues Subsequent to SARS-Cov 2 Restrictive Measures: The Role of Parental Bonding and Attachment Style.,"Background: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide. In Italy, a nationwide state of alert was declared on January 31st, leading to the confinement of the entire population from March 11 to May 18, 2020. Isolation and quarantine measures cause psychological problems, especially for individuals who are recognized as being vulnerable. Parental bonding and attachment styles play a role in the programming of the stress response system. Here, we hypothesize that the response to restricted social contact and mobility due to the pandemic has detrimental effects on mental-psychological health and that this relationship is, at least in part, modulated by parental bonding and attachment relationships that are experienced at an early age. Methods: A sample of 68 volunteer University students was screened for psychopathological symptoms (SCL-90-R and STAI-Y), stress perception (PSS), attachment style (RQ), and parental care and overcontrol (PBI) 6 months before the confinement. In the same subjects, psychopathological symptoms and stress perception were measured again during confinement. Results: Overall, psychological health and stress management deteriorated across the entire sample during confinement. Specifically, a significant increase in phobic anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and perceived stress was observed. Notably, parental bonding and attachment styles modulated the psychological status during the lockdown. Individuals with secure attachment and high levels of parental care (high care) showed increased levels of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 2, compared with phase 1. In contrast, individuals with insecure attachment and low levels of parental care (low care) already showed a high rate of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 1 that did not increase further during phase 2. Conclusion: The general deterioration of psychological health in the entire sample demonstrates the pervasiveness of this stressor, a decline that is partially modulated by attachment style and parental bonding. These results implicated disparate sensitivities to environmental changes in the high- and low care groups during the lockdown, the former of which shows the greatest flexibility in the response to environment, suggesting adequate and functional response to stress in high care individuals, which is not observable in the low care group.",2470903588.0, Journal Article,2020
81,Effect of Psychological-Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients.,"The COVID-19 epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health stress. In this study, we explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent depression and anxiety assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social support level was also evaluated by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at admission. Results showed that gender, age, oxygen saturation, and social support were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. In addition, age, family infection with SARS-CoV-2, and social support were the risk factors associated with depression. Moreover, we designed a psychological-behavioral intervention (PBI) program that included psychological support and breathing exercises, and explored its effects on patients with COVID-19. Of the 144 participants, 26 patients with both anxiety and depression symptoms (cutoff score of ≥8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. After 10-day treatment, the HADS scores of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the intervention group, and PSSS scores were also significantly improved. However, no significant differences in HADS and PSSS scores between pre- and post-treatment were found in the control group. Our findings indicate that mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for COVID-19 patients.",2470903558.0, Journal Article,2020
82,"Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on International University Students, Related Stressors, and Coping Strategies.","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted university teaching globally. The mental health impacts on international university students have been overlooked. Aims: This study examined the differences in COVID-19-related stressors and mental health impacts between international university students studying in the UK or USA who returned to their home country or region (returnees) and those who stayed in their institution country (stayers), and identified COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies that were predictors of mental health. Method: An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 28 through May 12, 2020 using an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy (registered at the National Institutes of Health: NCT04365361). Results: A total of 124 full-time international university students (36.3% male) were included: 75.8% had returned to their home country or region for reasons related to COVID-19; 77.4% were pursuing a bachelor's program, and 53.2% were in programs with practicum component. 84.7% of all students had moderate-to-high perceived stress, 12.1% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and 17.7% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of insomnia. Compared with returnees, stayers had significantly higher stress from COVID-19-related stressors such as personal health and lack of social support (Cohen's d: 0.57-1.11), higher perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)] {22.6 ± 6.2 vs. 19.1 ± 6.1, β [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 4.039 (0.816, 7.261), Cohen's d: 0.52}, and more severe insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)] [11.8 ± 6.1 vs. 7.6 ± 5.2, β (95% CI): 3.087 (0.262, 5.912), Cohen's d: 0.45], with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Compared with males, females reported significantly higher stress from uncertainties about academic program (Cohen's d: 0.45) with a small effect size. In the total sample, stress related to academics (e.g., personal attainment, uncertainties about academic program, and changes in teaching/learning format), health (including personal health and health of family and friends), availability of reliable COVID-19-related information, and lack of social support predicted more negative mental health impacts. Resilience, positive thinking, and exercise were predictors of less severe mental health impacts. Conclusions: Stayers experienced more adverse mental health impacts than returnees. We call on educators and mental health professionals to provide appropriate support for international students, particularly the stayers, during the pandemic.",2470903366.0, Journal Article,2020
83,Anxiety Status and Influencing Factors of Rural Residents in Hunan During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Objective: To explore the status quo of anxiety and its influencing factors among rural residents in Hunan Province during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, and to provide an effective basis for prevention of and intervention for anxiety symptoms among rural residents. Methods: Convenience sampling was used. An online questionnaire was distributed to Hunan rural residents through the questionnaire star platform from February 26-29, 2020. The general data and anxiety of Hunan rural residents were investigated, and the data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0. Results: The mean Self-Rating Anxiety Scale score of 179 rural residents in Hunan was 40.93 ± 9.36. Based on the cutoff criteria, 32 residents had anxiety, including 26 with mild anxiety, five with moderate anxiety, and one with severe anxiety. The detection rate of anxiety was 17.88%. Self-rated health status, level of concern about the epidemic, and self-rated impact of the epidemic on one's life were the factors influencing the anxiety score of rural residents in Hunan (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: During the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, the detection rate of anxiety in rural residents in Hunan was higher than that of the general population in China. The relevant departments should pay attention to the mental health of rural residents and implement targeted mental health prevention and intervention measures during the epidemic situation.",2470903354.0, Journal Article,2020
84,Psychometric Properties of the Chinese SUPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale: Factor Structure and Measurement Invariance Across Gender and Age.,"Objective: Impulsivity is widely recognized as a risk factor for a variety of mental disorders and problematic behaviors. The Short UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P) is an extensively used instrument to measure impulsivity in research and clinical settings. The current study primarily aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the SUPPS-P (C-SUPPS-P) among Chinese adolescents and emerging adults, and then to test its measurement invariance across gender and age. Methods: Data were collected from three vocational high schools and six colleges in Changsha, China. A total of 2,551 participants (20.1% male and 22.6% adolescents) completed the C-SUPPS-P and scales assessing addictive and problematic smartphone use, as well as emotional symptoms (anxiety, stress, depression). Four alternative models were examined and compared by using confirmatory factor analysis to determine the best factor structure of the C-SUPPS-P. Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses were used to test measurement invariance across gender and age. Results: A theory-driven five-factor structure consistent with the original scale was identified. All of the subscales had good internal consistency. The correlations observed with the other scales supported the construct validity of the C-SUPPS-P. Full measurement invariance was established across gender and age, and significant gender and age differences according to impulsivity facets were identified. Conclusions: The C-SUPPS-P presents a consistent factor structure, as well as reliability and validity that are equivalent to those of the original scale. The full measurement invariance shown across gender and age allows for intergroup comparisons. Overall, the C-SUPPS-P is a promising instrument to measure various impulsivity traits in Chinese adolescents and emerging adults.",2470903336.0, Journal Article,2020
85,Offspring of Mothers With Histories of Chronic and Non-chronic Depression: Symptom Trajectories From Ages 6 to 15.,"Several studies have reported that individuals with chronic depression have higher rates of depressive disorders, and particularly chronic depression, in their first-degree relatives, compared to those with non-chronic (episodic) major depression. In addition, a few studies have suggested that offspring of parents with chronic depression have elevated rates of depression and other psychopathology. Most of this work uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which defines chronicity as persistence for at least 2 years. An alternative is a life-course, approach, which evaluates overall course since first onset. We examined the trajectories of depressive, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms in a community sample of 577 offspring of mothers with histories of chronic depression, non-chronic (or episodic) major depression, and no depression using prospective, multi-informant assessments from age 6 to age 15. Offspring of mothers with a history of depression exhibited higher levels of depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms than offspring of mothers who were never depressed. Moreover, the effects of maternal depression on offspring depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms were more pronounced for mothers with histories of chronic than non-chronic depression, particularly when the life-course approach to classifying chronicity was used. These data suggest that research that combines chronic and non-chronic depressions includes significant heterogeneity that may hinder understanding of etiology and reduce the likelihood of developing a cumulative and replicable literature. In addition, these findings have significant implications for prevention and treatment.",2470902981.0, Journal Article,2020
86,Anxiety and Sleep Problems of College Students During the Outbreak of COVID-19.,"This study aimed to explore the psychological situation and the influence of the outbreak of COVID-19 on college students. An online questionnaire survey was conducted among 3,092 Chinese college students who were quarantined at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey tools included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS). Of all the respondents, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, any of the two, and both of the two, were 16.8, 13.5, 25.1, and 5.3%, respectively. Of the participants, 43.7% of the college students had higher perceived stress. Factors associated with anxiety symptoms included reading the daily news with higher frequency (1-3 times; 4-7 times; more than 7 times), having sleep problems, higher stress, and carelessness with the number of remaining masks. Factors associated with sleep problems included postgraduates, reading the news with higher frequency daily (1-3 times), the frequency of going out per week (1-3 times), having anxiety symptoms and higher stress. Factors associated with higher perceived stress included reading the daily news with higher frequency (4-7 times), anxiety about the number of remaining masks (1-10; more than 20), having anxiety symptoms, and having sleep problems. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, and higher perceived stress among college students was high during the COVID-19 outbreak. Particular attention should be paid to psychological support for college students quarantined at home, especially those at high risk of psychological problems.",2470902980.0, Journal Article,2020
87,"Implementation of a Mindfulness-Based Crisis Intervention for Frontline Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak in a Public General Hospital in Madrid, Spain.","Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak is having an impact on the well-being of healthcare workers. Mindfulness-based interventions have shown effectiveness in reducing stress and fostering resilience and recovery in healthcare workers. There are no studies examining the feasibility of brief mindfulness-based interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: This is an exploratory study with a post intervention assessment. We describe an on-site brief mindfulness intervention and evaluate its helpfulness, safety, and feasibility. Results: One thousand out of 7,000 (14%) healthcare workers from La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (Spain) participated in at least one session. One hundred and fifty out of 1,000 (15%) participants filled out a self-report questionnaire evaluating the helpfulness of the intervention for on-site stress reduction. Ninety two subjects (61%) participated in more than one session. Most of the participants were women (80%) with a mean age of 38.6 years. Almost half of the sample were nurses (46%). Sessions were perceived as being helpful with a mean rating of 8.4 on a scale from 0 to 10. Only 3 people (2%) reported a minor adverse effect (increased anxiety or dizziness). Discussion: Our data supports the utility, safety and feasibility of an on-site, brief mindfulness-based intervention designed to reduce stress for frontline health workers during a crisis. There is a need to continue testing this type of interventions, and to integrate emotion regulation strategies as an essential part of health workers' general training.

88,Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective.,"Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",2470902881.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
89,"COVID-19 Concerns Among Old Age Psychiatric In- and Out-Patients and the Employees Caring for Them, a Preliminary Study.","A questionnaire was administered to 14 patients admitted at the Department of Old Age Psychiatric 24-h unit at Oslo University Hospital with questions about experiences and fears regarding COVID-19. A similar adjusted questionnaire was administered to 19 outpatients. The purpose was to investigate if the patients had fears, anxieties, and quality of life issues related to COVID-19 that could affect their treatment. A quest back questionnaire with similar questions about patient care and work conditions was sent to the personnel working with these patients, and 46 of 81 responded. Most patients welcomed the strict measures that were applied, including a visitation ban for inpatients and a reduction in consultations for the outpatients. Most patients reported that they were not very scared of getting COVID-19, nor did many believe that they would die if they were infected. A minority of patients reported being very worried. The patients also differed on other issues related to the COVID-19 situation. A minority were negative to the interventions, rules, and regulations, and/or considered the risk of infection to be elevated at the clinic, and/or that the quality of their daily life was negatively impacted. Employees more often than patients were concerned about the COVID-19 influence on their health. They were also concerned about being at work amid the crisis. About half of their comments were related to the fear of inadvertently infecting patients with COVID-19. Also, a majority complained about aspects related to the implemented COVID-19 guidelines. This study is explorative in nature, mainly due to its small sample size, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions from the results. However, the results imply a need for addressing the COVID-19 concerns of both patients and employees, to prevent potential negative effects on treatment and overall life quality. Future research should investigate the self-reported effects of the pandemic situation on a larger sample size of elderly psychiatric patients.",2470902826.0, Journal Article,2020
90,"Workplace Stress, Presenteeism, Absenteeism, and Resilience Amongst University Staff and Students in the COVID-19 Lockdown.","Background: This study explored how the COVID-19 outbreak and arrangements such as remote working and furlough affect work or study stress levels and functioning in staff and students at the University of York, UK. Methods: An invitation to participate in an online survey was sent to all University of York staff and students in May-June 2020. We measured stress levels [VAS-scale, Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ)], mental health [anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9)], physical health (PHQ-15, chronic medical conditions checklist), presenteeism, and absenteeism levels (iPCQ). We explored demographic and other characteristics as factors which may contribute to resilience and vulnerability for the impact of COVID-19 on stress. Results: One thousand and fifty five staff and nine hundred and twenty five students completed the survey. Ninety-eight per cent of staff and seventy-eight per cent of students worked or studied remotely. 7% of staff and 10% of students reported sickness absence. 26% of staff and 40% of the students experienced presenteeism. 22-24% of staff reported clinical-level anxiety and depression scores, and 37.2 and 46.5% of students. Staff experienced high stress levels due to COVID-19 (66.2%, labeled vulnerable) and 33.8% experienced low stress levels (labeled resilient). Students were 71.7% resilient vs. 28.3% non-resilient. Predictors of vulnerability in staff were having children [OR = 2.23; CI (95) = 1.63-3.04] and social isolation [OR = 1.97; CI (95) = 1.39-2.79] and in students, being female [OR = 1.62; CI (95) = 1.14-2.28], having children [OR = 2.04; CI (95) = 1.11-3.72], and social isolation [OR = 1.78; CI (95) = 1.25-2.52]. Resilience was predicted by exercise in staff [OR = 0.83; CI (95) = 0.73-0.94] and in students [OR = 0.85; CI (95) = 0.75-0.97]. Discussion: University staff and students reported high psychological distress, presenteeism and absenteeism. However, 33.8% of staff and 71.7% of the students were resilient. Amongst others, female gender, having children, and having to self-isolate contributed to vulnerability. Exercise contributed to resilience. Conclusion: Resilience occurred much more often in students than in staff, although psychological distress was much higher in students. This suggests that predictors of resilience may differ from psychological distress per se. Hence, interventions to improve resilience should not only address psychological distress but may also address other factors.",2470902265.0, Journal Article,2020
91,The Differential Role of Cytokines on Stress Responses in a Menopause Rat Model.,"Menopause is a risk factor of anxiety and depression. Also, psychoneurological symptoms are shown in almost all women in the perimenopausal period. The present study investigated if repeated stress modulates behavioral changes or the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Albino SD female rats were randomly divided into four groups: the naïve normal group (NOR), a surgically ovariectomized group (OVX), the only stressed group (ST), and the OVX and stressed groups (OVX + ST). We performed a battery of tests such as the forced swimming test (FST), the sucrose intake, and social exploration. In the same animals, corticosterone (CORT) was assessed in the serum, and also, two representative cytokines (IL-1β and IL-4) were examined in different brain regions after all the behavior sessions for all the experimental groups. The OVX + ST group showed more immobility time in FST than the OVX group or the ST group. Also, the OVX + ST group tended to have a decreased active social exploration and sucrose solution intake compared to the OVX group or ST group. The serum concentration of CORT of the OVX + ST group was higher than the OVX group or ST group and also the level of CORT in OVX + ST was markedly increased compared to the NOR group. In the brain, the number of IL-1β immunoreactive neurons of the OVX + ST group was increased compared to the NOR group. The OVX + ST group tended to have an increase in IL-1β-positive neurons compared to the OVX or ST group. However, the number of IL-4 immunoreactive neurons of the OVX + ST group was markedly decreased compared with the NOR group. Also, the IL-4-positive neurons in the OVX + ST group was significantly decreased when compared to the ST group. These results indicate that ovariectomy and stress combine to increase the depressive-like behaviors and neuroinflammatory responses. Together, these data show neuroinflammation as a potential contributor to depressive-like symptoms during menopausal transition.",2470902243.0, Journal Article,2020
92,A Systematic Review of the Impact of Viral Respiratory Epidemics on Mental Health: An Implication on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"Background: The twenty-first century viral respiratory epidemics have taught us valuable lessons. Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.",2470902221.0, Systematic Review,2020
93,Glutamate Systems in DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders: Their Role and a Review of Glutamate and GABA Psychopharmacology.,"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines are evidence-based pharmacological treatments for Anxiety Disorders targeting serotonin and GABAergic systems, respectively. Although clearly effective, these medications fail to improve anxiety symptoms in a significant proportion of patients. New insights into the glutamate system have directed attention toward drugs that modulate glutamate as potential alternative treatments for anxiety disorders. Here we summarize the current understanding of the potential role of glutamate neurotransmission in anxiety disorders and highlight specific glutamate receptors that are potential targets for novel anxiety disorder treatments. We also review clinical trials of medications targeting the glutamate system in DSM-5 anxiety disorders. Understanding the role of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorder may aid in developing novel pharmacological agents that are effective in treating anxiety disorders.",2470902181.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
94,Adverse Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown in Individuals With Tourette Syndrome in Italy: An Online Survey.,"During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy, an online survey was launched via a local patient advocacy website to investigate mental health issues in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS). Respondents were parents, who were asked to report on their child's general health, tics, comorbidities/problems, pharmacological treatment/psychotherapy, symptom variations, and daily routine, as well as on their family's health and work experiences during the pandemic. Two hundred thirty-eight people participated in the survey, 203 females and 35 males. Our findings indicate that, in the time window of 4-6 weeks after the beginning of the COVID-19-related lockdown, 67% of individuals with TS developed a relevant worsening of the overall clinical condition as rated by their parents. An improvement or no variation of the clinical picture was reported in 20.5 and 6.7% of cases, respectively. Most worsened symptoms included tics, hyperactivity, rage attacks, obsessions/compulsions, and anxiety. Of the subjects experiencing a clinical worsening, the majority (51.76%) showed variations across two to five symptom domains. No association was found between symptom variation and family demographics or health and economic issues specifically related to the lockdown. The current COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a considerable impact on the mental health of young individuals with TS by worsening both tics and emotional and behavioral symptoms.",2470902177.0, Journal Article,2020
95,The Transgenerational Transmission of Trauma: The Effects of Maternal PTSD in Mother-Infant Interactions.,"The objective of the study was to examine the process of mother to infant trauma transmission among traumatized mothers in humanitarian contexts. We investigated the impact of mothers' post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms on the quality of the dyadic interaction by conducting a microanalysis of mother-infant interactions at specific moments when trauma was recalled, compared to more neutral moments. Twenty-four mother-infant dyadic interactions of traumatized mothers and children aged from 1.5 to 30 months Central Africa, Chad, and Cameroon were videotaped during three sequences: a neutral initial session (baseline) exploring mothers' representations of the infant and of their bonding; a second sequence, ""the traumatic narration,"" in which mothers were asked to talk about the difficult events they had experienced; and a third sequence focusing on a neutral subject. Three minutes of each sequence were coded through a specific grid for microanalysis [based on the scales developed at Bobigny Faculty of Medicine and the work of (1)], according to different communication modalities (touch, visual, and vocal), for both the mother and the child. Impact of traumatic event (IES-R), the level of depression and anxiety (HAD) were investigated in order to have a holistic understanding of the trauma transmission mechanism. The data analysis highlighted significant differences in mothers, children and their interaction during the ""traumatic narration"": mothers touched and looked at the infant less, looked more absent and smiled less, and looked less at the interviewer; infants looked less at the interviewer, and sucked the breast more. The mother-child interaction ""infant self-stimulation-mother looks absent"" and ""Infant sucks the breast-mother looks absent"" occurred more often during the mothers' traumatic narrations. The ""absence"" of the mother during trauma recall seems to have repercussions on infants' behavior and interaction; infants show coping strategies that are discussed. We found no significant associations between interaction and infant gender and age, the severity of traumatic experience, mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms, and the country of residence. The results of the microanalysis of interaction can shed light on the fundamental role of intermodal exchanges between mother and infant in trauma transmission during mothers' trauma reactivation.",2470902152.0, Journal Article,2020
96,Regional White Matter Integrity Predicts Treatment Response to Escitalopram and Memantine in Geriatric Depression: A Pilot Study.,"Background: Geriatric depression with subjective memory complaints increases the risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Memantine, a neuroprotective drug, can improve depression and help prevent cognitive decline. In our 6-months clinical trial, escitalopram/memantine (ESC/MEM) improved mood and cognition compared to escitalopram/placebo treatment (ESC/PBO; NCT01902004). In this report, we investigated whether baseline brain white matter integrity in fronto-limbic-striatal tracts can predict clinical outcomes using fractional anisotropy (FA). Methods: Thirty-eight older depressed adults (mean age = 70.6, SD = 7.2) were randomized to ESC/MEM or ESC/PBO and underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla at baseline. Mood was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), apathy using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and anxiety using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) at baseline and 6-months follow-up. FA was extracted from seven tracts of interest (six in each hemisphere and one commissural tract) associated with geriatric depression. Non-parametric General Linear Models were used to examine group differences in the association between FA and symptom improvement, controlling for age, sex, baseline symptom scores and scanner model, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). Post-hoc tests further investigated group differences in axial, mean and radial diffusivity (AD, MD, and RD, respectively). Lastly, we performed an exploratory whole-brain model to test whether FA might be related to treatment response with memantine. Results: There were no differences in remission rates or HAMD change between groups. In bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule tracts and bilateral inferior and right superior fronto-occipital (IFO and SFO) fasciculus, higher FA was associated with larger improvements in depressive symptoms for ESC/MEM, but not ESC/PBO, correcting for FDR. Lower MD in the left IFO and RD in the right anterior internal capsule were associated with improved treatment responses. We found no significant associations in the whole-brain analysis. Limitations: Included small sample size and high dropout. Conclusions: Higher baseline FA and lower RD and MD in hypothesized fronto-limbic-striatal tracts predicted greater improvement in mood and anxiety with ESC/MEM compared to ESC/PBO in geriatric depression. FA as a biomarker for white matter integrity may serve as a predictor of treatment response but requires confirmation in larger future studies.",2470902150.0, Journal Article,2020
97,Comorbidity Between Non-suicidal Self-Injury Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder in Adolescents: A Graphical Network Approach.,"In 2013, DSM-5 urged for further research on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and defined NSSI disorder (NSSI-D) for the first time separate from borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, research on the comorbidity between NSSI-D and BPD symptoms is still scarce, especially in adolescent populations. The current study selected 347 adolescents who engaged at least once in NSSI (78.4% girls, M age = 15.05) and investigated prevalence, comorbidity, gender differences, and bridge symptoms of NSSI-D and BPD. Network analysis allowed us to visualize the comorbidity structure of NSSI-D and BPD on a symptom-level and revealed which bridge symptoms connected both disorders. Our results supported NSSI-D as significantly distinct from, yet closely related to, BPD in adolescents. Even though girls were more likely to meet the NSSI-D criteria, our findings suggested that the manner in which NSSI-D and BPD symptoms were interconnected, did not differ between girls and boys. Furthermore, loneliness, impulsivity, separation anxiety, frequent thinking about NSSI, and negative affect prior to NSSI were detected as prominent bridge symptoms between NSSI-D and BPD. These bridge symptoms could provide useful targets for early intervention in and prevention of the development of comorbidity between NSSI-D and BPD. Although the current study was limited by a small male sample, these findings do provide novel insights in the complex comorbidity between NSSI-D and BPD symptoms in adolescence.",2470902142.0, Journal Article,2020
98,Beneficial Effects of Exercise on Depression and Anxiety During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review.,"First reported in Dec 2019, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the physical and social activities of the population, which contributed to the increased prevalence of mental disorder. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality. This review summarizes the mental health consequences of COVID-19, especially for depression and anxiety. Exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression has been demonstrated in both of the animal studies and human clinical trials. The underlying mechanism including the regulation on the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), D-β-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic transmission, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, tryptophan hydroxylase, GSK3β/β-catenin pathway, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and PGC-1α1-PPAR axis. In addition, we summarized the exercise strategies to fight against anxiety and depression according to the information from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), World Health Organization and recent literatures about physical exercise during COVID-19.",2470902130.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
99,Chemsex and Mental Health of Men Who Have Sex With Men in Germany.,"Background: Chemsex is defined as using certain substances immediately before or during sexual activities to facilitate, prolong and/or intensify sexual experience, mainly by some communities of men who have sex with men (MSM). Four substances are typically associated with chemsex: methamphetamine, mephedrone, GHB/GBL, and ketamine. While there is a lot of evidence for increased prevalence of HIV, sexually transmitted infections and other sexual health measures among MSM, who engage in chemsex, there has been little research on mental health aspects. This study aims to describe aspects of mental health among a sample of German men who have sex with men (MSM) who engage in chemsex and to describe potentially adverse consequences of chemsex behavior. Method: This paper refers to a subset of participants from the German Chemsex Survey, an MSM-community recruited, self-completed online survey with a self-selected convenience sample. The survey comprised 420 different items considering recreational substance use, substance use in sexual settings, mental health, sexual transmitted infections, adverse consequences of chemsex behavior, and experiences of non-consensual sex acts. A group of participants who used methamphetamine, mephedrone, GHB/GBL, and/or ketamine in a sexual setting in the last 12 months (n = 280, chemsex group) was analyzed regarding symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), general anxiety disorder (GAD-7), somatization (PHQ-15), and PTSD (Primary Care PTSD Screen). Group comparisons were conducted between the chemsex group and men who did not use substances in a sexual context (n = 177, non-chemsex group). Mean scores of mental health measures were compared, as well as scores above a cut-off that indicates clinically relevant symptoms. Logistical regression was utilized to determine whether mental health measures can predict adverse consequences of engagement in chemsex behaviors. Results: A total of 1,583 men started the survey; 1,050 participants provided information on substance use. Twenty-seven percent of participants (n = 280) reported that they used methamphetamine, mephedrone, GHB/GBL and/or ketamine in a sexual setting in the last 12 months. The chemsex group showed significantly higher mean scores for depression, anxiety, and somatization than the non-chemsex group, but effect sizes were low. Even though mean scores were heightened, they were still far below the cut-off for clinically relevant symptoms. The chemsex group reported significantly higher incidences of non-consensual sex acts compared with the non-chemsex group. Some men in the chemsex-group experienced potentially adverse consequences, such as loss of control regarding time and money spent for chemsex activities or amount of substances used at one occasion (49.6%), negative impacts on social functioning (33.6%), psychotic symptoms (13.2%), and physically aggressive behavior toward others (2.9%). Clinically relevant symptoms did not predict a higher likelihood for adverse consequences. Discussion: Mean scores for depression, anxiety, and somatization were significantly higher in the chemsex-group, but effect sizes were low. Both groups reported poorer mental health compared to men in the German general population. Mental health measures did not contribute to predict potentially adverse consequences of chemsex behavior.",2470902124.0, Journal Article,2020
100,An Integrated Approach to Improve Maternal Mental Health and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Crisis.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption of normal life across the globe, severely affecting the already vulnerable populations such as the pregnant women. Maternal mental health and well-being is a public health priority and the evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health status of pregnant women is gradually emerging. The findings of the recently published studies suggest that increased risk perception about contracting COVID-19, reduced social support, increase in domestic violence, disruption of antenatal care, and economic consequences of COVID-19 mitigation strategies can lead to adverse mental health outcomes in antenatal period. There is a significant increase in antenatal depression and anxiety since the onset of COVID-19 and social determinants of health (e.g., younger age, lower education, lower income) are associated with these poor outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to improve the mental health and well-being of pregnant women. Physical activity and/or mind-body interventions like yoga can be practiced as self-care interventions by pregnant women. Despite social distancing being the current norm, efforts should be made to strengthen social support. Evidence-based interventions for perinatal depression should be integrated within the health system and stepped, collaborative care using non-specialist health workers as key human resource be utilized to improve access to mental health services. Use of digital platforms and smartphone enabled delivery of services has huge potential to further improve the access to care. Most importantly, the COVID-19 related policy guidelines should categorically include maternal mental health and well-being as a priority area.",2470900655.0, Journal Article,2020
101,Comparison of Psychosocial Distress in Areas With Different COVID-19 Prevalence in Korea.,"Objectives: This study aimed to compare psychosocial distress in areas in Korea with different prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after validating a questionnaire on psychological experiences and stress associated with the disease outbreak. Methods: Using an online-based survey, psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19 was investigated in three regions, which were selected according to their prevalence of COVID-19. A total of 1,500 people from an online public panel in the three regions participated in the study. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information, psychosocial experience and stress related to COVID-19, and the perceived stress scale (PSS), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7). Those questionnaires and scales were compared by level of prevalence of COVID-19 after validating the questionnaire on psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19. Results: The 19 items on psychosocial experience associated with COVID-19 comprised 5 subscales, with favorable Cronbach's α ranging from 0.69 to 0.88. Six stress items related to COVID-19 had a Cronbach's α of 0.79. Disturbance in eating and sleeping, difficulty with outside activities, stress from COVID-19, and PSS scores were greater in the areas where COVID-19 was highly prevalent. Economic problems, daily activity changes, and anger toward society were higher in the higher-prevalence regions. Discussion: Psychosocial distress associated with COVID-19 was closely related to the prevalence of the disease in the areas where participants lived. Psychosocial interventions for distress associated with COVID-19 should be developed and prepared for people during this lengthy pandemic.",2470899210.0, Journal Article,2020
102,Insomnia in Chinese College Students With Internet Addiction: Prevalence and Associated Clinical Correlates.,"Background: Internet addiction (IA) has gained more and more attention for its negative impact on the subjects' study and daily life. However, in a large sample, there is little research on the association between IA and insomnia in Chinese college students. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and its related risk factors among Chinese college students with IA. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate 627 Chinese college students with IA. Each student completed a survey on demographic data, Internet addiction (Revised Chinese Internet Addiction Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and suicidal behavior. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to adjust for confounding factors. Results: The prevalence of insomnia among students with IA was 54.86%. Compared with IA students without insomnia, IA students with insomnia were more likely to be younger, smoking, drinking, have anxiety, depression, suicidal ideations, suicide plans, and suicide attempts (all p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, drinking [OR, 1.664; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.139-2.431; p = 0.008], anxiety (OR, 2.321; 95% CI, 1.116-4.826; p = 0.024), and suicidal ideation (OR, 1.942; 95% CI:1.295-2.911; p = 0.001) were independently associated with insomnia in IA students. Conclusions: Insomnia is very common in Chinese IA students. Drinking, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are independently correlated with insomnia. This study provides valuable evidence for school counselors and clinical professionals to assess Internet addiction, insomnia, and suicide risk.",2470898732.0, Journal Article,2020
103,Young Patients With Persistent and Complex Care Needs Require an Integrated Care Approach: Baseline Findings From the Multicenter Youth Flexible ACT Study.,"Background: The Multicenter Youth Flexible ACT Study is an ongoing observational prospective cohort study that examines the effects of Youth Flexible ACT (Assertive Community Treatment) on young people with complex care needs who are difficult to engage in traditional (office-based) mental health services. However, a clear and detailed description of this patient group is lacking. In the current paper, we present baseline characteristics and psychosocial outcomes of the Youth Flexible ACT target group and explore the existence of underlying specific patient subgroups. Methods: Sixteen Youth Flexible ACT teams from seven mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands participated in the study. Research participants were monitored for 18 months and administered questionnaires measuring psychiatric- and social functioning every 6 months, yielding four measurements. Baseline data were obtained from 199 adolescents, their mental health workers, and parents/carers. Latent Class Analysis based on HoNOSCA scores (measuring psychosocial and daily functioning) was conducted to identify underlying subgroups. Results: The target group of Youth Flexible ACT mainly consisted of patients older than 15 years of age with a history of (specialized) mental healthcare. They face many complex problems, including trauma; developmental, mood, and anxiety disorders; and problems with school attendance, family life, and peer relationships. Other frequently reported difficulties were substance misuse, the involvement of the legal system or police, problems with intellectual functioning, and personal finance. Patients were classified into four distinct classes: the ""internalizing,"" ""externalizing,"" ""non-specific,"" and the ""overly impulsive"" subgroup. Each subgroup had its unique pattern of difficulties and focus, respectively, high levels of depression and anxiety, disruptive behavior, unspecific difficulties, and substance misuse. Conclusions: As expected, patients in Youth Flexible ACT experienced many severe problems, rendering them vulnerable to fragmented and, thus, ineffective care. Our findings underscore the need for an integrated care approach with a multidisciplinary team of skilled professionals that can bridge these wide-ranging psychosocial problems, as each class of participants experienced a different set of difficulties. Youth Flexible ACT teams need to adjust their care services accordingly.",2470628406.0, Journal Article,2020
104,Alcohol Consumption in China Before and During COVID-19: Preliminary Results From an Online Retrospective Survey.,"Background: Alcohol is an important aspect of Chinese culture, and alcohol use has been traditionally accepted in China. People with stress, anxiety, and depression may use more alcohol. More people reported symptoms of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, people may drink more alcohol during the outbreak of COVID-19 than before COVID-19. Methods: An online retrospective survey was conducted on a total sample of 2,229 participants. Drinking behaviors before and during COVID-19, current risky drinking and hazardous drinking, and the association between high-risk drinking and mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and stress) were assessed via self-reported measures on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Results: This study found that, compared with before COVID-19, alcohol consumption was slightly decreased during COVID-19 (from 3.5 drinks to 3.4 drinks, p = 0.035) in the overall sample. Most (78.7%) alcohol drinkers were males. Before and during COVID-19, males consumed more drinks per week (4.2 and 4.0 vs. 1.3 and 1.2 drinks), had a higher percentage of heavy drinking (8.1 and 7.7% vs. 4.4 and 2.7%), and more drinking days per week (2.1 and 2.1 vs. 1.0 and 0.9 days). Males also had more risky drinking (43.2 vs. 9.3%) and hazardous drinking (70.2 vs. 46.6%) than female counterparts. This study also found that high-risk drinking predicted anxiety in females. Conclusions: This study suggests a slight reduction in alcohol consumption during COVID-19. However, hazardous drinking is common, especially among male alcohol drinkers. Males consumed more alcohol, had more risky and hazardous drinking than female counterparts both before and during COVID-19. Public health policy makers should pay more attention to developing effective, population-based strategies to prevent harmful alcohol consumption.",2470626537.0, Journal Article,2020
105,"Anxiety, Reinforcement Sensitivity and Social Context in Accepting the Experience of Pain Among Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.","Background: Acceptance has become one of the most widely studied processes regarding chronic pain because of its ability to influence participants' adaptation and coping responses. Leading researchers have found relationships between variables such as anxiety, reinforcement sensitivity, and the responses of the participants' environment to their behavior and acceptance. In contrast, few studies have been found that investigate the variables that predict the acceptance of pain. This study has set out to explore the relationships between pain-related anxiety, sensitivity to contingencies, and the punishment responses of significant people toward pain behaviors regarding pain acceptance. Methods: With a view to fulfilling this purpose, a cohort of 62 participants with rheumatoid arthritis was chosen, and the subjects were assessed through the following self-report measures: Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, CPAQ; Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, PASS-20; The Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, SPSRQ, and The West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory, WHYMPI. The study's initial objectives were achieved by means of a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The linear regression analyses revealed a negative and significant correlation between anxiety, reinforcement sensitivity, and the significant persons' responses to pain behaviors and pain acceptance. Conclusion: The results suggest that the identification of these variables might be important for addressing these participants' pain. Finally, the discussion focuses on our findings' implications as regards their use in clinical practice.",2470626525.0, Journal Article,2020
106,The Medium-Term Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Referrals to Secondary Care Mental Health Services: A Controlled Interrupted Time Series Study.,"To date, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of COVID-19 or lockdown on mental disorders. We aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of lockdown on referrals to secondary care mental health clinical services. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study using data from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment population ~0.86 million). The UK lockdown resulted in an instantaneous drop in mental health referrals but then a longer-term acceleration in the referral rate (by 1.21 referrals per day per day, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-2.02). This acceleration was primarily for urgent or emergency referrals (acceleration 0.96, CI 0.39-1.54), including referrals to liaison psychiatry (0.68, CI 0.35-1.02) and mental health crisis teams (0.61, CI 0.20-1.02). The acceleration was significant for females (0.56, CI 0.04-1.08), males (0.64, CI 0.05-1.22), working-age adults (0.93, CI 0.42-1.43), people of White ethnicity (0.98, CI 0.32-1.65), those living alone (1.26, CI 0.52-2.00), and those who had pre-existing depression (0.78, CI 0.19-1.38), severe mental illness (0.67, CI 0.19-1.15), hypertension/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease (0.56, CI 0.24-0.89), personality disorders (0.32, CI 0.12-0.51), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.28, CI 0.08-0.49), dyslipidemia (0.26, CI 0.04-0.47), anxiety (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), substance misuse (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), or reactions to severe stress (0.17, CI 0.01-0.32). No significant post-lockdown acceleration was observed for children/adolescents, older adults, people of ethnic minorities, married/cohabiting people, and those who had previous/pre-existing dementia, diabetes, cancer, eating disorder, a history of self-harm, or intellectual disability. This evidence may help service planning and policy-making, including preparation for any future lockdown in response to outbreaks.",2470626474.0, Journal Article,2020
107,Discriminating Suicide Attempters and Predicting Suicide Risk Using Altered Frontolimbic Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Patients With Bipolar II Disorder.,"Bipolar II disorder (BD-II) major depression episode is highly associated with suicidality, and objective neural biomarkers could be key elements to assist in early prevention and intervention. This study aimed to integrate altered brain functionality in the frontolimbic system and machine learning techniques to classify suicidal BD-II patients and predict suicidality risk at the individual level. A cohort of 169 participants were enrolled, including 43 BD-II depression patients with at least one suicide attempt during a current depressive episode (SA), 62 BD-II depression patients without a history of attempted suicide (NSA), and 64 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). We compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the frontolimbic system among the three groups and explored the correlation between abnormal rsFCs and the level of suicide risk (assessed using the Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk, NGASR) in SA patients. Then, we applied support vector machines (SVMs) to classify SA vs. NSA in BD-II patients and predicted the risk of suicidality. SA patients showed significantly decreased frontolimbic rsFCs compared to NSA patients. The left amygdala-right middle frontal gyrus (orbital part) rsFC was negatively correlated with NGASR in the SA group, but not the severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms. Using frontolimbic rsFCs as features, the SVMs obtained an overall 84% classification accuracy in distinguishing SA and NSA. A significant correlation was observed between the SVMs-predicted NGASR and clinical assessed NGASR (r = 0.51, p = 0.001). Our results demonstrated that decreased rsFCs in the frontolimbic system might be critical objective features of suicidality in BD-II patients, and could be useful for objective prediction of suicidality risk in individuals.",2470624151.0, Journal Article,2020
108,Mental Health Status of Psychogeriatric Patients During the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Effects on Caregiver Burden.,"Introduction: There is a growing awareness about the noxious effects of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of the elderly. However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in São Paulo, Brazil. Method: Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. Results: We included 100 consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (p &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (p = 0.002) and HADS-D (p = 0.001) predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (p &lt; 0.00001, R 2 0.46); taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction values for either DS (p &lt; 0.00001, R 2 0.95) or elderly adults (p &lt; 0.00001, R 2 0.88). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with significant impact on caregiver distress. Apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorders, and psychoses were the main psychopathological domains, which had determined caregiver burden worsening.",2470028956.0, Journal Article,2020
109,"Physical Inactivity Is Associated With Increased Levels of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in Brazilians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Objective: To evaluate the levels of anxiety, depression, and stress associated with the practice of physical exercise (PE) during pandemic by COVID-19. Methods: This study has a cross-sectional characteristic and was carried out between May 12 and 14, 2020. An online questionnaire was applied with questions to assess sociodemographic characteristics and physical exercise during the CoVID-19 pandemic, in addition to depression, anxiety, and stress analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (CAAE: 31521720.8.0000.5082). Results: One thousand one hundred and fifty four answered the questionnaire (69.84% female). During the isolation period, the number of participants who declared not to exercise was 54.16%. Women generaly presented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress when compared to men (p &lt; 0.0001 for all domains). The risk of having increased anxiety were 118% higher (OR = 2.183; 95% CI = 1.717-2.775), the risk of depression was 152% higher (OR = 2.525; 95% CI = 1.991-3.205), and the risk of stress symptoms increased 75.1% (OR = 1.751; 95% CI = 1.386-2.213) in the participants who did not perform PE when compared to those who maintain regular PE. Conclusion: People who was not involved with PE during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher anxiety, depression, and stress scores. Based on this, it seems important to advise people to continue PE, following all the recommendations of preventive measures of the pertinent health organizations.",2470028903.0, Journal Article,2020
110,Psychological Effects of Social Isolation Due to Quarantine in Chile: An Exploratory Study.,"As we all know, COVID-19 has impacted the entire world. Quarantine disrupts people's lives, with high levels of stress and negative psychological impacts. Studies carried out mostly in the Far East, Europe, or the United States have started to provide evidence on survivors, frontline healthcare workers, and parents. The present study is the first survey to be carried out in Latin America (in Santiago, the capital of Chile). It aims to (a) explore the perceived psychological impact and future concerns; (b) evaluate vulnerability factors; (c) describe the perceived psychological impacts on participants whose psychological help and actual online psychotherapy was interrupted; and (d) explore the future need for psychological help. Procedure: An online survey was carried out (the first 2 weeks of lockdown in Santiago), which included sociodemographic data, perceived psychological impact, future concerns, and questions about psychological support. Participants: A total of 3,919 subjects answered, mostly women (80%). Results: The main perceived psychological impacts were concern (67%) and anxiety (60%). Future concerns were: general health (55.3%), employment (53.1%), and finances (49.8%). Younger participants had a greater perceived psychological impact (p's &lt; 0.01) and concerns about employment, finances, mental health, stigma, and general health (p's &lt; 0.001). Women reported more perceived psychological impact than men (p's &lt; 0.05). Men reported mainly boredom (χ2 = 11.82, gl = 1, p &lt; 0.001). Dependent employees experienced more boredom, anxiety, distress, sleep problems, an inability to relax, and a lack of concentration than the self-employed (p's &lt; 0.05). While the latter reported future concerns about employment and finances (p's &lt; 0.001), dependent employees reported them on their general and mental health (p's &lt; 0.001). Regarding psychological support, 22% of participants were receiving it before lockdown. They showed more perceived psychological impact than those who were not (p's &lt; 0.01), and 7% of them had online psychotherapy, reporting excellent (32.1%) or odd but working (65.2%) results. Finally, of the total sample, almost half of the participants (43.8%) felt they would need emotional support after this pandemic, and these are the ones that also showed higher perceived psychological impact (p's &lt; 0.001). This study confirms the presence of perceived negative emotional impact and concerns about the future. Also, there are vulnerable groups, such as women, younger people, the self-employed, and people with psychological processes that were interrupted.",2470028888.0, Journal Article,2020
111,Insomnia Symptoms in Patients With Substance Use Disorders During Detoxification and Associated Clinical Features.,"Background: Insomnia is highly prevalent in patients with substance use disorders (SUD), and it has been related to a worse course of addiction. Insomnia during detoxification in a hospital has not been adequately studied. This study aims to compare sociodemographic, clinical, and psychopathological characteristics of SUD patients undergoing a detoxification program, by comorbidity and insomnia symptoms. Methodology: We recruited 481 patients who received pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment for detoxification. They were evaluated through semi-structured interviews, standardized questionnaires, and a specific sleep log. A bivariate and multivariate analysis of the data was performed. Results: Insomnia was reported by 66.5% patients, with sleep-maintenance insomnia the most frequent issue, followed by early morning awakening and sleep-onset insomnia. Patients with alcohol use disorder and cannabis use disorder had higher prevalence of sleep-onset insomnia. Patients with cocaine and heroin use disorder had higher prevalence of sleep-maintenance insomnia. Independent factors that allowed the identification of insomnia symptoms included being female (OR: 3.43), polysubstance use (OR: 2.85), comorbid anxiety disorder (OR: 2.02), and prior admission for detoxification (OR: 1.22). Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms are very prevalent in patients admitted for detoxification. The diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for the insomnia symptoms should be improved, especially in women and in patients with greater addiction severity and with anxiety disorders.",2470028881.0, Journal Article,2020
112,Brief Research Report on Adolescent Mental Well-Being and School Closures During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia.,"The COVID-19 pandemic does not affected only physical but also mental health and socioeconomic part. The social distancing, social quarantine, school from home, and work from becomes a new normal these days. Being adolescence, the above conditions may be challenging due to their developmental milestones. Therefore, this brief report aimed to preliminary identify proportion of adolescents' emotional and behavior problems and several factors related to it during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The findings might raise some understanding of youth mental well-being and programs that can be applied in schools and community in general to overcome the issues. The study was designed as cross sectional and used online survey that started on April 2020. During April 15-May 10, 2020, there were 113 adolescents participated on this survey. Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) 11-17 years old was used to assess adolescent emotional and behavior problems; and specific life experience questionnaire was designed to collect other independents variables (Cronbach's α = 0.75). All participants fulfilled the online informed consent before they started to complete the questionnaire. All data was analyzed by using SPSS version 20 for Mac. The average age of research subjects were 14.07 (2.18) years old; 98.2% was school from home. There was 14.2% of the total research subject at risk on total difficulties problems; 38.1% of adolescent was at risk on peer-relationship problems, 28.3% at risk on pro-social behavior problems, 15% at risk on conduct behavior and 10.6% at risk on emotional problems. The number of adolescent that perceived worse to significantly worse self-mental well-being prior COVID-19 increased during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia (p &lt; 0.05). There was significantly association between having mental health information and conduct behavior (OR = 10.34, 95%CI = 1.27-78.86); Subjective anxiety due to COVID-19 pandemic and pro-social behavior problems (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.00-5.63), parental support and total difficulties (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.14-0.60) and pro-social behavior problems (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01-0.82); friends support during COVID-19 pandemic and conduct behavior (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.04-1.00) and pro-social behavior problems (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.02-0.75). To be concluded, during phase 1 and 2 COVID-19 pandemic and school closures in Indonesia, adolescents were at risk for having emotional and behavior problems. Therefore, maintain clear mental health information, keep them on connection with school by designing an optimal tele-education, tele-consultation, and virtual activity programs to accommodate adolescents' biopsychosocial needs in the near future.",2470028200.0, Journal Article,2020
113,Recent/Childhood Adversities and Mental Disorders Among US Immigrants.,"Past research documents the heterogeneity in US immigrants, particularly in terms of racial and ethnic categories and specific ethnic subgroups. The present study builds on this research foundation by investigating heterogeneity in immigrants' experiences of adversity, both recent and during childhood, and associations with mental disorders. Data are drawn from 6,131 adult immigrants in the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III. Prevalence estimates for mental disorders and adversities were calculated overall and by gender. Latent class analysis was utilized to characterize patterns of self-reported experiences of childhood and recent adversities, and multinomial logistic regression established the statistical association between latent class membership and past-year mental disorder outcomes (substance use disorder only, mood/anxiety/trauma disorder only, co-occurring disorder, or no mental disorder). Neglect was the most commonly-reported childhood adversity among immigrant men and women. Prevalence of meeting criteria for a substance use disorder only, or a mood/anxiety/trauma disorder only, varied between men and women, yet no gender differences were observed in prevalence of co-occurring disorders. For latent class analyses, a five-class solution was selected based on fit indices and parsimony. Approximately 10.0% of the sample was categorized in the latent class characterized by severe childhood adversities, while 57.5% was classified in the latent class with low probabilities of reported adversities. The relative risk of meeting criteria for a past-year substance use disorder only (compared to no substance use or mood/anxiety/trauma disorder) was more than three times as high for members of the class with severe childhood adversities (RRR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.08-5.10), as well as the class with recent employment/financial adversities (RRR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.36-6.19), compared to the class with low adversities. The relative risk of past-year co-occurring disorders (compared to no disorder) was more than 12 times as high for those in the severe childhood adversities class (RRR, 12.21; 95% CI, 7.06-21.10), compared to the class with low adversities. Findings underscore the importance of considering both recent and childhood adversities when assessing and providing services for US immigrant groups.",2470028073.0, Journal Article,2020
114,"""Waking Up Every Day With the Worry"": A Mixed-Methods Study of Anxiety in Undocumented Latinx College Students.","To date, little research has taken a mixed-methods strategy to consider the ways in which living ""in the shadows"" without recognized legal status may affect mental health. In this study, we took this approach, to examine how legal status, as well as stressors (deportation worries, financial concerns) and potentially protective factors (faculty support, peer support), affect anxiety levels of undocumented Latinx undergraduates from colleges across California. We surveyed 486 participants including both standardized measures as well as open-ended responses. We found that rates of self-reported anxiety between undocumented females were 4 times that of the norm population and that of male undocumented students were 7 times higher as measured by the GAD-7 in the moderate and severe ranges. Our predictive models suggested that participants' rates of anxiety were in large part related to worries about financing their education and their daily living expenses as well as detainment and deportation; having an institutional agent such as a professor whom they can turn to for support served to buffer the effects of anxiety. Qualitative findings triangulated the quantitative findings and provided further insights into the experience of living with the stresses of social exclusion and liminal status.",2467845064.0, Journal Article,2020
115,"A Polish and German Population Study of Quality of Life, Well-Being, and Life Satisfaction in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Introduction: Psychological studies undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic rarely include people in their 60s or older. In our study, we studied the predictors of quality of life, well-being, and life satisfaction (including risky behavior, trait anxiety, feeling of threat, sleep quality, and optimism) during the pandemic in older people from Germany and Poland and compared them to three different age groups. Methods: A total of 494 adults in four groups-60+ (N = 60), 50-60 (N = 139), 36-49 (N = 155), &lt;35 (N = 140)-completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing: socio-demographic data, quality of life, trait anxiety, risk tolerance, Coronavirus threat, optimism regarding the pandemic, difficulty relaxing, life satisfaction, well-being, and sleep quality during the pandemic period. Results: Older people rated their quality of life higher than did young (mean difference=0.74, SE=0.19, p &lt; 0.01) and middle-aged (mean difference=0.79, SE=0.18, p &lt; 0.01) participants, rated their life satisfaction higher than young (mean difference=1.23, SE = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01) and middle-aged (mean difference=0.92, SE = 0.30, p &lt; 0.05) participants, and rated their well-being higher than young (mean difference=1.40, SE = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01) and middle-aged (mean difference=0.91, SE = 0.31, p &lt; 0.05) participants. They also experienced lower levels of trait anxiety and Coronavirus threat (mean difference=-9.19, SE = 1.90, p &lt; 0.01) than the younger age groups. They experienced greater risk tolerance (mean difference=1.38, SE=0.33, p &lt; 0.01), sleep quality (F =1 .25; eta 2 = 0.01), and optimism (F = 1.96; eta 2 = 0.01), and had less difficulty relaxing during the pandemic (F = 3.75; eta 2 = 0.02) than middle-aged respondents. Conclusions: Quality of life, life satisfaction, and well-being during the pandemic is affected by age, trait anxiety, and Coronavirus threat. Older people rated their quality of life, life satisfaction, and well-being during pandemic higher than young people, and experienced lower levels of trait anxiety and Coronavirus threat than the younger age groups. They experienced greater risk tolerance, sleep quality, and optimism, and had less difficulty relaxing than middle-aged respondents.",2467845009.0, Journal Article,2020
116,Managing Children's Anxiety During COVID-19 Pandemic: Strategies for Providers and Caregivers.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic by virtue of its sudden, unprecedented and widespread nature, has led to a multitude of psychological effects on individuals across societies. This includes anxiety which has important implications on the daily functioning, physical and mental health of individuals. Children are a vulnerable group of the population who can experience anxiety which potentially can lead to long-lasting implications on their health for years to come. It is thus important that their caregivers, including parents and healthcare professionals be aware of strategies that can help with anxiety in children. This article discusses anxiety in children in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines strategies that may be helpful.",2467844889.0, Journal Article,2020
117,The Impact of Coping Strategies and Perceived Family Support on Depressive and Anxious Symptomatology During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) Lockdown.,"The coronavirus pandemic represents a severe global crisis, affecting physical, and psychological health. Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; SD = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.85; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.34; p = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (r = -0.43; p = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.72; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.35; p = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (R 2 = 0.78; adjusted R 2 = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (β = 0.83; p = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (β = -0.24; p = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (R 2 = 0.52; adjusted R 2 = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (β = 0.71; p = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.",2467844873.0, Journal Article,2020
118,Adolescent Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Exposure Selectively Impairs Working Memory but Not Several Other mPFC-Mediated Behaviors.,"As the frequency of cannabis use by 14-16-year-olds increases, it becomes increasingly important to understand the effect of cannabis on the developing central nervous system. Using mice as a model system, we treated adolescent (28 day old) C57BL6/J mice of both sexes for 3 weeks with 3 mg/kg tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Starting a week after the last treatment, several cognitive behaviors were analyzed. Mice treated with THC as adolescents acquired proficiency in a working memory task more slowly than vehicle-treated mice. Working memory recall in both sexes of THC-treated mice was also deficient during increasing cognitive load compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our adolescent THC treatment did not strongly affect social preference, anxiety behaviors, or decision-making behaviors on the elevated T maze task. In summary, under the conditions of this study, adolescent THC treatment of mice markedly affected the establishment, and persistence of working memory, while having little effect on decision-making, social preference or anxiety behaviors. This study provides further support that adolescent THC affects specific behavioral domains.",2466296525.0, Journal Article,2020
119,Animal Models for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are characterized by chronic abdominal symptoms in the absence of an organic, metabolic or systemic cause that readily explains these complaints. Their pathophysiology is still not fully elucidated and animal models have been of great value to improve the understanding of the complex biological mechanisms. Over the last decades, many animal models have been developed to further unravel FGID pathophysiology and test drug efficacy. In the first part of this review, we focus on stress-related models, starting with the different perinatal stress models, including the stress of the dam, followed by a discussion on neonatal stress such as the maternal separation model. We also describe the most commonly used stress models in adult animals which brought valuable insights on the brain-gut axis in stress-related disorders. In the second part, we focus more on models studying peripheral, i.e., gastrointestinal, mechanisms, either induced by an infection or another inflammatory trigger. In this section, we also introduce more recent models developed around food-related metabolic disorders or food hypersensitivity and allergy. Finally, we introduce models mimicking FGID as a secondary effect of medical interventions and spontaneous models sharing characteristics of GI and anxiety-related disorders. The latter are powerful models for brain-gut axis dysfunction and bring new insights about FGID and their comorbidities such as anxiety and depression.",2466296116.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
120,"A New Hypothesis on Anxiety, Sleep Insufficiency, and Viral Infections; Reciprocal Links to Consider in Today's ""World vs. COVID-19"" Endeavors.","In today's ever-growing concerns about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many experience sleep insufficiencies, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, sleep-related behavioral symptoms, and out-of-phase circadian rhythmicity despite the lack of history of earlier such symptoms. Meanwhile, the disruption in sleep bioparameters is experienced more in people with a history of sleep disorders. The behavioral sleep disorders in the current situations are prevalent given the today's amount of anxiety everyone is feeling about COVID-19. On the other hand, evidences indicated that the cross-link between impaired sleep efficiency and disrupted innate immunity makes people susceptible to viral infections. The present brief review highlights the links between psychosocial stress, sleep insufficiency, and susceptibility to viral infections in relevance to COVID-19 situation. The stress management measures, including addressing sleep-related disorders and sleep hygiene, will have a notable impact by harnessing immune response and thus reducing the susceptibility to viral infections.",2465759666.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
121,Psychosocial Consequences of Female Infertility in Iran: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Although not a life-threatening condition, infertility does influence various aspects of life. Based on a meta-analysis of the relevant literature, the aim of this study is to identify the psychosocial consequences of infertility in Iranian women. Methods: Comprehensive Portal of Human Sciences, Magiran, Scientific Information Database, Noormags, MEDLIB, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Medline, and ProQuest were the databases searched from inception (1999) to 2018. To maximize the comprehensiveness of the search, the reference lists of all the relevant papers identified were manually examined. The evaluation of the content was based on PRISMA guidelines, and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for data analysis. Results: Based on the analysis of 124 quantitative papers, the psychosocial consequences of infertility in women in Iran can be classified into 14 categories: psychological well-being (effect size = 3.10), adaptation to infertility (effect size = 2.71), quality of life (effect size = 1.83), depression (effect size = 1.80), anxiety (effect size = 1.72), marital relationships (effect size = 1.37), personality disorders (effect size = 1.37), violence (effect size = 1.31), social support (effect size = 0.90), self-efficacy (effect size = 0.90), coping strategies (effect size = 0.84), irrational thoughts (effect size = 0.77), somatization disorders (effect size = 0.65), and sexual dysfunction (effect size = 0.55). Conclusion: Considering the wide-ranging psychosocial consequences of infertility in women, it is necessary for treatment to account for psychological factors.",2465757517.0, Systematic Review,2020
122,A Cross-Sectional Study of Psychological Status in Different Epidemic Areas in China After the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has seriously affected people's mental health. We aimed to assess the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on health care workers and non-health care workers in three different epidemic areas in China and to identify independent risk factors. Methods: We surveyed 1,020 non-health care workers and 480 health care workers in Wuhan, other cities in Hubei except Wuhan and other provinces in China except Hubei. Results: Health care workers in Hubei had higher levels of anxiety and depression than non-health care workers (p &lt; 0.05), but there was no such difference in other provinces in China except Hubei (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with other regions, health care workers in Wuhan was more anxious (p &lt; 0.05), and this anxiety may be caused by concerns about occupational exposure and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily; health care workers in Hubei had more obvious depression (p &lt; 0.05), which may be associated with long days participating in epidemic work and wearing protective clothing for a long time daily. Meanwhile, 62.5% of health care workers were proud of their work. The anxiety and depression of non-health care workers in Wuhan were also the most serious. Conclusions: In Wuhan, where the epidemic is most severe, levels of anxiety and depression seem to be higher, especially among health care workers. This information may help to better prepare for future events.",2465756507.0, Journal Article,2020
123,"Heightened Levels of Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With COVID-19 Lockdown, Pre-existing Psychiatric Diagnoses, and Intensified Psychological Dysfunctions: A Multi-country Study.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading globally since December 2019, bringing with it anxieties, mortal risk, and agonizing psychological suffering. This study aimed to explore the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming (MD)-an addictive mental behavior to vivid fantasy associated with distress and functional impairment-and forced COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and quarantine. Previous literature indicated that individuals employ MD for the regulation of distress and boredom, wish fulfillment, and entertainment experiences. The literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health identifies a flareup in psychological difficulties in the general population. In this study we explored the associations between the pandemic threat and mental health indices among individuals with MD. We surveyed 1,565 adults from over 70 countries who responded to calls for participants posted in online MD communities and other general social media sites. Probable MD was determined based on an empirically derived cut-off score on a pertinent measure. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, a series of MANCOVAs, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs, revealed that individuals with probable MD who were observing lockdown restrictions reported having spent more time in fantasy, experienced more intense and vivid daydreaming, and had a stronger urge to daydream than other participants. Similar statistical procedures indicated that, individuals with probable MD who reported pre-existing anxiety and depression disorders described a greater urge to daydream due to the pandemic and greater difficulty to control this addictive behavior. Compared to individuals with likely normal daydreaming, individuals with suspected MD reported more pandemic-attributed deterioration on a wide array of psychological distress indices. Our data show that the current worldwide pandemic threat is connected with an elevated intensity of this addictive form of mental activity, and that MD is associated with the exacerbation of psychological distress and dysfunction rather than with beneficial regulation of the experienced stressor.",2464607597.0, Journal Article,2020
124,A Network Analysis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Correlates During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background and Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been suggested as a collective trauma, which presents a continuing crisis. However, the specific post-traumatic implication of this crisis has not been adequately studied yet. The current study was aimed to ascertain the most central symptom and the strong connections between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At the same time, exploring the relationship between covariates and the network of PTSD symptoms, by taking sex, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, quality of life, and social support as covariates, may help us to know the arise and maintenance of PTSD symptoms and give specified suggestions to people under the shadow of COVID-19. Method: The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was used to assess the PTSD symptoms extent of 338 healthy participants over the past month. Networks were analyzed using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. In addition, the centrality of the symptoms and the robustness of the results were analyzed. Results: The network analysis revealed that the especially strong connections emerged between avoidance of thoughts and avoidance of reminders, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response, intrusive thoughts and nightmares, flashbacks and emotional cue reactivity, and detachment and restricted affect. The most central symptoms were self-destructive/reckless behavior. Incorporation of covariates into the network revealed the strong connections path between self-destructive/reckless behavior and loss of interest and depression. Conclusion: Self-destructive/reckless behavior was the most central symptom in the network of PTSD symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which as an important target of interfere may have great benefits.",2464607438.0, Journal Article,2020
125,Psychosocial Correlates of Depression and Anxiety in the United Arab Emirates During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is likely to be significant. Identifying vulnerable groups during the pandemic is essential for targeting psychological support, and in preparation for any second wave or future pandemic. Vulnerable groups are likely to vary across different societies; therefore, research needs to be conducted at a national and international level. This online survey explored generalized anxiety and depression symptoms in a community sample of adults (N = 1,039) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between April 8th and April 22nd, 2020. Respondents completed symptom measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7), along with psychosocial and demographic variables that might potentially influence such symptoms. Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for the main study variables. Levels of anxiety and depression were notably higher than those reported in previous (pre-pandemic) national studies. Similar variables were statistically significantly associated with both depression and anxiety, most notably younger age, being female, having a history of mental health problems, self or loved ones testing positive for COVID-19, and having high levels of COVID-related anxiety and economic threat. Sections of the UAE population experienced relatively high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic. Several COVID-related and psychosocial variables were associated with heightened symptomatology. Identifying such vulnerable groups can help inform the public mental health response to the current and future pandemics.",2464606987.0, Journal Article,2020
126,Mental Health Consequences of the Coronavirus 2020 Pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain. A Longitudinal Study.,"Background: Covid-19 remains a pandemic that most countries in the world are still dealing with. This is study aims to report the psychological impact of Covid-19 over time on the Spanish population. Methods: A longitudinal study (N = 1041) was carried out with two measurements: after 2 and 5 weeks starting from the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disease (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, variables about Covid-19, loneliness, spiritual well-being, social support, discrimination, and a sense of belonging were collected. Results: The data showed how depressive symptomatology increased significantly over time, while anxiety and PTSD did not show statistically significant changes. Spiritual well-being and loneliness were the main predictors of psychological impact. A younger age was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, while female gender was associated with anxiety and PTSD. Conclusions: The impact of the pandemic is sustained over time, even increasing in depression, and vulnerable groups that need greater psychological health support could be identified.",2464606979.0, Journal Article,2020
127,Psychological Impact During the First Outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy.,"The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy was confirmed on February 21, 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 turned into a global pandemic, causing a global health emergency, triggering an unprecedented event in the modern era. This study assessed the immediate psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on emotional health and well-being. An ad hoc questionnaire was designed for online completion to expedite data collection during the COVID-19 outbreak. People were invited to participate in the study via social media and email from 4 to 18 March 2020. The entire survey comprised of 21 questions, covering a wide range of factors, such as demographics, disease knowledge, psychological impact, daily life activities, and psychological precautionary measures. The main outcome measure was psychological impact. This was measured based on intensity and prevalence of self-reported feelings of anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, and concern during the epidemic. In total, 10,025 respondents completed the online survey. Of these, about 73% were females, and 100% of the sample possessed good knowledge of the disease. The greatest prevalence of high psychological impact was reported in the &lt;34 years' age group and in north Italy. Additionally, the psychological impact influenced important daily life activities, such as sexuality and nutrition. Our study provides information about the immediate psychological (emotional feelings) responses of Italy's general population to the COVID-19 epidemic. The survey covers several factors that can influence mental health; our results help gauge the psychological burden on the community and offer ways to minimize the impact.",2464606951.0, Journal Article,2020
128,Multimodal Psychotherapeutic Inpatient Therapy of Depression Is Successful in Patients With High Cytokine Production.,"Objective: In experimental settings, systemically elevated inflammation markers interfere with major depression treatment. In German healthcare, compulsory national health insurance covers treatment of a wide variety of depressive disorders, if it follows evidence-based medicine guidelines combining recommended therapies. To date, little is known about the relevance of immune system cytokine production with regard to real-world clinical care for patients with moderate depression. Methods: Seventy three patients with moderate depression subjected to multimodal psychotherapeutic inpatient therapy (mPT) following a psychodynamic concept at a German university hospital were included. As a primary outcome, mPT success, evidenced by delta HADS ""depression,"" was analyzed according to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) challenge at baseline. Secondary outcomes addressed the inflammatory response and mental health comparing high and low TNFα-producers. Results: First, higher PBMC TNFα production at baseline predicted a better mPT-outcome (R 2 0.162, p = 0.014). Second, patients with high TNFα (hTNF) at baseline produced significantly more acute inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)1β, IL6), TH1/TH2 cytokines [interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL4] as well as eotaxin and IL2 compared to low TNFα producers (lTNF) (Cohen's ds between -0.532 and -1.013). Demographic data, diagnosis subtype-distribution, medication, systemic inflammation markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), leptin], anxiety and depression (HADS) did not differ. From baseline to mPT-discharge, HADS ""depression"" decreased in both hTNF (11.31 to 5.47, p = 0.001, d = 1.184) and lTNF patients (11.50-7.92, p = 0.001, d = -0.765), while PBMC cytokine production decreased significantly in hTNF (Cohen's ds between -0.304 and -0.345) with a significant group by time interaction for TH1/TH2 ratio. At the end of therapy, comparison of TNF groups revealed significantly lower depression-scores in hTNF compared to lTNF patients (5.47 compared to 7.92, p = 0.035, d = 0.504). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates successful treatment of depression in a clinical care setting using multimodal psychotherapy based on a psychodynamic concept following guideline recommendation. The greatest improvement in patient depression was linked to the highest production of TNFα by PBMCs at baseline. Our study contributes to the definition of patient subpopulations with differing cytokine responses that are related to succesful treatment of depression.",2464606895.0, Journal Article,2020
129,Relations of COVID-19-Related Stressors and Social Support With Chinese College Students' Psychological Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"This study examines the main and interactive relations of stressors and social support with Chinese college students' psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) during the COVID-19 pandemic. All the constructs are assessed by self-report in an anonymous survey during the pandemic outbreak. The results show that the number of stressors has a positive relation with psychological symptoms, and social support has a negative relation with psychological symptoms. In addition, social support serves as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors. These findings hold implications for university counseling services during times of acute, large-scale stressors. Specifically, effective screening procedures should be developed to identify students who experience large number of stressors and provide suitable psychological intervention for them.",2464606882.0, Journal Article,2020
130,Bullying Perpetration and Narcissistic Personality Traits across Adolescence: Joint Trajectories and Childhood Risk Factors.,"Objectives: Although there is some evidence on the longitudinal associations between bullying perpetration and narcissistic personality traits, their joint developmental trajectories across early to late adolescence are largely unknown. Accordingly, we examined the co-development of bullying perpetration and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence and examined the childhood predictors of these joint trajectories. Method: Self-reports of bullying and narcissistic personality traits were assessed across 6 years of adolescence from Grade 7 (i.e., age 13) to Grade 12 (i.e., age 18) in a sample of 616 Canadian adolescents and childhood predictors were assessed in Grades 5 and 6. Results: As predicted, latent class growth analyses demonstrated that most adolescents were reflected in a trajectory of low decreasing bullying (82.0%) and a smaller group followed a moderate stable trajectory of bullying (18.0%). The majority of adolescents followed a moderate stable trajectory of narcissistic traits (56.3%), followed by a high increasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (22.8%), and a low decreasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (20.9%). Six percent of adolescents followed a high-risk dual trajectory of moderate stable bullying and high increasing narcissistic traits (high-risk group). Also as predicted, higher hyperactivity, higher frustration, and lower anxiety in childhood differentiated the high-risk group from a low-risk group (low decreasing bullying and low decreasing narcissistic traits; 19.0%). Higher childhood hyperactivity also differentiated a group of adolescents who followed a trajectory of moderate stable bullying and moderate stable narcissistic traits (10.0%) from the low-risk group. Results showed that moderate stable bullying was a better indicator of high increasing and moderate stable trajectories of narcissistic personality traits than the reverse. Conclusions: Findings suggest adolescence is a time when personality and bullying reflect dynamic and heterogeneous development. Early intervention of childhood risk factors may help prevent a high-risk developmental course of bullying and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence.",2464606869.0, Journal Article,2020
131,A Systematic Review and Provisional Metanalysis on Psychopathologic Burden on Health Care Workers of Coronavirus Outbreaks.,"Background The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shows several similarities with previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence of the psychopathologic burden on health care workers (HCWs) of the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks to get lessons for managing the current burden of COVID-19 outbreak.
 Method According to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement, the study quantified the effects of frontline work on mental health of HCWs. Major databases - Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science - were searched for observational and case-control studies evaluating mental health indexes reported by front-line work. This study computed the percentage of sample that reported clinically significant levels of psychiatric symptoms. Cohen's d was used for comparing mental health outcomes of health care workers directly involved in addressing pandemic emergency with a control group that was not directly exposed to such conditions. Pooled effect sizes (dw ) were estimated whenever at least three independent studies yielded data. Heterogeneity of findings and bias of publication were estimated as well.
 Findings Fifteen studies have been selected for a total of 7,393 HCWs. From 9.6% to 51% of HCWs reported symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and from 20% to 75% reported psychiatric symptoms, with a prevalence of anxiety and depression. From one to the three years after outbreak, from 2% to 19% reported PTSD symptoms and from 5% to 90% psychiatric symptoms. Interestingly, HWCs who were directly involved in pandemic emergency showed significantly higher depressive and anxious symptoms (dw = .66 (.46-.85); p &lt;.001) than ones who were not directly exposed. Similarly, the direct involvement significantly affected the severity of PTSD symptoms (dw = .30 (.21-.39); p &lt;.001).
 Conclusion Health care professionals in general and most of all frontline workers showed an association with a likely risk of developing psychiatric disorders following outbreaks and for at least three years later. Mental health interventions for professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented. Further studies are warranted to investigate long-term consequences carefully, and to look for mediating and buffering factors as well. The role of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in delivering adequate interventions is critically important.",2461001381.0, Systematic Review,2020
132,The Long-Term Impact of Maternal Anxiety and Depression Postpartum and in Early Childhood on Child and Paternal Mental Health at 11-12 Years Follow-Up.,"Background Postpartum maternal anxiety and depression can affect child development and family functioning. However, the long-term impact of postpartum maternal anxiety and depression on child and paternal mental health is understudied. The present large-scale prospective cohort study is one of the first to investigate whether maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms postpartum and at child age 5-6 years separately and synergistically increase paternal anxiety and depressive symptoms and child emotional problems in early adolescence at age 11-12 years. Secondly, we investigated whether concurrent paternal anxiety and depressive symptoms at child age 11-12 years moderated the association between maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and at child age 5-6 years with child emotional problems at age 11-12 years.
 Methods This study is part of the Amsterdam Born Children and Development (ABCD) cohort study, the Netherlands (N = 2.298). Maternal postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at 13 weeks postpartum. Maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms at child age 5-6 years and parental anxiety and depressive symptoms at 11-12 years were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Child emotional problems were reported by the child and a teacher using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multivariable linear regression was conducted, adjusted for demographic, perinatal/obstetric confounders, and affective symptoms of the other family members at 11-12 years.
 Results Neither maternal anxiety nor depressive symptoms were related to paternal depressive symptoms at child age 11-12 years, while maternal postpartum depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms at 5-6 years and maternal anxiety at 5-6 years were positively related to paternal anxiety at 11-12 years. However, effect sizes were small. Only maternal postpartum depression was positively but weakly associated with more child emotional problems at 11-12 years. Although paternal concurrent affective symptoms were positively related to more child emotional problems in early adolescence, they did not moderate the association between maternal symptoms and child emotional problems.
 Conclusions Our results indicate that fathers and children seem to be affected only to a small extent by maternal postpartum anxiety or depression.",2461001333.0, Journal Article,2020
133,"Knowledge, Anxiety, Fear, and Psychological Distress About COVID-19 Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates.","Background: Fear of infection, the epidemic situation, unexpected lockdown, and implementation of online classes are most likely affecting the psychological well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to assess the level of knowledge, anxiety, and psychological distress concerning COVID-19 and their association with fear, gender, age, history of mental illness, time spent reading about COVID-19, program of study, and type of dwelling among students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods and Materials: In this cross-sectional study, 433 students participated in a web-based survey. These were students at the University of Sharjah, coming from all the emirates of the UAE. Demographic scale, COVID-19 knowledge, anxiety, fear, and psychological distress scales were used to screen these problems. Results: Of the 433 students, 278 (64.2%) were male and 155 (35.8%) were female. Overall, 353 (81.5%) exhibited adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Sixty-nine (15.9%) of students were anxious and 221 (51%) were in psychological distress. Students who exhibited anxiety concerning COVID-19 anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 2.98) and fear (OR: 1.27), and who spent more than 4 h reading about COVID-19 (OR: 11.20) were more psychologically distressed. Students with a history of mental illness showed adequate knowledge of COVID-19; however, they were more psychologically distressed (OR: 5.93). Older students were less likely to have psychological distress (OR: 0.87). Conclusion: Students possess adequate knowledge concerning COVID-19; however, they are psychologically distressed. Age, dwelling status, history of mental illness, anxiety, and fear significantly predicted psychological distress. Frequent web-based workshops that include insight, guidance, online counseling, scheduled activity, and coping mechanisms for COVID-19 are highly recommended. The authors discuss the implications for future research and provide recommendations for students and educational institutions.",2461001285.0, Journal Article,2020
134,"The Effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","Background: As a public health emergency of international concern, the COVID-19 outbreak has had a tremendous impact on patients' psychological health. However, studies on psychological interventions in patients with COVID-19 are relatively rare. Objectives: This study examined the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in relieving patients' psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Ninety-three eligible participants selected by cluster sampling were randomized to an intervention group (N = 47) and a control group (N = 46). Participants in the control group received routine treatment according to the Chinese Management Guidelines for COVID-19, while participants in the intervention group received routine treatment with additional CBT. The Chinese Version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress for all participants at baseline and post-intervention. Two-sided t-test, and proportion tests were used to examine the differences between the intervention and control group for each DASS-21 indicator. Univariate linear regression was used to examine the association between chronic disease status and change in each DASS-21 indicator after intervention. Two-way scatter plots were generated to show the association of the length of hospital stay and the changes of each DASS-21 indicator by intervention and control groups. Results: Significant decreases in means were found for scales of depression, anxiety, stress and total DASS-21 in both intervention (p &lt; 0.001) and control group (p = 0.001), with participants in the intervention group having a bigger reduction in means. After the intervention, more participants in the intervention group had no depression or anxiety symptoms than in the control group, but no statistical differences were found (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with participants with chronic disease, participants with no chronic disease had a significantly larger reduction of total DASS-21 scale (coefficient = -4.74, 95% CI: -9.31; -0.17).The length of hospital stay was significantly associated with a greater increase in anxiety scale in the intervention group (p = 0.005), whilst no significant association was found in the control group (p = 0.29). Conclusions: The patients with COVID-19 experienced high levels of anxiety, depression and stress. Our study result highlights the effectiveness of CBT in improving the psychological health among patients with COVID-19, also suggests that CBT should be focused on patients with chronic disease and those who have longer hospital stays. These results have important implications in clinical practice in improving psychological health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Trial Registration: ISRCTN68675756.

135,Machine Learning Analysis of Electronic Nose in a Transdiagnostic Community Sample With a Streamlined Data Collection Approach: No Links Between Volatile Organic Compounds and Psychiatric Symptoms.,"Non-intrusive, easy-to-use and pragmatic collection of biological processes is warranted to evaluate potential biomarkers of psychiatric symptoms. Prior work with relatively modest sample sizes suggests that under highly-controlled sampling conditions, volatile organic compounds extracted from the human breath (exhalome), often measured by an electronic nose (""e-nose""), may be related to physical and mental health. The present study utilized a streamlined data collection approach and attempted to replicate and extend prior e-nose links to mental health in a standard research setting within large transdiagnostic community dataset (N = 1207; 746 females; 18-61 years) who completed a screening visit at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research between 07/2016 and 05/2018. Factor analysis was used to obtain latent exhalome variables, and machine learning approaches were employed using these latent variables to predict three types of symptoms independent of each other (depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder) within separate training and a test sets. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, and smoking status, the best fitting algorithm produced by the training set accounted for nearly 0% of the test set's variance. In each case the standard error included the zero line, indicating that models were not predictive of clinical symptoms. Although some sample variance was predicted, findings did not generalize to out-of-sample data. Based on these findings, we conclude that the exhalome, as measured by the e-nose within a less-controlled environment than previously reported, is not able to provide clinically useful assessments of current depression, anxiety or substance use severity.",2461001205.0, Journal Article,2020
136,Imagery Rescripting on Guilt-Inducing Memories in OCD: A Single Case Series Study.,"Background and objectives Criticism is thought to play an important role in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and obsessive behaviors have been considered as childhood strategies to avoid criticism. Often, patients with OCD report memories characterized by guilt-inducing reproaches. Starting from these assumptions, the aim of this study is to test whether intervening in memories of guilt-inducing reproaches can reduce current OCD symptoms. The emotional valence of painful memories may be modified through imagery rescripting (ImRs), an experiential technique that has shown promising results.
 Methods After monitoring a baseline of symptoms, 18 OCD patients underwent three sessions of ImRs, followed by monitoring for up to 3 months. Indexes of OCD, depression, anxiety, disgust, and fear of guilt were collected.
 Results Patients reported a significant decrease in OCD symptoms. The mean value on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) changed from 25.94 to 14.11. At the 3-month follow-up, 14 of the 18 participants (77.7%) achieved an improvement of ≥35% on the Y-BOCS. Thirteen patients reported a reliable improvement, with ten reporting a clinically significant change (reliable change index = 9.94). Four reached the asymptomatic criterion. Clinically significant changes were not detected for depression and anxiety.
 Conclusions Our findings suggest that after ImRs intervention focusing on patients' early experiences of guilt-inducing reproaches there were clinically significant changes in OCD symptomatology. The data support the role of ImRs in reducing OCD symptoms and the previous cognitive models of OCD, highlighting the role of guilt-related early life experiences in vulnerability to OCD.",2461001167.0, Journal Article,2020
137,"Childhood Trauma, Emotion Regulation, and Pain in Individuals With Alcohol Use Disorder.","Introduction: Several studies have confirmed that the experience of childhood trauma, poor emotion regulation, as well as the experience of physical pain may contribute to the development and poor treatment outcomes of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, little is known about how the joint impact of these experiences may contribute to AUD. Objectives: To analyze associations between childhood trauma, emotion regulation, and pain in individuals with AUD. Methods: The study sample included 165 individuals diagnosed with AUD. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to investigate different types of trauma during childhood (physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and neglect), the Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess anxiety symptoms, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to assess emotional dysregulation, and the Pain Resilience Scale and Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire were used to measure self-reported pain tolerance and sensitivity. Results: Childhood emotional abuse (CTQ subscale score) was positively associated with anxiety, anxiety was positively associated with emotional dysregulation, and emotional dysregulation was negatively associated with pain tolerance. Accordingly, there was support for a significant indirect negative association between childhood emotional abuse and pain tolerance. The serial mediation statistical procedure demonstrated that anxiety and emotional dysregulation mediated the effect of childhood emotional abuse on pain resilience among individuals with AUD. Conclusions: Targeting emotional dysregulation and physical pain that can result from childhood trauma may have particular therapeutic utility among individuals treated for AUD.",2461001052.0, Journal Article,2020
138,Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in COVID-19 Isolated Patients and in Their Relatives.,"Background: While focusing on the management and care of COVID-19 patients, the mental health of these patients and their relatives is being overlooked. The aim of the current study was to measure anxiety and depression, and to assess their association with socio-demographic and pandemic-related stress factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives during the initial stage of hospitalization. Methods: We assessed isolated hospitalized patients (N = 90) and their relatives (adults and children, N = 125) by phone, 25-72 h following patients' admission. The quantitative measures included the Anxiety and Depression modules of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and pandemic-related stress factors. Qualitative measures included questions exploring worries, sadness, and coping modes. Results: Both patients and relatives suffer from high levels of anxiety and related pandemic worries, with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Compared to adult relatives, child relatives reported significantly lower anxiety. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an increased risk for anxiety among females and a decreased risk among ultra-orthodox participants. While increased anxiety among patients was associated with feelings of isolation, increased anxiety among relatives was associated with a feeling of not being protected by the hospital. Conclusions: Patients and relatives experience similar high anxiety levels which are more robust in women and lower in ultra-orthodox participants. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms of both patients and adult relatives should be addressed.",2461000830.0, Journal Article,2020
139,"A Systematic Review of Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Duloxetine.","Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients affected by major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), neuropathic pain (NP), fibromyalgia (FMS), and stress incontinence urinary (SUI). These conditions share parallel pathophysiological pathways, and duloxetine treatment might be an effective and safe alternative. Thus, a systematic review was conducted following the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items (PRISMA) recommendations and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical (JBI) Appraisals guidelines. Eighty-five studies focused on efficacy, safety, and tolerability of duloxetine were included in our systematic review. Studies were subdivided by clinical condition and evaluated individually. Thus, 32 studies of MDD, 11 studies of GAD, 19 studies of NP, 9 studies of FMS, and 14 studies of SUI demonstrated that the measured outcomes indicate the suitability of duloxetine in the treatment of these clinical conditions. This systematic review confirms that the dual mechanism of duloxetine benefits the treatment of comorbid clinical conditions, and supports the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of duloxetine in short- and long-term treatments.",2461000771.0, Systematic Review,2020
140,"""Now It's Just Old Habits and Misery""-Understanding the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People With Current or Life-Time Eating Disorders: A Qualitative Study.","Background: Many aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic may make living with or recovery from an eating disorder (ED) particularly challenging. Understanding the processes which underlie the psychological and behavioral responses of people with EDs during this time are key to ensure tailored support in these unprecedented circumstances. Methods: People with lifetime EDs (n = 32) were recruited through social media from May to June 2020 during a period of strict infection control measures in the United Kingdom (i.e., ""lockdown,"" ""social distancing""). They completed open-ended questions in an online anonymous questionnaire that invited them to reflect on how various aspects of their lives have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including ED symptoms and coping strategies. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Most respondents reported that their ED worsened or resurfaced. Isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise seemed to contribute to this. There was a clear sense that individuals struggled with which aspects of psychological distress to prioritize, i.e., mood vs. ED cognitions and behaviors, particularly as attempts to cope with one often exacerbated the other. Nonetheless, some participants reported ""silver linings"" of the pandemic. Conclusions: In this self-selected sample, deterioration or recurrence of ED symptoms were the norm. This has implications for the provision of treatment and care for people with EDs both in the immediate short-term and in potential future waves of the pandemic, with a significant surge of new and re-referrals expected.",2461000742.0, Journal Article,2020
141,Self-Perceived Stress During the Quarantine of COVID-19 Pandemic in Paraguay: An Exploratory Survey.,"Introduction: Any viral pandemic is a global health and mental health issue. The World Health Organization and mental health associations have warned that the current COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a drastic increase of stress-related conditions and mental health issues globally. Materials and Methods: An online web-based survey has been launched from 10 to 15 April 2020 in Paraguay in order to collect information regarding the stress related to the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been spread through social media (""WhatsApp,"" ""Twitter,"" and ""Facebook""). Two thousand two hundred and six Paraguayan citizens, over 18 years of age, completed the survey voluntarily. Socio-demographics as well as ratings at Self-perceived Stress Scale have been collected and analyzed. Results: Two thousand two hundred and six subjects (74.12% men) aged between 18 and 75 with an average of 34 ± 11 years old completed the survey. 12.42% (276 subjects) of sample reported a preexisting diagnosis of mental disorder, and 175 participants (7.93%) reported an increase of preexisting symptoms with the onset of COVID-19 quarantine. 41.97% of them had anxiety and 54.38% did not receive any specific treatment. The general population rated 18.10 ± 5.99 at Self-perceived Stress Scale, which indicates a moderate level of self-perceived stress. Significant association was found between higher levels of stress and female sex, being single, or reporting preexisting mental disorder, above all anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0.01). In fact, in 63.87% of mentally ill subjects (n = 175), the quarantine has worsened symptoms of preexisting mental disorders. Conclusion: This study suggests a stressful impact of COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of participants reporting a moderate level of self-perceived stress. We suggest mental health services to provide a phone-based or web-based support to the general population in order to contrast the psychological impact of the pandemic. This approach may improve the accessibility to mental healthcare services in Paraguay, especially in times of social distancing.",2461000646.0, Journal Article,2020
142,DSM-5 Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome in Adolescents Hospitalized With Non-psychotic Psychiatric Disorders.,"Introduction: Although attenuated psychotic symptoms often occur for the first time during adolescence, studies focusing on adolescents are scarce. Attenuated psychotic symptoms form the criteria to identify individuals at increased clinical risk of developing psychosis. The study of individuals with these symptoms has led to the release of the DSM-5 diagnosis of Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) as a condition for further research. We aimed to characterize and compare hospitalized adolescents with DSM-5-APS diagnosis vs. hospitalized adolescents without a DSM-5-APS diagnosis. Methods: Interviewing help-seeking, hospitalized adolescents (aged 12-18 years) and their caregivers independently with established research instruments, we (1) evaluated the presence of APS among non-psychotic adolescents, (2) characterized and compared APS and non-APS individuals regarding sociodemographic, illness and intervention characteristics, (3) correlated psychopathology with levels of functioning and severity of illness and (4) investigated the influence of individual clinical, functional and comorbidity variables on the likelihood of participants to be diagnosed with APS. Results: Among 248 consecutively recruited adolescents (age=15.4 ± 1.5 years, females = 69.6%) with non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, 65 (26.2%) fulfilled APS criteria and 183 (73.8%) did not fulfill them. Adolescents with APS had higher number of psychiatric disorders than non-APS adolescents (3.5 vs. 2.4, p &lt; 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.77), particularly, disruptive behavior disorders (Cramer's V = 0.16), personality disorder traits (Cramer's V = 0.26), anxiety disorders (Cramer's V = 0.15), and eating disorders (Cramer's V = 0.16). Adolescents with APS scored higher on positive (Cohen's d = 1.5), negative (Cohen's d = 0.55), disorganized (Cohen's d = 0.51), and general symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.84), and were more severely ill (Cohen's d = 1.0) and functionally impaired (Cohen's d = 0.31). Negative symptoms were associated with lower functional levels (Pearson ρ = -0.17 to -0.20; p = 0.014 to 0.031). Global illness severity was associated with higher positive, negative, and general symptoms (Pearson ρ = 0.22 to 0.46; p = 0.04 to p &lt; 0.001). APS status was independently associated with perceptual abnormalities (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.6-2.5, p &lt; 0.001), number of psychiatric diagnoses (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2-2.0, p = 0.002), and impaired stress tolerance (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.7, p = 0.002) (r 2 = 0.315, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: A considerable number of adolescents hospitalized with non-psychotic psychiatric disorders meet DSM-5-APS criteria. These help-seeking adolescents have more comorbid disorders and more severe symptoms, functional impairment, and severity of illness than non-APS adolescents. Thus, they warrant high intensity clinical care.",2461000644.0, Journal Article,2020
143,COVID-19 and Mental Health-What Do We Know So Far?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought several worldwide health, social, and economic disturbances-particularly associated with the imposed confinement measures-that raised concerns about an emerging public mental health crisis. Studies investigating the early mental health impact of the pandemic on general population and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers, revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among others, and found several risk and protective factors. Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being. We encourage the development of longitudinal studies to assess long-term adaptive responses.",2461000517.0, Journal Article,2020
144,Psychological Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Among Italians During the First Week of Lockdown.,"Pandemics and government-mandated quarantining measures have a substantial impact on mental health. This study investigated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis on Italian residents during the first week of government-imposed lockdown and the role of defense mechanisms as protective factors against distress. In this cross-sectional study, 5,683 Italians responded to an online survey assessing socio-demographics, overall psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms, and defense mechanisms using validated measures as the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scale-Self-Report-30 (DMRS-SR-30). Data were collected from March 13 to March 18, within the first week of lockdown in Italy. Results showed that younger age and female gender were associated with increased psychological distress. Having positive cases nearby, more days on lockdown, and having to relocate were also associated with greater distress. Higher overall defensive functioning (ODF) was associated with lower levels of depression (r = -.44, 95% CI -0.48, -0.40), anxiety (r = -.38, 95% CI -0.42, -0.35), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (r = -.34, 95% CI -0.38, -0.30). Conversely, less adaptive defensive functioning was related to greater affective distress across all domains. Each increased unit of ODF decreased the chances of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) by 71% (odds ratio = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI.026,.032). The psychological impact of COVID-19 among Italians during the early weeks of government lockdown has been significant. The pandemic continues to have extraordinary mental health impact as it moves across the globe. Given the salience of defensive functioning in psychological distress, consideration of interventions that foster the use of more adaptive defenses may be an important component of building resilience amidst a pandemic.",2461000492.0, Journal Article,2020
145,GWAS SNPs Impact Shared Regulatory Pathways Amongst Multimorbid Psychiatric Disorders and Cognitive Functioning.,"Background: Epidemiological research has reported that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and unipolar depression (UD) are multimorbid conditions that are typically accompanied by cognitive advantages or deficits, suggesting that common biological mechanisms may underlie these phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with psychiatric disorders and cognitive functioning. However, the mechanisms by which these SNPs contribute to multimorbidities amongst psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes remains largely unknown. Objective: To identify shared regulatory mechanisms amongst multimorbid psychiatric disorders and cognitive functioning. Methods: We integrated data on 3D genome organization, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and pathway analyses to identify shared and specific regulatory impacts of 2,893 GWAS SNPs (p &lt; 1 × 10-6) associated with ADHD, anxiety, BD, SCZ, UD, and cognitive functioning on genes and biological pathways. Drug-gene interaction analysis was performed to identify potential pharmacological impacts on these genes and pathways. Results: The analysis revealed 33 genes and 62 pathways that were commonly affected by tissue-specific gene regulatory interactions associated with all six phenotypes despite there being no common SNPs in our original dataset. The analysis of brain-specific regulatory connections revealed similar patterns at eQTL and eGene levels, but no pathways shared by all six phenotypes. Instead, pairwise overlaps and individualized pathways were identified for psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes in brain tissues. Conclusions: This study offers insight into the shared genes and biological pathways that are affected by tissue-specific regulatory impacts resulting from psychiatric- and cognition-associated genetic variants. These results provide limited support for the ""p-factor"" hypothesis for psychiatric disorders and potential mechanisms that explain drug side-effects. Our results highlight key biological pathways for development of therapies that target single or multiple psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes.",2461000384.0, Journal Article,2020
146,Placebo Responses and Placebo Effects in Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.,"Much has been written about the placebo effects in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD), especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), driven by the early hypothesis that in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IBS, the placebo effect might be specifically high and thus, corrupts the efficacy of novel drugs developed for this condition. This narrative review is based on a specific search method, a database (www.jips.online) developed since 2004 containing more than 4,500 papers (data papers, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, reviews) pertinent to the topic placebo effects/placebo response. Three central questions-deducted from the body of current literature-are addressed to explore the evidence behind this hypothesis: What is the size placebo effect in FGD, especially in IBS, and is it different from the placebo effect seen in other gastrointestinal disorders? Is the placebo effect in FGD different from other functional, non-intestinal disorders, e.g. in other pain syndromes? Is the placebo effect in FGD related to placebo effects seen in psychiatry, e.g. in depression, anxiety disorders, and alike? Following this discussion, a fourth question is raised as the result of the three: What are the consequences of this for future drug trials in FGD? In summary it is concluded that, contrary to common belief and discussion, the placebo effect seen in RCT in FGD is not specifically high and extraordinary as compared to other comparable (i.e. functional) disorders. It shares less than expected commonalities with the placebo effect in psychiatry, and very few predictors have yet been identified that determine its effect size, especially some that are driven by design features of the studies. Current practice of RCT in IBS seems to limit and control the placebo effect quite well, and future trial practice, e.g. head-to-head trial, still offers options to maintain this control, even in the absence of placebos used.",2461000344.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
147,"Mental Health Literacy of Non-mental Health Nurses: A Mental Health Survey in Four General Hospitals in Hunan Province, China.","Background: The high numbers of patients with mental illness, especially those who are misdiagnosed or delayed in treatment in China, have imposed a huge burden on the country and the society. This study was designed to investigate the mental health literacy (MHL) of non-mental health nurses. Method: A cross-sectional survey was designed, and a convenient cluster sampling method was applied. We presented evidence on 601 nurses from the non-mental health department in four hospitals in Hengyang city, China. One-third of the vignettes were diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Result: The correct identification rates for schizophrenia, depression, and GAD vignettes reached 38.9, 56.2, and 17.5%, respectively. The majority of the participants deemed that the person in each vignette needed professional help, and most of them preferred professional medical help and lifestyle interventions. As for the likely outcome for the persons described in each vignette, more than half of the participants thought that with professional help, the patients would make a full recovery, but problems would probably recur. Conclusion: The MHL of non-mental health nurses is insufficient in China. This condition is particularly applicable in the case of GAD. Thus, the country must implement more mental health education programs to improve the MHL of non-mental health nurses.",2461000340.0, Journal Article,2020
148,COVID Feel Good-An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus.,"Background Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability, and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary.
 Aims This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the ""Secret Garden"" 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection. Three hundred sixty-degree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The ""Secret Garden"" video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals.
 Methods This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention.
 Conclusion The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the ""surgical mask"" of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer's respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions.",2459626131.0, Journal Article,2020
149,Meaning in Life and Self-Control Buffer Stress in Times of COVID-19: Moderating and Mediating Effects With Regard to Mental Distress.,"Background As evidenced by several studies, mental distress increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, citizens were asked to exercise a high degree of self-control with regard to personal and social health behavior. At the same time, we witnessed an increase of prosocial acts and shared creative expressions, which are known to serve as sources of meaning. Meaning in life and self-control are acknowledged psychological resources. Especially in times of crisis, meaning in life has been shown to be a crucial factor for resilience and coping. However, threatening and stressful situations can also jeopardize existential security and trigger crises of meaning. The present study aimed to document levels of acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in Germany and Austria during the lockdown and in the weeks thereafter. In order to identify potential risk factors related to demographics and living conditions, their associations with COVID-19 stress were analyzed exploratively. The primary objective of the study, however, was to investigate the buffering effect of two psychological resources-meaningfulness and self-control-with regard to the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress. Finally, a potential aggravation of mental distress due to the occurrence of crises of meaning was examined.
 Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during lockdown (survey group 1) and the subsequent weeks characterized by eased restrictions (survey group 2). A total of N = 1,538 German-speaking participants completed a questionnaire battery including a novel measure of acute COVID-19 stress, meaningfulness and crisis of meaning (SoMe), self-control (SCS-KD), and a screening of general mental distress, measured by core symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-4). In a first step, associations between living conditions, demographics, and COVID-19 stress were explored. Second, a moderation and a mediation model were tested. Meaningfulness, a measure of presence of meaning in life, as well as self-control were proposed to serve as buffers in a time of crisis, thus moderating the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress (double moderation). Crisis of meaning, operationalizing an experienced lack of meaning in life, was proposed to mediate the relationship between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress, with an assumed moderation of the association between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning by survey group (lockdown versus eased restrictions after lockdown), and a hypothesized moderation of the link between crisis of meaning and general mental distress by self-control (dual moderated mediation).
 Results COVID-19 stress was slightly right-skewed. Scores were higher during lockdown than in the weeks thereafter. The rate of clinically significant general mental distress was high, exceeding prevalence rates from both the general population and clinical samples of the time before the pandemic. In the weeks following the lockdown (group 2), general mental distress and crisis of meaning were significantly higher than during lockdown (group 1), whereas meaningfulness and self-control were significantly lower. Demographically, age had the strongest association with COVID-19 stress, with older participants perceiving less acute stress (r = -.21). People who were partnered or married suffered less from COVID-19 stress (η2 = .01). Living alone (η2 = .006), living in a room versus a flat or house (η2 = .008), and being unemployed due to the pandemic (η2 = .008) were related to higher experience of COVID-19 stress. COVID-19 stress and general mental distress were strongly related (r = .53). Both meaningfulness and self-control were negatively associated with general mental distress (r = -.40 and -.36, respectively). They also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When meaningfulness was high, high COVID-19 stress was related to substantially lower PHQ-4 scores than when meaningfulness was low. The same held for self-control: High scores of self-control were associated with lower PHQ-4 scores especially when COVID-19 stress was high. Crisis of meaning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and PHQ-4. There was a higher likelihood of crises of meaning occurring when COVID-19 stress was high; crisis of meaning, in turn, was associated with general mental distress. Survey group moderated the first path of this mediation, i.e., the relationship between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning: High scores of COVID-19 stress were associated more strongly with crisis of meaning in the second survey group (after the lockdown). Self-control moderated the second path, i.e., the relationship between crisis of meaning and PHQ-4: When a crisis of meaning was present, self-control could buffer its effect on general mental distress.
 Conclusions Also in the present study among German-speaking participants, general mental distress was high. Scores were higher after than during the lockdown, indicating an ongoing destabilization for a significant part of the population. People who saw a meaning in their lives and who were capable of self-control reported substantially less mental distress. Meaningfulness and self-control also served as buffers between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When COVID-19 stress was high, the presence of meaningfulness and self-control accounted for lower general mental distress. Moreover, people who suffered strongly from COVID-19 stress were more likely to develop a crisis of meaning which, in turn, was associated with higher general mental distress. This suggests that ongoing anxiety and depression might (also) be based on existential struggles. Again here, self-control buffered the impact of crisis of meaning on general mental health. We conclude from these findings that public health policies can support citizens in coping with large-scale crises by enabling experiences of meaningfulness, e.g., through transparent and reliable modes of communicating goals and necessary intermediate steps. Moreover, health professionals are well advised to invite individuals to confront existential questions and struggles, and to encourage them to exercise self-control. The latter can be boosted by keeping higher-order goals salient-which again is inherently linked to an understanding of their meaning.",2459626090.0, Journal Article,2020
150,Disrupted Structural Brain Network Organization Behind Depressive Symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe and devastating condition. However, the anatomical basis behind the affective symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and somatic-vegetative symptoms of MDD is still unknown. To explore the mechanism behind the depressive symptoms in MDD, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based structural brain connectivity analysis to investigate the network difference between MDD patients and healthy controls (CN), and to explore the association between network metrics and patients' clinical symptoms. Twenty-six patients with MDD and 25 CN were included. A baseline 24-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD-24) score ≥ 21 and seven factors (anxiety/somatization, weight loss, cognitive disturbance, diurnal variation, retardation, sleep disturbance, hopelessness) scores were assessed. When compared with healthy subjects, significantly higher characteristic path length and clustering coefficient as well as significantly lower network efficiencies were observed in patients with MDD. Furthermore, MDD patients demonstrated significantly lower nodal degree and nodal efficiency in multiple brain regions including superior frontal gyrus (SFG), supplementary motor area (SMA), calcarine fissure, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). We also found that the characteristic path length of MDD patients was associated with weight loss. Moreover, significantly lower global efficiency of MDD patients was correlated with higher total HAMD score, anxiety somatization, and cognitive disturbance. The nodal degree in SFG was also found to be negatively associated with disease duration. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that MDD patients had impaired structural network features compared to CN, and disruption of optimal network architecture might be the mechanism behind the depressive symptoms and emotion disturbance in MDD patients.",2459625105.0, Journal Article,2020
151,Suicidality in Fibromyalgia: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Fibromyalgia (FM), a poorly understood rheumatic condition, is characterized by chronic pain and psychiatric comorbidities, most notably depression and anxiety. Additional symptoms include sleep difficulties, fatigue, and various cognitive impairments. Furthermore, FM is surrounded by social stigma, due to the unclear nature and etiology of this condition. While there is widespread evidence for the emotional and psychological suffering of those with FM, the scope of suicidality, as well as the underlying factors that are associated with suicidal ideation and behavior among this population, are not well understood. The present review, which is the first of its kind, aims to summarize existing data on the prevalence of suicide-related outcomes among FM patients, highlight factors associated with suicidal ideation and behavior in FM, and identify gaps in the literature to better inform research and clinical care. Studies were extracted from the literature that measured suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and/or completed suicide among FM patients. Results indicated that both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were prevalent among individuals suffering from FM. Psychiatric comorbidity, sleep difficulties, and inpatient hospitalization were associated with both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Functional impairment was associated with suicidal ideation in FM. Factors associated with higher levels of suicidal behavior in FM included female gender, unemployment and lower income, medical comorbidity, and drug dependence. While an understanding of currently recognized risk factors is important for improving FM research and clinical care, some clear methodological and conceptual limitations of the reviewed studies were identified. Future work should focus on longitudinal studies, as well as on gaining a better biological and psychological understanding of the underpinnings of FM and suicidality.",2459625070.0, Systematic Review,2020
152,Continuous High Frequency Deep Brain Stimulation of the Rat Anterior Insula Attenuates the Relapse Post Withdrawal and Strengthens the Extinction of Morphine Seeking.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates the neuronal activity in specific brain circuits and has been recently considered as a promising intervention for refractory addiction. The insula cortex is the hub of interoception and is known to be involved in different aspects of substance use disorder. In the present study, we investigate the effects of continuous high frequency DBS in the anterior insula (AI) on drug-seeking behaviors and examined the molecular mechanisms of DBS action in morphine-addicted rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to the morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP, day 1-8) followed by bilaterally implanted with DBS electrodes in the AI (Day 10) and recovery (Day 10-15). Continuous high-frequency (HF) -DBS (130 Hz, 150 μA, 90 μs) was applied during withdrawal (Day 16-30) or extinction sessions. CPP tests were conducted on days 16, 30, 40 during withdrawal session and several rats were used for proteomic analysis on day 30. Following the complete extinction, morphine-CPP was reinstated by a priming dose of morphine infusion (2 mg/kg). The open field and novel objective recognition tests were also performed to evaluate the DBS side effect on the locomotion and recognition memory. Continuous HF-DBS in the AI attenuated the expression of morphine-CPP post-withdrawal (Day 30), but morphine addictive behavior relapsed 10 days after the cessation of DBS (Day 40). Continuous HF-DBS reduced the period to full extinction of morphine-CPP and blocked morphine priming-induced recurrence of morphine addiction. HF-DBS in the AI had no obvious effect on the locomotor activity and novel objective recognition and did not cause anxiety-like behavior. In addition, our proteomic analysis identified eight morphine-regulated proteins in the AI and their expression levels were reversely changed by HF-DBS. Continuous HF-DBS in the bilateral anterior insula prevents the relapse of morphine place preference after withdrawal, facilitates its extinction, blocks the reinstatement induced by morphine priming and reverses the expression of morphine-regulated proteins. Our findings suggest that manipulation of insular activity by DBS could be a potential intervention to treat substance use disorder, although future research is warranted.",2459625062.0, Journal Article,2020
153,The Effects of COVID-19 and Quarantine Measures on the Lifestyles and Mental Health of People Over 60 at Increased Risk of Dementia.,"Background: The lockdown strategies adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection may lead to adopt unhealthy lifestyles which may impact on the mental well-being and future risk of dementia. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may suffer important mental health consequences from measures of quarantine and confinement. Aims: The study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on lifestyles and mental health of elderly at increased risk of dementia. Methods: One hundred and twenty six community-dwelling seniors with MCI or SCD were phone-interviewed and assessed with questions regarding variables related to COVID-19 pandemic, lifestyle changes and scales validated for the assessment of depression, anxiety, and apathy. Results: The sample included 55.6% patients with MCI and 56 people with SCD. Over 1/3 of the sample reduced their physical activity and nearly 70% reported an increase in idle time. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet decreased in almost 1/3 of respondents and over 35% reported weight gain. Social activities were abolished and 1/6 of participants also decreased productive and mental-stimulating activities. 19.8% were depressed, 9.5% anxious, and 9.5% apathetic. A significant association existed between depression and living alone or having a poor relation with cohabitants and between anxiety and SCD, cold or flu symptoms, and reduction in productive leisure activities. Conclusions: Seniors with SCD and MCI underwent lifestyle changes that are potentially harmful to their future cognitive decline, even if, with the exception of leisure activities, they do not appear to be cross-sectionally associated with psychiatric symptoms.",2459624050.0, Journal Article,2020
154,Association of Lipid Profile and Suicide Attempts in a Large Sample of First Episode Drug-Naive Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.,"Several studies have reported a link between lipid disorders and suicidality. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between suicidal behavior and blood lipid profiles in patients with first-episode and drug-naive (FEDN) major depressive disorder (MDD). The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lipid profiles and suicide attempts in a large sample of FEDN MDD patients in the Chinese Han population, which has not been reported. A total of 1,718 MDD outpatients were recruited. Their clinical and demographic data as well as plasma lipid parameters were collected. We obtained suicide attempt data through interviews with patients and their family members. We rated the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) for all patients. The suicide attempt rate of MDD patients was 20.14%, of which 13.68% in the last month and 6.46% in the past. Further, compared with non-attempters, suicide attempters had significantly higher total levels of cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), higher HAMA and HAMD scores, but significantly lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis showed that suicide attempts were correlated with higher TC, lower HDL-c, and higher HAMA and HAMD scores with the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.35, 0.52,1.28, and 1.08, respectively (all p &lt; 0.05). Our findings suggest that FEDN patients with MDD have a high rate of attempted suicide. In the early stage of MDD patients, certain blood lipid parameters and more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression are correlated with suicide attempts. However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, it is impossible to draw a causal relationship between lipid profiles and suicide attempts. Moreover, an inverse correlation can also be considered, that is, high cholesterol may be the consequence of suicide attempts and depression.",2456855549.0, Journal Article,2020
155,The Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing in a Representative Sample of Australian Adults.,"There is minimal knowledge about the impact of large-scale epidemics on community mental health, particularly during the acute phase. This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises. The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5). Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors. Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis. Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes. Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing. In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing. Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss per se, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health. These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.",2456854927.0, Journal Article,2020
156,"Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Older Adults in London, UK.","The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing a profound negative impact on the health and wellbeing of societies and individuals, worldwide. One concern is the effect of social isolation as a result of social distancing on the mental health of vulnerable populations, including older people. Within six weeks of lockdown, we initiated the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study, a bespoke survey of cognitively healthy older people living in London, to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated social isolation on mental and physical wellbeing. The sample was drawn from CHARIOT, a register of people over 50 who have consented to be contacted for aging related research. A total of 7,127 men and women (mean age=70.7 [SD=7.4]) participated in the baseline survey, May-July 2020. Participants were asked about changes to the 14 components of the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) after lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23rd March. A total of 12.8% of participants reported feeling worse on the depression components of HADS (7.8% men and 17.3% women) and 12.3% reported feeling worse on the anxiety components (7.8% men and 16.5% women). Fewer participants reported feeling improved (1.5% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). Women, younger participants, those single/widowed/divorced, reporting poor sleep, feelings of loneliness and who reported living alone were more likely to indicate feeling worse on both the depression and/or anxiety components of the HADS. There was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.",2456854199.0, Journal Article,2020
157,"Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Elderly With Dementia During COVID-19 Pandemic: Definition, Treatment, and Future Directions.","Background Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia, such as anxiety, depression, agitation, and apathy, are complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, and are associated to poor health outcomes and caregiver burden. A steep worsening of such symptoms has been reported during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, their causes, their impact on everyday life, and treatment strategies have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a detailed description of behavioral and psychopathological alterations in subjects with dementia during COVID-19 pandemic and the associated management challenges.
 Methods A PubMed search was performed focusing on studies reporting alterations in behavior and mood and treatment strategies for elderly patients with dementia, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The following search strategy was utilized: (COVID* OR coronavirus OR ""corona vir*"" OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (dementia OR demented OR dement* OR alzheimer* OR ""pick's disease"" OR ""lewy body"" OR ""mild cognitive"" OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI).
 Results Apathy, anxiety and agitation are the most frequently NPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and are mainly triggered by protracted isolation. Most treatment strategies rely on pharmacotherapy; technology is increasingly utilized with mixed results.
 Conclusions NPS of dementia during COVID-19 appear to arise from social restrictions occurring as a consequence of the pandemic. Implementation of caregiver support and the presence of skilled nursing home staff are required to restore social interaction and adjust technological support to the patients' needs.",2456852828.0, Systematic Review,2020
158,A Systematic Review of Home-Setting Psychoeducation Interventions for Behavioral Changes in Dementia: Some Lessons for the COVID-19 Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Assistance.,"Background Impacts of social isolation measures imposed by COVID-19 Pandemic on mental health and quality of life of older adults living with dementia and their caregivers remain unexplored. Studies have shown that psychoeducational and psychosocial interventions can manage behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) and reduce the emotional burden on family members when applied in home-setting scenarios.
 Method a comprehensive systematic review of useful interventions for easing the BPSD burden in patients with dementia (PwD) and their caregivers in the context of COVID-19 quarantine was performed from January 2010 to March 2020.
 Results From a total of 187 articles retrieved from electronic databases (MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane and SCOPUS), 43 studies were eligible for this review. Most of the psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions described were person-centered strategies based on the cognitive-behavioral approach or informational tools to enhance care providers' knowledge of dementia. Most studies achieved successful results in handling BPSD and mood-anxiety symptoms of care providers, contributing to an overall improvement in dyad life quality.
 Conclusion Evidence from the last few years suggest that low-cost techniques, tailored to the dyad well-being, with increasing use of technology through friendly online platforms and application robots, can be an alternative to conventional assistance during COVID-19 Pandemic. Nevertheless, the world's current experience regarding the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its effects on the cognition, behavior, and life quality of PwD will demand research on preventive and protective factors of dementia and the pursue of efficient interventions in different scenarios.",2456852823.0, Systematic Review,2020
159,Mental Health Outcomes in Perinatal Women During the Remission Phase of COVID-19 in China.,"Background Since the middle of March, the COVID-19 outbreak has been well contained in China. The prevention and control measures for the outbreak have been downgraded to a normalized level. However, until now, the change in level of psychological health amongst perinatal women during the remission phase of the COVID-19 outbreak has not been investigated in China. The aim of this current study was to assess the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life (QOL) in perinatal women and to identify potential risk factors associated with these symptoms.
 Methods This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted between March 25th till June 5th, 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was adopted. Women's anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms and QOL was examined through standardized measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for the same.
 Results A total of 625 perinatal women completed the study; of them, 195 women (31.2%, 95%CI=27.56%-34.84%) reported anxiety, 120 (19.2%, 95%CI=16.10%-22.30%) reported depression, and 87 (13.9%, 95%CI=11.20%-16.64%) experienced symptoms of insomnia. Previous adverse experiences during pregnancy was a significant risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.628, 95%CI=1.069-2.480, P=0.023), depression (OR=1.853, 95%CI=1.153-2.977, P=0.011), and insomnia (OR=2.160, 95%CI=1.290-3.616, P=0.003). Participants having infected friends/families/colleagues were more likely to report anxiety (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.245-3.871, P=0.007) and depression (OR=2.666, 95%CI=1.482-4.794, P=0.001). Those women whose regular check-ups were severely interrupted by the COVID-19 were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety (OR=2.935, 95%CI=1.701-5.062, P&lt;0.001) and insomnia (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.098-4.390, P=0.026).
 Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic does affect the mental health and well being of perinatal women. Increased attention should be paid to women who have infected friends/families/colleagues and those with previous adverse experiences during pregnancy. Coping strategies that relieve psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak should be provided to prevent adverse outcomes for women and their infants.",2456852652.0, Journal Article,2020
160,Study Protocol for the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS): A Longitudinal Study of Australian Parents of a Child 0-18 Years.,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health and wellbeing of Australian families. Employment and economic uncertainty, chronic stress, anxiety, and social isolation are likely to have negative impacts on parent mental health, couple and family relationships, as well as child health and development.
 Objective This study aims to: (1) provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the emerging COVID-19 crisis in a close to representative sample of Australian parents and children (0-18 years), (2) identify adults and families most at risk of poor mental health outcomes, and (3) identify factors to target through clinical and public health intervention to reduce risk. Specifically, this study will investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased risk for parents' mental health, lower well-being, loneliness, and alcohol use; parent-parent and parent-child relationships (both verbal and physical); and child and adolescent mental health problems.
 Methods The study aims to recruit a close to representative sample of at least 2,000 adults aged 18 years and over living in Australia who are parents of a child 0-4 years (early childhood, N = 400), 5-12 years (primary school N = 800), and 13-18 years (secondary school, N = 800). The design will be a longitudinal cohort study using an online recruitment methodology. Participants will be invited to complete an online baseline self-report survey (20 min) followed by a series of shorter online surveys (10 min) scheduled every 2 weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., estimated to be 14 surveys over 6 months).
 Results The study will employ post stratification weights to address differences between the final sample and the national population in geographic communities across Australia. Associations will be analyzed using multilevel modeling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the testing period.
 Conclusions This study will provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on parents and children in Australia; identify communities, parents, families, and children most at risk of poor outcomes; and identify potential factors to address in clinical and public health interventions to reduce risk.",2455173041.0, Journal Article,2020
161,Effectiveness of a Brief Psychotherapeutic Intervention for Employees With Psychosomatic and Psychosocial Complaints-Pilot Study of a Consultation Off the Workplace.,"Employees' mental health impairments are a leading reason for sickness-leave and early retirement. This is why a large number of different intervention programmes have evolved in recent years with the aim of counteracting this development. Our study evaluates a short-term cognitive-behavioral psychotherapeutic intervention off the workplace. We investigated improvement of mental and physical health in psychologically strained employees of a white collar company. Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), and perceived stress (PSQ-20) were assessed at the beginning and after the intervention. Patient satisfaction (recommendation - likeliness) was also measured after the intervention. In a second step, we have looked at potential determinants of therapy outcome. Changes in the symptom measures were assessed using t-tests, MANOVA, and Chi²-tests. Cohen's d was computed as effect size measure. One-hundred twenty-seven participants completed the assessment before, and 66 participants post intervention. Mean age of the participants was 44.6 (SD = 9.8) years, 54% were men. 89.7% of the patients attended one to five sessions. Depressive, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and perceived stress significantly declined from baseline to end of intervention. Effect sizes ranged from d = 0.49 (perceived stress) to d = 0.72 (depressive symptoms). Moreover, 93% of the patients stated that they were satisfied with the intervention and would recommend it to a friend. Previous uptake of psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment moderated the effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms, i.e., patients without previous experience showed a stronger reduction in symptoms of depression. The results tentatively suggest that the intervention is effective in reducing a broad range of psychological symptoms. Future research could investigate preferences and different outcomes of on-site and off-site work place interventions.",2454415364.0, Journal Article,2020
162,Heightened Negative Affects Associated With Neurotic Personality in Behavioral Addiction.,"Although studies have demonstrated that negative affects are critical attributes of drug addiction, this has remained less clear in behavioral addiction. In this preliminary study with a relatively small number of samples, we investigated negative affects in patients diagnosed with behavioral addiction, particularly paraphilia and kleptomania. Negative affects were examined using self-rating questionnaire and further evaluated by objective assessments in behavioral addicts and normal subjects. Explicit, self-referential negative affects, such as anxiety, stress, and depression, were higher in behavioral addicts than control subjects. Such self-referential negative affects were, although not entirely, consistent with objective evaluations by others and blood stress hormone concentrations. Further investigation of personality traits in behavioral addicts unveiled that heightened negative affects were associated with stronger neurotic personality in behavioral addicts than normal subjects. These results suggest that behavioral addiction, such as paraphilia and kleptomania, may be characterized by heightened negative affects attributable to stronger neurotic personality.",2454414691.0, Journal Article,2020
163,The Influence of an Attachment-Related Stimulus on Oxytocin Reactivity in Poly-Drug Users Undergoing Maintenance Therapy Compared to Healthy Controls.,"Background Substance use disorders (SUDs) have been described as a dysfunctional way to compensate for deficiencies in that person's underlying attachment system. Furthermore, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), which is a critical component of the neurobiology of the attachment system, has been shown to effectively reduce addictive behavior and therefore has been discussed as a potential medication in SUD treatment. This study investigates variation in peripheral OT plasma levels as a function of exposure to an attachment-related stimulus in SUD patients compared to healthy controls (HCs).
 Methods A total sample of 48 men, 24 inpatients in maintenance treatment who were diagnosed with poly-drug use disorder (PUD) and 24 HC, was investigated. A 15-min exposure to the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) was used as an attachment-related stimulus and coded for attachment status. Blood samples before and after the AAP-assessment were taken and assayed for OT levels. Variation in baselines level of OT was examined in relation to the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), the Adult Attachment-Scale (AAS), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).
 Results Following the AAP stimulus controls showed no significant difference in OT levels elevation from baseline compared to the PUD group's OT levels. Furthermore, in the PUD group only OT-baseline-levels may be negatively associated with the AAS subscale ""Comfort with Closeness"" and ""Anxiety"" and lifetime substance use.
 Discussion Our results suggest that peripheral OT levels in poly-drug users undergoing maintenance treatment are not significantly different in responsiveness to an attachment related stimulus compared to HC. With regard to non-significant tendencies observed in this study which hint toward decreased OT-reactivity in the PUD group, further research is needed to explore this hypothesis with increased statistical power.",2454413566.0, Journal Article,2020
164,Association Between Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome and the Health-Related Quality of Life Among Stroke Survivors.,"Aim Behavioral dysexecutive syndrome (BDES) is one common neuropsychiatric comorbidity after stroke. Despite evidences suggesting the adverse effect of BDES on the survivors' outcome, little is known about the association between BDES and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among stroke survivors and how BDES impacts the HRQoL. This study aimed to address these questions.
 Methods This study included 219 patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong. BDES was defined as a Chinese version of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) score of ≥20 assessed at three months after stroke. The HRQoL was assessed with the Chinese version of the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL) questionnaire encompassing 12 domains. Multivariate linear regression models were employed to examine the association between BDES symptoms and the SSQoL total and domain scores. Structural equation model (SEM) was further constructed to delineate the linking pathways linking BDES and the HRQoL.
 Results The study sample compromised mainly older patients with mild to moderate ischemic stroke. Compared with patients without BDES, those with BDES exhibited poorer performances regarding with the summarized SSQoL (226.2 ± 18.8 vs. 200.3 ± 29.8, p &lt; 0.001) and almost all domains. The BDES symptoms were independently contributed to the whole HRQoL (SSQoL total score) (β = -0.20, p = 0.002), specifically to the domains in personality (β = -0.34, p &lt; 0.001), language (β = -0.22, p = 0.01), and work/productivity (β = -0.32, p &lt; 0.001), after adjusting demographic and clinical characteristics in linear models. The impacts of the BDES symptoms on the HRQoL were mainly explained by the indirect path mediated by depression and anxiety (path coefficient = -0.27, p &lt; 0.05) rather than physical disability, while the resting was elucidated by the path directly linking BDES to the HRQoL (path coefficient = -0.17, p &lt; 0.05).
 Conclusion The present study preliminarily demonstrated a potential association between BDES and a lower level of the HRQoL, predominantly in domains of personality, language, and work/productivityafter acute ischemic stroke. This study also offered insights into the underlying mechanisms linking BDES and the HRQoL, implicating that integrative psychological therapies were urged to achieve better HRQoL after stroke.",2454412771.0, Journal Article,2020
165,"The Psychology of Addictive Smartphone Behavior in Young Adults: Problematic Use, Social Anxiety, and Depressive Stress.","This review enhances the existing literature on relationships between problematic smartphone use (PSU), psychopathology, addictive personality, and online social engagement as regards young adults, giving attention to predictive determinants of addictive behavior in smartphone usage. My article cumulates previous research findings on the psychology of addictive smartphone behavior in terms of problematic use, social anxiety, and depressive stress by focusing on the relationship among mobile social media usage, smartphone addiction risk, mental health issues, and individual well-being. The inspected collected findings prove that depression and social anxiety constitute risk determinants for greater PSU and that particular categories of smartphone applications are positively related to well-being. State anxiety and motivations represent significant predictors of PSU. High PSU affects participation in social engagement. As limitations in the current review, my results point towards relevant avenues of research on social consequences of teenagers' smartphone problematic use. Future directions should clarify whether compulsive smartphone use adversely affects both mental and physical health in the long run.",2454412722.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
166,Psychopathological Burden and Quality of Life in Substance Users During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Italy.,"Background Following the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, a rigid public health strategy of reduced social contact and shelter-in-place has been adopted by the Italian Government to reduce the spread of the virus. In this paper, we aim at evaluating the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relative containment measures, have had on a real-life sample of patients suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs) and/or behavioral addictions.
 Methods An anonymous questionnaire was filled out by 153 addicted patients, both outpatients and residential inpatients, recruited across Italy and highly representative of the current Italian population suffering from addictions. Psychopathological burden (anxiety and depressive symptomatology, somatization, irritability, and post-traumatic symptoms), quality of life, and craving changes in daily habits were assessed.
 Results In our sample, we found moderate rates of depression (22.9%), anxiety (30.1%), irritability (31.6%), and post-traumatic stress (5.4%) symptoms. Psychopathological burden was globally higher among residential patients. Reported levels of craving were generally low.
 Discussion This study is the first attempt to collect Italian data regarding the effects of the rigid quarantine period, during the COVID-19 pandemic, on patients suffering from a SUD and/or behavioral addictions. The presence of a moderate psychopathological burden correlated to poor quality of life and low craving scores represented the main outcomes. Long-term studies, with follow-up after the end of the restrictive measures, should be considered to implement our findings.",2454412329.0, Journal Article,2020
167,Demographic and Clinical Differences Between Bipolar Disorder Patients With and Without Alcohol Use Disorders.,"Background Bipolar disorder (BD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are two major independent causes of psychopathology in the general population. The prevalence of AUD in BD is high. Identifying the clinical and demographic features of patients with BD who may develop AUD could help with early identification and intervention.
 Methods Data from 238 patients diagnosed with BD were gathered on alcohol use, social demographics, longitudinal course of BD, clinical features of the most severe lifetime manic and depressive episodes, comorbid physical diseases, anxiety disorders, and other substance use disorders.
 Results We found that 74 of 238 BD patients had AUD (67 with alcohol dependence and 7 with alcohol abuse). Bivariate logistic regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis found that the best predictors of AUD in patients with BD were being male (OR = 2.086, 95% CI = 1.094-3.979, p = 0.001), younger (OR = 0.965, 95% CI = 0.935-0.996, p = 0.026), and comorbidity with other unclassified substance dependence (OR = 10.817, 95% CI = 1.238-94.550, p = 0.031).
 Conclusions Male, younger current age, and having other substance use disorders were independently associated with AUD.",2454412264.0, Journal Article,2020
168,Identifying the Associated Risk Factors of Sleep Disturbance During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Bangladesh: A Web-Based Survey.,"Background Bangladesh, a developing country with a lower-middle-income and one of the world's most densely populated areas, has been severely affected by COVID-19. This global epidemic is not only affecting the physical health of the patients but also causing severe psychological effects among those who have not yet been infected. Sleep disturbance is one of the key symptoms of major depression and one of the proven risk factors for suicide. The objective of this study is to identify the risk factors associated with sleep disturbance which has developed as a general impact of COVID-19 and new normal life during the lockdown (a measure to control the spread of COVID-19) in Bangladesh.
 Methods Demographic characteristics, COVID-19, and lockdown related information have been collected from 1,128 individuals by conducting a web-based survey. Respondent's perspective regarding sleep disturbance during COVID-19 lockdown is considered as the outcome of interest which is dichotomous. Descriptive statistics methods have been applied to explore the distribution of respondent's demographic characteristics. Pearson's chi-square tests have been performed to relate the sleep disturbance status of the respondents to their demographic, personal, and COVID-19 related information. Furthermore, a multivariable logistic regression model has been adopted to identify the significant association of sleep disturbance with the demographic, COVID-19, and lockdown related information of respondents during the COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh.
 Findings The prevalence of sleep disturbance during the COVID-19 lockdown is found to be higher among participants aged 31-40 years. Gender disparity has also been observed in favor of male participants, whereas no significant regional heterogeneity has been found. Working from home or doing online classes during the lockdown has been found as a potential predictive factor of sleep disturbance. Losing a job has been considered as an adverse economic effect of COVID-19, which also induces sleep disturbance. Perception regarding the risk of getting infected and anxiety triggered the chance of developing sleep disturbance. The sleeping schedule is also found as a risk factor for sleep disturbance.
 Conclusion Evidence-based policies are required to combat psychological challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19, primarily targeting the groups who are largely suffering from sleep disturbance.",2454102192.0, Journal Article,2020
169,"Stress, Anxiety, and Change in Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings Among Adult Twin Pairs.","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of people worldwide since being declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in stress and anxiety, which may increase the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The objective of this study was to examine if stress and anxiety were associated with changes in alcohol use in a sample of adult twins. Twins allowed us to control for genetic and shared environmental factors that would confound the alcohol - mental health relationship. Twins (N = 3,971; 909 same-sex pairs) from the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) completed an online survey examining several health-related behaviors and outcomes and their self-reported changes due to COVID-19. About 14% of the respondents reported an increase in alcohol use. We found an association between both stress and anxiety and increased alcohol use, where twins with higher levels of stress and anxiety were more likely to report an increase in alcohol consumption. The associations were small and confounded by between-family factors and demographic characteristics. However, there was no significant difference in stress or anxiety levels between non-drinkers and those who reported no change in alcohol use. Our findings suggest that individuals' mental health may be associated with changes in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2453683465.0, Journal Article,2020
170,Behavioral and Psychological Effects of Coronavirus Disease-19 Quarantine in Patients With Dementia.,"Background In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and several governments planned a national quarantine in order to control the virus spread. Acute psychological effects of quarantine in frail elderly subjects with special needs, such as patients with dementia, have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess modifications of neuropsychiatric symptoms during quarantine in patients with dementia and their caregivers.
 Methods This is a sub-study of a multicenter nation-wide survey. A structured telephone interview was delivered to family caregivers of patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VD), followed regularly at 87 Italian memory clinics. Variations in behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) were collected after 1 month since quarantine declaration and associations with disease type, severity, gender, and caregiver's stress burden were analyzed.
 Results A total of 4,913 caregivers participated in the survey. Increased BPSD was reported in 59.6% of patients as worsening of preexisting symptoms (51.9%) or as new onset (26%), and requested drug modifications in 27.6% of these cases. Irritability, apathy, agitation, and anxiety were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms and sleep disorder and irritability the most frequent new symptoms. Profile of BPSD varied according to dementia type, disease severity, and patients' gender. Anxiety and depression were associated with a diagnosis of AD (OR 1.35, CI: 1.12-1.62), mild to moderate disease severity and female gender. DLB was significantly associated with a higher risk of worsening hallucinations (OR 5.29, CI 3.66-7.64) and sleep disorder (OR 1.69, CI 1.25-2.29), FTD with wandering (OR 1.62, CI 1.12-2.35), and change of appetite (OR 1.52, CI 1.03-2.25). Stress-related symptoms were experienced by two-thirds of caregivers and were associated with increased patients' neuropsychiatric burden (p&lt;0.0001).
 Conclusion Quarantine induces a rapid increase of BPSD in approximately 60% of patients and stress-related symptoms in two-thirds of caregivers. Health services need to plan a post-pandemic strategy in order to address these emerging needs.",2449954899.0, Journal Article,2020
171,The Association Between Physical and Mental Health and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison of Two Countries With Different Views and Practices.,"Background The physical and mental health of citizens living in a country that encouraged face masks (China) and discouraged face masks (Poland) during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic remained unknown. We conducted a cross-country study to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Poles and Chinese. This study aimed to compare the levels of psychological impact of pandemic and levels of anxiety and depression between China and Poland.
 Methods The survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms, contact history, and precautionary measures. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The chi-squared test was used to analyze the differences in categorical variables between the two populations. Linear regression was used to calculate the bivariate associations between independents variables (e.g., physical symptoms and precautionary measures) and dependent variables (e.g., mental health outcomes).
 Results This study included a total of 2,266 respondents from both countries (1,056 Poles and 1,210 Chinese). There were significantly less Polish respondents who wore face masks (Poles: 35.0%; Chinese: 96.8% p &lt; 0.001). Significantly more Polish respondents reported physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (p &lt; 0.001), recent medical consultation (p &lt; 0.01), recent COVID-19 testing (p &lt; 0.001), and hospitalization (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, Polish respondents had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress (p &lt; 0.001) than Chinese. The mean IES-R scores of Poland and China were above the cut-off for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Besides precautionary measures, unemployment, retirement, physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection, recent medical consultation or COVID-19 testing, and long daily duration of home confinement were risk factors for PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, or stress for Polish respondents.
 Conclusion Use of face masks at the community level may safeguard better physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need of health education with scientific information from Polish health authority on the proper use of face masks and reduce social stigma. This study was limited by the respondent sampling method that had compromised the representativeness of samples.",2449954889.0, Journal Article,2020
172,The UK National Homicide Therapeutic Service: A Retrospective Naturalistic Study Among 929 Bereaved Individuals.,"Homicidal bereavement puts survivors at risk of developing a broad range of lasting and severe mental health problems. Previous research has often relied on relatively small and homogenous samples. Still, little is known about what factors influence the expression of symptoms following homicidal bereavement. Preventive and curative treatments often do not consider the complex coherence between the emotional, judicial, financial, and societal challenges that likely arise following a homicide. Despite the severity of its consequences on mental health, no gold standard for the preventative and curative treatment of mental health issues in homicide survivors exists. We aimed to introduce a time-limited, traumatic grief-focused outreaching model of care designed specifically for homicide survivors, and to examine its potential effectiveness. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate what factors influence the severity of mental health problems and response to treatment. In the current study, self-reported data on five different outcome measures, namely, symptoms of posttraumatic stress, prolonged grief, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were available from 929 homicidally bereaved treatment receiving adults. We used Latent Growth Modeling to analyze our repeated measures data and to classify individuals into distinct groups based on individual response patterns. Results showed that the current model of care is likely to be effective in reducing mental health complaints following homicidal bereavement. Having a history of mental illness, being younger of age and female, and having lost either a child or spouse consistently predicted greater symptom severity and functional impairment at baseline. For change in symptom severity and functional impairment during treatment, having a history of mental illness was the only consistent predictor across all outcomes. This study was limited by its reliance on self-reported data and cross-sectional design without a control group. Future prospective, longitudinal research across different cultures is needed in order to replicate the current findings and enhance generalizability. That notwithstanding, findings provide a first step toward evaluating a novel service-delivery approach for homicide survivors and provide further insight in the development of mental health complaints following bereavement by homicide.",2448403089.0, Journal Article,2020
173,The Mediating Role of Emotion Regulation Within the Relationship Between Neuroticism and Misophonia: A Preliminary Investigation.,"Misophonia is a newly described condition characterized by heightened emotional reactivity (e.g., anger, anxiety, and disgust) to common repetitive sounds (e.g., oral or nasal sounds made by others), accompanied by difficulties responding to these sounds (e.g., intolerance, avoidance, and escape) and associated impairment in functioning. Although research indicates that problematic emotional responses are a key characteristic of misophonia, it is unknown whether individual differences in experiencing and regulating emotional responses influence severity of misophonia symptoms. Examination of individual differences in emotional functioning will help to guide treatment development for misophonia. Accordingly, the present study examined the associations among trait neuroticism, difficulties with emotion regulation, and symptoms of misophonia. For this study, a sample of 49 adults completed the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale, the Misophonia Questionnaire, and the neuroticism subscale of the NEO-Personality inventory. Findings indicated that difficulties with emotion regulation and neuroticism were significantly positively correlated with symptoms of misophonia. Bootstrapped mediation analyses suggested that difficulties controlling impulsive behavior while experiencing intense negative emotions fully mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of misophonia. Results from this study suggest that neuroticism and difficulties with emotion regulation may be important risk factors and treatment targets for adults with misophonia, and difficulties controlling impulsive behavior when distressed may be an important individual difference accounting for the relationship between neuroticism and misophonia.",2448402735.0, Journal Article,2020
174,COVID-19 Epidemic in Argentina: Worsening of Behavioral Symptoms in Elderly Subjects With Dementia Living in the Community.,"In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic. Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. We invited family members to participate in a questionnaire survey. The sample consisted of family caregivers (n = 119) of persons with AD or related dementia living at home. We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care of family members. Items inquired in the survey included type and setting (home or day care center) of rehabilitation services (physical/occupational/cognitive rehabilitation) and change in psychotropic medication and in behavioral symptoms that subjects with dementia experienced before and during the epidemic. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p &lt; 0.01 was considered significant. Results: The sample included older adults with dementia. Mean age: 81.16 (±7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosess were 67% Alzheimer´s dementia and 26% mixed Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. When we compared the frequency of behavioral symptoms within each dementia group category, we found that anxiety, depression, and insomnia were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. We analyzed the type and pattern of use of rehabilitation services before and during the isolation period, and we observed that, as a rule, rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them.",2448402647.0, Journal Article,2020
175,Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated With Childhood Adversities.,"Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). Its pathogenesis, however, is still not fully understood. Potential psychological roots, in particular, have received little attention to date. The present study examined the association of childhood adversities, specific trait characteristics, and MS disease characteristics with fatigue symptoms utilizing path analysis. Five hundred and seventy-one PwMS participated in an online survey. Standardized psychometric tools were applied. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) served to assess childhood adversities. Trait variables were alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale; TAS-26) and early maladaptive schemas (Young Schema Questionnaire; YSQ). Current pathology comprised depression (Beck's Depression Inventory FastScreen; BDI-FS) and anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI-state), as well as physical disability (Patient determined Disease Steps; PDDS). The Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) was the primary outcome variable measuring fatigue. PwMS displayed high levels of fatigue and depression (mean FSMC score: 72; mean BDI-II score: 18). The final path model revealed that CTQ emotional neglect and emotional abuse remained as the only significant childhood adversity variables associated with fatigue. There were differential associations for the trait variables and current pathology: TAS-26, the YSQ domain impaired autonomy and performance, as well as all current pathology measures had direct effects on fatigue symptoms, accounting for 28.2% of the FSMC variance. Bayesian estimation also revealed indirect effects from the two CTQ subscales on FSMC. The final model fitted the data well, also after a cross-validation check and after replacing the FSMC with the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ). This study suggests an association psychological factors on fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis. Childhood adversities, as well as specific trait characteristics, seem to be associated with current pathology and fatigue symptoms. The article discusses potential implications and limitations.",2448402374.0, Journal Article,2020
176,"Prevalence and Correlation of Anxiety, Insomnia and Somatic Symptoms in a Chinese Population During the COVID-19 Epidemic.","Background Anxiety has been a common mental state during the epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is usually closely related to somatization. However, no study on somatization in anxiety and its relationship with insomnia has been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, somatization and insomnia and explore the relationships between different psychological states in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak.
 Methods A total of 1,172 respondents were recruited from 125 cities in mainland China by an online questionnaire survey. All subjects were evaluated with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
 Results The percentages of anxiety, somatization, and insomnia were 33.02%, 7.59%, and 24.66%, respectively. The prevalence of somatization was 19.38% in participants with anxiety. Compared to the anxiety without somatization group, the anxiety with somatization group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a history of physical disease and insomnia, as well as higher GAD-7 scores and SCL-90 somatization subscores (all p &lt; 0.001). The SCL-90 somatization subscores were positively correlated with age, history of physical disease, GAD-7 scores, and ISI scores (all p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression showed that GAD-7 score, ISI score, and age were risk factors for somatization in the anxious population.
 Conclusions Somatic and psychological symptoms were common in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Somatic symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia are closely related, and improving anxiety and sleep quality may help relieve somatic symptoms.",2448402015.0, Journal Article,2020
177,Prevalence of Common Mental Disorders in South Asia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression Analysis.,"South Asian countries report the highest prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) globally. This systematic review and meta-analysis report the pooled prevalence of CMDs among the South Asian countries. Database searches were conducted in eight electronic databases. Titles, abstracts, full-text screening, and extraction of data on the event rate of 17 indicators of CMDs were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 160 studies were included and data analysis was done using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software (v.3). A prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.4% among 173,449 participants, alcohol abuse was 12.9% (n = 107,893); anxiety 25.8% (n = 70,058); tobacco smoking 18.6% (n = 84,965); PTSD 17.2% (n = 42,298); mixed anxiety and depression 28.4% (n = 11,102); suicidal behaviors 6.4% (n = 25,043); misuse of opiates 0.8% (n = 37,304); tobacco chewing 21.0% (n = 10,586); use of cannabis 3% (n = 10,977); GAD 2.9% (n = 70,058); bipolar disorder 0.6% (n = 7,197); IV drug abuse 2.5% (n = 15,049); panic disorder 0.01% (n = 28,087); stimulant use 0.9% (n = 1,414); OCD 1.6% (n = 8,784) and phobic disorders 1.8% (n = 27,754). This study reported a high prevalence of CMDs in South Asian countries; necessitating further research on psychiatric epidemiology in those contexts. It informs the need for effective policymaking and implementation of culturally appropriate multilevel interventions.",2446993767.0, Systematic Review,2020
178,Internet Addiction and Related Psychological Factors Among Children and Adolescents in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic.,"Background The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease presenting a major threat to public health. This study aims to assess Internet use characteristics and objectively examine the potential psychological factors associated with Internet addiction (IA) during the COVID-19 epidemic.
 Methods A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported survey was conducted among Chinese children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old. Participants completed questionnaires containing Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and questions regarding demographic information and Internet use characteristics.
 Results A total of 2050 participants (mean age:12.34 ± 4.67 years old, female: 48.44%) were enrolled. Fifty-five (2.68%) participants met the criterion for addictive Internet use (IAT≥70), while 684 (33.37%) participants were classified as problematic Internet users (69≥IAT≥40). Internet usage had grown during the COVID-19 epidemic, including the frequency and duration of recreational Internet use, and the frequency of stay-up Internet use. A linear regression analysis showed female gender (β=-0.091, p&lt;0.001), age (β=0.066, p=0.001), depression (β=0.257, p&lt;0.001), and stress (β=0.323, p&lt;0.001) were significantly correlated with the IAT total scores (R=0.539, R2 = 0.291, p&lt;0.001).
 Conclusions We observed excessive Internet use among Chinese children and adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19. Age, gender, depression, and stress were the potential key factors affecting IA. Extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during these unprecedented times.",2446993302.0, Journal Article,2020
179,Cognitive Reappraisal and the Association Between Perceived Stress and Anxiety Symptoms in COVID-19 Isolated People.,"The purpose of this study is to examine how the emotion regulation strategy, cognitive reappraisal, affects the association between perceived stress and anxiety symptoms in COVID-19 isolated people. Data for this cross-sectional study come from a community-based online survey of COVID-19 isolated people (N = 328), who are not infected with the 2019-nCoV virus. We applied correlation and moderating effect for data analysis and found that cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety symptoms. These results give us a new perspective on understanding the relationship between anxiety symptoms and perceived stress by clarifying the protective function of cognitive reappraisal. It buffers the induced negative emotion when COVID-19 isolated people perceive overpressure, and thus instigates future research into targeted clinical interventions, which aim to cultivate cognitive reappraisal skills for those isolated people in the face of stressful events or crisis events.",2446992863.0, Journal Article,2020
180,"Antidepressants in Children and Adolescents: Meta-Review of Efficacy, Tolerability and Suicidality in Acute Treatment.","Antidepressants are prescribed for the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, however there is still controversy about whether they should be used in this population. This meta-review aimed to assess the effects of antidepressants for the acute treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (ADs), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), enuresis, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Efficacy was measured as response to treatment (either as mean overall change in symptoms or as a dichotomous outcome) and tolerability was measured as the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. Suicidality was measured as suicidal ideation, behavior (including suicide attempts) and completed suicide. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched (until 31 October 2019) for existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of double-blind randomized controlled trials. The quality of the included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Our meta-review included nine systematic reviews/meta-analyses (2 on ADHD; 1 on AD; 2 on ASD; 1 on enuresis; 1 on MDD, 1 on OCD and 1 on PTSD). In terms of efficacy this review found that, compared to placebo: fluoxetine was more efficacious in the treatment of MDD, fluvoxamine and paroxetine were better in the treatment of AD; fluoxetine and sertraline were more efficacious in the treatment of OCD; bupropion and desipramine improved clinician and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; clomipramine and tianeptine were superior on some of the core symptoms of ASD; and no antidepressant was more efficacious for PTSD and enuresis. With regard to tolerability: imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine were less well tolerated in MDD; no differences were found for any of the antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety disorders (ADs), ADHD, and PTSD; tianeptine and citalopram, but not clomipramine, were less well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD. For suicidal behavior/ideation, venlafaxine (in MDD) and paroxetine (in AD) were associated with a significantly increased risk; by contrast, sertraline (in AD) was associated with a reduced risk. The majority of included systematic reviews/meta-analyses were rated as being of high or moderate in quality by the AMSTAR-2 critical appraisal tool (one and five, respectively). One included study was of low quality and two were of critically low quality. Compared to placebo, selected antidepressants can be efficacious in the acute treatment of some common psychiatric disorders, although statistically significant differences do not always translate into clinically significant results. Little information was available about tolerability of antidepressants in RCTs of OCD and in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and PTSD. There is a paucity of data on suicidal ideation/behavior, but paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidality in the treatment of AD and venlafaxine for MDD. Findings from this review must be considered in light of potential limitations, such as the lack of comparative information about many antidepressants, the short-term outcomes and the quality of the available evidence.",2446992836.0, Systematic Review,2020
181,Psychological and Behavioral Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece.,"Objective Fear of COVID-19 was associated with more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to explore COVID-19-related fear, depressive and anxiety symptoms, social responsibility, and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece.
 Method A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 10 to April 13, 2020. Members of the Greek general population completed anonymously an online survey, distributed through the social media. Among the 3,700 adult respondents, 3,029 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions, questions exploring potential risk factors for increased fear of COVID-19, questions about the employment of safety and checking behaviors, and questions about compliance with public health guidelines. In addition, four psychometric scales were used, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Steele's Social Responsibility Motivation scale. Multivariate General Linear Models (GLM) were used to depict significant differences among dependent variables (FCV-19S, PHQ-9, GAD-7) and independent variables (potential risk factors, safety and checking behaviors, compliance with guidelines). The relationship between the FCV-19S total score and influencing factors was quantified by linear regression analysis.
 Results Several participants reported high levels of COVID-19-related fear (35.7%) and moderate to severe depressive symptoms (22.8%), while a significant proportion reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (77.4%). Women scored altogether significantly higher than men. Respondents under the age of 30 reported less fear and depressive symptoms and showed the least social responsibility. Based on GLM, a significant other's COVID-19 illness, being on psychiatric medication, employment of safety and checking behaviors, and compliance with guidelines were associated with higher COVID-19-related fear. Linear regression analysis revealed that gender, age, depressive, and anxiety symptoms modified levels of COVID-19-related fear.
 Conclusions Greater behavioral responses to the pandemic, that is, excessive employment of safety/checking behaviors and greater compliance with guidelines, were shown to amplify fear, potentially due to increased contamination awareness. In addition, female gender, older age, and more severe anxiety symptoms were related with higher COVID-19-related fear. Describing and weighing carefully the psychosocial and behavioral impact of the pandemic will enable the implementation of both supportive and preventive interventions.",2446667377.0, Journal Article,2020
182,A Novel Treatment of Opioid Cravings With an Effect Size of .73 for Unilateral Transcranial Photobiomodulation Over Sham.,"Background Opioid use disorders (OUDs) are an epidemic causing catastrophic consequences to individuals, families, and society despite treatments including psychotherapy, substitution therapy or receptor blockers, and psychoeducation. We have developed a novel treatment that combines unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) to the hemisphere with a more positive valence by Dual Brain Psychology (DBP).
 Methods We used a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 22 patients with significant opioid cravings and a history of recent or current OUD attended three 1-h weekly sessions. After baseline measures of opioid craving and other psychometrics, subjects received two unilateral t-PBM applications (810 nm CW LED, 250 mW/cm2, 60 J/cm2, 4 min) or a sham (foil-covered LED) at F3 or F4. Prior to any treatment we used two tests to determine which hemisphere was more associated with a negative outlook and cravings and treated that side before the more positive hemisphere. Primary outcome measure was an opioid craving scale (OCS). Secondary outcomes were weekly Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HARS) Rating Scales prior to treatments and at follow-up.
 Results Immediately after treatment the OCS improved significantly for both the sham and active treatments, but one week later the active treatment showed a 51.0% (SD 33.7) decrease in OCS while a week after the sham treatments there was a decrease of only 15.8% (SD 35.0) (by Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test, p = 0.004) and by a mixed model it was p = 0.0071. The effect size for the differences between active and sham was 0.73. For the active treatment from before and after treatment the effect size was 1.51 and for the sham, 0.45. The HDRS improved from a baseline of 15.1 to 8.8 (SD 10.3) a week after the active treatment and to 13.3 (SD 12.9) after the sham (p = 0.0071). HARS improved from 14.7 to 8.0 (SD 13.2) after the active treatments and to 14.3 (SD 16.0) after the sham, p = 0.08. Active treatment of the positive hemisphere after the negative hemisphere significantly improved the OCS, but there was no significant difference after the sham treatment. One patient complained of 2 h of abdominal bloating and dropped out; no other adverse effects were observed.
 Discussion Unilateral t-PBM to the hemisphere with a more positive hemispheric emotional valence was an effective and safe treatment for opioid cravings as well as for depression and anxiety. Our results also lend support to the underlying premises of DBP.",2446666657.0, Journal Article,2020
183,Association of Depression With Functional Mobility in Schizophrenia.,"Background Functional immobility can cause functional disability in patients with schizophrenia and has been linked to prognosis and mortality. Although depression might be a barrier for physical activity engagement, scarce data are present on the relationship between depression and functional mobility (FM) in schizophrenia. Thus, we aimed to investigate the associations among FM, depression, and other clinical correlates in individuals with schizophrenia.
 Methods FM was evaluated by the pedometer-assessed daily steps and Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test in the daily-living and clinical settings, respectively. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Sternberg Working Memory (SWM) Task. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors associated with FM, with adjustment for relevant covariates.
 Results Sixty patients were enrolled in this study. Depression was the most consistent explanatory variable for both pedometer (β = -0.34, p = 0.011) and TUG time (β = 0.32, p = 0.018). Additionally, SWM accuracy (β = -0.29, p = 0.018), BPRS-Withdrawal (β = 0.19, p = 0.139), and fasting blood sugar (β = 0.34, p = 0.008) were associated with TUG time. However, psychotic symptoms and anxiety were not associated with pedometer and TUG.
 Conclusions We identified an association between depression and FM after adjusting for other disorder-related correlates in schizophrenia. Since the intervention goal is functional recovery, improving FM by treating depression may have considerable therapeutic value.",2446665580.0, Journal Article,2020
184,Partial Predictability in Avoidance Acquisition and Expression of Wistar-Kyoto and Sprague-Dawley Rats: Implications for Anxiety Vulnerability in Uncertain Situations.,"Individual differences or vulnerabilities must exist which bias some individuals toward psychopathology while others remain resilient in the face of trauma. Recent work has studied the effects of uncertainty on individuals expressing behavioral inhibition (BI). The current study extended this work with uncertainty to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats which are a behaviorally inhibited inbred strain that models learning vulnerabilities for anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). WKY rats exhibit superior avoidance performance in a signaled bar press avoidance task in which a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) signals a foot shock unconditional stimulus (US) when compared with non-inhibited Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In addition, WKY rats express enhanced eyeblink conditioning. Recent work with behaviorally inhibited humans has indicated that this enhanced eyeblink conditioning is more evident in conditions that insert CS- or US-alone trials into CS-US paired training, resulting in uncertain and suboptimal learning conditions. The current study examined the effects of partial predictability training, in which the CS signaled the US only one-half of the time, on the acquisition and expression of avoidance. Standard training with a fixed 60-s CS which predicted shock on 100% of trials was compared with training in which the CS predicted shock on 50% of trials (partial predictability) using a pseudorandom schedule. As expected, WKY rats acquired avoidance responses faster and to a greater degree than SD rats. Partial predictability of the US essentially reduced SD rats to escape responding. Partial predictability also reduced avoidance in WKY rats; however, adjusting avoidance rates for the number of potential pairings of the CS and US early in training suggested a similar degree of avoidance expression late in the last session of training. Enhanced active avoidance expression, even in uncertain learning conditions, can be interpreted as behaviorally inhibited WKY rats responding to the expectancy of the shock by avoiding, whereas non-inhibited SD rats were responding to the presence of the shock by escaping. Future work should explore how WKY and SD rats as well as behaviorally inhibited humans acquire and extinguish avoidance responses in uncertain learning situations.",2446662191.0, Journal Article,2020
185,Intolerance of Uncertainty and Loneliness in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a psychological burden on people worldwide, including fear and anxiety. Older adults are considered more vulnerable during public health emergency crises. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological response of older adults during the acute phase of the pandemic in Greece.
 Method This cross-sectional study was part of a larger three-day online survey. A total of 103 participants over the age of 60 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions and six psychometric scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (JGLS).
 Results A significant proportion of the participants reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (81.6%), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (84.5%), as well as disrupted sleep (37.9%). Women reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19-related fear, more severe depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Participants living alone showed higher levels of loneliness. Intolerance of uncertainty was shown to modulate levels of loneliness.
 Conclusions During the quarantine, attention was promptly drawn upon the risks related with older people's loneliness. Studies identifying factors that may contribute to loneliness during a public health emergency facilitate the implementation of supportive interventions. Preparedness to address and manage older people's loneliness may limit this deleterious emotional response during the pandemic, as well as at the post-COVID-19 phase.",2446661448.0, Journal Article,2020
186,Data-Driven Discovery of Predictors of Virtual Reality Safety and Sense of Presence for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Pilot Study.,"Virtual reality (VR) offers children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) an inexpensive and motivating medium to learn and practice skills in a personalized, controlled, and safe setting; however, outcomes of VR interventions can vary widely. In particular, there is a need to understand the predictors of VR experience in children with ASD to inform the design of these interventions. To address this gap, a sample of children with ASD (n=35, mean age: 13.0 ± 2.6 years; 10 female) participated in a pilot study involving an immersive VR experience delivered through a head-mounted display. A data-driven approach was used to discover predictors of VR safety and sense of presence among a range of demographic and phenotypic user characteristics. Our results suggest that IQ may be a key predictor of VR sense of presence and that anxiety may modify the association between IQ and sense of presence. In particular, in low-anxiety participants, IQ was linearly related to experienced spatial presence and engagement, whereas, in high-anxiety participants, this association followed a quadratic form. The results of this pilot study, when replicated in larger samples, will inform the design of future studies on VR interventions for children with ASD.",2441604783.0, Journal Article,2020
187,"Current Status, Diagnosis, and Treatment Recommendation for Tic Disorders in China.","Tic disorders (TD) are a group neuropsychiatric disorders with childhood onset characterized by tics, i.e. repetitive, sudden, and involuntary movements or vocalizations; and Tourette syndrome (TS) is the most severe form of TD. Their clinical manifestations are diverse; and are often associated with various psychopathological and/or behavioral comorbidities, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. Individual severity and response to treatment are highly variable, and there are some refractory cases, which are less responsive to conventional TD treatment. TD/TS are also common in the Chinese pediatric population. To help improve the understanding of TD for pediatricians and other health professionals, and to improve its diagnosis and treatment in China, the Chinese Child Neurology Society (CCNS) has developed an Expert Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of TD in China, which is based on our clinical experience and the availability therapeutic avenues. It is focused on clinical diagnosis and evaluation of TD and its comorbidities, psychological and educational intervention, nonpharmacological therapy, pharmacological treatment, including traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, as well as prognosis in children with TD in China. A summary of the current status of TD and up-to-date diagnosis and treatment recommendations for TD in China is presented here.",2441604713.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
188,Prevalence and Psychosocial Correlates of Mental Health Outcomes Among Chinese College Students During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.,"Objectives To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for poor mental health of Chinese university students during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
 Method Chinese nation-wide on-line cross-sectional survey on university students, collected between February 12th and 17th, 2020. Primary outcome was prevalence of clinically-relevant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Secondary outcomes on poor mental health included prevalence of clinically-relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms, while posttraumatic growth was considered as indicator of effective coping reaction.
 Results Of 2,500 invited Chinese university students, 2,038 completed the survey. Prevalence of clinically-relevant PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and post traumatic growth (PTG) was 30.8, 15.5, 23.3, and 66.9% respectively. Older age, knowing people who had been isolated, more ACEs, higher level of anxious attachment, and lower level of resilience all predicted primary outcome (all p &lt; 0.01).
 Conclusions A significant proportion of young adults exhibit clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxious or depressive symptoms, but a larger portion of individuals showed to effectively cope with COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions promoting resilience should be provided, even remotely, to those subjects with specific risk factors to develop poor mental health during COVID-19 or other pandemics with social isolation.",2437845135.0, Journal Article,2020
189,"Effects Of Early Trauma and Recent Stressors on Depression, Anxiety, and Anger.","Background Early life traumatic events and recent stressful events are known to have especially strong effects on emotional wellbeing. However, little is known about the interaction of early and recent stressors on emotions. We aimed to examine the interactive effects of early trauma and recent stressors on depression, anxiety, and anger.
 Methods One hundred and seventy adults were recruited and asked to complete the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-S). Early traumas and recent stressors were assessed during face-to-face interviews. Multiple regression analysis was performed to test whether early trauma, recent stressors, and the interaction of the two would predict CES-D, STAI-S, and STAXI-S scores.
 Results In the multiple regression models, STAI-S scores were predicted only by recent stressors (R2 = 0.063, p = 0.001). In contrast, CES-D and STAXI-S scores were predicted only by the synergistic interaction of early trauma with recent stressors (R2 = 0.075, p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.039, p = 0.01, respectively).
 Conclusions A synergistic interaction effect between early trauma and recent stressful events on current depression and anger was observed, indicating that the combined effects of early trauma and recent stressors are stronger than their individual effects. In contrast, anxiety was affected mainly by recent stressors. Our findings suggest that the form that emotional disturbance takes can vary depending on the timing of stressors.",2437844373.0, Journal Article,2020
190,Suicide Attempts Among French and Brazilian Adolescents Admitted to an Emergency Room. A Comparative Study of Risk and Protective Factors.,"Background Suicide is the second most common cause of preventable mortality among Brazilian and French adolescents. The aim of the current study was to compare the main risk and protective factors associated with a suicide attempt (SA) and to highlight differences based on geographical characteristics.
 Method We compared a Brazilian sample (N = 45) of adolescents admitted to the emergency room of a public hospital in São Paulo for SA to a French sample (N = 320) of adolescents hospitalized for SA across 5 paediatric departments. Then, we ran several multivariate models to examine how each selected variable was related to geographic origin and to the other selected variables linked to geographic origin.
 Results The two samples presented no significant differences regarding gender, age or schooling. Both samples had high rates of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use, disruptive disorders, borderline psychopathology, and lifetime SAs. However, the Brazilian sample presented significantly higher levels of psychopathology and had more insecure attachment relationships (fearful and detached), whereas the French sample had a more secure attachment style. Brazilian adolescents had more recourse to spiritual beliefs and spiritual support, whereas the French adolescents had higher scores on the Reasons for Living Inventory and used more help-seeking strategies from their social network, mainly close friends. Multivariate models showed that two productive coping strategies (seeking spiritual support and social action) and the dependence score were significantly associated with membership in the Brazilian cohort, whereas a secure attachment style and depression severity (evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory) were significantly associated with membership in the French cohort.
 Conclusion Despite presenting similar psychopathologies, Brazilian adolescents presented a more insecure attachment style and used the religious kind of coping more commonly than their French counterparts. We hypothesize that religion may compensate for the social vulnerabilities present in a middle-income country such as Brazil. More transcultural studies may help to elucidate this phenomenon.",2437844329.0, Journal Article,2020
191,Validation of the Impact of Event Scale With Modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19).,"Viral outbreaks can be experienced as disruptive and can be associated with trauma-related stress symptoms. In the current study, we adjusted the Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to assess traumatic stress symptoms related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychometric properties of this Impact of Event Scale with modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19) were investigated by administering the IES-COVID19 to 380 university students who participated during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, upon invitation via e-mail. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-COVID19 was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, χ2 (85) = 147.51, CFI = .92, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .044, SRMR = .049. Cronbach's alpha showed acceptable internal consistency of the total IES-COVID19, α = .75. Pearson's correlations of the IES-COVID19 over time were also sufficient, demonstrating adequate test-retest reliability, r = .62. Significant correlations (ranging between .15 and .50) between the IES-COVID19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, stress-related rumination, as well as negative social interactions, demonstrate adequate convergent validity. Overall, the IES-COVID19 shows to be a valid and reliable measure that can be utilized to investigate trauma-related stress symptoms of intrusion and avoidance related to the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.",2437843873.0, Journal Article,2020
192,The Influences of Impulsivity and Education Levels on Severity of Alcohol Dependence.,"Background Impulsivity contributes to the severity of alcohol use disorder. The association is affected by expectation towards alcohol use, emotional regulation and self-control. Here we investigated the influences of self-reported impulsivity and levels of education on severity of alcohol dependence.
 Method We retrospectively analyzed the basic demographic information, alcohol consumption state, education years, depression and anxiety state, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and Barrett Impulsivity Scales (BIS) from a group of 66 AUD patients.
 Result Impulsivity significantly predicted alcohol dependence severity (R 2 = 0.069, F = 4.724, p = 0.034). In addition, education years served as a moderator in the relationship between impulsivity and alcohol dependence severity (ΔR2 = 0.059, F = 4.414, p = 0.040).
 Conclusion Self-reported impulsivity affects the severity of alcohol dependence, which might be different in patients with different education levels.",2437843853.0, Journal Article,2020
193,Identifying Individuals at High Risk for Permanent Disability From Depression and Anxiety.,"Mental illnesses, among which depression and anxiety are most common, are the leading cause for permanent disability. It is of interest to know what case characteristics determine if a person returns to the work force in spite of mental illness to tailor specific interventions. So far, there has been little research into this field. In the present study a sample of 202 workers who had permanent disability due to depression/anxiety were followed-up on. 22% started some kind of work during follow-up in a period of 30 to 75 months. Logistic regression analyses showed that quick progression into disability, short period of disability, younger age, adequacy of income replacement through insurance benefits and no previous disability predicted return to work. These findings also allow to identify individuals at high risk for progression into permanent disability that can benefit from supporting interventions.",2437843830.0, Journal Article,2020
194,Self-Awareness Deficits of Cognitive Impairment in Individuals With Schizophrenia. Really?,"Objective Misestimation of cognitive functioning has been largely described in individuals with schizophrenia. There is large evidence that correlations between subjectively assessed cognitive functioning and objectively determined cognitive functioning are weak in non clinical individuals and may be more closely related to other psychoaffective or clinical factors than to objective neuropsychological functioning. Surprisingly, no study to date has compared the associations between cognitive complaint and objective measures of cognitive functioning in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The main objective of this study was to 1) compare cognitive complaint between individuals with schizophrenia and non clinical controls, 2) explore the relationships between cognitive complaint and psychoaffective and clinical factors in the clinical group and 3) compare the relationships between subjective awareness of cognitive functioning and objective neuropsychological assessment in individuals with schizophrenia and non-clinical participants.
 Method In this study 30 individuals with schizophrenia and 20 non-clinical matched controls were included. In addition to objective cognitive measures and subjective cognition assessed by the Subjective Scale To Investigate Cognition In Schizophrenia, measures of psychotic symptoms, depression, and anxiety were included.
 Results Schizophrenia patients reported higher cognitive complaints in comparison with controls. In individuals with schizophrenia, cognitive complaint subscores were differently associated with depression, anxiety, and negative symptoms. When depression was controlled for, the same number of correlations between self-rated measures of cognition and objective measures of cognition were found in both groups, but accuracy of self-assessment of cognition was lower in the schizophrenia group.When the schizophrenia group was divided into a high cognitive complaint group (SZ High CC) and a low cognitive complaint group (SZ Low CC), findings indicated that self-assessment of cognition in the SZ high CC was highly accurate (correlations with large effect sizes). By contrast the SZ low CC group severely misjudge their cognition.
 Conclusion A significant proportion of patients with schizophrenia can accurately estimate their cognitive skills. Self-awareness of cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia is an heterogenous phenomenon and misestimation of cognitive functioning might have been overestimated, partly due to secondary psychoaffective factors. Caution is warranted before jumping to the conclusion that all individuals with schizophrenia misjudge their cognitive functioning.",2437843259.0, Journal Article,2020
195,"Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Intervention on Improving Glycaemic, Psychological, and Physiological Outcomes in Adult Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","Background Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high risk of secondary physiological and psychological complications. Some interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been used to control glucose levels and improve negative emotions of patients with DM. This study was undertaken to provide an overview of the effectiveness of CBT-based interventions for improving glycaemic control, psychological, and physiological outcomes in adult patients with DM.
 Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English and Chinese during 2007 and April 2019 were searched through various electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and the Chinese databases (WanFang data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). The primary outcome variables included glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), depression, and anxiety symptoms. The secondary outcomes were weight and cholesterol. Effect sizes were pooled by random-effects modelling using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Physiotherapy Evidence Database tool was used to assess the quality of all included studies.
 Results Twenty-three RCTs comprising 2,619 patients with DM (type 1 and type 2) were included in at least one meta-analysis. The results of the main analysis showed that CBT-based interventions had a better effect on reduced HbA1c (-0.275%, 95% CI: -0.443 to -0.107; p &lt; 0.01) with Hedge's g of 0.466 (95% CI: 0.710 - 0.189), reduced depression symptoms with average reduction of -2.788 (95% CI: -4.450 to -1.207; p &lt; 0.01) and Hedge's g of 0.966 (95% CI: 1.507 - 0.426). Twenty-three RCTs comprising 2,619 patients with DM (type 1 and type 2) were included in this meta-analysis. Several mediators of the effect were found through subgroup analysis for HbA1c and depression symptoms. The interventions emphasising completion homework assignments, stress management, and that used an interpersonal strategy delivered via a group had a better effect on both HbA1c and depression symptoms. In addition, behavioral strategies had a better effect on glycaemic control, and cognitive strategies had a better effect on depression symptoms. There was no difference in the change of FPG, anxiety symptoms, weight, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) between CBT-based interventions and the control conditions.
 Conclusions The findings indicate that CBT-based interventions are effective for improving glycaemic control and depression symptoms in adult patients with type 1 DM (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM) with moderate to large effect size. The results of the subgroup analysis suggest that it is necessary to adopt different types and technical components of CBT according to the population and purpose of the treatment in clinical practice. Due to the high heterogeneity of included studies and other limitations, further study including large number of studies is needed to confirm these results.",2437843146.0, Systematic Review,2020
196,COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown Measures Impact on Mental Health Among the General Population in Italy.,"Background The psychological impact of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and lockdown measures on the Italian population are unknown. The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors.
 Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors.
 Results Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia.
 Conclusion We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population 3 weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings warrant further monitoring on the Italian population's mental health.",2437842691.0, Journal Article,2020
197,Network Analyses of Maternal Pre- and Post-Partum Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety.,"Background Maternal mental health problems often develop prenatally and predict post-partum mental health. However, the circumstances before and following childbirth differ considerably. We currently lack an understanding of dynamic variation in the profiles of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the perinatal period.
 Methods Depressive and anxiety symptoms were self-reported by 980 women at 26-week pregnancy and 3 months post-partum. We used network analysis of depressive and anxiety symptoms to investigate if the symptoms network changed during and after pregnancy. The pre- and post-partum depressive-anxiety symptom networks were assessed for changes in structure, unique symptom-symptom interactions, central and bridging symptoms. We also assessed if central symptoms had stronger predictive effect on offspring's developmental outcomes outcomes at birth and 24, 54, and 72 months old than non-central symptoms. Bridging symptoms between negative and positive mental health were also assessed.
 Results Though the depressive-anxiety network structures were stable during and after pregnancy, the post-partum network was more strongly connected. The central depressive-anxiety symptoms were also different between prenatal and post-partum networks. During pregnancy, central symptoms were mostly related to feeling worthless or useless; after pregnancy, central symptoms were mostly related to feeling overwhelmed or being punished. Central symptoms during pregnancy were associated with poorer developmental outcomes for the child. Anxiety symptoms were strongest bridging symptoms during and after pregnancy. The interactions between negative and positive mental health symptoms were also different during and after pregnancy.
 Conclusions The differences between pre- and post-partum networks suggest that the presentation of maternal mental health problems varies over the peripartum period. This variation is not captured by traditional symptom scale scores. The bridging symptoms also suggest that anxiety symptoms may precede the development of maternal depression. Interventions and public health policies should thus be tailored to specific pre- and post-partum symptom profiles.",2437842675.0, Journal Article,2020
198,The Role of Cathepsins in Memory Functions and the Pathophysiology of Psychiatric Disorders.,"Cathepsins are proteases with functions in cellular homeostasis, lysosomal degradation and autophagy. Their role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases has been extensively studied. It is well established that impairment of proper cathepsin function plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and in recent years a role for cathepsins in mental disorders has emerged given the involvement of cathepsins in memory function, hyperactivity, and in depression- and anxiety-like behavior. Here we review putative cathepsin functions with a special focus on their role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases. Specifically, cathepsins are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly as part of the autophagy machinery of neural strategies underlying acute stress response. Disruption of cathepsin functions can lead to psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disease (MDD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Specifically, cathepsins can be excreted via a process called secretory autophagy. Thereby, they are able to regulate extracellular factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and perlecan c-terminal fragment LG3 providing maintenance of neuronal homeostasis and mediating neuronal plasticity in response to acute stress or trauma. In addition, impairment of proper cathepsin function can result in impaired synaptic transmission by compromised recycling and biogenesis of synaptic vesicles. Taken together, further investigations on cathepsin functions and stress response, neuroplasticity, and synaptic transmission will be of great interest in understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.",2434480495.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
199,Social Anxiety in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders Contribute to Impairments in Social Communication and Social Motivation.,"Background Recognition of symptoms of Social anxiety (SA) may be difficult among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) because of overlap between social anxiety and autistic symptomatology. The main aim of our study was thus to explore the association between symptoms of social anxiety and clinical characteristics of ASD in order to identify individuals experiencing concomitant ASD and social anxiety disorder. We also described the prevalence of SA in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD.
 Method 79 children and adolescents with ASD (with and without intellectual disability) and 28-matched control participants were recruited in two French Expert Centers for ASD, coordinated by the Fundation FondaMental. Psychiatric comorbidities, anxiety disorders and depression were screened with standard tools (Liebowitz social anxiety scale, Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale) and correlated to autistic features and social skills assessed with the social responsiveness scale 2 (SRS-2) and the repetitive behavior scale (RBS-R). We performed bivariate analysis between the social anxiety level and the scores measured with different clinical scales. We then adjusted the observed relationships with the alterations of SRS-2 and RBS-R scores.
 Results After adjustment, the level of social anxiety appeared as significantly associated with alterations in social reciprocity and particularly with the SRS-2 ""social communication"" and ""social motivation"" sub-scores, but not with RBS-R score.
 Conclusions We confirm previous reports showing that individuals with ASD are at high risk for specific anxiety disorders. In particular, high levels of impairments in social motivation and social communication (SRS-2) are indicative of comorbid disorders namely, social anxiety and ASD. Our findings clearly inform diagnostic assessment in ASD and stress the need to take comorbid anxiety disorders into consideration to improve treatment of ASD. To further clarify the impact of social anxiety on social competences and socio-adaptive handicap, longitudinal studies and cluster analysis will be needed in the future.",2434479639.0, Journal Article,2020
200,Association Between Current Physical Activity and Current Perceived Anxiety and Mood in the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Confinement.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.",2434479629.0, Journal Article,2020
201,"Sleep Disturbance and Psychological Profiles of Medical Staff and Non-Medical Staff During the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China.","Objective The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably burdened the healthcare system in the Hubei Province, the most severely affected region in China. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare workers in Hubei.
 Methods A total of 2737 healthcare workers were sampled using a two-dimensional code shared online between Mar 4 and Mar 9, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of three elements: baseline characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome variables were PQSI, anxiety and depression scores of non-medical staff, non-frontline medical staff and frontline medical staff. Binary logistical regression analyses were used to compare between respondents with and without sleep disturbance.
 Results About 61.6% of the respondents reported sleep problems, 22.6% experienced anxiety, and 35% exhibited depressive symptoms. The prevalence of sleep disorders was higher among the frontline healthcare workers compared to the non-frontline and non-medical staff, while anxiety and depression were prevalent in the entire cohort. Logistic regression analysis identified medical occupation, family burden, bereavement, anxiety, and depression as significantly predictive of poor sleep quality.
 Conclusions Frontline medical staff are more vulnerable to sleep disturbances. Psychosocial interventions are needed to help allied healthcare personnel to better respond to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.",2434478010.0, Journal Article,2020
202,Effects of BDNF Signaling on Anxiety-Related Behavior and Spatial Memory of Adolescent Rats in Different Length of Maternal Separation.,"As an adverse form of early-life stress (ELS), maternal separation (MS) can interfere with the development of cognition and behaviors of adolescent rodents. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the regulation of brain development and function, but the molecular mechanisms by which BDNF regulates brain function and behavior in MS with different stressor strengths remain unclear. This descriptive study characterized the levels of BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plasma corticosterone (CORT) from the offspring of rats exposed to early handling (EH, 15-min separation per day) and prolonged MS (PMS, 180-min separation per day), during postnatal days (PND) 1‑21. The behavioral and biochemical analyses were performed during adolescence (PND 42‑56). PMS resulted in reduced weight and decreased locomotor activity in the open field test and Y-maze task compared to control (CON) group, with EH showing an intermediate phenotype. BDNF protein levels in the PFC were lower in PMS compared to EH and further reduced in CON male rats. Plasma CORT levels were higher in PMS compared to CON with EH again showing intermediate levels. Neither PMS or EH affected spatial learning in the Y-maze task. These findings indicate that longer periods of maternal separation are necessary to increase anxiety-like behavior, elevate CORT levels, and further suppress BDNF levels in the PFC, providing a possible mechanism to explain why more severe forms of ELS lead to more significant psychiatric and medical consequences later in life.",2434477971.0, Journal Article,2020
203,Association Between Parental Anxiety and Depression Level and Psychopathological Symptoms in Offspring With 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.,"22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is recognized as one of the strongest genetic risk factors for the development of psychopathology, including dramatically increased prevalence of schizophrenia anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite sharing a homogenous genetic deletion, the psychiatric phenotype in 22q11DS still present significant variability across subjects. The origins of such variability remain largely unclear. Levels of parental psychopathology could significantly contribute to phenotypic variability of offspring psychopathology, through mechanisms of gene x gene (GxG) and gene x environment (GxE) interactions. However, this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested to date in 22q11DS. In the present manuscript, we employed a longitudinal design to investigate bi-directional interactions of parental anxiety and depressive symptoms, estimated with Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory, and offspring level of psychopathology assessed with a combination of parentally reported Child Behavioral Checklist, Youth Self Report Questionnaire, and Structured Clinical Interviews for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS). We tested associations in both typically developing healthy controls (HCs) (N = 88 participants; N = 131 time points) and in individuals with 22q11DS (N = 103 participants; N = 198 time points). We observed that 22q11DS individuals with higher levels of parental anxiety and depression presented significant increases in multiple forms of psychopathology, including higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as estimated both by parental and self-report questionnaires, along with higher negative and generalized symptoms as measured with the SIPS. Associations for positive and disorganized dimensions of the SIPS were not statistically significant. Purely longitudinal analysis pointed to bi-directional interactions of parental and child psychopathology, with marginally stronger longitudinal associations between early parental anxiety-depression and subsequent child psychopathology. Interestingly, associations between psychopathology across generations were significantly stronger in 22q11DS individuals compared to HCs. Our results show that parental levels of anxiety and depression are associated with levels of offspring psychopathology, particularly in individuals with 22q11DS. These findings point to the existence of GxG or GxE mechanisms, that should be investigated in future work. From a clinical perspective, they highlight a strong rational for the management of parental psychological well-being in 22q11DS.",2434477965.0, Journal Article,2020
204,Mental Health Status of Paediatric Medical Workers in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Background A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has occurred in China, and national medical workers have been thrown into this silent battle. Paediatric medical workers have been an important part of this battle and under enormous pressure. This paper evaluates the depression, anxiety, and stress of paediatric medical staff during the epidemic and examines related impact factors.
 Methods We conducted this study using online questionnaires via social networking software during the week of Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, 2020. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), which is a revised, simplified version of the original DASS developed by Lovibond et al., was used in this study.
 Results Among all 2,031 respondents, 14.81%, 18.3%, and 9.98% had depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, respectively. Males, doctors, individuals aged between 31‑60 years, those with senior job titles, those who had contact with patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, those who worked on the clinical frontlines fighting the epidemic and those who had experience combating similar outbreaks were more likely to have depression, anxiety or stress symptoms. Respondents in Beijing and Chongqing had lower negative psychological symptom scores than the national average.
 Conclusion During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression, anxiety and stress are present to varying degrees among paediatric medical workers across the country. Psychological crisis interventions should be implemented to protect the mental health of paediatric medical workers during and after the epidemic.",2434477072.0, Journal Article,2020
205,Suicidal Ideation in Newly-Diagnosed Chinese Cancer Patients.,"Objective Suicide is one of the main reasons cited behind the death rate of cancer, and suicidal ideation (SI) is the first step toward it. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associates of suicidal ideation in newly-diagnosed Chinese cancer patients.
 Methods This multicenter study was conducted from January 2018 to September 2019. Eligible participants were asked to complete a Case Record Form (CRF), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), Fear of Cancer Recurrence Questionnaire (FCRQ-7), and McGill Pain Questionnaire-Visual Analogue Scale (MPQ-VAS). Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted for assessment.
 Results Out of 603 patients, 91 (15.1%, 95%CI: 12.23%-17.96%) reported suicidal ideation in the last 2 weeks. Physical comorbidities (OR=1.808, P=0.039), childhood adversity experience (OR=5.999, P=0.001), cancer pain (OR=1.828, P=0.047), depression (OR=2.811, P=0.013), and anxiety (OR=6.532, P&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. It was also found that patients who regularly exercised were less likely to report suicidal thoughts (OR=0.172, P=0.007).
 Conclusion Physical comorbidities, body ache, and mood disturbances are possible risk factors for suicidal ideation that warrant further attention in clinical practice. Preventive measures, such as systematic screening and arrangement for regular check-ups, could be beneficial to lower the risk of suicide.",2434477069.0, Journal Article,2020
206,"Testing the Bidirectional Associations of Mobile Phone Addiction Behaviors With Mental Distress, Sleep Disturbances, and Sleep Patterns: A One-Year Prospective Study Among Chinese College Students.","Background Mobile phone addiction behaviors (MPAB) are extensively associated with several mental and sleep problems. Only a limited number of bidirectional longitudinal papers have focused on this field. This study aimed to examine the bidirectional associations of MPAB with mental distress, sleep disturbances, and sleep patterns.
 Methods A total of 940 and 902 (response rate: 95.9%) students participated at baseline and one-year follow-up, respectively. Self-reported severity of mobile phone addiction was measured using Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire (MPIQ). Mental distress was evaluated by using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Sleep disturbances were assessed by using Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Sleep patterns were evaluated by using reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ), weekday sleep duration, and weekend sleep duration.
 Results Cross-lagged analyses revealed a higher total score of BDI, SAS, and ISI predicted a greater likelihood of subsequent MPAB, but not vice versa. We found the bidirectional longitudinal relationships between MPAB and the total score of PSQI and ESS. Besides, a higher score of MPIQ at baseline predicts a subsequent lower total score of rMEQ and shorter weekday sleep duration.
 Conclusions The current study expands our understanding of causal relationships of MPAB with mental distress, sleep disturbances, and sleep patterns.",2431819679.0, Journal Article,2020
207,The Neural Correlates of Face-Voice-Integration in Social Anxiety Disorder.,"Faces and voices are very important sources of threat in social anxiety disorder (SAD), a common psychiatric disorder where core elements are fears of social exclusion and negative evaluation. Previous research in social anxiety evidenced increased cerebral responses to negative facial or vocal expressions and also generally increased hemodynamic responses to voices and faces. But it is unclear if also the cerebral process of face-voice-integration is altered in SAD. Applying functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the correlates of the audiovisual integration of dynamic faces and voices in SAD as compared to healthy individuals. In the bilateral midsections of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) increased integration effects in SAD were observed driven by greater activation increases during audiovisual stimulation as compared to auditory stimulation. This effect was accompanied by increased functional connectivity with the visual association cortex and a more anterior position of the individual integration maxima along the STS in SAD. These findings demonstrate that the audiovisual integration of facial and vocal cues in SAD is not only systematically altered with regard to intensity and connectivity but also the individual location of the integration areas within the STS. These combined findings offer a novel perspective on the neuronal representation of social signal processing in individuals suffering from SAD.",2431819112.0, Journal Article,2020
208,"A Survey of Attitudes, Anxiety Status, and Protective Behaviors of the University Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Turkey.","A new coronavirus disease began on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan/China and has caused a global outbreak in only a few months resulting in millions being infected. In conjunction with its' physical side effects, this outbreak also has a tremendous impact on psychology health. This study aims to assess the spread and frequency of protective behaviors, emotional and anxiety status among the Turkish population using a rapid survey during the COVID-19 outbreak. An online questionnaire was administered to 3,040 respondents between the ages of 18-30. This cross-sectional study was conducted from Apr 2 to Apr 8, 2020. While questions related to the outbreak were created by members of our neuroscience department, the Turkish version of the Abbreviated Beck Anxiety Inventory was included in our survey to measure anxiety status. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. We found that 90% of respondents report washing hands more frequently since the outbreak while %50 wear protective gloves. Respondents were more fearful of their relatives catching the coronavirus disease than they were of themselves catching it. In response to the question, ""What are your emotions about the coronavirus?"", 38% responded with ""worried"". There was a significant correlation between anxiety status and consumption information from the media about COVID-19. Individual early protection behaviors might slow transmission of the outbreak. Our results showed that the behavior of the participants has changed in predictable ways during the COVID-19 outbreak. Understanding how emotional responses such as fear and anxiety status vary and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of outbreak control strategies.",2431808731.0, Journal Article,2020
209,Promoting Mental Health and Psychological Thriving in University Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Three Well-Being Interventions.,"This study aimed to address the decline in mental health on U.S. university campuses by examining the effects of three interventions. University students suffer from high levels of anxiety, depression, and suicide. Counseling centers on university campuses are struggling to meet increased demand. The cost to students and universities could be buffered by offering preventative, psychoeducational, and skill-building training programs that promote mental health and psychological thriving. To date, the research literature has not yielded systematically evaluated and recommendable preventative mental health and well-being programs for university students. In a registered, randomized controlled trial, 131 university students were either placed in a non-intervention control group (N = 47) or received training in one of three 30-hour, eight-week semester-long well-being programs: SKY Campus Happiness (""SKY""; N = 29), Foundations of Emotional Intelligence (""EI""; N = 21) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (""MBSR""; N = 34). Compared to the control group and controlling for variance of baseline measurements and multiple comparisons, SKY Campus Happiness showed the greatest impact, benefiting six outcomes: depression, stress, mental health, mindfulness, positive affect and social connectedness. EI benefited one outcome: mindfulness. The MBSR group showed no change. Delivering SKY or EI to university students may be a cost-effective and efficient way to proactively and preventatively address mental health for university students and reduce the financial strain on universities.",2431808625.0, Journal Article,2020
210,Health-Related Quality of Life and Costs of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Adolescents and Young Adults in Germany.,"Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the psychopathological consequences of sexual and/or physical abuse. The economic burden is assumed to be high, whereas health-related quality of life and education is negatively affected. This study aims to determine health care costs, health-related quality of life, and educational interruption in adolescents and young adults with PTSD after sexual and/or physical abuse in Germany.
 Methods This analysis used data of 87 participants aged 14-21 years of a randomized controlled trial. Health care utilization, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), sick leave days, productivity, and delay or failure to achieve educational aims were assessed. Health care costs from a payer perspective were calculated using unit costs for the year 2014.
 Results Mean health care costs for a six-month period were 5,243€ (SE 868€). In particular, costs of inpatient stays in psychiatric hospitals, general hospitals and rehabilitation as well as child welfare institutions were high. In addition, health-related quality of life was lower due to anxiety/depression, resulting in a mean EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score of 0.70 and 61.0, respectively. Furthermore, participants reported on average 27 sick leave days, a productivity loss of 61%, and a delay in education attainment as well as having been unable to achieve educational aims.
 Conclusion PTSD in adolescents and young adults is associated with a high economic burden. Health-related quality of life was substantially reduced. Furthermore, delay and productivity losses in education were observed.

211,Gender Differences in Associated and Predictive Factors of Anxiety and Depression in People With Epilepsy.,"Purpose Comorbid anxiety and depression in people with epilepsy (PWE) are highly prevalent and contribute to low quality of life (QOL) and may even lead to poor outcomes of epilepsy. Among the various factors that affect these negative emotional comorbidities, possible gender differences remain poorly understood and are often neglected. This research aimed to determine whether there are discrepancies in the incidence and influence factors of anxiety and depression between men and women with epilepsy in a hospital in northwest China.
 Methods A total of 158 adult PWE (female: N = 65; 41.1%) completed self-report questionnaires, including the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Chinese version of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) inventory and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI). The comparison between male and female PWE was made by regression analysis.
 Results For the prevalence of anxiety and depression in PWE, no gender difference was found in this study. However, the moderating factors of psychiatric comorbidities were significantly different between men and women: male PWE with comorbid anxiety were more likely to be affected by sleep quality, while anxiety symptoms in female PWE were closely associated with the frequency of seizures. Education years and QOL social function were significant indicators of depression in male PWE but not in female PWE. The important and common predictor for anxiety and depressive symptoms in PWE was QOL energy/fatigue, with male patients being more affected.
 Conclusion For the PWE included in this study, the incidence of comorbid anxiety and depression in PWE was similar for men and women, but the moderating factors affecting comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders differed between genders: male PWE were more likely to be affected by psychosocial factors, while female PWE were more influenced by epilepsy itself. This exploration suggests that gender-specific health care should be considered in epilepsy therapy to improve the psychiatric condition and QOL of PWE, and different treatments should be conducted for male and female PWE to prevent negative emotional comorbidities.",2430669433.0, Journal Article,2020
212,Mental Health of the Participants of the Third Age University Program: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Introduction Population aging is a progressive demographic phenomenon observed in all countries worldwide. The progressive global process of population aging poses many threats, especially in the context of the mental health of the elderly. Third Age Universities are an essential preventive measure shown to improve the quality of life and psychological wellbeing of the elderly.
 Objectives The aim of this study was to analyze the mental status of older persons attending Third Age Universities in Poland, with particular emphasis on sociodemographic sources of variance in psychological indices.
 Methods The study included a group of the Third Age University program participants from Poland. A total of 247 persons were enrolled, among them 215 women and 32 men. The study was carried out as a diagnostic survey, using the following validated psychometric scales: The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and SMAST-G-Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test-Geriatric Version.
 Results The vast majority of the respondents did not screen positively for possible bipolar disorder. However, more than 90% of the participants presented with the symptoms of mild depression, and more than one-third had manifestations of non-psychotic mental morbidity. Nearly half of the respondents had complaints associated with insomnia, and in more than one-fourth, SMAST-G score raised suspicion of problem alcohol drinking. Retired participants were shown to present with significantly higher levels of anger control than the occupationally active respondents. Respondents with poor economic status had significantly higher levels of symptoms for non-psychotic mental disorders. Men significantly more often than women showed symptoms raising suspicion of alcohol-related problems.
 Discussion In conclusion, the study group was characterized primarily by the mild depressive and anxiety symptoms. The mental health of the Polish participants of the Third Age University program was significantly modulated by their socio-occupational and marital status, and financial condition. The study showed that persons with likely problem alcohol drinking differed from other respondents in terms of the occurrence of possible bipolar disorder, depression, and non-psychotic symptoms of mental disorders, state and trait anxiety levels and anger control. There is a need for further research in the field of mental health status in the Third Age Universities seniors to determine the prevalence of these phenomena on a national scale.",2430668799.0, Journal Article,2020
213,"To Increase Mental Health Literacy and Human Rights Among New-Coming, Low-Educated Mothers With Experience of War: A Culturally, Tailor-Made Group Health Promotion Intervention With Participatory Methodology Addressing Indirectly the Children.","Due to the increasing numbers of newcomers with impacts of war, civil war and persecution, at high risk of trauma-related mental health problems, there is a need for increase the poor mental health literacy (MHL) and human rights among the new-comers, especially low-educated mothers with children. This article aimed to present a case study report of several years' experience of tailor-made group health promotion intervention. It describes as an example, a project during autumn 2018 in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between academia, primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women, Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1-7 children, mean age 40 years, low-educated and in average four years' of living in Sweden participated. Under supervision, a local female member of the NGO coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up to ten participants and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social services and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial and parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week, totally 10 h excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per intervention. Each meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break with refreshments, the participants asked questions to the respective moderator. It was a mixed method but emphasis on qualitative design and participatory methodology with co-creation and evaluation of the intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made group intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence, MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that were mapped before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly addressing their children. However, they did not primarily talk about mental illness experience. It is vital that these interventions toward the target group with limited exposure to Western concepts (e.g., illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western and traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the target group's background and their resettlement in a Western reception country. Implications are discussed.",2429780999.0, Journal Article,2020
214,Establishing the Feasibility of Group Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Single-Blind Randomized Pilot Study.,"Background Anxiety and depression are common in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) patients. However, CR programs which incorporate psychological techniques achieve modest reductions in emotional distress. More efficacious interventions that can be easily integrated within services are required. A promising alternative to current psychological interventions is metacognitive therapy (MCT). The aim was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of delivering Group-MCT to CR patients experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
 Method and Results Fifty-two CR patients with elevated anxiety and/or depression were recruited to a single-blind randomized feasibility trial across three UK National Health Service Trusts and randomized to usual CR or usual CR plus six weekly sessions of group-MCT. Acceptability and feasibility of adding group-MCT to CR was based on recruitment rates, withdrawal, and drop-out by the primary end-point of 4 months; number of MCT and CR sessions attended; completion of follow-up questionnaires; and ability of the outcome measures to discriminate between patients. The study was also used to re-estimate the required sample size for a full-scale trial. We also examined the extent by which non-specialists adhered to the Group-MCT protocol. Group-MCT was found to be feasible and acceptable for CR patients with anxiety and depression. Recruitment and retention of participants was high, and attendance rates at CR were similar for both groups.
 Conclusion The results suggest the addition of MCT to CR did not have a negative impact on retention and support a full-scale trial of Group-MCT for cardiac patients.",2427524026.0, Journal Article,2020
215,Chronic Use of Synthetic Cannabinoids Is Associated With Impairment in Working Memory and Mental Flexibility.,"Background We have recently shown that chronic use of Synthetic Cannabinoids (SCs) has been associated with mood disorders and impairments in executive functions. There is also evidence indicating that chronic SC users have higher rates of comorbidity with depression and psychotic symptoms. Here, we investigate performance on executive function and emotional processing tasks in regular SC users and a measure of schizotypal traits.
 Method Thirty chronic SC users, 32 recreational cannabis users, and 32 non-using control participants, without history of mental disorder, or current substance abuse diagnosis (mean age 26 ± 4.27 years; 85 males, 9 females), were tested in addiction treatment centers in Israel. Computerized neurocognitive function tests; the N-back task, Go/No-Go task, Wisconsin Sorting Card-like Task (WSCT), and emotional face recognition task and questionnaires of depression, anxiety and schizotypal traits and symptoms were used.
 Results SC users have performed worse than recreational cannabis users and non-cannabis users on the N-back working-memory task (lower accuracy) and the WSCT cognitive flexibility task. SC users showed greater schizotypal traits and symptoms compared with recreational cannabis users and non-user control participants. A positive association was found in cannabinoid-user groups between schizotypal traits and symptoms and cognitive and emotional processing measures. Finally, SC users have scored higher on depression and state-trait anxiety measures than recreational cannabis users or healthy control participants.
 Conclusions Repeated use of SCs is associated with impairment in executive functions and emotional processing. These alterations are associated with depression and schizotypal traits and symptoms. This adds to existing evidence on the long-term consequences of SC drugs and their risks for mental health.",2426179325.0, Journal Article,2020
216,Tinnitus Among Patients With Anxiety Disorder: A Nationwide Longitudinal Study.,"Objectives The association between tinnitus and anxiety disorder remains debated. We used a retrospective cohort study to investigate the relationship between anxiety disorder and tinnitus, aiming to decipher possible risk factors for tinnitus in patients with anxiety disorder.
 Method Data on a total of 7,525 patients with anxiety disorder and 15,050 patients without (comparison cohort) were extracted from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 in Taiwan. The Kaplan-Meier estimator with the log rank test and the Cox proportional-hazard regression model were used to compare the incidence of tinnitus in both groups and to identify risk factors that predicted tinnitus.
 Results After adjusting for related covariates, the hazard ratio for the development of tinnitus during the follow-up period was 3.54 (95% confidence interval: 3.11-4.02, P &lt; .001) for anxiety disorder cohort relative to comparison cohort. Age ≧ 60 years, female sex, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were statistically significant predictive risk factors of tinnitus in patients with anxiety disorder.
 Conclusion A significant increase in the lifetime incidence of tinnitus was exhibited in patients with anxiety disorder. Elderly subjects, female sex, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were risk factors. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of tinnitus in subjects with anxiety disorder.",2424440157.0, Journal Article,2020
217,Neuroscience of Adolescent Anorexia Nervosa: Implications for Family-Based Treatment (FBT).,"Over the past 20 years significant progress has been made to elucidate some of the neurobiological underpinnings of the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa and their possible implications for treatment. There is increasing evidence supporting the notion that anorexia nervosa shares neurobehavioral patterns with anxiety disorders and involves reward processing aberrations and habit formation. There is consensus for the need of early intervention to ameliorate the effects of starvation on the adolescent brain and the effects of illness duration on neurodevelopment. Family-based treatment (FBT) is the first line evidence-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa achieving sustainable full remission rates of over 40%. FBT has an agnostic treatment approach and its mechanisms of change have until now not been fully understood. To help fill this gap in theoretical understanding, this paper will provide a review of the treatment model of FBT through a neuroscientific lens. It argues that FBT is well designed to address the implications of current key findings of the neuroscience of anorexia nervosa and that it is also well aligned with the current understanding of neuroscience principles underpinning therapeutic change. The paper supports the perspective that FBT utilizes principles of parent facilitated exposure response prevention. It concludes that an integration of a neuroscience perspective to the provision of FBT will assist the clinician in their practice of FBT.",2424440119.0, Journal Article,2020
218,Psychological Support System for Hospital Workers During the Covid-19 Outbreak: Rapid Design and Implementation of the Covid-Psy Hotline.,"Background The worldwide coronavirus outbreak has put hospital workers under extreme stress with possible mental health problems. In this context, we decided to rapidly design and implement a psychological support system for all hospital workers in Paris during the Covid-19 outbreak.
 Methods We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers.
 Results After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support.
 Conclusions This psychological support system can be easily duplicated and seems to benefit all hospital professions that all appeared psychologically affected.",2424439416.0, Journal Article,2020
219,The Impact of Avoidant/Disengagement Coping and Social Support on the Mental Health of Adolescent Victims of Sexual Violence in Eastern Congo.,"Introduction Eastern Congo has been affected by armed conflict for decades while the rampant use of sexual violence has left many women and girls dealing with a wide range of consequences of sexual violence. For adolescent victims the psychosocial impact of sexual violence is devastating. However, the role of avoidant/disengagement coping and family support on the mental health impact of sexual violence remains unclear.
 Methods The study design was a cross-sectional, population-based survey in which 1,305 school-going adolescent girls aged 11 to 23 participated. Mental health symptoms (IES-R and HSCL-37A), family support (MSPSS), avoidant/disengagement (Kidcope), war-related traumatic events (ACEES), experiences of sexual violence, daily stressors, and stigmatization (ACEDSS) were administered through self-report measures. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was carried out with mental health outcomes as dependent variables for different types of sexual violence. Finally, several ANCOVA models were defined to explore possible interaction effects of avoidant/disengagement coping and family support with stigmatization, daily stressors and war-related traumatic exposure.
 Results For girls who did not report sexual violence, avoidant/disengagement coping has a direct negative effect on all psychological symptoms. For victims of sexual violence, when high levels of stigma were reported, avoidant/disengagement coping possibly served as a protective factor, as shown by the interaction effect between avoidance/disengagement coping and stigmatization on mental health outcomes. In victims of sexual violence however, high levels of daily stressors combined with avoidant/disengagement strategies showed a strong increase in posttraumatic stress symptoms. Interestingly, the mental health impact of sexual violence was not mitigated by support by family members. For girls who reported a nonconsensual sexual experience without labelling it as rape and at the same time testified to have a lot of family support, there was a positive association between stressors (daily stressors, stigma, and war-related trauma) and posttraumatic stress symptoms.
 Conclusions These results of this study underwrite to the importance of looking beyond the straightforward negative impact of avoidant/disengagement coping strategies on mental health in adolescent victims of sexual violence. While avoidant/disengagement coping can have a negative impact on psychosocial well-being on adolescent victims of sexual violence, in case of high levels of stigmatization it can as well protect them from posttraumatic stress or anxiety. Furthermore these findings speak to the importance of exploring the diversified relationship between risk and protective factors, such as avoidant/disengagement coping strategies and family support, that shape the mental health impact of sexual violence in adolescent victims.",2423513543.0, Journal Article,2020
220,"Machine Learning for Differential Diagnosis Between Clinical Conditions With Social Difficulty: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Early Psychosis, and Social Anxiety Disorder.","Differential diagnosis in adult cohorts with social difficulty is confounded by comorbid mental health conditions, common etiologies, and shared phenotypes. Identifying shared and discriminating profiles can facilitate intervention and remediation strategies. The objective of the study was to identify salient features of a composite test battery of cognitive and mood measures using a machine learning paradigm in clinical cohorts with social interaction difficulties. We recruited clinical participants who met standardized diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD: n = 62), early psychosis (EP: n = 48), or social anxiety disorder (SAD: N = 83) and compared them with a neurotypical comparison group (TYP: N = 43). Using five machine-learning algorithms and repeated cross-validation, we trained and tested classification models using measures of cognitive and executive function, lower- and higher-order social cognition and mood severity. Performance metrics were the area under the curve (AUC) and Brier Scores. Sixteen features successfully differentiated between the groups. The control versus social impairment cohorts (ASD, EP, SAD) were differentiated by social cognition, visuospatial memory and mood measures. Importantly, a distinct profile cluster drawn from social cognition, visual learning, executive function and mood, distinguished the neurodevelopmental cohort (EP and ASD) from the SAD group. The mean AUC range was between 0.891 and 0.916 for social impairment versus control cohorts and, 0.729 to 0.781 for SAD vs neurodevelopmental cohorts. This is the first study that compares an extensive battery of neuropsychological and self-report measures using a machine learning protocol in clinical and neurodevelopmental cohorts characterized by social impairment. Findings are relevant for diagnostic, intervention and remediation strategies for these groups.",2421461957.0, Journal Article,2020
221,Safety and Tolerability of Both Arm Ischemic Conditioning in Patients With Major Depression: A Proof of Concept Study.,"Purpose A substantial proportion of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) does not respond or cannot tolerate to currently available treatments. This study was to assess the safety and tolerability of Remote Limb Ischemic Preconditioning (RLIPC) as an adjunctive therapy in patients with MDD.
 Patients and Methods Enrolled patients underwent RLIPC, five cycles of simultaneous bilateral arm ischemia, 5 min and followed by reperfusion of each cycle, and once daily for eight consecutive weeks. Depression and anxiety severity, and quality of life were assessed every 2 weeks. Descriptive analysis was used for safety and tolerability data.
 Results Thirty-seven participants completed at least one RLIPC. Twenty-four of them (64.9%) completed the study. Twelve patients prematurely discontinued the study due to poor adherence, and one due to a mild side effect. The changes in HRSD-17, GAD-7 and QOL-6 total scores from baseline to the endpoint were significant from the end of second week treatment onwards. The responder and remission rates were 59.46% (22/37) and 54.05% (20/37) at the endpoint, respectively.
 Conclusion RLIPC was safe and well tolerated, and may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD. Large studies are warranted to test its efficacy and safety as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of MDD.",2420626103.0, Journal Article,2020
222,Employers With Metabolic Syndrome and Increased Depression/Anxiety Severity Profit Most From Structured Exercise Intervention for Work Ability and Quality of Life.,"Background Major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders are associated with less productivity, earlier retirement, and more sick-days at the workplace. These associations also exist for patients with metabolic syndrome. For both, exercise is a generally recommended part of multimodal treatments. However, for individuals with metabolic syndrome, in which depression and anxiety is more prevalent and severe, evidence for the efficacy of exercise interventions is limited.
 Methods Company employees with diagnosed metabolic syndrome (n=314, age: 48 ± 8 yrs) were randomized to a 6-month exercise intervention (150 min per week) or wait-list control. Participants received individual recommendations for exercise activities by personal meetings, telephone, or via a smartphone app. Physical activities were supervised and adapted using activity monitor data transferred to a central database. Work ability (work ability index), depression severity and anxiety severity [hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)], and health-related quality of live [short form 36 (SF-36)] were assessed.
 Results We included 314 subjects from which 287 finished the intervention. Total work ability, depression- and anxiety severity, and the mental component score of the SF-36 improved after 6 months exercise compared to controls. After baseline stratification for normal (HADS scores 0-7) and increased depression- and anxiety scores (HADS scores 8-21) individuals with increased severity scores had similar age, body composition, blood lipids, and cardiorespiratory fitness compared to those with normal scores, but lower total work ability and component sum scores of health-related quality of life. After 6 months total work ability increased in the exercise group compared to controls with the magnitude of the observed increase being significantly greater for subjects with increased depression- and anxiety severity at baseline compared to those with normal severity scores.
 Conclusions A 6-month exercise intervention for company employees with metabolic syndrome showed strongest effects on self-perceived work ability in individuals with mild to severe depression- and anxiety severity. This suggests exercise programs offered to workers with metabolic syndrome not only reduces individual disease risk but may also reduce healthcare and employers costs arising from metabolic syndrome and mental disease conditions.

223,The Impact of Subsyndromal Bipolar Symptoms on Patient's Functionality and Quality of Life.,"Subsyndromal symptoms have rarely been in the focus of bipolar research. This may be, in part, due to the fact that there is neither a uniform definition nor do they constitute an indication of regulatory and commercial interest. Nevertheless, they do have a decisive impact on the long-term course of bipolar disorder (BD), and the degree of functionality and quality of life (QoL) is more likely determined by their presence or absence than by acute episodes. Summarizing the literature an estimated 20-50% of patients suffer inter-episodically or chronically from subsyndromal BD. The most prominent symptoms that interfere with functionality are subsyndromal depression, disturbances of sleep, and perceived cognitive impairment, whereas anxiety negatively impacts on QoL. In the absence of evidence-based pharmacological treatments for subsyndromal BD, clinical practice adopts guidelines designed for treatment-resistant full-blown episodes of BD, supplemented by cognitive-behavioral, family focused or social-rhythm-based psychotherapies.",2418732778.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
224,"Interpersonal Distance During Real-Time Social Interaction: Insights From Subjective Experience, Behavior, and Physiology.","Physical distance is a prominent feature in face-to-face social interactions and allows regulating social encounters. Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety. These results highlight the influence of IPD on experience, physiological response, and behavior during social interaction. The interaction of social anxiety and IPD suggests including the manipulation of IPD in behavioral tests in Virtual Reality as a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.",2418731793.0, Journal Article,2020
225,Effectiveness of Inpatient Psychotherapy for Patients With and Without Migratory Background: Do They Benefit Equally?,"Background Research on the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapy for migrant patients predominantly concludes that they have greater symptom severity at admission and benefit less from psychotherapy. This study aims to compare symptom severity and effects of psychotherapy regarding depression, somatoform disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of patients with and without migratory background (MB).
 Methods Symptom severity of 263 patients (T0, pretreatment) and 256 patients (T1, posttreatment) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire somatization module (PHQ-15), depression module (PHQ-9), and general anxiety disorder module (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). Calculations were made for a completer sample and an intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. To investigate the effectiveness of psychotherapy, we calculated effect sizes (Cohen's d) and clinically significant changes using the reliable change index (RCI).
 Results Patients with MB showed significantly higher symptom burden at admission for somatization (p = 0.025, d = 0.345) and posttraumatic symptoms (p = 0.008, d = 0.424) than patients without MB. At discharge, patients with MB reported significantly higher severity regarding all assessed symptoms (somatization: p = 0.001, d = 0.507; depression: p = 0.045, d = 0.313; anxiety: p = 0.012, d = 0.428; traumatization: p = 0.040, d = 0.329) compared with non-migrant patients. Patients without MB improved significantly regarding all assessed symptoms (somatization: p &lt; 0.001, d = -0.304; depression: p &lt; 0.001, d = -0.692; anxiety: p &lt; 0.001, d = -0.605; posttraumatic symptoms: p &lt; 0.001, d = -0.204). Patients with MB improved significantly concerning depression (p &lt; 0.001, d = -0.649) and anxiety (p = 0.002, d = -0.441). Occurrence of comorbidity was high (87.1% had more than one psychiatric diagnosis). Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (F4) and personality disorders (F6) were more frequent among patients with MB.
 Conclusions Patients with MB showed higher symptom severity at admission. Our study demonstrated a significant reduction of depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with MB receiving psychotherapy. Further research is needed to identify interventions that effectively improve somatization and posttraumatic stress for patients with MB, since these symptoms were not significantly reduced.",2418731473.0, Journal Article,2020
226,The Role of Learning Support and Chat-Sessions in Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents With Anxiety: A Factorial Design Study.,"Background Increased awareness of anxiety in adolescents emphasises the need for effective interventions. Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) could be a resource-effective and evidence-based treatment option, but little is known about how to optimize ICBT or which factors boost outcomes. Recently, the role of knowledge in psychotherapy has received increased focus. Further, chat-sessions are of interest when trying to optimize ICBT for youths. This study aimed to evaluate the role of learning support and chat-sessions during ICBT for adolescent anxiety, using a factorial design.
 Method A total of 120 adolescents were randomised to one of four treatment groups, in a 2x2 design with two factors: with or without learning support and/or chat-sessions.
 Results Anxiety and depressive symptoms were reduced (Beck Anxiety Inventory- BAI; Cohen's d =0.72; Beck Depression Inventory- BDI; d =0.97). There was a main effect of learning support on BAI (d =0.38), and learning support increased knowledge gain (d =0.42). There were no main effects or interactions related to the chat-sessions. Treatment effects were maintained at 6-months, but the added effect of learning support had by then vanished.
 Conclusion ICBT can be an effective alternative when treating adolescents with anxiety. Learning support could be of importance to enhance short-term treatment effects, and should be investigated further.",2418124072.0, Journal Article,2020
227,Reducing Allostatic Load in Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Physical Activity and Yoga Practice as Add-On Therapies.,"The allostatic load (AL) index constitutes a useful tool to objectively assess the biological aspects of chronic stress in clinical practice. AL index has been positively correlated with cumulative chronic stress (physical and psychosocial stressors) and with a high risk to develop pathological conditions (e.g., metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular pathology, inflammatory disorders) and the so-called stress-related psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders. Chronic stress has negative effects on brain neuroplasticity, especially on hippocampal neurogenesis and these effects may be reversed by antidepressant treatments. Several evidences indicate that non-pharmacological interventions based on physical activity and yoga practice may add synergizing benefits to classical treatments (antidepressant and benzodiazepines) for depression and anxiety, reducing the negative effects of chronic stress. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on AL and chronic stress in relation to depression and anxiety, physical activity and yoga practice.",2417407636.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
228,"Panic Disorder as Unthinkable Emotions: Alexithymia in Panic Disorder, a Croatian Cross-Sectional Study.","Objectives Previous research on alexithymia has led to controversy over its prevalence in panic disorder. The aim of this study was to assess the difference in the prevalence of alexithymia in panic disorder and other anxiety disorders.
 Design and Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on a sample of 71 patients diagnosed with panic disorder and 113 patients diagnosed with other anxiety disorders; both groups were 18-50 years old. Primary outcome was the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) score. Secondary outcome was the prevalence of alexithymia defined as a TAS score ≥61.
 Results Patients diagnosed with panic disorder had a 25% higher score on the TAS subscale of difficulty identifying feelings than patients diagnosed with other anxiety disorders. The prevalence of alexithymia was 27% in patients with panic disorder and 13% in patients with other anxiety disorders. Patients diagnosed with panic disorder had significantly higher odds for alexithymia.
 Conclusions The results of our study support the hypothesis of higher prevalence of alexithymia in individuals with panic disorder than in individuals with other anxiety disorders. In addition, difficulty identifying feelings as a salient feature of alexithymia is higher in panic disorder than in other anxiety disorders.",2417388076.0, Journal Article,2020
229,Empathic Accuracy in Clinical Populations.,"Empathy, broadly defined as the ability to understand the other and to share others' emotions, motivates prosocial behavior and underlies successful interpersonal relations. Dysfunctions in this ability may cause fundamental difficulties in social communication. Empathy has been measured in various ways, from self-report questionnaires to laboratory objective performance tests. Empathic accuracy (EA), i.e., the ability to accurately empathize, is measured using more complex and ecological paradigms, such as asking participants to infer filmed interactions, or having people narrate personal emotional stories then assessing the correspondence between the perceiver and the target of empathy as the criteria for empathic ability. This measure is particularly useful in the study of clinical populations, where deconstructing the multifaceted concept of empathy may contribute to a more complete understanding of specific clinical profiles. This paper presents a scoping review of the literature on EA in clinical populations, and on EA and clinical traits and states in nonclinical or high-risk populations. Following an exhaustive literature search, 34 studies were found eligible to be included in this review. The largest category was studies focused on EA in people with schizophrenia (31%; 11 papers), followed by studies focused on EA in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and autistic traits in a nonclinical population (22%; 8 papers). Studies were also found on EA and depression tendencies, psychopathy, social anxiety, behavior disorders, and personality disorders, and a few other clinical conditions. The included studies varied on research aims, designs, sample sizes, and male:female ratios. The overall synthesized results suggest that EA is reduced in schizophrenia and ASD. In other clinical populations, the number of studies was very limited. We urge researchers to further examine EA in these less-studied populations. The review reveals a general underrepresentation of female participants in studies on EA in clinical populations. We suggest that future research address understudied clinical populations, such as those diagnosed with psychopathy. Subject, target, and situational variables should also be considered, with special attention to gender differences (and similarities), the association between EA abilities and adaptive functioning, and the study of individuals with clinical conditions as targets, not just observers, in EA tasks.",2417386214.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
230,The Impact of Quarantine and Physical Distancing Following COVID-19 on Mental Health: Study Protocol of a Multicentric Italian Population Trial.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment measures-mainly physical distancing and isolation-are having detrimental consequences on the mental health of the general population worldwide. In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is completely different from Eastern countries. Therefore, there is the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The ""COVID-IT-mental health trial"" is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1-COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2-COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3-COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first- and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4-COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic. It is necessary to have a clear picture of the impact that this new stressor will have on mental health and well-being in order to develop and disseminate appropriate interventions for the general population and for the other at-risk groups.",2417386033.0, Journal Article,2020
231,Predictors of Asylum Seekers' Health Care Utilization in the Early Phase of Resettlement.,"Background Asylum seekers display high prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder due to pre-, peri-, and post-migration stressors. In contrast to the high mental health burden, health care utilization among asylum seekers in the early phase of resettlement is low. However, the early stages after migration are a particularly vulnerable phase in which psychosocial support measures are needed to prevent mental disorders from becoming chronic.
 Objective To identify predictors of asylum seekers' health care utilization in the early stages of resettlement.
 Methods Using hierarchical logistic regression analysis, the variance explanation of the (1) general utilization of health care services as well as the individual utilization of (2) outpatient psychiatrists, (3) counselling centers, and (4) general practitioners was analyzed in n = 65 asylum seekers. A structured interview on health care utilization took place between three to five months after assessment of possible predictors. We defined the following three groups of predictors a) the sociodemographic variables gender, age, number of children, religion, language proficiency, b) the psychological variables sense of coherence and emotion regulation as well as c) the asylum seekers' psychiatric diagnoses.
 Results Individual sociodemographic factors, such as gender, age, and number of children as well as the emotion regulation strategy of expressive suppression and sense of coherence were shown to be predictive for the utilization of health care services among asylum seekers.
 Conclusions Low-threshold, culture-sensitive treatment offers for asylum seekers should be established in the early phase after migration. General practitioners should be a central hub for further referrals to disorder-specific treatments.",2417384915.0, Journal Article,2020
232,Effect of Jian-Pi-Zhi-Dong Decoction on the Amino Acid Neurotransmitters in a Rat Model of Tourette Syndrome and Comorbid Anxiety Disorder.,"Amino acid neurotransmitters have been shown to correlate with Tourette syndrome (TS) and its comorbidities. In this study, we investigated the effects of Jian-Pi-Zhi-Dong Decoction (JPZDD), a formula containing 10 different Chinese medical herbs, on amino acid neurotransmitters in rats. We established a rat model of Tourette syndrome and comorbid anxiety with an iminodipropionitrile injection plus uncertain empty water bottle stimulation for 3 weeks. Then the rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group and model group were gavaged with saline, while the remaining two treatment groups were gavaged with fluoxetine hydrochloride or JPZDD for four consecutive weeks. We recorded the behaviors of the rats with TS and comorbid anxiety by stereotypy recording, open field test, and elevated plus maze. We observed mitochondrial changes with transmission electron microscopy. We measured the content of glutamate (GLU) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) both in the serum and striatum and the expression of their receptors by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The study revealed that JPZDD was effective in alleviating the behavioral symptoms of both tic and anxiety in the rat model groups. These results might be associated with the increase in GABA levels and decrease in GLU levels in the serum, as well as an increase in striatal GABA level by the activation of GABA receptors Type A (GABAAR). JPZDD treatment also reversed the mitochondrial dysfunction both in the striatum and cortex in affected animals.",2417384890.0, Journal Article,2020
233,Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, has led to the quarantine of many residents in their homes, in order to mitigate its spread. Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province.
 Materials and Methods The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study.
 Results A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states. There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety.
 Conclusion The present study implies that universities need to take measures to prevent, identify, and deal with mental health problems among students during large-scale stressors.",2416945897.0, Journal Article,2020
234,Self-Harming and Sense of Agency in Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder.,"Self-harm is considered a pervasive problem in several psychopathologies, and especially in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Self-harming behaviors may be enacted for many purposes for example to regulate emotions and to reduce dissociation. BPD patients often report dissociative episodes, which may be related to an altered body awareness, and in particular to an altered awareness of the sense of agency. The sense of agency draws in part upon perceptions of being in control of our bodies and our physical movements, of being able to act upon environments. In this study, we aim to investigate whether dissociative experiences of BPD patients may be linked to an altered sense of agency and whether self-injurious actions may, through strong sensorial stimulation, constitute a coping strategy for the reduction of the distress associated with these dissociative experiences. A group of 20 BPD patients, of whom 9 presented self-harming behaviors, took part in the study and were compared with an age-matched control group of 20 healthy individuals. Sense of agency was evaluated through the Sensory Attenuation paradigm. In this paradigm, in a comparison with externally generated sensations, the degree to which perceived intensity of self-generated sensations is reduced is considered an implicit measure of sense of agency. As we expected, we found a significant difference in the perceptions of the two groups. The attenuation effect appeared to be absent in the BPD group while it was present in the control group. However, further analysis revealed that those BPD patients who engaged in self-harming behaviors presented a degree of attenuation which was similar to that of the control group. These results confirm the hypothesis that self-injurious actions constitute a coping strategy for increasing the sense of agency. We finally discuss the correlation of these experimental results with some clinical self-evaluation measures assessing dissociation, anxiety, depression, and affective dysregulation.",2414412612.0, Journal Article,2020
235,Adolescents' Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire: Initial Validation and Prospective Associations With Nonsuicidal Self-Injury and Other Mental Health Problems in Adolescence and Young Adulthood in a Swedish Youth Cohort.,"Although there is extensive research indicating the vital role of functional emotion regulation (ER) in healthy psychological development, such research has neglected examination of adolescents. One potential reason for this neglect is the lack of valid ER instruments developed specifically for adolescents. Further, the available ER instruments for adolescents usually require elaborate forms of cognitive reasoning about the internal sequences of cognitions and emotions. To address these limitations, we developed the Adolescents' Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire (AERSQ), a self-report instrument of adolescents' commonly used ER strategies in daily life and examined its psychometric characteristics in a 10-year, three-wave cohort of Swedish youths (original N = 991, mean age = 13.7, 14.8, and 25.3 at waves 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Exploratory (wave 1 data) and confirmatory (wave 2 data) factor analyses revealed a five-factor structure for the AERSQ: rumination/negative thinking, positive reorientation, communication, distraction, and cultural activities. We observed gender differences for most ER strategies in adolescence. We also evaluated the associations between the AERSQ subscales and mental health (self-harm; psychological difficulties including hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, and peer problems; prosocial behavior; depression; anxiety; stress; flourishing; and life satisfaction) across the three time points. Rumination/negative thinking had the strongest relationships with these mental health indicators, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, in both genders. Distraction and cultural activities were less related to mental health, especially prospectively. Although the AERSQ showed good test-retest reliability and predictive validity over a 10-year period, the low internal consistency of two of its subscales (distraction and cultural activities) indicates that it may benefit from further development both in terms of the included items and psychometric testing.",2414411081.0, Journal Article,2020
236,Reducing Risky Alcohol Use via Smartphone App Skills Training Among Adult Internet Help-Seekers: A Randomized Pilot Trial.,"Alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for global disease burden and overconsumption leads to a wide variety of negative consequences in everyday life. Digital interventions have shown small positive effects in contributing to reductions in problematic use. Specific research on smartphone apps is sparse and the few studies published indicate effects ranging from negative or null to small or moderate. TeleCoach™, a web-based skills training smartphone app, has shown positive effects in non-treatment-seeking university students with excessive drinking. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate app effects in a sample of internet help-seekers from the general population in Sweden. A total of 89 participants were recruited via online advertisement. Following baseline assessment for hazardous use, they were randomized to TeleCoach or a web-based control app offering brief information and advice regarding problematic alcohol use. The primary outcome was number of standard drinks per week; secondary outcomes included drinking quantity and frequency, binge drinking and blood alcohol count measures as well as app user data and comorbidity related to depression, anxiety, and drug use. Analysis of baseline and 6-week follow-up outcomes showed significant within-group effects on alcohol consumption but no significant between-group differences. Effect sizes for the within-group changes in the primary outcome over time were significant [F(1, 55)=43.98; p &lt; 0.001], with a Cohen's d of 1.37 for the intervention group and 0.92 for the control group. This difference in effect sizes indicated that continuation of the study as a large randomized, controlled trial with up to 1,000 participants could be worthwhile.

We used a randomized controlled trial design with thirty healthy young adults assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of pranayama practices. Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols were used both at baseline and post-intervention: an emotion task as well as a resting-state acquisition. Our results suggest that pranayama significantly decreased states of anxiety and negative affect. The practice of pranayama also modulated the activity of brain regions involved in emotional processing, particularly the amygdala, anterior cingulate, anterior insula, and prefrontal cortex. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) showed significantly reduced functional connectivity involving the anterior insula and lateral portions of the prefrontal cortex. Correlation analysis revealed that changes in connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right anterior insula were associated with changes in anxiety. Although it should be noted that these analyses were preliminary and exploratory, it provides the first evidence that 4 weeks of B. pranayama significantly reduce the levels of anxiety and negative affect, and that these changes are associated with the modulation of activity and connectivity in brain areas involved in emotion processing, attention, and awareness.

239,Barriers to Professional Mental Health Help-Seeking Among Chinese Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Background A large number of Chinese suffer from common mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder), but treatment seeking is typically low in this population. It is unclear what barriers influence professional mental health help-seeking behavior within the Chinese population. Identifying these barriers could assist in implementation science efforts to reach this population.
 Objective This review systematically synthesizes findings related to the barriers to professional mental health help-seeking among Chinese adults.
 Methods Two English language databases (PubMed and PsycINFO) and two Chinese databases (WANFANGDATA and CNKI) were searched to find relevant studies. Quality assessment was conducted in identified studies. Quantitative findings were tabulated and frequently reported barriers were ranked. Primary data obtained from qualitative studies were thematically analyzed.
 Results Of 6,933 citations identified, 17 met inclusion criteria. There were 11 (64%) studies that reported quantitative methods; 3 (18%) employed qualitative research, and 3 (18%) mixed methods. Results indicated that frequently reported barriers to mental health help seeking among Chinese adults included a preference on self-reliance, seeking help from alternative sources, low perceived need toward help-seeking, a lack of affordability, negative attitude toward, or poor experiences with help-seeking. Less frequently mentioned barriers included stigma, families' opposition, limited knowledge about mental illness, a lack of accessibility, unwillingness to disclose mental illness, and fear of burdening family.
 Conclusions The current review identified a number of key barriers to help-seeking behavior. Effective strategies are needed to promote professional help-seeking among Chinese adults. Additional factors influencing professional mental health help-seeking need to be further investigated, as they may contribute to a better understanding the help-seeking behavior among Chinese.",2410711594.0, Systematic Review,2020
240,Comparisons Between Successful Versus Unsuccessful Switches From Benzodiazepines or Zolpidem (Z-Drug) to Controlled-Release Melatonin in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder and Insomnia.,"Objectives Chronic use of benzodiazepines and zolpidem (BDZ/Z-drugs) leads to dependency, cognitive impairment, and falls. Although controlled-release melatonin (Melatonin CR) may be an alternative, a switch in clinical settings has proven difficult. We investigated the factors associated with successful switch to Melatonin CR in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia.
 Methods This retrospective observational study involved 170 patients diagnosed with MDD and insomnia, and aged older than 55 years, who were treated with BDZ/Z-drug for at least the past 90 days and never before exposed to Melatonin CR. All patients were treated with a standard antidepressant therapy and Melatonin CR for their insomnia. A successful switch was defined as three or more consecutive prescriptions of Melatonin CR separated by at least one-month interval, after discontinuation of the BDZ/Z-drug.
 Results Seventy-nine patients (46.5%) who switched successfully showed no significant differences in sex, age, education, and occupational status compared with the unsuccessful group. The types of antidepressants used or BDZ/Z-drug treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. Fewer somatic symptoms were observed in the successful group. In the multivariate analysis, the successful group showed significantly less somatic anxiety, shorter duration from first BDZ/Z-drug use to the first antidepressant use, and shorter total duration of BDZ/Z-drug therapy.
 Conclusions A successful switch from BDZ/Z-drug to Melatonin CR was associated with less baseline somatic anxiety, earlier use of antidepressants, and shorter total duration of BDZ/Z-drug use, but was less strongly associated with the type of antidepressants in MDD patients with insomnia.",2410711073.0, Journal Article,2020
241,Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety Disorders: The Role of the HPA Axis.,"Stress in general, and early life stress in particular, has been associated with the development of anxiety and mood disorders. The molecular, biological and psychological links between stress exposure and the pathogenesis of anxiety and mood disorders have been extensively studied, resulting in the search of novel psychopharmacological strategies aimed at targets of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis has been observed in certain subgroups of patients with anxiety and mood disorders. In addition, the effects of different anti-anxiety agents on various components of the HPA axis has been investigated, including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). For example, benzodiazepines, including clonazepam and alprazolam, have been demonstrated to reduce the activity of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the hypothalamus. TCAs and SSRIs are also effective anti-anxiety agents and these may act, in part, by modulating the HPA axis. In this regard, the SSRI escitalopram inhibits CRF release in the central nucleus of the amygdala, while increasing glucocorticoid receptor (GRs) density in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. The molecular effects of these anti-anxiety agents in the regulation of the HPA axis, taken together with their clinical efficacy, may provide further understanding about the role of the HPA axis in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",2410356204.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
242,The Role of Stress and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Haplotypes in the Development of Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety During Adolescence.,"Adolescence is a critical developmental period characterized by heightened levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Experiencing chronic or environmental stress, for example, as a result of traumatic events or insensitive parenting, increases the risk for depression and anxiety. However, not all adolescents develop depressive or anxiety symptoms following environmental stressors, due to differences in stress resilience. One of the factors involved in stress resilience is enhanced functionality of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), one of the two brain receptors for the stress hormone cortisol. High levels of MR functionality result in relatively lower rates of depression, particularly in women that experienced stress. However, much less is known about MR functionality in relation to the development of adolescent depression and to other internalizing behavior problems such as anxiety. We therefore examined whether the effects of a functional MR haplotype (i.e., the MR CA haplotype) on the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms are sex-dependent, as well as interact with environmental stressors. In a community sample of adolescents (N = 343, 9 waves between age 13 and 24), environmental stressors were operationalized as parental psychological control and childhood trauma. Results showed a sex-dependent effect of MR CA haplotype on the development of depressive symptoms but not for anxiety symptoms. MR CA haplotypes were protective for girls but not for boys. This study sheds more light on the sex-dependent effects of MR functionality related to the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms during adolescence.",2410352443.0, Journal Article,2020
243,Personality Traits and Psychotic Proneness Among Chronic Synthetic Cannabinoid Users.,"Objective Chronic use of synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) has been associated with a wide range of negative consequences for health including psychotic and affective disturbances. Accumulating evidence indicates that cannabinoids use may be a risk factor for schizophrenia, and chronic natural cannabis users score higher than non-users on measures of schizotypal personality traits. However, little is known regarding the personality characteristics of SC users, especially in comparison with recreational cannabis users and healthy individuals. This study aimed to examine the differences in personality characteristics and schizotypy between SC users, regular cannabis users, and non-users and to compare these measures between groups.
 Methods Forty-two chronic SC users, 39 natural cannabis users, and 47 non-using control participants, without history of mental disorder, or current substance use diagnosis (mean age 26± 4.47 years; 23 females, 105 males), completed the Big-Five Factor Inventory (BFI), the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (SPQ-B), substance use history, rating scales of depression and anxiety, and a demographic questionnaire.
 Results On the BFI, SC users scored higher than natural cannabis users and non-users on neuroticism, but lower on agreeableness and extraversion, and endorsed greater schizotypal symptoms on the SPQ-B. In addition, SC users had lower scores on conscientiousness than non-users, and natural cannabis users were more extroverted than non-users. Higher openness and lower conscientiousness predicted schizotypy for both SC and natural cannabis users. Finally, greater neuroticism predicted schizotypy for natural cannabis users, and introversion predicted schizotypy for non-users.
 Conclusions These results show that chronic SC users differ from natural cannabis users and non-users on dimensions of specific personality traits and schizotypy that may indicate psychotic proneness.",2408541472.0, Journal Article,2020
244,Association Between Sub-types of Sibling Bullying and Mental Health Distress Among Chinese Children and Adolescents.,"Sibling bullying is a common phenomenon in childhood and adolescence worldwide and has a significant association with mental health distress. However, there have been few studies that have examined the associations between any specific sub-type of sibling bullying and depression as well as anxiety. Besides, the association between sibling bullying and psychological well-being was never explored among the Chinese population. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the associations between the number of sub-types of sibling bullying involvement and depression as well as anxiety among Chinese children and adolescents. Multi-stage stratified cluster sampling was used to recruit 5,926 participants aged 10 to 18 who had at least one sibling living in the household. Different sub-types of sibling bullying involvement were determined by using Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ). The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to screen clinical ranges of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Of the participants, 1,235 (20.8%) were bullied by siblings, and 1,230 (20.8%) perpetrated bullying behavior against siblings over the past 6 months. After controlling potential confounders, adjusted model of logistic regression analyses indicated that all three sub-types of sibling victimization and perpetration were significantly associated with both depression and anxiety. There were linear associations between the number of sub-types of sibling bullying victimization and depression (adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.68) as well as anxiety (adjusted OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.90). Besides, linear trends were found between the number of sub-types of sibling bullying perpetration and depression (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.64) as well as anxiety (adjusted OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.87). The findings underline dose-response relationships between the number of sub-types of sibling bullying involvement and mental health distress. Intervention programs should be conducted to focus on developing mental health status of those children and adolescents who are involved in multiple sub-types of sibling victimization or perpetration.",2408540900.0, Journal Article,2020
245,Exploring Relationships Between Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptoms and Eating Disorder Symptoms in Adults With Anorexia Nervosa: A Network Approach.,"Over the past few decades, research has accumulated to suggest a relationship between anorexia nervosa (AN) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Elevated ASD traits are present in around one third of those with AN, and there is some evidence to suggest that ASD traits are associated with more severe eating disorder (ED) psychopathology. The current study aimed to examine relationships between ED and ASD symptoms in individuals with a lifetime history of AN using network analysis. One hundred and one participants completed the ED Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2). A regularized partial correlation network was estimated using a graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Expected influence (EI) and bridge EI values were calculated to identify central and bridge symptoms respectively. Isolation, difficulties with relating to others, and feelings of tension during social situations were most central to the network, while poor self-confidence, concerns over eating around others, and concerns over others seeing one's body were the strongest bridge symptoms. Our findings confirm that interpersonal problems are central to ED psychopathology. They also suggest poor self-confidence and social anxiety-type worries may mediate the relationship between ED and ASD symptoms in those with a lifetime diagnosis of AN. Longitudinal studies examining fluctuations in symptoms over time may be helpful in understanding direction of causality.",2408540713.0, Journal Article,2020
246,Personality Structure and Attachment in Bipolar Disorder.,"Background An impairment of self and interpersonal functioning has an impact on coping strategies, regulation of affect and stress. Little is known so far about the impairment of personality functioning in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study is to assess the effects of personality structure and attachment in BD patients on the symptom burden.
 Methods Forty-six patients with the diagnosis of BD were assessed by the 12-item Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQS), the short version of Experience in Close Relationship-revised (ECR-R-D), and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI 18) to determine the level of personality functioning, attachment patterns, and symptom load.
 Results We observed positive correlations between personality difficulties, insecure attachment, and symptom load in patients with BD. A low level of structural integration and an insecure attachment style in patients with BD were accompanied by a significantly higher symptom load (r = 0.66, p ≤ 0.01). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the structural integration (T(1.44) = -0.93, p = 0.357) and in the attachment style attachment related avoidance: (T(1,44) = 1.50, p = 0.140); attachment related anxiety (T(1,44) = -0.781, p = 0.439) of study participants with BD when compared to the normative value of the general population.
 Limitations Our limitations are the small sample size of our group and the lack of a control group.
 Conclusion In general, our results suggest that there is a link between personality structure and affective dynamics including depressive, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in BD. These findings underline the increasing importance of assessing personality structure and attachment for diagnosis and treatment planning of BD.",2408540697.0, Journal Article,2020
247,Obesity After Kidney Transplantation-Results of a KTx360°Substudy.,"Objective There is solid evidence that kidney transplant (KTx) patients are susceptible to weight gain after transplantation. Post-transplantation obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2] seems to be associated with higher risks of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular events, while there are contradicting findings regarding the association between obesity and mortality, graft failure after transplantation as well as other variables. We aimed to evaluate the course of weight after KTx and to assess the prevalence of post-transplant obesity in a large sample of German KTx patients. Further, we focused on potential associations between weight gain, obesity, and BMI after transplantation with sociodemographic, medical, psychological [levels of anxiety and depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], and donation-specific variables.
 Methods In a structured post-transplant care program 433 KTx patients were evaluated at Hannover Medical School. Information on the pre-transplant body weight/dry weight of dialysis patients was taken from the electronic patient charts. At post-transplant assessment body weight was measured in the transplant center. For statistical analyses, descriptive statistics, analyses of variance, tests for correlations, and regression analyses were used.
 Results Mean age was 51.3 years, 59% were male and 26.3% had ≥12 years of school attendance. Regarding somatic conditions 6.0% were suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus, 6.9% were affected by new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 47.7 ml/min/1.73m2. The prevalence rates of obesity before and after kidney transplantation were 14.8 and 19.9%, respectively. This represents an increase of 34%. Obesity after transplantation was associated with higher rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus and of NODAT. Additionally, there was an association between increasing pre-transplant as well as post-transplant BMI and decreasing eGFR. Higher age and female sex were associated with higher rates of post-transplant obesity.
 Conclusions Our results suggest that obesity represents a serious problem in KTx patients, especially regarding the association between increasing BMI and decreasing graft functioning (eGFR). However, this aspect is often overlooked and information on effective treatment options for these patients are scarce making further research on this topic necessary.",2407319086.0, Journal Article,2020
248,Increased Anxiety After Stimulation of the Right Inferior Parietal Lobe and the Left Orbitofrontal Cortex.,"Sustained anxiety is a key symptom of anxiety disorders and may be associated with neural activation in the right inferior parietal lobe (rIPL), particularly under unpredictable threat. This finding suggests a moderating role of the rIPL in sustained anxiety, which we tested in the current study. We applied cathodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the rIPL as a symptom provocation method in 22 healthy participants in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, prior to two recordings of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In between, we applied a threat-of-shock paradigm with three conditions: unpredictable (U), predictable (P), or no electric shocks (N). We hypothesized increased anxiety under U, but not under P or N. Furthermore, we expected reduced CBF in the rIPL after tDCS compared to sham. As predicted, anxiety was higher in the U than the P and N conditions, and active tDCS augmented this effect. While tDCS did not alter CBF in the rIPL, it did attenuate the observed increase in brain regions that typically increase activation as a response to anxiety. These findings suggest that the rIPL moderates sustained anxiety as a gateway to brain regions crucial in anxiety. Alternatively, anodal tDCS over the left orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) may have increased anxiety through disruption of OFC-amygdala interactions.",2405305679.0, Journal Article,2020
249,Factor Analyses and Validity of the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS) in a Large Sample of Lung Transplant Candidates.,"Objective It is well known that the occurrence of mental disorders is more common in lung transplant candidates compared to the general population. After transplantation mental disorders may negatively affect quality of life, adherence to immunosuppressive medication, as well as overall survival. Therefore, the identification of patients at risk is of utmost importance and in Germany pre-transplant psychosocial evaluation of the patients is required. To ensure high quality and comparability of these assessments, the use of psychometrically sound instruments is recommended. We applied the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS), a broadly used expert interview. Two research groups have detected a two-factor structure of the TERS in different transplant samples; however, with slightly different results. The present study investigated which of the models would fit best in our sample of lung transplant patients. Additionally, we assessed convergent and predictive validity of the best fitting model to evaluate its clinical usefulness.
 Methods Between 2016 and 2019, 390 lung transplant candidates were evaluated and included in the study. The median age was 53 years and 54% were male. TERS interviews were conducted by trained medical doctors and psychologists. The participants completed questionnaires assessing quality of life and levels of depression and anxiety. Transplant- and disease-specific variables (lung disease, listing date, oxygen use) were taken from the patient charts. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the two proposed TERS-models in the present sample.
 Results The two-factor structure of the TERS reported by Hoodin and Kalbfleisch fit our sample best, showing good psychometric properties. The factor ""emotional sensitivity"" was highly correlated with quality of life and measures of psychosocial health while the factor ""defiance"" correlated with obstructive lung disease and older age but not with quality of life. The two factors showed differential predictive validity with regard to time until listing and pulmonary-specific quality of life 1 year after transplantation.
 Conclusions The two factors showed good psychometric properties, and differential convergent and predictive validity. However, further studies concentrating on the predictive value of the TERS and its factors regarding somatic outcomes (mortality, graft functioning) are required.",2404641181.0, Journal Article,2020
250,Analysis of the Gut Microbiota and Inflammatory Factors in mGluR5-Knockout Mice.,"Introduction Accumulating evidence indicates that the glutamatergic system plays an important role in the development of depression. Notably, the antidepressant effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) modulation is inconsistent across studies. Here, we attempted to identify the involvement of the gut microbiota and inflammation in mGluR5-/- mice.
 Methods mGluR5-/- mice and their wild-type littermates were used in our study. We used the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests to assess anxiety-like behaviors, and we used the two-day forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) to test despair-like behaviors. 16S rDNA was used to analyze the gut microbiota. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure the levels of inflammatory factors. Western blotting was used to detect the levels of various proteins.
 Results mGluR5-/- mice had no significant increase or decrease of despair-like behavior in the absence of stress exposure. However, mGluR5-/- mice exhibited despair-like behaviors following stress exposure. No significant changes in other glutamate receptors or representative synaptic proteins were detected in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or hippocampus of mGluR5-/- mice. Very similar bacterial groups were observed in mGluR5-/- mice and wild-type controls. In addition, there was no significant difference in the α-diversity of the microbiota between mGluR5-/- mice and wild-type controls. The levels of all measured cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) did not change significantly in the PFCs or colons of mGluR5-/- mice.
 Conclusion In conclusion, we deduced that mGluR5-/- mice are susceptible to despair-like behavior. The systemic knockout of mGluR5 did not affect the gut microbiota or inflammatory factors in mice.",2404641139.0, Journal Article,2020
251,Comorbidities Between Specific Learning Disorders and Psychopathology in Elementary School Children in Germany.,"Children with reading and/or spelling disorders have increased rates of behavioral and emotional problems and combinations of these. Some studies also find increased rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, anxiety disorder, and depression. However, the comorbidities of, e.g., arithmetic disorders with ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression have been addressed only rarely. The current study explored the probability of children with specific learning disorders (SLD) in reading, spelling, and/or arithmetic to also have anxiety disorder, depression, ADHD, and/or conduct disorder. The sample consisted of 3,014 German children from grades 3 and 4 (mean age 9;9 years) who completed tests assessing reading, spelling as well as arithmetic achievement and intelligence via a web-based application. Psychopathology was assessed using questionnaires filled in by the parents. In children with a SLD we found high rates of anxiety disorder (21%), depression (28%), ADHD (28%), and conduct disorder (22%). Children with SLD in multiple learning domains had a higher risk for psychopathology and had a broader spectrum of psychopathology than children with an isolated SLD. The results highlight the importance of screening for and diagnosing psychiatric comorbidities in children with SLD.",2404043579.0, Journal Article,2020
252,Prevalence and Influencing Factors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in the First-Line Medical Staff Fighting Against COVID-19 in Gansu.,"Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has brought enormous physical and psychological pressure on Chinese medical staff. It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.
 Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.
 Results The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).
 Conclusions The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.",2404043494.0, Journal Article,2020
253,Effect of Electroacupuncture and Counseling on Sub-Threshold Depression: A Study Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background Sub-threshold depression is common and could impair function, as well as increase the risk of developing major depression. Despite evidence of efficacy for electroacupuncture (EA) and counseling in the treatment of sub-threshold depression, the sample size is insufficient and the level of evidence remains low. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of sub-threshold depression treatments by comparing the treatment effects among EA, counseling, and combination therapy, as well as to further study their mechanism.
 Methods This study is a multicenter, randomized, single blind clinical trial that will be conducted in settings at four clinical centers in China. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the effectiveness of EA intervention, compared with counseling and combination therapy. A total of 138 sub-threshold depression patients (18 to 55 years of age with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score ≥ 14 points and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) score: 7 points ≤ HAMD total score &lt;17 points) will be recruited. The participants will be randomly assigned to receive the above treatments. The interventions will be delivered over a 6-week period (EA: 3 times a week for 6 weeks; 30 min a session. Counseling: once a week for 6 weeks; 50-60 min a session). The primary outcome measure will be the HAMD-17; BDI-II. The secondary outcome measures will be: Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The assessments will occur at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks and a follow-up period. Recruitment will commence in March 2020 and is anticipated to occur over a 2-year period.
 Discussion This study intends to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness among EA, counseling and the combined therapy in the treatment of patients with sub-threshold depression, and to further study the mechanisms of effect.

254,"Secondary Traumatic Stress, Mental State, and Work Ability in Nurses-Results of a Psychological Risk Assessment at a University Hospital.","Psychological risk assessment is a legal obligation for companies and part of occupational safety and employment protection in Germany. However, data from psychological risk assessments in nursing staff are scarce, although this population is at increased risk for secondary traumatic stress by patient experienced trauma. Therefore, our study aimed at examining the frequency of reported secondary trauma events, secondary traumatic stress, and its possible consequences for psychological well-being and work ability in nurses. N = 320 nurses (n = 280 female) were assessed at a University Hospital in Germany as part of the psychological risk assessment. Secondary traumatic events, secondary traumatic stress, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using self-report questionnaires (PHQ-2, GAD-2), and work ability was assessed using a modified version of the questionnaire for workplace analysis (KFZA). Of 320 nurses, 292 (91.2%) experienced secondary trauma, and 74 nurses (25.3%) reported secondary traumatic symptoms. Nurses with secondary traumatic symptoms reported higher depression (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety scores (p &lt; 0.001) compared to nurses without secondary trauma experience, and to nurses with secondary trauma experience but without secondary traumatic stress (both p &lt; 0.001). Further, nurses with secondary traumatic stress reported significantly reduced work ability, social support and control over work, and increased emotional strain and labor time. Nurses with secondary traumatic stress may be at increased risk of developing major depression and anxiety disorders, and particularly need support in overcoming secondary traumatic experiences. Psychological risk assessment is a useful tool to identify groups at risk, and pave the way to implement strategies to improve mental well-being and prevent work ability in high risk groups.",2401832895.0, Journal Article,2020
255,Endocannabinoid System Components as Potential Biomarkers in Psychiatry.,"The high heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders leads to a lack of diagnostic precision. Therefore, the search of biomarkers is a fundamental aspect in psychiatry to reach a more personalized medicine. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has gained increasing interest due to its involvement in many different functional processes in the brain, including the regulation of emotions, motivation, and cognition. This article reviews the role of the main components of the ECS as biomarkers in certain psychiatric disorders. Studies carried out in rodents evaluating the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of cannabinoid receptors or endocannabinoids (eCBs) degrading enzymes were included. Likewise, the ECS-related alterations occurring at the molecular level in animal models reproducing some behavioral and/or neuropathological aspects of psychiatric disorders were reviewed. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating gene or protein alterations in post-mortem brain tissue or in vivo blood, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed. Also, the results from neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) were included. This review shows the close involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1r) in stress regulation and the development of mood disorders [anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder (BD)], in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or eating disorders (i.e. anorexia and bulimia nervosa). On the other hand, recent results reveal the potential therapeutic action of the endocannabinoid tone manipulation by inhibition of eCBs degrading enzymes, as well as by the modulation of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2r) activity on anxiolytic, antidepressive, or antipsychotic associated effects. Further clinical research studies are needed; however, current evidence suggests that the components of the ECS may become promising biomarkers in psychiatry to improve, at least in part, the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders.",2401832813.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
256,Abnormal Rich Club Organization of Structural Network as a Neuroimaging Feature in Relation With the Severity of Primary Insomnia.,"Purpose Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep complaint in the general population but is often intractable due to uncertainty regarding the underlying pathomechanisms. Sleep is regulated by a network of neural structures interconnected with the core nodes of the brain connectome referred to as the ""rich club"". We examined alterations in brain rich-club organization as revealed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the statistical relationships between abnormalities in rich-club metrics and the clinical features of primary insomnia (PI).
 Methods This study recruited 43 primary insomnia (PI) patients and 42 age-, sex-, and education level-matched healthy controls (HCs). Differences in global and regional network parameters between PI and healthy control groups were compared by nonparametric tests, and Spearman's correlations were calculated to assess associations of these network metrics with PI-related clinical features, including disease duration and scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Self-Rating Depression Scale.
 Results Weighted white matter networks exhibited weaker rich-club organization in PI patients than HCs across different thresholds (50%, 75%, and 90%) and parcellation schemes [automated anatomical labeling (AAL)-90 and AAL-1024]. Aberrant rich-club organization was found mainly in limbic-cortical-basal ganglia circuits and the default-mode network.
 Conclusions Abnormal rich-club metrics are a characteristic feature of PI-related to disease severity. These metrics provide potential clues to PI pathogenesis and may be useful as diagnostic markers and for assessment of treatment response.",2401121206.0, Journal Article,2020
257,Sleep Problems Influence Emotional/Behavioral Symptoms and Repetitive Behavior in Preschool-Aged Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Unique Social Context of China.,"Sleep disturbances are common in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but research on this topic is still limited in China. In the current study, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep problems in preschool-aged children with ASD and to examine the correlations between sleep disturbances and emotional/behavioral symptoms and repetitive behavior in the unique social context of China. This study recruited 475 preschool-aged children aged 3-6 years old, including 252 children with ASD (mean age 5.13 ± 1.15, 80.6% male) and 223 age-matched typically developing (TD) children (mean age 5.12 ± 0.97, 74.9% male). The parents of all children completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire. The parents of 114 ASD children completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Repetitive Behavioral Questionnaire-2 (RBQ-2). The prevalence of sleep problems in preschool-aged children with ASD in this study was 81.7%, which was higher than that in TD children (61.0%). The scores for bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, sleep duration, parasomnias, and sleep onset delay in the ASD group were significantly higher than those in the TD group (t=-7.664, P=0.000; t=-10.477, P=0.000; t=-4.133, P=0.000; Z=-3.916, P=0.000; Z=-7.093, P=0.000; respectively). Sleep onset delay explained 17.3% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.173) in the total SDQ score of children with ASD, and bedtime resistance explained a large proportion of total RBQ-2 score variance (adjusted R2 = 0.206). The high rate of sleep disturbances in preschool-aged children with ASD emphasizes the importance of screening for sleep problems in this population. Attention should also be directed toward formulating good sleep hygiene practices for preschool-aged children in the particular social context and cultural setting of China.",2399238538.0, Journal Article,2020
258,Exploring Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Cell Adhesion Molecules as Biomarkers for the Transdiagnostic Symptom Anhedonia in Alcohol Use Disorder and Comorbid Depression.,"Background Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and depressive disorder often co-exist and have a shared heritability. This study aimed to investigate Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and three Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) as transdiagnostic biomarkers in AUD and depression co-morbidity.
 Methods In a cross-sectional study, patients with AUD (n=22), AUD and depression (n=19), and healthy controls (n=20) were examined. Depression and anxiety severity were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Anhedonia, alcohol use and dependence, craving, and social adaptation were assessed through self-report questionnaires. BDNF and CAM concentrations in peripheral serum were measured after overnight fasting using a Luminex assay. After controlling for age and gender, biomarker levels were compared across groups. The association between biomarker concentrations and symptom severity scales were explored using correlation and multiple regression analyses.
 Results BDNF and Neuronal CAM were lower in patients with AUD with and without depression compared to healthy controls. No differences were observed for Vascular CAM-1 and Interstitial CAM-1. BDNF correlated negatively with anhedonia levels. BDNF, age and gender together explained 21% of variability in anhedonia levels.
 Conclusion This pilot study suggests that peripheral levels of BDNF and NCAM might be reduced in AUD with and without comorbid mood disorder. Since low BDNF levels were associated with self- reported anhedonia across these conditions, BDNF and anhedonia might reflect transdiagnostic aspects involved in AUD and depression.",2399238257.0, Journal Article,2020
259,Prosocial Behavior Can Moderate the Relationship Between Rumination and Mindfulness.,"Objective Rumination, which is a coping style to distress, has become a common mode of thinking about mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Improving mindfulness is an effective way to help people cope with rumination. Individuals who had higher prosocial behaviors reported a high level of mindfulness. This study aimed to explore whether prosocial behavior helps individuals with high-level rumination improve their mindfulness, and explain the reason why prosocial behavior can influence the relationship between mindfulness and rumination.
 Methods Introducing prosocial behavior situations, the first study chose 51 high-level rumination and 53 low-level rumination participants and measured the influence of prosocial behavior on mindful attention awareness in the present moment. In the second study, a questionnaire was conducted among 261 participants to explore the moderating effect of prosocial behavior between rumination and mindfulness.
 Results In individuals with high-level rumination, ΔMAAS (mindful attention awareness scale) (posttest-baseline) scores in the prosocial behavior condition were significantly higher compared to those in the control condition (p=0.003). Meanwhile, prosocial behavior played a moderating effect between reflective pondering of rumination and mindfulness (R2 = 0.03, p=0.004).
 Conclusions Encouraging prosocial behavior is an effective way to improve mindfulness in highly ruminative individuals.",2398155915.0, Journal Article,2020
260,Paeonol at Certain Doses Alleviates Aggressive and Anxiety-Like Behaviours in Two Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Rat Models.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a common mental health disturbance associated with several periodic psychological symptoms in women. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for PMS/PMDD patients; however, side effects are inevitable, especially in long-term treatment. In previous studies, the natural compound paeonol in Moutan Cortex was found to play effective roles in central nervous system disorders with its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Consequently, we assume that paeonol might produce positive effects in the treatment of PMS/PMDD. In this study, the open-field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) and light dark box (LDB) tests were performed in mice to determine the optimal dose of paeonol for treating anxiety. Then, paeonol was used to treat the progesterone withdrawal (PWD) and resident intruder paradigm (RIP) rat models of PMDD. Using these two reliable models, the OFT and EPM, LDB, and composite aggressive tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the drug on behavioural symptoms of PMDD. From the dosage screening results, the optimal anti-anxiety dose of paeonol was identified as 17.5 mg/kg/d for 7 days. With regard to the effect of paeonol on PMDD rat models, a significantly improvement was found in the behavioural symptoms, but the effective dose varied in different models. For the PWD model rats, treatment with 6.05 mg/kg paeonol could significantly improve anxiety and irritability, while that with 24.23 mg/kg paeonol resulted in anxiety-like effects in behavioural tests. In RIP model rats, treatment with 12.11 mg/kg paeonol demonstrated excellent effects in improving anxiety, particularly irritable emotional behaviour. In conclusion, our study indicates that paeonol is a potential therapeutic compound for PMS/PMDD; it is a drug option that helps establish dosage guidance for treatment of this condition.",2396858918.0, Journal Article,2020
261,Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak.,"Objective The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.
 Method Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.
 Result There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5).
 Conclusion Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.",2396305865.0, Journal Article,2020
262,"High Psychiatric Morbidity and Comorbidity Among Female Prisoners in Hunan, China.","Background High prevalence of mental disorders has been found among female prisoners in Western countries, however, little is known about the epidemiology of mental disorders in such populations in China. This study aims to investigate psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity among sentenced prisoners in a female prison in China.
 Methods A cluster sample of 2,703 female adult prisoners from Hunan Provincial Female Prison were interviewed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a semi-structured Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) mental disorder diagnostic tool. The rates of psychotic disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders were reported.
 Results Nearly 2/3 (66.2%, N=1,790) of the sample fulfilled the criteria for at least one lifetime DSM-IV disorder 36.5% had major depression, 22.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 16.5% had drug use disorder. Drug use disorders were the major comorbid disorders. 60.8% of people with alcohol use disorder and 37.0% of those with psychotic disorders also had a drug use disorder. More than one-quarter (26.1%) of the population met criteria for a current diagnosis of any mental disorder, of which major depression was the most common (14.7%), followed by PTSD (6.4%) and psychotic disorder (1.8%).
 Conclusion The high levels of psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity in a representative sample of female prisoners in China indicate unmet needs that require identification and therapeutic intervention in prisons.",2396302999.0, Journal Article,2020
263,Autism Spectrum Disorder and Narcolepsy: A Possible Connection That Deserves to Be Investigated.,"Narcolepsy in childhood-adolescence is characterized by a high occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities. The most frequent psychiatric disorders reported in these patients are attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia. However, narcolepsy can be associated also with introversion, sorrowfulness, feelings of inferiority, impaired affectivity modulation, emotional lability, irritability, aggressiveness, and poor attention, that have been pooled by some authors under a definition of ""narcoleptic personality."" Some aspects of this ""narcoleptic personality,"" and in particular introversion, impaired affectivity modulation, irritability, and poor attention, partially overlap with the clinical features of the individuals with autism spectrum disorder, considering also those that are not regarded as core autism symptoms. Till now, in literature the number of cases affected by both narcolepsy and autism spectrum disorder (seven patients) has been clearly too small to demonstrate the presence of a pathogenetic link between these two conditions, but this possible connection has not yet been adequately investigated, despite the presence of several points in common. The finding of a connection between narcolepsy and autism spectrum disorder could boost the study of possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms shared between these two apparently so distant disorders. Basing on the literature data summarized in this paper, in the diagnostic work-up of a child with narcolepsy it is essential to evaluate also the social-communicative behavior using standardized tools in order to detect the real recurrence of clinical features suggesting an autism spectrum disorder. At the same time, it appears necessary to screen in the individuals with autism spectrum disorder for the possible presence of evoking symptoms of narcolepsy.",2394243194.0, Journal Article,2020
264,Interoceptive Abilities in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Alexithymia is usually described by three main dimensions difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and externally oriented thinking (EOT). The most commonly used questionnaire investigating alexithymia, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), supports this three-factor structure. One important assumption is that alexithymia severity is associated to vulnerability to somatic diseases, among them gastrointestinal disorders. However, the association between alexithymia and gastrointestinal disorders is not systematic, thus questioning the role of alexithymia as a vulnerability factor for those illnesses. A recent factor analysis suggested another four-factor structure for the TAS-20: difficulties in awareness of feelings (DAF), difficulties in interoceptive abilities (DIA), externally oriented thinking (EOT), and poor affective sharing (PAS). We assume that DIA and DAF might be more relevant to investigate the association between alexithymia and gastrointestinal disorders. The rationale is that DIA and DAF reflect impairments in emotion regulation that could contribute to an inappropriate autonomic and HPA axis homeostasis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis (UC), or Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether DIA and DAF are associated with the presence of IBS, UC or CD, while checking for anxiety, depression, parasympathetic (vagus nerve) activity and cortisol levels. We recruited control participants (n=26), and patients in remission who were diagnosed with IBS (n=24), UC (n=18), or CD (n=21). Participants completed questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression, and alexithymia. A blood sample and an electrocardiogram were used to measure the level of cortisol and parasympathetic activity, respectively. Logistic regressions with the four-factor structure of the TAS-20 revealed that DIA was a significant predictor of IBS (W(1)=6.27, p=.01). Conversely, DIA and DAF were not significant predictors in CD and UC patients. However, low cortisol level was a significant predictor of UC (W(1)=4.67, p=.035). Additional logistic regressions based on the original 3-factor structure of TAS-20 (DIF, DDF, and EOT) showed that only DDF was a significant predictor of CD [W(1)=6.16, p &lt; .001]. The present study suggests that DIA is an important dimension for assessing potential risk for gastrointestinal diseases, in particular for IBS.",2391971593.0, Journal Article,2020
265,Postpartal Affective and Endocrine Differences Between Parents of Preterm and Full-Term Infants.,"Background During the postpartum period, new parents frequently experience emotional stress and exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety, accompanied by substantial endocrine changes. However, evidence predominantly exists from parents of full-term infants, while data on parents of preterm infants are scarce. In this exploratory, cross-sectional study, we compared psychological well-being and endocrine parameters in parents of very preterm and term born infants.
 Methods Mothers (N = 28) and fathers (N = 30) of full-term infants as well as mothers (N = 18) and fathers (N = 21) of very or extreme preterm infants (&lt; 32nd gestational week) were recruited in the days following birth. Anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), respectively. Physiological measures included serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (mothers only), as well as the salivary cortisol awakening response (mothers and fathers).
 Results New mothers and fathers of very preterm infants exhibited higher scores of depression, anxiety and stress than parents of term infants. Besides, mothers of very preterm infants showed lower levels of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin, as well as a heightened post-awakening cortisol response compared to mothers of term infants. Furthermore, in mothers of preterm infants we found significant negative associations between serum prolactin levels and BDI and STAI scores, respectively.
 Conclusions Parents of very preterm infants suffered from a higher burden of psychological distress than parents of full-term infants. The affective symptoms in preterm mothers were accompanied by altered endocrine profiles that, at least to some extent, may contribute to the psychological changes. The profound psychological and physiological disturbances in mothers of preterm infants may have an impact on long-term mental health and early pharmacological and psychological interventions may help to ameliorate postpartum affective symptoms.",2390645490.0, Journal Article,2020
266,"Prevalence of Mood and Anxiety Disorders Among Adults Seeking Care in Primary Healthcare Centers in Cordoba, Argentina.","Objective To estimate the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among adults seeking care in primary healthcare centers in Cordoba city, Argentina.
 Methods Cross-sectional analysis of a random sample of adults 18-69 years of age seeking care for general health problems in public (i.e., government-funded) primary healthcare centers in Cordoba city, Argentina in 2010-2011. Mood and anxiety disorders were assessed in the participants' lifetime, and in the last 12 months and 30 days using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0, and defined following the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision.
 Results Overall, 1,067 participants were included in the current analysis [mean age 35.6 (SD 13.2) years, 83.7% female]. The lifetime, 12-month and 30-day prevalence of any mood or anxiety disorder was 40.4% [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 37.4-43.4%], 20.1% (17.8-22.7%) and 7.8% (6.2-9.6%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety disorders was higher compared to mood disorders when assessed in the participants' lifetime [29.7% (95%CI 27.0-32.5%) versus 19.3% (17.0-21.8%)], and in the last 12 months [14.9% (12.8-17.2%) versus 8.7% (7.1-10.6%)] and 30 days [5.8% (4.5-7.4%) versus 2.3% (1.5-3.4%)]. Age and marital status-adjusted odds ratios for any mood or anxiety disorder in the participants' lifetime and in the last 12 months and 30 days comparing women versus men were 1.19 (95%CI 0.85-1.67), 1.70 (1.07-2.69), and 2.26 (1.02-5.00), respectively.
 Conclusion The prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders is high among adults seeking care in primary healthcare centers in Cordoba city, particularly among women. Integration of primary and mental health services is warranted.",2390154510.0, Journal Article,2020
267,Emotional Awareness Correlated With Number of Awakenings From Polysomnography in Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome-A Pilot Study.,"Introduction Unrefreshing sleep is one of the diagnostic criteria in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which could be explained by sleep disorders, for example obstructive sleep apnea, reported in our previous study with polysomnography. Our previous findings also indicate difficulties in emotional regulation when measuring alexithymia by TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and level of emotional awareness by LEAS (Level of Emotional Awareness Scale) in ME/CFS patients. However, the reasons for this are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between data from subjective emotional regulation and polysomnography.
 Methods Twenty-three ME/CFS patients (5 men and 18 women) of mean age 43, and 30 matched healthy controls (9 males and 21 women) of mean age 45, filled in TAS-20, LEAS, and Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS). A polysomnography was performed on patients but not on healthy controls. Thus, values of normal population were used for sleep evaluation in ME/CFS patients.
 Result There were significant differences between patients and controls in several aspects of emotional regulation, for example LEAS-self and LEAS-total. Seventy percent of the patients had increased numbers of awakenings (shifts from any sleep stage to awake), 22% had obstructive sleep apneas, and 27% had periodic limb movements. Correlation analysis showed that number of awakenings significantly correlated with LEAS-self and LEAS-total, p &lt; 0.01, respectively. There were no other significant correlations.
 Conclusion This pilot study demonstrated significant correlations between reduced emotional awareness and number of awakenings in polysomnography. Future studies with larger cohorts need to be conducted.",2388831162.0, Journal Article,2020
268,Psychometric Properties of the Chinese version of UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale.,"Objective The present study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. The associations between the UPPS-P scale and impulsivity choice, gender, smoking, and drinking status were also assessed.
 Methods A total of 127 adults ranging from 21 to 65 years old participated in the study. Participants were administered with the Chinese version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Impulsivity choice tasks were also tested including the Delay Discounting Task (DDT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and Beads Task (Beads).
 Results A new version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale was formed that includes 40 items. The scores of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency on five subscales but less sufficient structure validity in the present sample. In addition, positive urgency was negatively related to the Beads task; negative urgency and positive urgency were positively related to the DDT and BART. Moreover, positive and negative urgency were positively correlated with depression; all five subscales were positively correlated with anxiety; sensation seeking was higher in males than females and in alcohol drinkers than non-drinkers; and lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance were higher in nonsmokers than smokers.
 Conclusions The present study supports the reliability but not the structure validity of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. The impulsivity personality trait assessed by the UPPS-P scale was associated with impulsivity choice, depression, anxiety, gender, and drinking and smoking status. Further studies should be conducted to explore the structure of impulsivity in the Chinese population.",2388827344.0, Journal Article,2020
269,A Feasibility and Acceptability Trial of Social Cognitive Therapy in Early Psychosis Delivered Through a Virtual World: The VEEP Study.,"Background Addressing specific social cognitive difficulties is an important target in early psychosis and may help address poor functional outcomes. However, structured interventions using standard therapy settings including groups suffer from difficulties in recruitment and retention.
 Aims To address these issues, we aimed to modify an existing group social cognitive intervention entitled 'Social Cognition and Interaction Training' (SCIT) to be delivered through a virtual world environment (Second Life ©).
 Methods A single arm nonrandomized proof-of-concept trial of SCIT-VR was conducted. Five groups of three to five individuals per group were recruited over 6 months. Eight sessions of SCIT-VR therapy were delivered through the virtual world platform Second Life© over a 5-week intervention window. Feasibility was examined using recruitment rates and retention. Acceptability was examined using qualitative methods. Secondary outcomes including social cognitive indices, functioning, and anxiety were measured pre- and postintervention.
 Results The SCIT-VR therapy delivered was feasible (36% consent rate and 73.3% intervention completion rate), acceptable (high overall postsession satisfaction scores) and safe (no serious adverse events), and had high levels of participant satisfaction. Users found the environment immersive. Prepost changes were found in emotion recognition scores and levels of anxiety. There were no signs of clinical deterioration on any of the secondary measures.
 Conclusion This proof-of-concept pilot trial suggested that delivering SCIT-VR through a virtual world is feasible and acceptable. There were some changes in prepost outcome measures that suggest the intervention has face validity. There is sufficient evidence to support a larger powered randomized controlled trial.

270,What Do We Know About the Preterm Behavioral Phenotype? A Narrative Review.,"Preterm birth is associated with a significantly increased risk for childhood and adolescent psychopathology relative to full-term birth, with an inverse relationship between gestational age at birth and later risk for psychopathology. The manifestation of symptomatology and comorbidity profiles of emotional and behavioral adjustment problems in this high-risk group have been shown to be distinct from the broader pediatric population. Acknowledging these differences, a preterm behavioral phenotype has been proposed and increasingly recognized, highlighting the unique, frequent co-occurrence of symptomatology associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety disorders. The current state-of-the-art review provides a comprehensive characterization of this phenotype to date and further highlights key knowledge gaps primarily regarding the evolution of symptoms, co-occurrence of disorders and/or symptomatology within the phenotype, and associations of the phenotype with chronological age and degree of prematurity.",2388004472.0," Journal Article , Review",2020
271,Under the Hood: Using Computational Psychiatry to Make Psychological Therapies More Mechanism-Focused.,"Psychological therapies, such as CBT, are an important part of the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. There is a growing desire to understand the mechanisms by which such therapies effect change so as to improve treatment outcomes. Here we argue that adopting a computational framework may be one such approach. Computational psychiatry aims to provide a theoretical framework for moving between higher-level psychological states (like emotions, decisions and beliefs) to neural circuits, by modeling these constructs mathematically. These models are explicit hypotheses that contain quantifiable variables and parameters derived from each individual's behavior. This approach has two advantages. Firstly, some of the variables described by these models appears to reflect the neural activity of specific brain regions. Secondly, the parameters estimated by these models may offer a unique description of a patient's symptoms which can be used to both tailor therapy and track its effect. In doing so this approach may offer some additional granularity in understanding how psychological therapies, such as CBT, are working. Although this field shows significant promise, we also highlight several of the key hurdles that must first be overcome before clinical translation of computational insights can be realized.",2387694801.0, Journal Article,2020
272,Design of a Guided Internet- and Mobile-Based Intervention for Internet Use Disorder-Study Protocol for a Two-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Context: Internet Use Disorder (IUD), characterized as the inability to control one's internet use, is emerging as an increasing societal concern as it is associated with reduced quality of life and mental health comorbidities. Evidence-based treatment options are, however, scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based interventions may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address individuals affected in their online setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed, guided internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD. Methods: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N = 130), individuals showing problematic internet use patterns (Internet Addiction Test ≥ 49) will be randomly allocated to the internet- and mobile-based intervention or a waiting control group. Assessments will take place at baseline, 7 weeks, 6- and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is internet addiction symptom severity (IAT) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other psychosocial variables associated with IUD. Intervention: The intervention consists of seven sessions: Goal setting and motivational interviewing, impulse control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, self-worth, relapse prevention, and a booster session. Participants are supported by an eCoach who provides individual feedback after completion of each session. Participants can choose between several elective sessions based on individual need. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate an internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD, which could be a promising first step to reduce individuals' disease burden. Trial Registration: DRKS00015314. The study is currently ongoing. First participants were enrolled in the study on September 14th 2018. Recruitment will continue approximately through March 2020.",2387694674.0, Journal Article,2020
273,"Sex-Specific Differences in Severity of Depressive Symptoms, Heart Rate Variability, and Neurocognitive Profiles of Depressed Young Adults: Exploring Characteristics for Mild Depression.","Mild depressive symptoms (MDS) reflect vulnerability to major depression that does not meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder (MDD). Previous research indicates that it is difficult to identify MDS in young adults, and they exhibit diverse aspects of depressive symptoms caused by clinical depression, which can lead to poor academic performance, relationship difficulties, and even suicide. Additionally, many young adults remain unaware of their depressive symptoms during the early stages of MDD. Thus, the present study investigated clinical, neurocognitive, and physiological characteristics of young adults with various symptoms of depression and explored sex-specific differences. A total of 113 students aged 18-35 (MDD: n = 32; MDS: n =37; control [CON]: n = 44) participated in the study. Self-report clinical measures, short-term cardiac activity measured by finger sensors, and neurocognitive data were collected. Pearson's correlations, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis, and exploratory structural equation modeling were conducted for the statistical analyses. Furthermore, the measurement invariance of the latent factor model was tested, and fit indices were compared according to sex. The results revealed that male students showed greater sympatho-vagal activity than female students. Additionally, male MDS students tended to exhibit decreased performance levels in neurocognitive function tasks compared with MDD and CON males, whereas female MDS students showed distinct characteristics compared to MDD and CON females on self-report measures of anxiety. Correlation analyses identified a positive association between the level of anger perception and latency in the executive function test among both males and females. Additionally, the use of a structured model revealed significant sex-specific differences in factor estimates. The present results suggest that recognizing the early signs of MDS that account for sex-specific differences in both subjective and objective measures may improve the diagnosis and monitoring of young adults with MDS.",2387692880.0, Journal Article,2020
274,Development and Validation of Fear of Relapse Scale for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding Stressors in Patients.,"Chronic diseases are associated with patients' long-term stress and development of fear to things related to the source of stress. Better management of a patients' condition requires investigation of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the process of development of chronic stress. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating chronic disease in most cases diagnosed after a relapse and characterized by the periodic occurrence of relapses in most patients. Due to the unpredictable course of the disease and relapses, patients with Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) may deal with the stress of anticipation of relapse and its unpredictable consequences. The role of relapses and related stress on patients' quality of life has not been previously investigated. This study is the first effort to develop a self-report measure of Fear of Relapse (FoR) in patients with RRMS. Thirty-one items were extracted from in-depth clinical interviews with 33 RRMS patients to develop the preliminary version of the scale. Subsequently, 168 RRMS patients completed the questionnaire, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). Fifty-one patients completed the scale one more time a month later. Factor analysis revealed three components, and five items failed to load on any of them. To test the FoR's independence from similar measures, responses to 26 items were pooled once with DASS items and once with IUS items, and each time were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (two-component solution). Despite significant correlations between FoR, DASS, and IUS Independent loadings of items belonging to FoR and DASS, and FoR and IUS revealed independence and unique contribution of FoR to the evaluation of patients. Cronbach's alpha for the 26-item version was 0.92. Test-retest reliability for total score was equal to 0.74. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the validity and reliability of the measure. This scale can help researchers and clinicians to have a more comprehensive understanding of patients' experience with the uncertain nature of MS, which is necessary for future efforts to address this stressor by targeting the underlying mechanism.",2387691505.0, Journal Article,2020
275,Validation of the Clinical Global Impression-Corrections Scale (CGI-C) by Equipercentile Linking to the BPRS-E.,"Background: The Clinical Global Impression-Corrections (CGI-C) is an adaptation of the severity scale of the Clinical Global Impression for use in correctional facilities. Although it has been shown to have good inter-rater reliability, there have been no validation studies of this instrument. Method: We analyzed data from 726 initial assessments of persons detained in two correctional facilities and compared clinician's ratings for the CGI-C and modified Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded (BPRS-E). We used equipercentile linkage and Spearman correlations to investigate concordance in the total sample, by diagnostic groups, and by gender. Results: We found that the CGI-C scores and BPRS-E scores among persons in remand settings were significantly correlated (ρ = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001) and that correlations were the same for men and women. We found that points of equivalence can be reliably found between the two scales using equipercentile linkage, and that those with psychotic disorders had lower BPRS-E scores than those with mood/anxiety/situational stress for equivalent CGI-C scores. Conclusion: Overall, CGI-C ratings correspond well to BPRS-E ratings for both men and women remand prisoners across diagnoses, and the CGI-C appears to be a valid tool for the assessment of severity of symptoms in this setting.",2387689910.0, Journal Article,2020
276,"The Positive Relationships Between Paranoia, Perceptions of Workplace Bullying, and Intentions of Workplace Deviance in United Kingdom and French Teachers: Cross-Cultural Aspects.","Cognitive models of psychopathology were applied to inform the relationships between paranoid cognitions, perceptions of workplace bullying, and intentions of workplace deviance in UK and French teachers. Sixty-six UK teachers and 50 French teachers were asked to fill in an online survey comprised of the Green Paranoia Thought Scales, Negative Acts Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales, and Workplace Deviance Scale. The variables in this study were conceptualized as cognitions and not as facts because the study used self-report questionnaires of paranoid ideation, workplace bullying, and workplace deviance. Mann-Whitney tests showed that UK teachers report significantly more perceptions of work-related bullying and intentions of workplace deviance than French teachers. However, there was no statistically significant difference between UK and French teachers for the report of paranoid ideation. Mediation analyses showed that paranoia impacted on intentions of workplace deviance but perceptions of workplace bullying and negative affect did not mediate this association in UK and French teachers. Culturally tailored psycho-social interventions should be implemented targeting teachers' paranoid thinking and workplace bullying in order to deter teachers from engaging in workplace deviance and to promote their well-being.",2387687214.0, Journal Article,2020
277,Classification of Social Anxiety Disorder With Support Vector Machine Analysis Using Neural Correlates of Social Signals of Threat.,"Threatening faces are potent cues in social anxiety disorder (SAD); therefore, neural response to threatening faces, particularly regions in the ""fear"" circuit such as amygdala, may classify individuals with SAD. Previous studies of indirect/implicit processing of threatening faces have shown that support vector machine (SVM) pattern recognition significantly differentiates individuals with SAD from healthy participants, though evidence for the role of the fear circuit in classification has been inconsistent. We extend this literature by using SVM during direct face processing. Individuals with SAD (n=47) and healthy controls (n=46) completed a validated emotional face matching task during functional MRI, which included a matching shapes control condition. SVM was based on brain response to threat (vs. happy) faces, threat faces (vs. shapes), and threat/happy faces (vs. shapes) in 90 regions encompassing frontal, limbic, parietal, temporal, and occipital systems. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used for feature selection and to rank the contribution of regions in predicting SAD diagnosis. SVM results for threat (vs. happy) faces revealed satisfactory accuracy (e.g., area under the curve=0.72); results with shapes as ""baseline"" yielded less optimal classification. RFE for threat (vs. happy) indicated that all 90 brain regions were necessary for classification. RFE-based ranking suggested diffuse neurofunctional activation to threat (vs. happy) faces in classification. When using an RFE cut-point, regions implicated in sensory and goal-directed processes contributed relatively more in differentiating SAD from controls than other regions. Results suggest that neural activity across large-scale systems, as opposed to fear circuitry alone, may aid in the diagnosis of SAD.",2385275592.0, Journal Article,2020
278,Self-Criticism and Personality Functioning Predict Patterns of Symptom Change in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Aim of the study was to identify patient variables that predict specific patterns of symptom course during and after hospital treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). In a sample of 518 patients, four pairs of clinically relevant patterns of symptom change were contrasted. The time points of measurement were admission, discharge, 3 and 12 month after discharge. CATREG was used to identify the best sets of predictors from 28 variables. A greater reduction in self-criticism during hospital treatment was the strongest predictor of rapid and sustained improvement. Traumatic childhood experiences and lower abilities for communication with others predicted a transient relapse after discharge, while a co-morbid personality disorder and higher level of anxiety differentiated between those with a persistent relapse and those with only a transient relapse in depressive symptoms following discharge. Overall, patients with less severe depression at admission, better abilities in self-perception, and less self-criticism (baseline and/or greater reduction during treatment) showed a better outcome after 1 year. There is limited generalizability to other countries and treatment settings. Data on personality functioning were not available for all patients and findings are correlational in nature. However, findings are in support of a psychotherapeutic focus on a reduction of self-criticism in MDD. Patient with traumatization, a co-morbid personality disorder and lower abilities to communicate their emotional needs should get specific attention and support after discharge from hospital treatment.",2384841754.0, Journal Article,2020
279,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Lymphoma Patients: A Prospective Study.,"The cancer experience may be marked by repeat stressors and/or traumas. The aim of our study was to assess traumatic events in a group of patients diagnosed with lymphoma and to determine which of these contribute to the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder/PTSD. Two weeks after receiving a diagnosis of lymphoma, patients were referred for an assessment of peritraumatic distress (using the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory/PDI) and peritraumatic dissociation (using the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire/PDEQ). Three months after the diagnosis, we recorded the following parameters: the patients' worst experiences, the presence of PTSD symptoms, using the PTSD CheckList/PCL, as it related to the diagnosis, and symptoms of anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression/HAD scale and of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory/BDI-II. The study recruited 129 patients, with a mean age of 46 years (SD = 17.3); 70 (54%) men, 87 (67.5%) with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 42 with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two weeks after the diagnosis, 49% of patients reported peritraumatic distress, and 20% peritraumatic dissociation, during or immediately after being informed of the lymphoma diagnosis. Three months after the diagnosis, the severity of PTSD symptoms was evaluated. At this stage none of the patients suffered PTSD, but 29 (23%) individuals exhibited partial PTSD: 13.4% correlated it to receiving the lymphoma diagnosis, 8% to telling family members, and 1.6% to adverse effects. Peritraumatic distress and dissociation as a result of receiving a lymphoma diagnosis, as well as anxiety and a mucositis within the first 3 months post-diagnosis, were factors that were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, accounting for 35.8% in PTSD symptom load. Our study reveals that clinicians should assess the impact of a number of stressors, which are risk factors for PTSD symptoms, starting from the time point of the initial lymphoma diagnosis.",2384209283.0, Journal Article,2020
280,A Brief Modified Family-Based Treatment Intervention for Youth With Mild Eating Disorders: A Case Series.,"Background Family-based treatment (FBT), an outpatient treatment which is typically offered for 6-12 months by specially trained therapists, is currently the first line treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The success of FBT for adolescents with moderate to severe eating disorders indicates a potential use for a short course of modified FBT which could be offered as an early intervention by nonspecialized community mental health counselors to adolescents with mild or subsyndromal eating disorders.
 Methods In 2016, seven adolescents with mild eating disorders underwent a brief intervention in the form of five FBT-inspired therapy sessions (called 'DREAMS' sessions). The DREAMS sessions consisted of five replicable family sessions given over 6 weeks, each with a specific area of focus for treatment, such as nutrition and eating disorder symptoms, mood, relationships and anxiety. Charts of these seven patients were reviewed in 2019 to determine whether this treatment might be worthy of further study.
 Results Based on a review of the progress notes, all seven patients reported an improvement in intake, a decrease in ED symptoms and an improvement in mood by the end of the sessions. All seven families reported that the sessions had been beneficial.
 Conclusion Early intervention is recommended for adolescents who present in the early stages of an eating disorder, yet there are no guidelines to recommend which treatment should be offered to this population. Further research is required to determine whether a short course of modified FBT, such as these five FBT-inspired 'DREAMS' sessions, may be an effective intervention to offer to youth who present with mild eating disorders.",2383525620.0, Journal Article,2020
281,The Impact of Climate Change on Mental Health: A Systematic Descriptive Review.,"Background Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time. The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental. However, there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change.
 Methods Literature available on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library until end of June 2019 were reviewed. The total number of articles and association reports was 445. From these, 163 were selected. We looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia, mood disorder and depression, suicide, aggressive behaviors, despair for the loss of usual landscape, and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather. Review of literature was then divided into specific areas: the course of change in mental health, temperature, water, air pollution, drought, as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations.
 Results Climate change has an impact on a large part of the population, in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health. However, the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect. Lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue. It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly-some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc.
 Conclusions The effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term. Acute events can act through mechanisms similar to that of traumatic stress, leading to well-understood psychopathological patterns. In addition, the consequences of exposure to extreme or prolonged weather-related events can also be delayed, encompassing disorders such as posttraumatic stress, or even transmitted to later generations.",2383525617.0, Systematic Review,2020
282,"Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Tele-Based Coaching for Farmers, Foresters and Gardeners to Prevent Depression: Study Protocol of an 18-Month Follow-Up Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (TEC-A).","Background: Farmers show high levels of depressive symptoms and mental health problems in various studies. This study is part of a nationwide prevention project carried out by a German social insurance company for farmers, foresters, and gardeners (SVLFG) to implement internet- and tele-based services among others to improve mental health in this population. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of personalized tele-based coaching for reducing depressive symptom severity and preventing the onset of clinical depression, compared to enhanced treatment as usual. Methods: In a two-armed, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (N = 312) with follow-ups at post-treatment (6 months), 12 and 18 months, insured farmers, foresters, and gardeners, collaborating family members and pensioners with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) will be randomly allocated to personalized tele-based coaching or enhanced treatment as usual. The coaching is provided by psychologists and consists of up to 34 tele-based sessions for 25-50 min delivered over 6 months. Primary outcome is depressive symptom severity at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include depression onset, anxiety, stress, and quality of life. A health-economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective. Discussion: This study is the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial evaluating the (cost-)effectiveness of a nationwide tele-based preventive service for farmers. If proven effective, the implementation of personalized tele-based coaching has the potential to reduce disease burden and health care costs both at an individual and societal level.

283,Family Features of Social Withdrawal Syndrome (Hikikomori).,"Background: Family may play an important role in the origin, maintenance, and treatment of people with social withdrawal. The aim of this study is to analyze family factors related to social withdrawal syndrome. Methods: Socio-demographic, clinical, and family data, including family psychiatric history, dysfunctional family dynamics, and history of family abuse were analyzed in 190 cases of social withdrawal with a minimum duration of 6 months that started an at-home treatment program. Data were analyzed at baseline and at 12 months. Results: In 36 cases (18%) neither the patient nor the family allowed at home evaluation and treatment by the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment (CRHT) team. Patients had high rates of dysfunctional family dynamics (n = 115, 61.5%), and family psychiatric history (n = 113, 59.3%), especially maternal affective (n = 22, 42.9%), and anxiety disorders (n = 11 20.4%). There was a non-negligible percentage of family maltreatment in childhood (n = 35, 20.7%) and single-parent families (n = 66, 37.8%). Most of the cases lived with their families (n = 135, 86%), had higher family collaboration in the therapeutic plan (n = 97, 51.9%) and families were the ones to detect patient isolation and call for help (n = 140, 73.7%). Higher social withdrawal severity (as defined by at least one of: early age of onset, no family collaboration, lack of insight, higher CGSI score, and higher Zarit score), was associated with family psychiatric history, dysfunctional family dynamics, and family abuse history. All of these predictive variables were highly correlated one to each other. Conclusions: There is a high frequency of family psychiatric history, dysfunctional family dynamics, and traumatic events in childhood (family maltreatment), and these factors are closely interrelated, highlighting the potential role of family in the development and maintenance of social withdrawal.",2381623122.0, Journal Article,2020
284,The Role of Chronic Stress in Normal Visceroception: Insights From an Experimental Visceral Pain Study in Healthy Volunteers.,"Visceroception is a complex phenomenon comprising the sensation, interpretation, and integration of sensations along the gut-brain axis, including pain or defecatory urgency. Stress is considered a crucial risk factor for the development and maintenance of disorders of gut-brain signaling, which are characterized by altered visceroception. Although the broad role of stress and stress mediators in disturbed visceroception is widely acknowledged, the putative contribution of chronic stress to variations in normal visceroception remains incompletely understood. We aimed to elucidate the role of chronic stress in shaping different facets of visceroception. From a well-characterized, large sample of healthy men and women (N = 180, 50% female), volunteers presenting with low (n = 57) and elevated (n = 61) perceived chronic stress were identified based on the validated Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS). Visceral sensitivity together with perceived and recalled intensity and defecatory urgency induced by repeated rectal distensions was experimentally assessed, and compared between low and elevated stress groups. Subgroups were compared regarding state anxiety and salivary cortisol concentrations across experimental phases and with respect to psychological measures. Finally, in the full sample and in chronic stress subgroups, a recall bias in terms of a discrepancy between the perception of experimentally-induced symptoms and their recall was tested. Participants with elevated chronic stress presented with increased state anxiety and higher cortisol concentrations throughout the experimental phases compared to the group with low chronic stress. Group differences in visceral sensitivity were not evident. The elevated stress group perceived significantly higher urgency during the stimulation phase, and recalled substantially higher feelings of urgency induced by rectal distensions, while perceived and recalled intensity were comparable between groups. Volunteers with elevated stress exhibited a recall bias in terms of a higher recall relative to mean perception of urgency, whereas no such bias was observed for the intensity of experimental visceral stimulation. Our findings in healthy men and women provide first evidence that the troublesome symptom of urgency might be particularly modifiable by chronic stress and support the relevance of memory biases in visceroception. These results may help to disentangle the impact of chronic stress on altered visceroception in disturbances of gut-brain communication.",2381622306.0, Journal Article,2020
285,Imagery Rescripting: Exploratory Evaluation of a Short Intervention to Reduce Test Anxiety in University Students.,"Background Test anxiety is common in university students. Demanding schedules may contribute to the relatively low utilization of professional counseling, when compared to other anxiety disorders. A possible solution could be a psychotherapeutic short-term intervention. The present exploratory study implemented a short-term psychotherapeutic treatment, consisting of two imagery rescripting (IR) sessions. The efficacy of IR techniques has already been demonstrated in the treatment of various anxiety disorders including test anxiety.
 Methods Nine students suffering from test anxiety (m = 3, f = 6) underwent two weekly applied sessions of IR. Outcome variables were examined one week prior to (t1), immediately after (t2) and three months after (t3) the intervention, using self-evaluation questionnaires on test anxiety (PAF), depressive symptoms (BDI II), life satisfaction (FLZ), general self-efficacy and study-specific self-efficacy (WIRKALL; WIRK_STUD), intrusiveness of mental images (IFES), and change and acceptance (VEV; ZUF; BFTB).
 Results There were no dropouts. According to results from ZUF and BFTB, the participants where highly satisfied with the intervention. PAF scores decreased significantly over time (t1 to t3), whereas WIRKALL scores (t1 to t3) and WIRK_STUD scores (t1 to t3 and t2 to t3) increased significantly. IFES scores decreased immediately after the intervention (t1 compared to t2) and further after the follow-up (t1 to t3). No changes in BDI-II scores were observed.
 Discussion The findings indicate a high acceptance and efficacy of the two-session IR-intervention. Limits are the lack of a control group, and the small sample size. Further evaluation in future controlled studies is needed.",2378878679.0, Journal Article,2020
286,Deep Brain Stimulation for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Long Term Naturalistic Follow Up Study in a Single Institution.,"Introduction Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven, effective tool in the treatment of movement disorders. Expansion of indications for DBS into the realm of neuropsychiatric disorders, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), has gained fervent interest, although data on appropriate clinical utilization remains limited.
 Methods A retrospective, naturalistic study followed nine severely affected OCD patients (average YBOCs score before implantation 34.2 ± 2.5) treated with DBS of ventral capsule/ventral striatum, with average follow up of 54.8 months.
 Results With chronic stimulation (years), a majority of the patients achieved significant benefits in obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptoms. Six patients experienced periods of OCD remission following implantation. Four of the six responders required more than 12 months to achieve response. Relief of major depressive symptoms occurred in four out of six patients with documented co-morbid depression. Settings required to achieve efficacy were higher than those typically utilized for movement disorders, necessitating increased impulse generator (IPG) battery demand. We found patients benefited from conversion to a rechargeable IPG to prevent serial operations for IPG replacement. For patients with rechargeable IPGs, the repetitive habit of recharging did not appear to aggravate or trigger new obsessive-compulsive behaviors or anxiety symptoms.
 Conclusions Our study supports and builds upon other research suggesting that DBS for OCD in a real-world setting can be implemented successfully and provide long-term benefit for severely affected OCD patients. Optimal patient selection and DBS programming criteria are discussed. The use of rechargeable IPGs appears to be both cost effective and well-tolerated in this population.",2378877352.0, Journal Article,2020
287,Gender Differences in Dysfunctional Attitudes in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Background Dysfunctional attitudes play a key role in the development and prognosis of depression. Gender also plays an important role in many clinical features of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study is aimed at investigating the gender differences in dysfunctional attitudes in patients with MDD.
 Methods One hundred and seventy-two patients with MDD and 159 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Dysfunctional attitudes were assessed by the Chinese version of the dysfunctional attitude scale-form A (C-DAS-A) and depression severity was assessed by the 24-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD24). The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA14) was used to measure anxiety. Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) of gender and diagnosis on C-DAS-A total and factor scores was adopted with age, education, and body mass index (BMI) controlled. Multiple linear regression analyses of DAS were performed in the MDD group.
 Results First, the C-DAS-A score in the MDD group was increased significantly than HCs. Second, female patients with MDD showed significantly higher scores in C-DAS-A total and three-factor scores (seeking applause, dependence, and self-determination attitude), while no significant difference between female HCs and male HCs was detected. Third, five variables (age, gender, smoking history, HAMD24, and HAMA14) had predictive effects on and gender showed the greatest contributions to C-DAS-A total and three-factor scores (seeking applause, dependence, and self-determination attitude).
 Conclusion Females with MDD may be linked to more severe cognitive distortion than their male counterparts in seeking applause, dependence, and self-determination attitude, supporting the reasonableness for gender-specific psychosocial interventions.",2377993552.0, Journal Article,2020
288,Psychopathy and Corticostriatal Connectivity: The Link to Criminal Behavior in Methamphetamine Dependence.,"Methamphetamine use and psychopathy are associated with criminal behavior; however, it is unclear how methamphetamine use and psychopathy interact to promote violent, economic and drug offenses. Abnormalities in corticostriatal functional connectivity are exhibited in both psychopathic and methamphetamine dependent individuals, which may contribute to criminal behavior through maladaptive and impulsive decision-making processes. This study shows that psychopathic traits contribute to weaker corticostriatal connectivity in methamphetamine dependence and contributes to an increase in criminal behavior. As the propensity to engage in criminal activity is dependent on a number of factors, a hierarchical regression identifies the contribution of the impulsive antisocial domain of psychopathy, anxiety, years of methamphetamine use and corticostriatal connectivity on different types of criminal offenses. Methamphetamine use and psychopathic traits reduce treatment responsiveness and increase the likelihood of recidivism, and it is therefore important to understand the factors underlying the propensity to engage in criminal behavior.",2377990758.0, Journal Article,2020
289,The Heterogeneity of Mental Health Assessment.,"Across the landscape of mental health research and diagnosis, there is a diverse range of questionnaires and interviews available for use by clinicians and researchers to determine patient treatment plans or investigate internal and external etiologies. Although individually, these tools have each been assessed for their validity and reliability, there is little research examining the consistency between them in terms of what symptoms they assess, and how they assess those symptoms. Here, we provide an analysis of 126 different questionnaires and interviews commonly used to diagnose and screen for 10 different disorder types including depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), addiction, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as comparator questionnaires and interviews that offer an all-in-one cross-disorder assessment of mental health. We demonstrate substantial inconsistency in the inclusion and emphasis of symptoms assessed within disorders as well as considerable symptom overlap across disorder-specific tools. Within the same disorder, similarity scores across assessment tools ranged from 29% for assessment of bipolar disorder to a maximum of 58% for OCD. Furthermore, when looking across disorders, 60% of symptoms were assessed in at least half of all disorders illustrating the extensive overlap in symptom profiles between disorder-specific assessment tools. Biases in assessment toward emotional, cognitive, physical or behavioral symptoms were also observed, further adding to the heterogeneity across assessments. Analysis of other characteristics such as the time period over which symptoms were assessed, as well as whether there was a focus toward frequency, severity or duration of symptoms also varied substantially across assessment tools. The consequence of this inconsistent and heterogeneous assessment landscape is that it hinders clinical diagnosis and treatment and frustrates understanding of the social, environmental, and biological factors that contribute to mental health symptoms and disorders. Altogether, it underscores the need for standardized assessment tools that are more disorder agnostic and span the full spectrum of mental health symptoms to aid the understanding of underlying etiologies and the discovery of new treatments for psychiatric dysfunction.",2377682624.0, Journal Article,2020
290,"Long-Term Impact of War, Civil War, and Persecution in Civilian Populations-Conflict and Post-Traumatic Stress in African Communities.","This chapter describes how chronic conflict, warfare, and persecution, as lived experiences, have created significant mental distress in communities on the African continent. There is a growing body of research that highlights increasing mental distress in Africa e.g., about sexuality, health, disease, modernity, climate, politics, culture, religion, ethnicities, race, economies etc. Many of these stresses and uncertainties are driven by political persecution, war, and conflict. This has shaped many African people's attitudes and government policies and an increasing scholarly interest in exploring these ""uncertainties and mental distresses in Africa."" The chapter will show how trauma, as seen in conflict/post-conflict settings in Africa, causes significant mental stress and associated social problems as well as medically-defined PTSD syndromes, anxiety, and depression which cause much morbidity and retard development in many African communities. Taking a classical look at post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, the chapter explores the presentation of the various physical and mental clinical syndromes related to war-trauma on the African continent and the consequent health-seeking behaviors of the African peoples in this regard. The term ""culture-bound PTSD syndromes"" will be introduced and discussed in the broader context of treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention on the continent and worldwide. It will also discuss the dilemma of the vicious cycles of trauma driven by appetitive aggression in today's Africa which portends to further retard socio-economic development and drives the trans-generational perpetuation of ethnic-based conflicts including genocides. Despite this mass traumatization, the chapter points to the virtual absence of post-conflict mental health policies in almost all African countries, hence leading to discussions of ""best-practices"" recommendations.",2376226995.0, Journal Article,2020
291,Interoception in Anorexia Nervosa: Exploring Associations With Alexithymia and Autistic Traits.,"Background Previous research on whether interoception is altered in anorexia nervosa (AN) using the heartbeat tracking task has yielded inconsistent results. However, no previous research has examined whether interoception is associated with alexithymia and autistic traits in AN, conditions which are more prevalent in this population and thought to be related to performance in this task. The aim of this study was to explore whether altered interoception in AN is associated with alexithymia and autistic traits.
 Methods We assessed interoceptive accuracy using the heartbeat tracking task in n = 37 people with AN, and n = 37 age and gender matched healthy controls (HC), and explored within the AN group if interoceptive accuracy was related to self-rated alexithymia or autistic traits. We also assessed self-reported interoceptive ability, and the relationship between subjective and actual performance.
 Results Heartbeat tracking task performance was not found to be altered in the AN group compared to the HC group. However, confidence ratings in task performance in the AN group were lower compared to the HC group. Unlike the HC group, confidence ratings in the AN group did not correlate with task performance. Within the AN group there was no relationship between interoceptive accuracy, alexithymia, and autistic traits, after controlling for the potential confounders of anxiety and depression. There was a relationship between confidence ratings and illness severity in the AN group.
 Conclusion The results found no differences between heartbeat tracking task performance in people with AN compared to HC. There was no association between task performance, alexithymia and autistic traits in AN. Results do suggest that people with AN exhibit lowered confidence in their task performance, and that they may lack insight into this performance compared to HC. The findings are discussed in the context of potential significant limitations of the heartbeat tracking task, with recommendations for future research into interoception in AN.",2375913899.0, Journal Article,2020
292,Integrating Urban Adolescent Mental Health Into Urban Sustainability Collective Action: An Application of Shiffman &amp; Smith's Framework for Global Health Prioritization.,"The majority (55%) of the world's population lives in urban environments. Of relevance to global mental health, the rapid growth in urban populations around the world and the attendant risks coincide with the presence of the largest population of adolescents the global community has seen to date. Recent reviews on the effects of the urban environment on mental health report a greater risk of depression, anxiety, and some psychotic disorders among urban dwellers. Increased risk for mental disorders is associated with concentrated poverty, low social capital, social segregation, and other social and environmental adversities that occur more frequently in cities. To address these problems, urban adolescent mental health requires attention from decision makers as well as advocates who seek to establish sustainable cities. We examine opportunities to increase the prominence of urban adolescent mental health on the global health and development agenda using Shiffman and Smith's framework for policy priorities, and we explore approaches to increasing its relevance for urban health and development policy communities. We conclude with suggestions for expanding the community of actors who guide the field and bridging the fields of mental health and urban development to meet urban adolescent mental health needs.",2375910855.0, Journal Article,2020
293,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Antenatal Depression in a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial and Effects on Neurobiological, Behavioral and Cognitive Outcomes in Offspring 3-7 Years Postpartum: A Perspective Article on Study Findings, Limitations and Future Aims.","Purpose of Article In a previous pilot randomized controlled trial including 54 pregnant women with depression, maternal mood improved after Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) compared to treatment as usual (TAU), showing medium to large effect sizes. The effect persisted up to 9 months postpartum, with infant outcomes also showing medium to large effects favoring CBT in various child domains. This perspective article summarizes the results of a follow-up that was performed approximately 5 years later in the same cohort, assessing the effects of antenatal Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for depression and anxiety on child buccal cell DNA-methylation, brain morphology, behavior and cognition.
 Findings Children from the CBT group had overall lower DNA-methylation compared to children from the TAU group. Mean DNA-methylation of all NR3C1 promoter-associated probes did not differ significantly between the CBT and TAU groups. Children from the CBT group had a thicker right lateral occipital cortex and lingual gyrus. In the CBT group, Voxel-Based-Morphometry analysis identified one cluster showing increased gray matter concentration in the right medial temporal lobe, and fixel-based analysis revealed reduced fiber-bundle-cross-section in the Fornix, the Optical Tract, and the Stria Terminalis. No differences were observed in full-scale IQ or Total Problems Score. When the total of hypotheses tests in this study was considered, differences in DNA-methylation and brain measurements were no longer significant.
 Summary Our explorative findings suggest that antenatal depression treatment decreases overall child DNA-methylation, increases cortical thickness, and decreases white matter fiber-bundle cross-section in regions involved in cognitive function and the stress response. Nevertheless, larger studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary conclusion that CBT in pregnancy alters neurobiological outcomes in children.

294,Association Between BDNF Gene Variant Rs6265 and the Severity of Depression in Antidepressant Treatment-Free Depressed Patients.,"Background Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, and its dysregulation has been associated with the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders. Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone which is also produced as a cytokine by immune cells and could be a neurotrophic factor regulating the functional activity of stress-related mechanisms.
 Aim To investigate the possible relationship between depressive state and BDNF and PRL genotypes or levels with special reference to severity of depression.
 Methods Participants of 18-70 years with a clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder of at least moderate severity were included. These patients had not been treated with antidepressant drugs before admission to hospital during the preceding period of the last 6 months, and 54.5% had never been treated with antidepressant drugs during their entire life. The DNA was genotyped for rs1341239 within the prolactin and for rs6265, rs7124442, and rs11030104 within the BDNF gene. Rs11030104 violated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium distribution and was excluded from further analyses. BDNF and prolactin concentration was measured in serum by MAGPIX multiplex analyzer (Luminex, USA) using MILLIPLEX® MAP kit (Merck, Germany). Genetic associations were determined by sequentially regressing prolactin, BDNF, 17-items Hamilton's Depression (HAMD-17) and Clinical Global Impression scale, Severity (CGI-S) ratings, and depression (absent/present) on the available SNPs. Genetic associations were evaluated assuming an additive model.
 Results A total of 186 depressed patients (of which 169 were women) and 94 healthy controls (67 women) were genotyped. After excluding subjects without genetic information on all three study SNPs, 217 remained of whom 138 suffered from depression. Within depressed patients we observed an association of rs6265 with HAMD-17: mean difference (MD) 2.33 (95%CI 0.49; 4.16; p = 0.014) and CGI-S: MD 0.38 (95%CI 0.09; 0.66; p = 0.011). No significant association was observed between the prolactin SNP rs1341239 and prolactin levels. Similarly the mean differences of BDNF SNPs did not show an association with BDNF: rs6265 -0.042 ln(pg/ml) (95%CI -0.198; 0.113), and rs7124442 0.006 ln(pg/ml) (95%CI -0.117; 0.130). No other association reached statistical significance.
 Conclusion We observed a significant association between BDNF gene variant rs6265 and the severity of depression in newly admitted, antidepressant treatment-free, depressed patients. Actual PRL and BDNF levels were not elevated sufficiently in depressed patients to reach statistical significance and were not associated with the studied genotypes.",2369886730.0, Journal Article,2020
295,"Role of School Bullying Involvement in Depression, Anxiety, Suicidality, and Low Self-Esteem Among Adolescents With High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.","This study aimed to compare the severities of psychopathologies and the level of self-esteem among 219 adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who were classified into pure perpetrators, pure victims, perpetrator-victims, and neutrals in Taiwan. The experiences of school bullying involvement in the previous 1 year were measured using the Chinese version of the School Bullying Experience Questionnaire. The severities of depression, anxiety, and suicidality were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and the 5-item questionnaire from the epidemiological version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, respectively. The level of self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The results indicated that compared with the self-reported neutrals, the self-reported perpetrator-victims and pure victims had more severe depression and anxiety. No difference in depression, suicidality, anxiety, and self-esteem was found among the four groups of various parent-reported bullying involvement experiences. Mental health problems in adolescents with ASD who experienced bullying victimization should be routinely surveyed.",2362101181.0, Journal Article,2020

1,Life in a post-pandemic world: What to expect of anxiety-related conditions and their treatment,"Our research suggests that, during the current pandemic, some people have developed a COVID Stress Syndrome, characterized by fear of infection, fear of touching surfaces or objects that might be contaminated with the novel coronavirus, xenophobia (i.e., fear that foreigners might be infected with the virus), COVID-related checking and reassurance seeking, and COVID-related traumatic stress symptoms (e.g., COVID-related intrusive thoughts and nightmares). It appears that people who develop COVID Stress Syndrome have pre-existing psychopathology, particularly pre-existing high levels of health anxiety and obsessive-compulsive checking and contamination symptoms. It remains to be seen whether the COVID Stress Syndrome is simply an adjustment disorder, abating once the pandemic is over, or whether it will become chronic for some individuals.

3,The effects of imagery rescripting on memory outcomes in social anxiety disorder,"Imagery rescripting (IR) is an effective intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) that targets negative autobiographical memories. IR has been theorized to work through various memory mechanisms, including modifying the content of negative memory representations, changing memory appraisals, and improving negative schema or core beliefs about self and others. However, no prior studies have investigated the unique effects of rescripting itself relative to other IR intervention components on these proposed mechanisms. In this preliminary study, 33 individuals with SAD were randomized to receive a single session of IR, imaginal exposure (IE), or supportive counselling (SC). Memory outcomes were assessed at 1- and 2-weeks post-intervention and at 3-months follow-up. Results demonstrated that the content of participants’ autobiographical memory representations changed in distinct ways across the three conditions. Whereas IR facilitated increases only in positive/neutral memory details, IE facilitated increases in both positive/neutral and negative memory details and SC facilitated no changes in memory details. Although memory appraisals did not differ across conditions, participants who received IR were more likely to update their negative memory-derived core beliefs. These unique effects of rescripting on memory representations and core beliefs enhance our understanding of the memory-based mechanisms of IR within the context of exposure-based learning for people with SAD.

4,Mediators of treatment effect in minimal-contact cognitive behaviour therapy for severe health anxiety: A theory-driven analysis based on a randomised controlled trial,"Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious for severe health anxiety, but little is known about mechanisms. We analysed putative mediators of change based on 13 weekly assessments in a randomised controlled trial (N = 132) of exposure-based minimal-contact CBT (guided Internet-delivered CBT, unguided Internet-delivered CBT and bibliotherapy) vs. a waitlist control for severe health anxiety. We hypothesised that the effect of CBT on health anxiety would be mediated by non-reactivity to inner experiences, health anxiety behaviours and perceived competence. We also explored somatosensory amplification. In parallel process growth models, non-reactivity, health anxiety behaviours and perceived competence—but not somatosensory amplification—were influenced by CBT and associated with health anxiety. Random intercepts cross-lagged panel models were used to study within-individual ordering of change. None of the putative mediators systematically predicted subsequent changes in health anxiety. Rather, changes in health anxiety predicted subsequent changes in all putative mediators. In summary, CBT influenced health anxiety behaviours, non-reactivity to inner experiences and perceived competence, and these variables were associated with the outcome. However, their role as mediators was not corroborated because we found no evidence that changes in these variables predicted subsequent changes in health anxiety. We encourage further research into mediators of CBT for health anxiety.

5,Do religious patients need religious psychotherapists? A naturalistic treatment matching study among orthodox Jews,"Religion is professed by the majority of the general population, but a minority of mental health practitioners. We evaluated whether religious patients benefited more from treatment with religious psychotherapists in a naturalistic study among adult Orthodox Jewish ( n = 117) and control patients ( n = 91) receiving psychotherapy from Orthodox Jewish ( n = 15) and other ( n = 7) psychotherapists at a New York based outpatient clinic. Groups did not differ with respect to diagnoses (χ² (200) = 7.5, p = .76), likelihood of having an Orthodox Jewish therapist (χ² (200) = .06, p = .81), or number of therapy sessions ( t (206) = .73, p = .47). Multilevel regression modeling revealed that Orthodox patients reported lower initial anxiety ( t (198) = 3.71, p &lt; .001, d = .54) and depression ( t (198) = 3.71, p &lt; .001, d = .54, d = .50), but were equivalent to controls at termination (Anxiety t (189) = .36, p = .72; Depression t (182) = 1.00, p = .32). Interactions between patient and therapist religious affiliations were not significant. These results suggest that religious (and non-religious) patients may benefit equally from treatment delivered by religious and non-religious therapists.

6,The impact of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety on cyberchondria,"Cyberchondria refers to an emotional-behavioural pattern whereby excessive online searches lead to increased anxiety about one’s own health status. It has been shown to be associated with health anxiety, however it is unknown whether existing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions targeting health anxiety also improve cyberchondria. This study aimed to determine whether internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for severe health anxiety led to improvements in self-reported cyberchondria and whether improvements in cyberchondria were associated with improvements in health anxiety observed during treatment. Methods: We analysed secondary data from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an iCBT group (n = 41) to an active control group who underwent psychoeducation, monitoring and clinical support (n = 41) in health anxious patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of Illness Anxiety Disorder and/or Somatic Symptom Disorder. The iCBT group showed a significantly greater reduction in cyberchondria compared to the control group, with large differences at post-treatment on the Cyberchondria Severity Scale Total scale (CSS; Hedges g = 1.09), and the Compulsion, Distress, Excessiveness subscales of the CSS (g’s: 0.8–1.13). Mediation analyses showed improvements in health anxiety in the iCBT group were mediated by improvements in all of the CSS subscales, except for the Mistrust subscale. Conclusions: Internet CBT for health anxiety improves cyberchondria.

1,Moderators of treatment response to an intervention for nonsuicidal self-injury in young adults,"Objective: Despite the prevalence and impact of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), there are few treatments developed to treat the behavior specifically, and little is known about moderators of treatment response. The Treatment for Self-Injurious Behaviors (T-SIB), a brief, behavioral intervention, was developed to treat NSSI in young adults; a previous pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing T-SIB with treatment as usual (TAU) provided support for the intervention. This study examined demographic, clinical, and NSSI-related predictors of treatment outcome in the pilot RCT for T-SIB. Method: Young adults (N = 33) were randomized to receive T-SIB or treatment as usual; all participants were included in intent-to-treat analyses. The primary outcome of NSSI behaviors was assessed at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and 3-month follow up, and potential moderators were assessed at baseline. Results: Greater lifetime and last year NSSI frequency was associated with fewer NSSI behaviors at posttreatment and follow up among participants in T-SIB. Anxious symptoms also moderated treatment outcomes, but other demographic and clinical variables did not. Conclusion: Previous research has shown that T-SIB is more effective than TAU overall; the current study suggests that T-SIB may be effective for individuals with more frequent NSSI and those with elevated anxiety. A larger evaluation of T-SIB is supported. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",2459435074.0, Journal Article,2020
2,Reassessing evidence-based content in popular smartphone apps for depression and anxiety: Developing and applying user-adjusted analyses,"Objective: To assess the dissemination of evidence-based content within smartphone apps for depression and anxiety by developing and applying user-adjusted analysis-a method for weighting app content based on each app's number of active users. Method: We searched the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and identified 27 apps within the top search hits, which real-world users are most likely to encounter. We developed a codebook of evidence-based treatment elements by reviewing past research on empirically supported treatments. We coded the apps to develop an initial tally of the frequency of treatment elements within the mental health (MH) apps. We then developed and applied user-adjusted analysis to refine the tallies based on each app's number of monthly active users. Results: The 2 most popular apps were responsible for 90% of monthly active users, and user-adjusted analysis markedly altered conclusions of prior reports based on tallies alone. For example, mindfulness was present in 37% of apps but reached 96% of monthly active users, cognitive restructuring was present in 22% but reached only 2%, and exposure was present in 7% but reached only 0.0004%. Conclusions: The potential impact of MH apps on mental health may be best evaluated via assessment that combines tallies of evidence-based content with data on the content users are actually accessing. Given wide variation in the popularity of MH apps, findings weighted by usage data may differ markedly from findings based on raw tallies alone.

3,"Temporal relations among sleep, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms during intensive cognitive–behavioral treatment","Objective: Bidirectional relations between sleep disturbances, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms have been frequently observed in empirical studies; however, little is known about the temporal relations between these variables in the context of treatment. Method: The current study examines the temporal relations between sleep parameters, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms in a large sample of individuals undergoing intensive cognitive–behavioral partial hospital treatment (N = 1,184). Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were fit to these data to determine whether (1) sleep parameters uniquely predicted subsequent depression and anxiety symptoms and (2) depression and anxiety symptoms uniquely predicted subsequent sleep parameters. Results: Results revealed relations in both directions: later than usual bedtimes predicted higher than usual anxiety and depression the next day, shorter than usual sleep duration predicted higher than usual depression the next day, shorter than usual nighttime sleep onset latency predicted higher than usual anxiety the next day, and higher than usual anxiety predicted shorter than usual sleep duration on the next night. Conclusions: These finding suggest the potential value of examining sleep behaviors associated with sleep timing and circadian rhythms as important transdiagnostic factors during treatment for anxiety and depression. We discuss the implications for future studies of the relations between sleep and psychopathology symptoms and understanding individuals' experiences in the context of cognitive–behavioral treatment.

4,Predicting sudden gains before treatment begins: An examination of pretreatment intraindividual variability in symptoms,"Objective: Sudden gains during psychotherapy have been found to be predictive of positive treatment outcomes. Previous attempts at predicting occurrence of sudden gains have yielded equivocal findings. Recently, intraindividual variability in symptoms during treatment was suggested as a trans-therapeutic and trans-diagnostic predictor of sudden gains. The goal of the present study was to examine this predictor in Internet-delivered treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to examine whether this predictor predicts sudden gains when measured before treatment begins. Method: We examined data from a preregistered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Internet-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD (n = 101). We measured variability in symptoms both within-treatment and before treatment (i.e. during waitlist). Results: Intraindividual variability in symptoms significantly predicted sudden gains both when measured before treatment or within-treatment and correctly classified 84% and 83% of individuals to sudden gains versus non-sudden gains status, respectively. Conclusions: Intraindividual variability in symptoms can predict sudden gains in Internet-delivered treatment for SAD, thus supporting its trans-diagnostic and trans-therapeutic nature. Predicting sudden gains before treatment begins has implications for treatment planning and clinical decision making as well as for personalized tailoring of interventions.",2435542561.0, Journal Article,2020
5,Reevaluating ruptures and repairs in alliance: Between- and within-session processes in cognitive–behavioral therapy and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy,"Objective: Ruptures and repairs in alliance and their association with treatment outcome have been studied widely. Many of these studies have used indirect methods, focused on decreases in alliance across sessions while measuring alliance at postsession. However, this approach does not establish whether observed decreases occur within (as insinuated by most theories) or between sessions. In the current study, we examined decreases of alliance measured both pre- and postsession in 3 clinical trials and explored the phenomenology and interpretation of these decreases. Additionally, we investigated the effects of rupture magnitude and the interpretation of repairs on treatment outcome, examining whether the ""repairs benefit"" or the ""unrepaired ruptures damage"" theories were supported by the data. Method: Presession and postsession therapeutic alliance and outcome measures were examined from patients who participated in 1 of 3 studies: cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (N = 29), CBT for panic disorder (N = 31), or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression (N = 44). Patterns of change in alliance are described. Ruptures and repairs are examined according to several criteria and are used to predict outcome using longitudinal multilevel modeling. Results: In all samples, alliance systematically decreased between sessions and increased within them. Decreases in alliance as measured by traditional postsession to postsession were unreliable predictors of within-session decreases in alliance and of outcomes. Conclusions: Decreases in alliance across sessions are not valid measures of ruptures as defined by most theories. Instead, we suggest that they are indicative of an ebb-and-flow model for the development of alliance.",2435541033.0, Journal Article,2020
6,Community-based randomized controlled trial of psychological first aid with crime victims,"Objective: The first randomized controlled trial of psychological first aid (PFA) was conducted, using crime victims as participants. For study Aim 1, investigators tested whether paraprofessional victim advocates could be trained to deliver PFA to crime victims. For study Aim 2, investigators tested the effect of PFA delivery on victims' psychiatric (i.e., symptoms of PTSD, somatization, depression, anxiety, and substance use) and adaptive functioning outcomes. Method: Two law enforcement agencies served as study sites. A dynamic wait-listed design included a phase when advocates at both sites delivered usual services (US) to victims, a phase when one site was randomly selected to deliver PFA while the other delivered US, and a phase when both sites delivered PFA. Across all phases, 172 crime victims (mean age = 36.4 years; 81% female) were recruited, and a battery assessed their psychiatric symptoms and adaptive functioning at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 months postbaseline. Results: From the US to PFA phases, advocates' PFA adherence (i.e., their delivery of PFA components) increased significantly. PFA did not outperform US with regard to improvement on victims' individual psychiatric and adaptive functioning outcomes. However, on a composite global functioning outcome created for this trial, PFA yielded significantly greater improvement relative to US. Conclusion: Paraprofessional victim advocates have the capacity to deliver PFA. Conclusions regarding the effectiveness of PFA for crime victims vary depending on the nature of the scored outcome variable (individual vs. global), highlighting the importance of careful outcome measurement considerations in future research on PFA.",2435541516.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
7,"Single-session digital intervention for adolescent depression, anxiety, and well-being: Outcomes of a randomized controlled trial with Kenyan adolescents","Background: Adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in sub-Saharan African countries, yet treatment options are scarce, and stigma limits help-seeking. Brief, computerized single-session interventions (SSIs) that contain empirically supported stigma-reducing elements may help expand access to treatment. We developed and evaluated such an intervention for Kenyan adolescents. Method: High school students (N = 103, age 13–18) were randomized to a digital SSI Shamiri-Digital (Shamiri means ""thrive"" in Kiswahili) or a study-skills control intervention. Shamiri-Digital consisted of reading and writing activities about 3 concepts: growth mindset, gratitude, and value affirmation. Both Shamiri-Digital and the study-skills control condition were delivered electronically in schools. Results: Compared to the control, Shamiri-Digital produced a greater reduction in adolescent depressive symptoms in both the full sample (p = .028, d = 0.50) and a subsample of youths with moderate to severe depression symptoms (p = .010, d = 0.83) from baseline to 2-week follow-up. The effects exceed the mean effects reported in meta-analyses of full-length, face-to-face psychotherapy for youth depression. There were no significant effects on anxiety symptoms, well-being, or happiness. Conclusion: This is the first report that a brief, computerized SSI may reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Replication trials with extended follow-ups will help gauge the strength and durability of these effects.",2415495579.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
8,"A transdiagnostic minority stress intervention for gender diverse sexual minority women's depression, anxiety, and unhealthy alcohol use: A randomized controlled trial","Objective: To remedy the notable gap in evidence-based treatments for sexual minority women, this study tested the efficacy of a minority-stress-focused cognitive–behavioral treatment intended to improve this population's mental and behavioral health. Method: The intervention, EQuIP (Empowering Queer Identities in Psychotherapy), was adapted from a transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral treatment as also recently adapted for sexual minority men. Sexual minority women at risk of mental and behavioral health problems (n = 19) and expert providers with this population (n = 12) shaped the treatment's development, including by supporting its primary focus on universal and minority-stress-focused processes underlying this population's disproportionately poor mental and behavioral health. The resulting treatment was then delivered to young adult sexual minority women (n = 60; M age = 25.58; 41.67% racial/ethnic minority; 43.33% transgender/nonbinary) experiencing depression/anxiety and past 90-day heavy alcohol use. Results: Compared to waitlist (n = 30), participants randomized to immediately receive EQuIP (n = 30) experienced significantly reduced depression and anxiety (d = 0.85, 0.86, respectively); effects for alcohol use problems were smaller (d = 0.29) and marginally significant. In pre- to post-intervention pooled analyses, effect sizes for minority stress processes (mean d = .25) and universal risk factors (mean d = .48), through which the treatment was expected to work, were small and moderate, respectively, and in the expected direction. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for a minority-stress-focused transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral treatment for sexual minority women. These first results can launch exploration of other mechanisms and modalities through which to equip this population with evidence-based support.",2415494336.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
9,Mechanisms of change in female-specific and gender-neutral cognitive behavioral therapy for women with alcohol use disorder,"Objective: In a randomized trial for women with alcohol use disorders (AUD), the efficacy of Female-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (FS-CBT) was compared with Gender-Neutral CBT (GN-CBT; Epstein et al., 2018). The current study examined whether putative mechanisms of change differed between treatment conditions, using a novel statistical approach. Both treatments were hypothesized to work by increasing use of alcohol-related coping skills (coping) and confidence to abstain from drinking (confidence), but FS-CBT additionally targeted female-salient mechanisms: anxiety, depression, sociotropy (i.e., overinvestment in others' opinion of oneself), autonomy, and social networks supportive of abstinence. Method: Ninety-nine women with AUD (55 in GN-CBT, 44 in FS-CBT) completed self-report assessments at baseline and 0, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Multilevel vector autoregression estimation was used to analyze associations between putative mechanisms of change, and network models of those associations were generated using network analysis. Results: Across conditions, higher confidence and coping were directly associated with less drinking; autonomy was directly and indirectly associated with drinking. Additionally, network analysis indicated that although variation in depression was associated with change in other variables specifically for GN-CBT, sociotropy was associated with change specifically in FS-CBT. Conclusions: Women receiving CBT-AUD changed their drinking through increased confidence to abstain and greater use of coping skills. Autonomy played a central role in behavior change across treatment conditions. Participants receiving treatment tailored to women also changed through decreases in sociotropy and increases in social support for abstinence. For women who received standard CBT, changes in depression were important to clinical improvement.",2404657343.0, Journal Article,2020
10,Cognitive Processes Associated With Sudden Gains in Cognitive Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Routine Care,"Objective: Although most studies investigating sudden gains in treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report a positive association between sudden gains and outcomes at the end of treatment, less is known about sudden gains in routine clinical care and the processes involved in their occurrence. This study investigated changes in cognitive factors (negative appraisals, trauma memory characteristics) before, during, and after sudden gains in PTSD symptom severity. Method: Two samples (N 1 = 248, N 2 = 234) of patients who received trauma-focused cognitive therapy for PTSD in routine clinical care were analyzed. Mahalanobis distance matching, including the propensity score, was used to compare patients with sudden gains and similar patients without sudden gains. Estimates from both samples were meta-analyzed to obtain pooled effects. Results: Patients with sudden gains (N 1 = 76, N 2 = 87) reported better treatment outcomes in PTSD symptom severity, depression, and anxiety at the end of therapy and follow-up than those without sudden gains. No baseline predictors of sudden gains could be reliably identified. During sudden gains, those with sudden gains had greater changes in both cognitive factors than matched patients. Meta-analyses of the two samples showed that negative appraisals had already decreased in the session prior to sudden gains compared with matched patients. Conclusions: The pooled estimates suggest that changes in negative trauma-related appraisals precede sudden gains in PTSD symptoms. The results suggest that interventions that promote change in appraisals may also facilitate sudden gains in therapy.",2389726810.0, Journal Article,2020
11,"Longitudinal associations between minority stress, internalizing symptoms, and substance use among sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth","Objective: Sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth (SGM-AFAB) are at increased risk for anxiety, depression, and substance use and problems compared with heterosexual cisgender women. Cross-sectional research has demonstrated that minority stressors are associated with anxiety, depression, and substance use. However, longitudinal research is limited and the examination of prospective associations between minority stressors, mental health, and substance use is even more sparse. Method: We utilized 4 waves of data (6 months between waves) from a diverse (26.0% non-Latinx White; 26.2% gender minorities) longitudinal cohort of 488 SGM-AFAB (16- to 32-years-old at Wave 1) to examine concurrent and prospective associations between 3 minority stressors (internalized stigma, microaggressions, victimization) and anxiety, depression, and alcohol and cannabis use and problems. Results: At the within-person level, results indicated that when SGM-AFAB experienced more minority stressors than usual, they reported more concurrent and prospective anxiety and depression. Additionally, when SGM-AFAB experienced more microaggressions than usual, they were more likely to use alcohol and cannabis, and when they experienced more victimization than usual, they reported more concurrent alcohol and cannabis use problems. No prospective associations between minority stressors and substance use were significant. Conclusions: Findings indicate that minority stressors were consistently associated with internalizing symptoms, both concurrently and prospectively, while evidence for associations between minority stressors and substance use/problems was less consistent. These findings highlight the need for interventions that that teach SGM-AFAB skills for effectively coping with minority stress.",2389726755.0, Journal Article,2020
12,Text message safety behavior reduction for social anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder propose that maladaptive safety behaviors (SBs; i.e., behaviors intended to avoid, prevent, or manage threat) play an important maintaining role in the disorder. Though targeting these behaviors for elimination is one component of contemporary cognitive–behavioral therapies for social anxiety, it has rarely been examined as a specific treatment strategy, and, to our knowledge, it has not yet been examined in isolation as an intervention for social anxiety. The current study evaluated an SB reduction intervention for social anxiety that consisted of brief text message reminders. Method: Individuals with elevated social anxiety (N = 94) were recruited from across the United States and randomized to receive one of two 1-month text message interventions consisting of 16 text message reminders to avoid SBs or focus on the present. Symptoms were assessed at pre- and posttreatment, as well as at 1-month follow-up. Results: Both treatments were associated with substantial symptom reduction. Compared to the present-focused text message condition, SB elimination led to lower SB frequency at posttreatment (sr² = .044, p = .048) and lower social anxiety at follow-up (sr² = .096, p = .005). Conclusions: These preliminary findings provide novel evidence for the importance of SBs in social anxiety and suggest text message SB reduction may be an effective, highly accessible intervention for individuals with social anxiety.",2389726682.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
13,Predicting treatment failure in regular care Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for depression and anxiety using only weekly symptom measures,"Objective: Therapist guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) is effective, but as in traditional CBT, not all patients improve, and clinicians generally fail to identify them early enough. We predict treatment failure in 12-week regular care ICBT for Depression, Panic disorder and Social anxiety disorder, using only patients' weekly symptom ratings to identify when the accuracy of predictions exceed 2 benchmarks: (a) chance, and (b) empirically derived clinician preferences for actionable predictions. Method: Screening, pretreatment and weekly symptom ratings from 4310 regular care ICBT-patients from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Stockholm, Sweden was analyzed in a series of regression models each adding 1 more week of data. Final score was predicted in a holdout test sample, which was then categorized into Success or Failure (failure defined as the absence of both remitter and responder status). Classification analyses with Balanced Accuracy and 95% Confidence intervals was then compared to predefined benchmarks. Results: Benchmark 1 (better than chance) was reached 1 week into all treatments. Social anxiety disorder reached Benchmark 2 (&gt; 65%) at week 5, whereas Depression and Panic Disorder reached it at week 6. Conclusions: For depression, social anxiety and panic disorder, prediction with only patient-rated symptom scores can detect treatment failure 6 weeks into ICBT, with enough accuracy for a clinician to take action. Early identification of failing treatment attempts may be a viable way to increase the overall success rate of existing psychological treatments by providing extra clinical resources to at-risk patients, within a so-called Adaptive Treatment Strategy.",2380036990.0, Journal Article,2020
14,A randomized clinical trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for women with irritable bowel syndrome-Effects and mechanisms,"Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of brain–gut interaction. Previous studies suggest that mindfulness could be therapeutic for IBS patients, however no study has evaluated the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy adapted for patients with IBS (MBCT-IBS). A 6-week MBCT-IBS course was designed to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MBCT-IBS and to investigate its therapeutic mechanisms in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Sixty-seven female patients with IBS were randomized to MBCT-IBS (MG; n = 36) or a waitlist (WL; n = 31) control condition. Patients completed standardized self-report measures of IBS symptom severity, IBS quality of life, maladaptive illness cognitions (catastrophizing, visceral anxiety sensitivity) and mindfulness at baseline, after 2 treatment sessions, at posttreatment, and at 6-week follow-up. Self-referential processing of illness and health was measured with an implicit association test (IAT). Results: The MG reported significantly greater reductions in IBS symptoms (p = .003) and improvements in quality of life (p &lt; .001) at follow-up compared with the WL. Changes in visceral anxiety sensitivity and pain catastrophizing at posttreatment and reductions in the IAT-score after 2 sessions combined with increases in nonjudgmental awareness at posttreatment mediated reductions in IBS symptoms. Conclusions: MBCT-IBS has the potential to reduce IBS symptoms and increase quality of life. MBCT-IBS may exert its effect on IBS symptoms via reducing maladaptive illness cognitions and activating changes in self-processing (reducing biases in self-referent processing of illness and health and increasing nonjudgmental awareness).",2380036482.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
15,A Common Elements Approach to the Development of a Modular Cognitive Behavioral Theory for Chronic Loneliness,"Background: Loneliness is a transdiagnostic clinical phenomenon that can significantly impact mental health and well-being across the lifespan. Objective: The aim was to combine existing theory and evidence-based treatment approaches to propose a comprehensive transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral analysis of the maintenance of chronic loneliness relevant across disorders, age groups, and populations. Method: A distillation and matching model-framework approach was taken to identify interventions designed to reduce loneliness. Eligible studies were coded for the presence of practice elements. The findings were combined with an analysis of the broader literature on loneliness and psychopathology to derive a comprehensive cognitive–behavioral analysis of the maintenance of loneliness over time across populations. Results: The search yielded 11 studies containing 14 practice elements with relative frequencies ranging from 7% to 64%. The identified practice elements target putative mechanisms such as negative interpersonal appraisals, anxiety, and social skills deficits. Counterproductive behavior and cognitive processes such as self-focused attention were identified as maintenance factors based on the broader literature. A modular transdiagnostic model with multiple pathways is proposed to be consistent with the existing theoretical and treatment literature. Conclusions: Combining the distillation and matching model framework with existing theory from the literature is a novel approach for developing a model of factors that maintain loneliness over time. The model has varying treatment implications for different populations including children with autism spectrum disorders and bereaved older adults. Targeting transdiagnostic processes has the potential to transform interventions for loneliness across a range of formats and settings.",2360026560.0, Journal Article,2020
16,A Multimethod Investigation of the Impact of Attentional Control on a Brief Intervention for Anxiety and Depression,"Objective: Anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety) is a malleable risk factor for anxiety and depression. Brief computerized interventions, including elements of psychoeducation, interoceptive exposure, and cognitive bias modification (CBM) can reduce anxiety and depression through AS reductions. These interventions are not equally efficacious for all who receive them, suggesting the need to explore moderators. Attentional control (AC), the ability to regulate attentional processes by focusing and shifting attention as needed, has been linked to AS, anxiety, and depression suggesting that it may moderate treatment efficacy. The moderating effects of self-report and neurophysiological (i.e., theta/beta ratio, occipital alpha power) indices associated with AC processes on a brief AS-focused intervention were examined. Method: Participants (M age = 36.43, SD = 16.47; 57.5% female) were randomized to cognitive AS treatment (n = 67) or a repeated contact control (n = 60). Results: Occipital alpha power moderated the rate of change in AS across three weekly treatment sessions as well as the effects of the intervention on anxiety and depression symptoms at the 1-month follow-up. Lower alpha power was associated with a swifter reduction in AS symptoms and marginally lower levels of anxiety and depression at follow-up. AC indices were not correlated with each other. Conclusions: These findings present a novel hypothesis that lower AC as indexed by occipital alpha power might increase treatment gains in the context of a brief transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety and depression. These findings also highlight the need for external validity studies of AC indices.",2360026305.0, Journal Article,2020
17,Effects of Modifying Interpretation Bias on Transdiagnostic Repetitive Negative Thinking,"Objective: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT; e.g., worry and rumination) is common across emotional disorders, as is the tendency to generate negative interpretations (interpretation bias). Ameliorating negative interpretations via cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) reduces worry/rumination, and improves mood in people diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or depression. We investigated whether these findings generalize to high worry or rumination populations, irrespective of diagnosis, and whether effects are increased by enhancing emotional engagement with training with active generation of positive resolutions of ambiguity and imagery. Method: Community volunteers with excessive worry and/or rumination, who were above clinical cut-off on anxiety and/or depression measures, were allocated to an active control condition (n = 54), interpretation training condition with prior activation of RNT (CBM_RNT; n = 54), or training condition augmented with positive outcome generation and imagery (CBM_ENH; n = 53). Interpretation bias, RNT, and mood were assessed before and following 10 Internet-based sessions completed within a 1-month period. RNT and mood questionnaires were also completed at 1-month follow-up. Results: After training, both forms of CBM-I (vs. control) facilitated more positive interpretations and reduced negative intrusions during a worry task. At 1-month follow-up, anxiety, depression, RNT, and worry in the past week were lower in the CBM-I than control conditions, but not rumination or trait worry. Compared with standard CBM-I, the augmented form facilitated more positive interpretations, reduced negative intrusions after training, and reduced trait rumination at 1-month follow-up, but it did not augment effects on trait worry, anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Interpretation bias maintains transdiagnostic RNT and Internet-based CBM-I can reduce longer-term RNT.",2360025826.0, Journal Article,2020
18,The Breadth and Potency of Transdiagnostic Cognitive Risks for Psychopathology in Youth,"Objective: Multiple cognitive risks from different theoretical paradigms (dysfunctional attitudes, negative inferential style, self-criticism, dependency, brooding) predict depression, but may be transdiagnostic vulnerabilities for multiple psychopathologies. Risk factors can be identified as broadly transdiagnostic and relatively specific to psychopathological outcomes by organizing the common and specific aspects of each respective construct using latent bifactor models, and by examining links between dimensions of risk and psychopathology. This study evaluated (a) whether a bifactor model of cognitive vulnerabilities, including a general cognitive risk dimension (c factor) and several specific dimensions replicated in early adolescents (M age = 13.50 years) and extended to younger and older youth, and (b) how the general and specific cognitive risk dimensions related to the general psychopathology (p factor) and internalizing- and externalizing-specific dimensions. Method: Community youth (N = 571; 55% female) reported on cognitive risks; youth and a caregiver reported on psychopathologies (depression, anxiety, aggression, conduct, attention problems). Results: The cognitive risk bifactor model showed good fit and slight advantages over a correlated factors model. The bifactor model exhibited invariance across development and captured key associations that were identified when each individual cognitive risk was related to the bifactor model of psychopathology. The c factor strongly related to internalizing-specific, and moderately to the p factor and externalizing-specific dimensions. Specific cognitive risk dimensions (brooding, negative inferential style, dependency) related to all psychopathology dimensions. Conclusion: A general cognitive vulnerability (c factor) transdiagnostically associates with a breadth of psychopathologies and most potently to internalizing-specific among youth.",2360024947.0, Journal Article,2020
19,Who benefits the most from cognitive change in cognitive therapy of depression? A study of interpersonal factors,"Objective: Research suggests that decreases in negative cognitions coincide with symptom improvements over the course of cognitive therapy (CT) of depression, but the role cognitive change (CC) plays in reducing symptoms remains controversial. Method: A total of 126 adults (mean age = 31.7, SD = 13.35; 60% female; 83% Caucasian) participated in CT for depression. Patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory–II and the Immediate Cognitive Change Scale at each session. At intake evaluation, maladaptive personality traits (Personality Inventory for DSM–5, Brief Form) and interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, Short Version) were assessed via self-report, and social skills were assessed through patients' evaluation of their performance following a series of behavioral role-plays (standardized interaction task). To rule out between-patient differences as potential confounds, our model disaggregated within- and between-patient components of CC and depression scores. Results: Within-patient CC significantly predicted within-patient change in depressive symptoms. This relation was moderated by patients' evaluations of their social skills and patients' level of interpersonal problems, with CC predicting symptoms more robustly for patients with fewer perceived social skills and for those with greater interpersonal problems. Maladaptive personality traits did not emerge as a moderator. Additional analyses showed the relation of CC and symptom change was particularly strong among those with social anxiety disorder and among those observers rated as having lower social skills. Conclusions: CC in CT sessions appears to foster subsequent depressive symptom reduction, especially among patients with lower levels of self-evaluated social skills and greater interpersonal problems.",2348317906.0, Journal Article,2020
20,Effects of Safety Behavior Fading on Appearance Concerns and Related Symptoms,"Objective: Appearance-related safety behaviors (SBs; e.g., mirror checking, grooming) have been implicated in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders, and social anxiety disorder. The proposed project aimed to extend previous research efforts by exploring the experimental effects of reducing engagement in appearance-related SBs on appearance concerns and related symptoms. Method: Eighty-four undergraduate female participants with elevated appearance concerns were randomly assigned to a SB fading group or a no instructions control group. For 2 weeks, participants in the SB fading condition were sent daily reminders via text message to decrease their engagement in appearance-related SBs, whereas participants in the control group completed assessments only. Self-report assessments of study variables of interest were administered at baseline, midmanipulation, postmanipulation, and 2-week follow-up. Participants also completed an appearance-related in vivo stressor task at post, during which participants rated their reactivity to having their photographs taken from various angles. Results: Compared to the control group, the SB fading group exhibited significantly lower social anxiety, BDD symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and maladaptive cognitions at the postmanipulation and follow-up assessments. SB fading had stronger effects on BDD symptoms at postmanipulation among those high versus those low in baseline BDD symptoms. The SB fading group also showed less reactivity to some aspects of the in vivo appearance-related stressor task. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence for the importance of appearance-related SBs in the maintenance of BDD and other disorders characterized by body image disturbances. Findings point to the potential utility of decreasing appearance-related SBs as a transdiagnostic treatment strategy.",2332079141.0, Journal Article,2020
21,Social Phobia Moderates the Outcome in the EVIDENT Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial on an Internet-Based Psychological Intervention for Mild to Moderate Depressive Symptoms,"Objective: Data from the EVIDENT trial were reanalyzed to examine whether specific anxiety-related comorbidities moderate the effect of an Internet intervention on depression outcome. Method: The EVIDENT study is a randomized controlled trial that included N = 1,013 participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., scores between 5 and 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire−9 [PHQ-9]) who were randomized to a control group with access to care-as-usual (n = 504) or to an intervention group, which accessed the Internet intervention Deprexis adjunctively to care-as-usual (n = 509). Anxiety-related comorbidities (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder) were assessed with the Web Screening Questionnaire at baseline. Multilevel models were performed. Results: Twelve potential moderators (8 specific anxiety-related comorbidities, depression severity, and 3 previously identified moderators in the EVIDENT trial) were examined within 1 multilevel model, and only social phobia moderated the intervention effect on depression outcome (in favor of Deprexis). This moderating effect of social phobia did not depend on the other moderators' being included in the model. These results emerged for continuous PHQ-9 scores as well as for clinically important PHQ-9 changes as outcome (p &lt; .05). However, moderating effects did not reach small effect sizes, accounted for less than 1% of the variance in change in depressive symptoms, and showed limited reproducibility in randomly selected split halves. Conclusions: Deprexis appears to be most effective for participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms and comorbid social phobia, but further replications of this finding are necessary.",2332078874.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
22,Hostile and Harmful: Structural Stigma and Minority Stress Explain Increased Anxiety Among Migrants Living in the United Kingdom After the Brexit Referendum,"Objective: The extent to which the outcome of the European Union referendum (""Brexit"") has affected the mental health of migrants living in the United Kingdom has been the subject of much speculation. However, no empirical attempts to examine the mental health impact of the Brexit vote have been made. Through the combination of structural stigma and minority stress theories, this study examined the extent to which the outcome of the Brexit referendum was associated with the mental health of migrants in the United Kingdom as a result of increased discrimination. Method: Adult migrants living in the United Kingdom (N = 311) participated in a longitudinal survey containing measures of discrimination and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at baseline and at 1-month and 6-month follow-ups. Participant data were matched to official voting records at the electorate level. Results: The percentage of ""leave"" voters where participants lived was associated with increased discrimination, which was in turn associated with increased GAD symptoms, including the likelihood of experiencing clinically significant GAD symptoms over the course of the study (OR = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.25, 7.33]). The percentage of leave voters where participants lived was associated with increased GAD symptoms indirectly via increased discrimination (standardized indirect effect = .12; 95% bias-corrected CI [.07, .19]). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that voter referenda can have a detrimental impact on migrants' mental health. Findings illustrate how aspects of structural stigma can produce experiences of minority stress, which can lead to negative mental health outcomes for members of marginalized populations.",2332077876.0, Journal Article,2020
13,Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders among children and adolescents: A systematic review,"Background: Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders have rarely been studied, even though they are highly prevalent in children and adolescents. It is important to identify the common risk factors, so that targeted preventive care and early interventions can be provided. Methods: A systematic review of the PubMed and PsycInfo databases was conducted to 25 October 2019, according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and the quality assessment was carried out using the Joanna Briggs tools. Results: The review identified 31 studies from eight countries, including three register studies. Cohort sizes ranged from 69 to 89,404 and diagnoses cases ranged from 4 to 7867. Although various risk factors had been researched, only few of them had been repeatedly studied and the findings were highly inconsistent. The associations between the different risk factors and anxiety disorders seemed weak compared to many other psychiatric disorders, but preterm birth and maternal somatic illnesses may increase the risk for anxiety disorders in offspring. Limitations: The studies varied considerably by study design, risk factors and anxiety disorders studied, sample sizes and follow up periods. Conclusions: Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for anxiety disorders have been under-researched, compared to other psychiatric disorders. Our systematic review found weak links to prenatal events, but flagged up preterm birth and maternal somatic illnesses as possible avenues for future research.

14,Altered resting-state fMRI signals and network topological properties of bipolar depression patients with anxiety symptoms,"Background: This study aims to explore the changes in functional neuroimaging in bipolar depression patients with anxiety symptoms (BDP-A). Methods: Forty-five BDP-A patients, 22 bipolar depression patients without anxiety symptoms (BDP-NA), and 48 healthy controls (HC) were finally involved. The low-frequency oscillation characteristics, functional connectivity (FC), and network properties among the three groups of participants were analyzed. Results: Compared with the BDP-NA group, BDP-A patients exhibited significantly decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior occipital gyrus, and inferior parietal, but supramarginal and angular gyri (IPL). Enhanced FC from left IPL to middle temporal gyrus, from left precentral gyrus (PreCG) to bilateral angular gyri, medial superior frontal gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG)/MFG were also revealed. Compared with HC, the BDP-A group showed remarkably increased ALFF in the left MFG/PreCG, right superior parietal gyrus, while decreased ALFF in the left inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, and SFG. In addition, higher regional homogeneity in the left MFG/PreCG was found. Limitations: The limitations are as follows: (1) relatively small sample size; (2) not all the patients were drug-naive; (3) lack of pure anxiety disorder patients as a controlled group; (4) mental health conditions of HC were not systemic evaluated. Conclusions: BDP-A patients showed significant differences in resting-state fMRI properties when compared with BDP-NA or HC group. These results may infer the dysfunction of the dorsal attention network, the default network, and the fronto-limbic system as well as disrupted brain network efficiency in BDP-A patients.

15,Applying network analysis to investigate the links between dimensional schizotypy and cognitive and affective empathy,"Background: Although impairment in empathy has been reported in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, little is known about the relationship between empathy and schizotypal traits. This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset. Methods: One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy. Results: Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength ( S = 0.813, p &lt; 0.05) and significant differences in network structure ( M = 0.531, p &lt; 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted p s &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy.

16,Temporal patterns of anxiety disorders and cortisol activity in older adults,"Introduction: Studies focusing on anxiety temporal patterns and cortisol activity in older adults are scarce. The objectives of this study were to examine in older adults the relationship between anxiety temporal patterns and cortisol activity and ascertain the presence of sex differences. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Étude sur la santé des ainés—Services study in Quebec and included N = 762 community living adults aged ≥ 65 years having participated in interviews at baseline (T1) and at 4 years follow-up (T₂). A standardized questionnaire, based on DSM-5 criteria, was used to ascertain in the past 6 months the presence of anxiety (absence, remission, incidence, persistence). Cortisol activity during the interview and cortisol concentration on a regular day (at T₂) were the dependent variables. Adjusted multivariable linear regression models, stratified by sex, were used. Results: Results showed higher cortisol activity during the interview in participants with anxiety in remission ( Beta : 2.59; 95% CI: 0.62 , 4.57), specifically in males, and lower activity in participants with persistent anxiety ( Beta : -3.97; 95% CI: -7.05, -0.88). Cortisol concentration on a regular day was higher in males reporting incident anxiety ( Beta : 8.07; 95% CI: 2.39 , 13.76). Limitations: The convenience sample with losses to follow-up may have led to a potential selection bias. Conclusion: Anxiety temporal patterns were associated with cortisol activity profiles in older adults with sex being a significant moderator. Future studies are recommended to ascertain the longitudinal changes in cortisol activity and anxiety temporal patterns, which may further inform personalized treatment of anxiety.

17,A tailored online intervention to improve parenting risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depression: Medium-term findings from a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Despite considerable evidence on parenting risk and protective factors for child anxiety and depressive disorders, the development of interventions based on this evidence is still lagging behind. To address this gap, the web-based Parenting Resilient Kids (PaRK) program was developed to target these risk and protective factors. This study evaluated the effects of the program at 12-month follow-up. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with a community sample of 355 parents and 342 children ( M child age = 9.79). Parents randomized into the web-based PaRK intervention condition received a personalized feedback report about their parenting and were recommended a tailored course of up to 12 interactive modules. Parents in the control condition received a standard set of web-based educational factsheets. Results: Parents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in self-reported parenting compared to control group parents from baseline to 12-month follow-up, d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.03, 0.45]. Both groups showed reductions in child anxiety and depressive symptoms, parental psychological control and unhealthy family functioning; and improvements in parental acceptance, child- and parent- health-related quality of life. Limitations: The PaRK intervention was tailored based on the parents’ own report of their parenting behaviors. There was an over-representation of highly-educated mothers and only one parent-child dyad was included per family. Conclusions: PaRK improved parenting for up to 12 months, but had no superior effect on children's mental health outcomes compared with an educational-factsheet intervention. Further follow-up is needed to assess longer-term effects.

18,Psychological distress related to COVID-19—the contribution of continuous traumatic stress,"Objective: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Method: An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Results: Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. Limitations: This study relied on convenience sampling. Conclusions: Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.

19,Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 279 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-97726-048). In the original article, there was an error in the syntax that caused systematically lowered scores for all individuals on the pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) and the interpersonal support evaluation list (ISEL). These scores have been updated in the tables and the text, and the corrections are present in the erratum.] Background: Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.

20,Physical activity partially mediates associations between “Big” personality traits and incident generalized anxiety disorder: Findings from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing,"Background: This study aimed to examine associations of personality with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and physical activity (PA), PA with GAD, and PA mediates associations between personality and incident GAD. Methods: Participants aged ≥ 50 years completed the 60-item NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire to assess personality and short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline, and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview—Short Form to clinically assess GAD at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 years later. Participants who had GAD at baseline or reported having ever been told by a doctor that they had anxiety were excluded from analyses. Binary logistic regression quantified associations of the ‘Big Five’ personality traits with PA and incident GAD, and associations of PA with incident GAD (i.e., GAD at any point during follow-up). The ‘counterfactual approach’ identified potential mediating effects of PA in the associations between personality traits and incident GAD. Results: Participants ( n = 4582; 53.7% female) were aged 64.38±8.88 years. Incidence of GAD was 2.95% ( n = 135). Extraversion (OR=1.160, 95%CI = 1.087–1.237), openness (1.113, 1.043–1.188), and conscientiousness (1.083, 1.015–1.155) were positively associated with physical activity. Neuroticism was positively (2.335, 1.945–2.803), and extraversion (0.700, 0.563–0.797), conscientiousness (0.826, 0.693–0.985), and PA (0.655, 0.451–0.952) were inversely, associated with the incident GAD. Approximately 8.7% of the effect of extraversion and 8.8% of the effect of conscientiousness on GAD was due to mediation by PA only. Limitations: PA was self-reported Conclusions: Personality screening may help to identify older adults at-risk of anxiety who would benefit from participation in physical activity interventions.

21,Cognitive behavioral therapy for persons living with HIV in China: A randomized pilot trial,"Background: Chinese persons living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from prevalent mental health issues. We aimed to develop a tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), test its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects (depression, anxiety, and medication adherence) for Chinese PLWH. Methods: Twenty PLWH were assigned randomly. Intervention participants learned skills in CBT and relaxation training in a tailored group-based weekly 10-session project. Each session lasted for two hours and was delivered by nurses and volunteers. Control participants only received laboratory tests and free antiretroviral therapy (ART) medication. Feasibility and acceptability were descriptively summarized. Depression, anxiety, and ART medication adherence data were collected at the baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1) and after 6 months of follow-up (T2). Results: The average CBT attendance rate for all sessions was 60%. No participants in the intervention group dropped out of the study. All participants in the intervention group agreed that they could benefit from the CBT. Participants in the intervention group showed a greater improvement in anxiety and self-reported ART medication adherence than those in the control group at T1. However, no preliminary intervention effect was found at T2. Limitations: The small sample size leads to a lack of representativeness in the study sample. We excluded participants with severe comorbidities, which may lead to an underestimate of the intervention effect of CBT among Chinese PLWH. Conclusions: CBT is feasible and acceptable, demonstrating promising preliminary effects on anxiety and ART medication adherence among Chinese PLWH. Additional research is needed to test the effectiveness of this approach.

22,Differential effects of cranial electrotherapy stimulation on changes in anxiety and depression symptoms over time in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a safe and well-tolerated 6-12 week treatment that is clinically and cost effective on both anxiety and depression symptoms resulting in sustained remission of these symptoms at 12 and 24 weeks in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients. The aim of the current report was to explore whether the effectiveness of CES was related to its effects on depression or anxiety over time Methods: A consecutive sample of 161 eligible patients with GAD was recruited from two publicly funded services in England while they waited for individual cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) after failing to achieve remission on the GAD-7 with computerised CBT. They received 60 minutes per day Alpha-Stim CES for 6-12 weeks. Outcomes were changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7 score from baseline to 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. Latent variable cross-lagged panel analysis permitted an analysis of the differential effects of anxiety and depression with CES treatment over time. Results: Anxiety at baseline significantly predicted depression at week 4 (standardized regression weight = .40, p &lt; 0.001). Depression at week 12 significantly predicted anxiety at week 24 (standardized regression weight = .28, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Not a randomized controlled trial but further analysis of a prospective observational cohort. High rates of loss to follow up by 24 weeks. Conclusion: Sustained effectiveness required a CES response to anxiety symptoms in first 4 weeks and improvement in depression symptoms by 12 weeks.

23,Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies’ mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. Methods: A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. Results: The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD = 20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression ( p &lt; 0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors’ abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression ( p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: An English online survey was used. Conclusion: During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.

24,Is in vitro fertilization (ivf) associated with perinatal affective disorders?,"Background: Since mothers who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) may experience more anxiety and depressive symptoms than mothers who conceive naturally, a review of the literature was conducted to investigate whether IVF may be considered a risk factor for the development of anxiety or depression during pregnancy and post-partum. Methods: A thorough search of articles in Pubmed, PsycINFO and Isi Web of Knowledge was performed in order to produce a comprehensive review regarding the potential association of in vitro fertilization and anxiety/depression. Results: The search resulted in a total of 10 articles. Contradictory results were reported in the articles about the possible association between IVF and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms both during pregnancy and postpartum period. Three studies found that women who resorted to IVF showed less anxiety and depressive symptoms than those who conceived naturally especially with the progression of pregnancy and in the postpartum. Limitations: Vulnerability to affective disorders of women affected by infertility may be independent from the outcome of IVF. Other limits are the limited research in this area, the small sample sizes, the heterogeneity of the tools used to assess affective symptoms. Conclusions: The available data indicate that IVF is not associated with perinatal affective symptoms. Women who resorted to IVF could have less perinatal depressive symptoms as the result of a positive outcome of the technique and the satisfaction of the desire to become mothers. Further studies are necessary in order to draw definitive conclusions about this topic.

25,"Depression and anxiety symptoms correlate with diurnal preference, sleep habits, and &lt;i&gt;Per3&lt;/i&gt; VNTR polymorphism (rs57875989) in a non-clinical sample","Background: Evidences suggest that alterations in circadian rhythms trigger the development of mental disorders. Eveningness, sleep behavior, and circadian genes polymorphisms have been associated with depression and anxiety symptomatology. However, the mechanism underlying these interactions is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of diurnal preference, sleep habits, and PER3 VNTR polymorphism (rs57875989) to depression and anxiety symptoms in a Northeast sample from the Brazilian population. Methods: Eight hundred and four young adults completed the Morningness-Eveningness (MEQ), Munich Chronotype (MCTQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression (CES-D), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) questionnaires. All participants were genotyped and linear regression was performed to test the interactions between the genetic /behavioral variants and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: Eveningness and sleep behaviors (bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and midpoint of sleep) were correlated with depression symptomatology, specifically in somatic factors of the CES-D questionnaire. No correlation was found between diurnal preference/sleep habits with anxiety symptoms for both BAI total score and its factors. However, women with PER3 4/4 genotype showed less interpesonal affect in depression symptomatology and more anxiety symptoms in four factors of the BAI questionnaire. Limitations: Mainly because this study was based on self-report questionnaires and was limited to undergraduate students aging 18 to 30 years old. Conclusion: These results reinforce a role for sleep and diurnal preference in depression, and PER3 VNTR polymorphism in anxiety symptomatology, particularly in women.

26,Expressive suppression of emotion is a moderator of anxiety in a unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders: A secondary analysis,"Background: Expressive suppression (ES) of emotion is considered a moderator that reduces the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); however, whether and how ES moderates the efficacy of the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders (UP), a version of CBT targeting aversive/avoidant responses to emotions, including ES, remain unclear. We investigated whether and how emotion regulation, especially ES, moderates UP efficacy for anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a previous trial. Seventeen patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorders were included. Changes (slope estimates) in the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale from pre-treatment to post-treatment were measured using a latent growth curve model with empirical Bayesian estimation. Pre-treatment ES, cognitive reappraisal, and depressive symptoms were used as slope factor predictors. Results: Only pre-treatment ES significantly predicted the slope in the latent growth curve model (estimate value = 0.45; standard deviation = 0.21; 95% credible interval = 0.03–0.87, one-tailed p -value = 0.004), and an inverse correlation between pre-treatment ES levels and improvement magnitude of anxiety symptoms was demonstrated. Limitations: Because the data were obtained from a single-arm trial, this study did not have controls, and most participants received pharmacotherapy in addition to UP. Therefore, generalisability of the present findings might be compromised. Conclusions: Low ES before UP was an effective predictor of greater improvement in anxiety symptoms after UP. The findings suggest that interventions intended to improve ES may improve UP efficacy.

27,The prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff in China under the COVID-19 epidemic: Workload should be concerned,"Background: To our best knowledge, this was the first time to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances, including depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia and suicide, among frontline medical staff, who were working with the COVID-10 infected patients directly. Methods: Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD-7), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) somatization, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the suicidal module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used for online survey. Results: A total of 606 frontline hospital staff and1099 general population were recruited. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia, and suicide risk in frontline medical staffs were 57.6%, 45.4%, 12.0%, 32.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Except for suicide risk, the prevalence of other psychological disorders in frontline medical staff were higher than those in general population (all p &lt; 0.01). Among the frontline medical staff, the daily working hours were associated with all psychological disturbance (all p &lt; 0.01), women with anxiety ( p = 0.02), body mass index (BMI) with anxiety and insomnia ( p = 0.02, p = 0.03). Age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia (all p &lt; 0.01). Finally, years of working and family income were negatively associated with suicide risk ( p = 0.03, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that during the outbreak of COVID-19, the frontline medical staff are more likely to suffer from psychological disturbances than general population. It is noticeable that daily working hours are a risk factor for all measured psychological disturbances, and some other variables may be involved in certain psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff.

28,"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, and association with epidemic-related factors during the epidemic period of COVID-19 among 123,768 workers in China: A large cross-sectional study","Background: COVID-19 has gained intense attention globally. However, little is known about the COVID-19-ralated mental health status among workers. Methods: The cross-sectional online survey with 123,768 workers was conducted from February 2, 2020 to February 7, 2020 on a mega-size labor-intensive factory in Shenzhen, China. Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37–3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69–3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. Limitations: All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias. Conclusions: Our findings show a relatively low prevalence of anxiety symptoms, a relatively high prevalence of depression symptoms, and urgent demand for psychological education and interventions among workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

29,Prevalence and factors for anxiety during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic among the teachers in China,"Objective: To assess the prevalence of anxiety and explore its factors during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic among the teachers in China. Methods: We involved 88611 teachers (response rate: 94.75%) from three cities of Henan Province, China, during February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Anxiety was assessed by using Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence intervals (CI) for potential factors of anxiety were estimated using multiple logistic regression models. Results: The overall prevalence of anxiety was 13.67%. The prevalence was higher for women than men (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The highest prevalence of anxiety was 14.06% (SE 2.51%) with age of 60 to 100 years in men, and 14.70% (SE 0.56%) with age of 50 to 60 years in women. Participants located in country-level city school had the lowest prevalence of anxiety across all age categories (12.01% for age of 18–30 years; 12.50% for age of 30–40 years; 12.13% for age of 40–50 years; 9.52% for age of 60–100 years). After adjusting for potential confounders, age, sex, education status, type of teachers, school location, information source, worried level, fear level, and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety. Conclusions: This large-scale study assessed the prevalence of anxiety in teachers, as well as its potential influence of factors, which is useful for international and national decision-makers.

30,"Anhedonia is central for the association between quality of life, metacognition, sleep, and affective symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder: A complex network analysis","Background: Poor quality of life, sleep problems, anhedonia, and negative metacognitions are common in anxiety and depression. To examine the nature of the relationship between these features and the role of metacognitions, anhedonia, and quality of life in anxiety and depression, we conducted a complex network analysis with items of self-report measures assessing quality of life, sleep, negative thinking styles, anxiety, and depression. Methods: Participants were 226 treatment seeking individuals with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Node centrality, strength, expected influence, community, and bridge estimation were calculated using partial correlation coefficients and glasso regularization. Results: Results revealed that anhedonia was the most central node followed by quality of life nodes. Moreover, anhedonia exhibited the highest strength and expected influence, which were both stable, reliable metrics within the network. Metacognitions were not central nodes in the network, but were strong bridge symptoms between communities. Limitations: The results are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data and the administration of self-report scales at one time-point, despite different rating anchors. Conclusion: These findings suggest that anhedonia is a crucial element for the association between quality of life, sleep problems, and negative cognitions.

31,Alcohol use and mental health status during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,"Background: We aimed to estimate the population prevalence of people with changes in their usual patterns of alcohol use during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia; assess the association between mental health status and changes in alcohol use during the pandemic; and examine if the associations were modified by gender and age. Methods: This study was an anonymously-completed online self-report survey. Changes in alcohol use were assessed using a single fixed-choice study-specific question. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Results: A total of 13,829 people contributed complete data and were included in the analysis. Overall, about one in five adults reported that they had been drinking more alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic began than they used to. People were more likely to be drinking alcohol more than they used to if they had more severe symptoms of depression or anxiety. The associations between depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased alcohol use since the COVID-19 pandemic began were consistent between females and males. Limitations: Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. Cross-sectional data can identify associations, not causal relationships. The study was limited to participants from Australia. Conclusions: These data indicate that there is a need for public policies focused on alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic and the strategies should include specific consideration of the needs of people with mental health problems.

32,Young women are the most vulnerable to postpartum mental illness: A retrospective cohort study in UK primary care,"Background: Whilst childbirth is a leading cause of mental illness in women, how it affects women at different ages is unknown. Aims: We examine whether the effect of childbirth on mental illness varies at different ages. Methods: From 2,657,751 women identified from a UK population-based primary care database, 355,864 postpartum periods, with no history of mental illness, were matched on year of birth and general practice to 1,420,350 non-postpartum periods. Cox regression models were used to compare incident mental illness between postpartum and non-postpartum periods. These were measured using hazard ratios (HR) and hazard ratios adjusted for parity and prior pregnancy loss (aHR). Results: Strong evidence is presented that the effect of livebirth on mental illness was age-dependant for depression ( p &lt; 0·001), anxiety (p 0·048) and affective psychosis (p 0·031). In 15–19 year olds, depression was over seven times more likely to occur in postpartum periods than non-postpartum periods (aHR 7·09, 95%CI 6·65–7·56); twice the effect in women overall (aHR 3·24 95%CI 3·18–3·29). 15–19 year olds were 50% more likely to develop anxiety in postpartum periods than non-postpartum periods (aHR 1·52, 95%CI 1·38–1·67), with little effect in women overall (aHR 1·07 95%CI 1·04–1·10). Livebirth had over twice the effect on affective psychosis in women aged 15–24 (15–19 year olds: aHR 2·71 95%CI 1·23–5·97; 20–24 year olds: aHR 2·79 95%CI 1·68–4·63) compared to women overall (aHR 1·66, 95%CI 1·29–2·14). Conclusions: Younger women are far more vulnerable to the effect of childbirth on their mental health, particularly depression and anxiety.

33,"Anxiety and depression symptoms, and lack of emotional support among the general population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors","Background: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and emotional support among the general population are unclear. We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed. Methods: Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel ( N = 3,983). ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020. Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019. These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes. Results: The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence. ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020. Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019. While 35–49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020. Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019. Limitations: No other mental health problems were assessed. Conclusions: No increase in the prevalence of ADS and lack of ES was found. Some risk factors remained significant after the outbreak, while others changed notably.

34,Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"Background: Strict confinement and social distancing measures have been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. The aim was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys, separated by one month, performed in Spain. Methods: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. Results: There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales, and daily physical activity to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Conclusions: Results indicated a temporal increase of anxiety, depression and stress scores during the COVID-19 lockdown. Factors such as age, consumption of information about COVID-19 and physical activity seem to have an important impact on the evolution of psychological symptoms.

35,Theta and gamma connectivity is linked with affective and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease,"Background: The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) can often exacerbate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or cognitive impairment. In this study, we explore the possibility that multiple brain network responses are associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment in PD. This association is likely to provide insights into a single multivariate relationship, where common affective symptoms occurring in PD cohorts are related with alterations to electrophysiological response. Methods: 70 PD patients and 21 healthy age-matched controls (HC) participated in a high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study. Functional connectivity differences between PD and HC groups of oscillatory activity at rest and during completion of an emotion-cognition task were examined to identify key brain oscillatory activities. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to identify a putative multivariate relationship between connectivity patterns and affective symptoms in PD groups. Results: A CCA analysis identified a single mode of co-variation linking theta and gamma connectivity with affective symptoms in PD groups. Increases in frontotemporal gamma, frontal and parietal theta connectivity were related with increased anxiety and cognitive impairment. Decreases in temporal region theta and frontoparietal gamma connectivity were associated with higher depression ratings and PD patient age. Limitations: This study only reports on optimal dosage of dopaminergic treatment (‘on’ state) in PD and did not investigate at “off” medication”. Conclusions: Theta and gamma connectivity during rest and task-states are linked to affective and cognitive symptoms within fronto-temporo-parietal networks, suggesting a potential assessment avenue for understanding brain-behaviour associations in PD with electrophysiological task paradigms.

36,"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Background: Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Methods: Online cross-sectional data ( n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study ( n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Results: Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Conclusions: Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress. Attention should be given to COVID-19-related fear and coping-skills as they act as potential mediators in emotional suffering during quarantine.

37,Comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms and frailty among older adults: Findings from the West China health and aging trend study,"Background: Depression and anxiety are two common mental disorders in older people. Studies have reported that depression is strongly associate with frailty, but few studies focus on anxiety disorder and comorbid two mental disorders. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms with frailty in older adults. Methods: 4,103 community-dwellings adults aged 60 and older from the baseline of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study were included. Frailty was measured by the Fried frailty phenotype criteria. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) assessed for depressive and anxiety symptoms with a cut-off value of 5. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the association between different depressive and anxiety status and frailty. Results: 8.7% of old adults suffered comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms in the present study. The prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty was 47.0% and 6.7%, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, individuals with comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms had higher odds of being pre-frail (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.41, 2.45) and frail (OR = 7.03, 95% CI = 4.48, 11.05) compared to those without depressive and anxiety symptoms. In the comorbidity group, those with severe comorbid symptoms also had higher prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty. Limitations: Depressive and anxiety symptom assessments were based on screening tools. Conclusions: This study suggested comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with frailty among Chinese older adults. Further efforts to screen and target depression and anxiety comorbidity may be warranted.

38,Prevalence and correlates of somatization in anxious individuals in a Chinese online crisis intervention during COVID-19 epidemic,"Background: Somatization is a common comorbidity in anxious people. From January 31 to February 2, 2020, a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety was detected due to COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of somatization among Chinese participants with anxiety receiving online crisis interventions from Feb 14 to Mar 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: A total of 1134 participants who participated in online crisis interventions completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and demographic questions online. Somatization was defined as the average score of each item ≥ 2 in SCL-90 somatization subscale. Moderate to severe anxiety was defined as a score ≥ 10 in the GAD-7 scale. Results: Among all participants, 8.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 7.4% reported somatization. After March 1, the prevalence of anxiety with or without somatization did not significantly change (both p &gt; 0.05), while the prevalence of somatization increased significantly ( p &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that somatization was associated with chronic disease history (with an odds ratio of 4.80) and female gender (with an odds ratio of 0.33). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the history of chronic diseases is associated with somatization in individuals with anxiety, indicating some stress-related mechanisms. Chinese men in crisis intervention need more attention because they are more likely to report anxiety comorbid somatization.

39,Antenatal depression and anxiety across pregnancy in urban South Africa,"Background: Depression and anxiety in pregnancy have negative consequences for women and their offspring. High adversity places pregnant women at increased mental health risk, yet there is a dearth of longitudinal research in these settings. Little is known about the pathways by which these problems emerge or persist in pregnancy. Methods: Women were enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort in Soweto, South Africa (2014–2016) and assessed using validated measures (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS ≥ 13; State Trait Anxiety Index STAI ≥ 12) in early (T1) and later pregnancy (T2). Data was available for n = 649 women. Multinominal regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with transient versus persistent depression and anxiety across pregnancy. Cross-lagged panel modelling explored direction of effect between depression and anxiety, and stressors. Results: We found high rates of depression (T1: 27%; T2: 25%) and anxiety (T1: 15%; T2: 17%). Perceiving a partner made one's life harder increased risk of persistent depression (RR 5.92 95% CI [3.0–11.8] p &lt; 0.001); family stress increased risk for persistent anxiety (RR 1.71 95% CI [1.1–2.7] p = 0.027). We find evidence of a direct effect of early depression (T1) on later family stress (T2); and early family stress (T1) on later anxiety (T2). Limitations: We used screening measures of depression and anxiety rather than clinical interviews. Conclusions: Studies which focus only on late pregnancy may underestimate risk. Early identification, in the first trimester, is critical for prevention and treatment. Partner and family stressors are a key intervention target.

40,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp;amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study,"Background: COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results: 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B = 3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B = 7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusion: This COVID-19 outbreak imposes psychological consequences on people to a great extent which requires attention from the concerned authorities to cope with this situation mentally. The perception about the outbreak can also play a big role in psychological impact.

41,Sleep conditions associate with anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women during the epidemic of covid-19 in shenzhen,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.

42,Effects of mask wearing on anxiety of teachers affected by covid-19: A large cross-sectional study in china,"OBJECTIVE: There is a limited information on mask wearing in relation to anxiety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mask wearing practice and the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic among teachers in Henan province, China. METHODS: We enrolled 88,611 teachers in an online cross-sectional survey across three cities of Henan Province in China. A total of 94.75% of study participants completed an online questionnaire between February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Mask wearing practice was defined according to its type, how it is worn, and the behavior exhibited in relation to wearing a mask. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels among study participants. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association between mask wearing practice and anxiety by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 67,357 registered teachers (25.91% men) were included in this study. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who knew the wrong type of mask had 17% increased odds of having anxiety compared to those who knew the proper type (Aor = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.11–1.24). Odds for anxiety were higher for teachers who did not know the proper way of wearing mask compared to those who knew it properly (aOR = 1.18; 95%CI: 1.07–1.30). Not adhering to proper behavior of mask wearing was associated with 39% increased odds for anxiety (aOR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.18–1.64). The odds for anxiety for teachers who did not adhere to all the three parameters of proper mask wearing was about 2.55 times as much compared to those who reported full compliance to the parameters (aOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 1.22–5.35). We observed similar ORs on stratified analyses across gender and age groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improper mask wearing is another important attribute that play a significant role in increasing the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, these results should be considered as exploratory and hence interpreted with caution.

43,Mental health among college students during the covid-19 pandemic in china: A 2-wave longitudinal survey,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs &gt; 1.20, ps &lt; 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.

44,A transdiagnostic examination of anxiety and stress on executive function outcomes in disorders with social impairment,"BACKGROUND: Executive function (EF) difficulties characterise a number of psychiatric conditions and EF impairment may be a predisposing factor and/or consequence of anxiety and stress. The aim of the study was to examine EF factors in a mixed clinical cohort (Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder) characterised by social impairment and investigate the influence of trait anxiety and state-based depression, anxiety and stress. METHODS: In Study 1, a factor analysis identified EF and non-EF latent factor structures (N=205). In Study 2, (N=137) multiple regression analyses investigated the association between trait anxiety and state based depression, anxiety and stress, on EF and non-EF cognitive domains and on the two composite indices of the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). RESULTS: Trait anxiety was associated with better performance on neuropsychological measures of EF while state-based stress was associated with lower EF performance. A dissociation was observed between trait anxiety and state stress on the two behavioural indices of the BRIEF. Depression, anxiety and stress did not predict performance on non-EF cognitive domains. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design precludes cause-effect conclusions, further only self-report measures of affect were utilised and our performance measures of EF did not include a working memory test. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that trait anxiety and state-based stress influence EF processes across disorders with social impairment. The transdiagnostic efficacy of this finding can facilitate remediation strategies, it may also contribute to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder gaining better access to mental health services.

45,"A comparison of two measures to screen for mental health symptoms in pregnancy and early postpartum: The matthey generic mood questionnaire and the depression, anxiety, stress scales short-form","BACKGROUND: The Matthey Generic Mood Questionnaire (MGMQ) provides a rapid screen of clinically significant emotional difficulties in adults. This study aimed to investigate associations between the MGMQ and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short-form (DASS-21) and how well the MGMQ detects women scoring high on the DASS-21 in pregnancy and 1 and 2 years postpartum. METHODS: Pregnant Australian, English-speaking women were recruited from 10 maternity hospitals across two states (for the “right@home” trial, N=729). Prioritized for their experience of social adversity (2 or more of 10 risk factors), they completed the 2-item MGMQ and 21-item DASS-21 in pregnancy and at 1 and 2 years postpartum. DASS-21 Total and subscale scores were classified “high” based on (a) normed percentiles for top 15% and (b) clinical cut-points. RESULTS: The MGMQ and DASS-21 were completed within 7 days of each other by 296 (41%) women in pregnancy, 625 (86%) at 1 year and 573 (79%) at 2 years. Associations between the measures were weak-to-moderate in pregnancy and moderate-to-strong in the postpartum years. Most women scoring “high” on the DASS-21 could be identified with various thresholds of the MGMQ. LIMITATIONS: Pregnant women with 0 or 1 risk factor were excluded; the DASS-21 is not a perinatal specific measure nor a gold standard diagnostic tool. CONCLUSIONS: The MGMQ and DASS-21 appeared to assess overlapping but distinct constructs of mental health. These findings can help clinicians and researchers decide whether to use the MGMQ, and which balance of sensitivity, specificity and correct classification will suit their needs.

46,Social anxiety and depression stigma among adolescents,"BACKGROUND: The stigma associated with mental disorders in adolescence has a range of detrimental consequences, negatively impacting help-seeking behaviours and quality of life. Social anxiety typically has its onset during adolescence, but the associated stigma is not well understood. This study was designed to improve understanding of social anxiety and depression stigma in adolescence by examining demographic and personal variables that predict them both. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen adolescents (150 males, 165 females), from 2nd and 4th year of secondary school (mean ages 13.92 and 15.92 years respectively), completed the Peer Mental Health Stigmatization Scale to measure both personal and perceived stigma towards vignettes depicting social anxiety and depression. They also answered demographic questions and completed the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents. RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that gender predicted both personal and perceived stigma towards depression and personal stigma towards social anxiety. Males scored higher on measures of personal stigma whereas females had higher scores on perceived stigma. Ability to accurately identify symptoms described in a vignette, predicted lower personal stigma towards social anxiety and higher perceived stigma towards depression. Depression was more stigmatized than social anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The study used vignettes to represent individuals with depression and social anxiety so participant responses may not reflect their behaviour towards real peers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasise the importance of separately considering personal and perceived stigma for each condition and highlight gender differences in stigma responses that need to be considered in intervention design.

47,Distinct grey matter volume alterations in adult patients with panic disorder and social anxiety disorder: A systematic review and voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The paradox of similar diagnostic criteria but potentially different neuropathologies in panic disorder (PD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) needs to be clarified. METHODS: We performed a qualitative systematic review and a quantitative whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) meta-analysis with an anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based D mapping (AES-SDM) to explore whether the alterations of grey matter volume (GMV) in PD are similar to or different from those in SAD, together with potential confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of thirty-one studies were eligible for inclusion, eighteen of which were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the respective healthy controls (HC), qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed smaller cortical-subcortical GMVs in PD patients in brain areas including the prefrontal and temporal-parietal cortices, striatum, thalamus and brainstem, predominantly right-lateralized regions, and larger GMVs in the prefrontal and temporal-parietal-occipital cortices, and smaller striatum and thalamus in SAD patients. Quantitatively, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) deficit was specifically implicated in PD patients, whereas left striatum-thalamus deficits were specific to SAD patients, without shared GMV alterations in both disorders. Sex, the severity of clinical symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, and concomitant medication use were negatively correlated with smaller regional GMV alterations in PD patients. CONCLUSION: PD and SAD may represent different anxiety sub-entities at the neuroanatomical phenotypes level, with different specific neurostructural deficits in the right IFG of PD patients, and the left striatum and thalamus of SAD patients. This combination of differences and specificities can potentially be used to guide the development of diagnostic biomarkers for these disorders.

48,The role of post-loss anxiety in the development of depressive symptoms and complicated grief symptoms: A longitudinal sem study,"BACKGROUND: Though grief, anxiety, and depression often co-occur, existing evidence mostly focus on any two of them at a time. Our study examined the relationships among the three clusters of symptoms. METHODS: A Chinese community sample of 101 bereaved individuals participated at T1. We utilized Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) to conduct cross-lagged analyses on three-wave panel data (T1 at one-month post-loss, T2 at four-months, and T3 at seven-months). RESULTS: BSEM findings confirmed the presence of distinctive developmental paths for complicated grief (CG), anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Three simplex models showed that anxiety, CG symptoms, and depressive symptoms maintained high consistency. In cross-lagged models, anxiety at T1 was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (standardized estimate B=0.386*) and CG symptoms (standardized estimate B=0.300*) at T2. The remaining positive directions (0.338*, 0.256*) in the final model suggest the important role of anxiety at early bereavement, while at a later stage, T2 CG contributed to depressive symptoms at T3 (0.356*). LIMITATIONS: In addition to attrition, the overall sample size was limited. Data were based on self-report. Future research with repeated measures and Bayesian informative priors would be more useful to establish relational patterns of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In our models, the reduction in anxiety symptoms contributed to the development of depressive and CG symptoms, and these results should be replicated. Theories of mechanisms underlying post-loss anxiety can be explored as a potential means of reducing later symptoms.

49,Familial aggregation of anxiety disorder subtypes and anxious temperament in the nimh family study of affective spectrum disorders,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from family and twin studies suggests that mood and anxiety disorders, and related temperamental factors may share common etiologic factors. We examine the familial aggregation and coaggregation of anxiety disorder subtypes and anxiety-related temperamental traits, and their association with mood disorders. METHODS: A total of 477 probands and 549 first-degree adult relatives from a large community based family study of affective spectrum disorders completed semi-structured diagnostic interviews and self-reported assessments of temperamental traits including: negative affectivity on the ‘Positive and Negative Affect Schedule’ (PANAS), neuroticism anxiety on the ‘Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire’ (ZKPQ), and anxiety sensitivity on the ‘Anxiety Sensitivity Index’ (ASI). RESULTS: The anxiety-related temperamental traits of negative affectivity, neuroticism anxiety and anxiety sensitivity had significant familial specificity, even after controlling for comorbid mood and anxiety disorders in probands and relatives. Yet, these traits in probands did not predict anxiety disorders in relatives. Although some anxiety subtypes were familial, there were no longer familial links between anxiety disorder subtypes (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety or panic disorder) after controlling for mood disorder subtypes in probands and relatives. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional interviews were used to estimate disorders, and self-report measures were used for temperamental traits. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous research regarding familial overlap between anxiety subtypes and mood disorders, however their shared liability cannot be fully explained by anxiety-related temperamental traits. These findings suggest that anxiety-related temperamental traits may indicate a vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders or a potential consequence of these conditions.

50,Expressive flexibility and anxiety,"BACKGROUND: The ability to flexibly enhance and suppress emotional expressions plays an important role in emotion regulation and the fostering of social connections. Deficits in expressive flexibility have been linked with posttraumatic stress disorder and prolonged grief reactions. Previous studies have suggested that the ability to respond flexibly in the context of an immediate threat (a nonconscious prime) may be important. In this study we sought to extend this work by examining the impact of individual differences in anxiety on expressive flexibility. METHODS: Eighty four participants with high and low trait anxiety viewed blocks of negative images with instructions to enhance or suppress emotional expressions. Across blocks one of three nonconscious primes (threat, safety, neutral) appeared before each image. Observers blind to the study's design rated participants’ emotional expressiveness. RESULTS: Repeated Measures Anova's showed that high trait anxiety was associated with lower levels in enhancement ability. Further, low trait anxiety was associated with less emotion in response to the threat prime irrespective of expressive instruction. LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional which precludes causal relationships. Participants were drawn from a student population and the generalizability to other populations will need to be established CONCLUSIONS: This study identified trait anxiety as factor that may contribute to expressive flexibility deficits. High trait anxiety is a feature of many clinical conditions. Strategies to target expressive flexibility may relevant to a range of anxiety related clinical conditions.

51,An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form,"With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference ( p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference ( p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients. Lastly, spectrum of panic consequences due to COVID-19 pandemic were constructed.

52,Do people with elevated social anxiety respond differently to digital and face-to-face communications? Two daily diary studies with null effects,"Background: Retrospective studies have found that people with elevated social anxiety (SA) show a preference for digital/online communication, which may be due to perceptions of enhanced emotional safety. Whether these individuals prefer digital compared to face-to-face communication and experience emotional benefits naturalistically remains unclear. Methods: We recruited college students ( N = 125) and community adults ( N = 303) with varying levels of SA and sampled their emotions during digital and face-to-face communication using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (Study 1) and a day reconstruction method (DRM) (Study 2). We preregistered our hypotheses (https://osf.io/e4y7x/). Results: Results from both studies showed that SA did not predict the likelihood of engaging in digital compared to face-to-face communication, and SA was associated with less positive and more negative emotions regardless of the communication medium. Study 2 showed that whether digital communication was synchronous (e.g., in real time via phone/video chat) or asynchronous (e.g., texting/instant messaging) did not impact the association between SA and emotions. Limitations: EMA and DRM methods, despite their many advantages, may be suboptimal for assessing the occurrence of digital communication behaviors relative to more objective methods (e.g., passively collecting smartphone communication data). Using event-contingent responding may have also yielded more reports of digital communication, thus strengthening our power to detect small, cross-level interaction effects. Conclusions: These results challenge beliefs that digital/online communication provides a source of emotional safety for people with elevated SA and suggests a greater need to address SA-related emotional impairments across digital communication platforms.

53,"Role of autobiographical memory in the impact of MBCT on dysfunctional attitudes, depressive symptoms and anxiety in bipolar I patients","Background: The literature suggests that cognitive reactivity in bipolar patients can increase relapse vulnerability, is enhanced by depressive mood and dysfunctional attitudes, and could be improved with MBCT. Autobiographical memory (AM) could be involved in cognitive reactivity, and improved with MBCT training. This study aims to investigate the effect of MBCT for bipolar patients on depressive and anxious symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes and AM, and the predictive versus mediating role of AM in the impact of MBCT on clinical symptoms. Methods: Sixty-two outpatients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder were assigned to MBCT and were compared to 37 bipolar patients on a waiting list. Affective symptoms and dysfunctional attitudes were explored using self-report inventories (BDI, BAI, DAS) and AM was assessed using the Autobiographical Memory Test. Results: Patients receiving MBCT demonstrated significantly decreased depressive symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes, overgeneral memories and omissions, and increased specific memories. General AM and omissions at baseline respectively predicted lower anxiety and dysfunctional attitudes improvement following therapy, but the improvement of AM did not explain the impact of MBCT on depression and dysfunctional attitudes improvement. Limits: Further studies should consider patients’ therapeutic adherence and mechanisms involved in MBCT in order to better apprehend how MBCT may reduce dysfunctional attitudes and improve AM in bipolar patients. Conclusion: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that MBCT reduces cognitive reactivity and AM impairment in bipolar disorders. Findings suggest that AM training prior to MBCT may influence MBCT efficacy, but that MBCT efficacy on AM and clinical symptoms are non-related phenomena.

54,Changes in symptoms of anhedonia in adults with major depressive or bipolar disorder receiving IV ketamine: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence,"Background: Anhedonia is a trans-diagnostic, multidimensional phenotype that mediates patient outcomes and suicidality. Convergent evidence suggests that ketamine may be effective in targeting measures of anhedonia in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This retrospective, post-hoc analysis included 203 (x̄ = 45 ± 14.6 years of age) patients receiving four infusions of intravenous (IV) ketamine at a community-based clinic. The primary outcome measure was change in anhedonia severity, as measured by the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). Secondary measures sought to determine if improvement on the SHAPS mediated the effect of repeated IV ketamine infusions on symptoms of depression and suicidal ideations, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR16) and anxiety, as measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results: After adjusting for age, sex, primary diagnosis, concomitant medication, body mass index, and baseline depression severity, there was a statistically significant reduction in symptoms of anhedonia with IV ketamine treatment ( F (2, 235.6) = 31.6, p &lt; 0.001). Improvements in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and anxiety symptoms with repeated-dose IV ketamine were significantly partially mediated by reduction in anhedonic severity. Moreover, the combination of number of infusions received and change in anhedonic severity accounted for 26% of the variance in depressive score improvements. Limitations: This is a post-hoc analysis of retrospective data and lacks a control group. Conclusion: Ketamine was effective in improving measures of anhedonia in this large, well-characterized community-based sample of adults with TRD. Improvements in anhedonia also partially mediated the significant improvement in depressive symptoms, suicidality, and anxiety.

55,Interpretation bias in social anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Interpretation bias, which involves interpreting ambiguous social events negatively and catastrophising even mildly negative social events, has been suggested as a key maintenance factor of Social Anxiety Disorder. Although some individual studies and narrative reviews have demonstrated a role for negative interpretation bias in social anxiety (disorder), findings have been mixed. Given the lack of a quantitative synthesis of the evidence, the current systematic review and meta-analysis examined the strength of the relationship between interpretation bias and social anxiety. It also investigated potential moderators of this relationship (i.e., types of measures and stimuli, samples, and study designs). Methods: Five databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Of 46 studies identified, 44 were suitable for meta-analysis ( N = 3859). Results: There was a large effect for the relationship between social anxiety and interpretation bias ( g = 0.83). Types of measures (subjective versus objective) and stimuli (verbal versus visual) were identified as significant moderators, with subjective measures and verbal stimuli particularly adept at capturing interpretation bias in socially anxious individuals. Limitations:: The effect sizes displayed significant heterogeneity between studies, which likely reflects some publication bias, and thus, the overall effect size may be inflated. Conclusion: Findings may help to refine clinical models and interventions for Social Anxiety Disorder, which in turn may maximise evidence-based interventions that target negative interpretation bias in this disorder.

56,Is there an association between anxiety and depression prior to and during pregnancy and gestational diabetes? An analysis of the Born in Bradford cohort,"Background: Anxiety and depression are common in women with gestational diabetes but it is not clear whether they are more likely to precede the onset of gestational diabetes or to co-occur with it. Our aims were to compare the strength of association between common mental disorders of anxiety and depression (i) before pregnancy and (ii) during pregnancy in women with and without gestational diabetes. Methods: the sample comprised 12,239 women with 13,539 pregnancies from the UK's Born in Bradford cohort. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Indicators of common mental disorders were obtained from linked primary care records. Multivariable robust Poisson and logistic regression were employed. Multiple imputation by chained equations was implemented to handle missing data. Models were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, education and obstetric complications. Analyses of common mental disorders during pregnancy were additionally adjusted for maternal smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, multiple pregnancy and common mental disorders prior to pregnancy. Results: there was no evidence for an association between common mental disorders prior to pregnancy and gestational diabetes (adjusted RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.80,1.15) or between gestational diabetes and common mental disorders during pregnancy (adjusted OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.73,1.12). Limitations: high levels of deprivation and multi-ethnic composition of the cohort may limit generalisability of these findings to other populations. Conclusions: routine primary care records did not identify an increased risk of gestational diabetes in women with common mental disorders prior to pregnancy or of gestational diabetes in women with common mental disorders during pregnancy.

57,COVID-19 infection outbreak increases anxiety level of general public in China: Involved mechanisms and influencing factors,"Background: COVID-19 outbreak happened last December in China and is still continuing. Here, we reported effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the mood of general public and ascertained impacts of psychosocial factors on the plague-related emotional measures. Methods: During Feb. 4-6, 2020, a self-reported questionnaire Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was disseminated to general public via Wechat, along with a sociodemographic information sheet. BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety in subgroups of respondents were compared. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were done for correlation analysis and to identify factors predictive of anxiety. Results: Averaged BAI score of all respondents is higher than those of general public in two previous studies. The people quarantined for probable COVID-19 infection presented higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety relative to non-quarantined respondents. People in high epidemic area showed higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety compared to those in low epidemic area. Significant associations existed between anxiety level of the respondents and each of the investigated factors, except for gender. Quarantine was the predictor with a highest OR, followed by divorced/widow. The other factors showed smaller but significant effects on the anxiety level of respondents. Limitations: This cross-sectional study was unable to track the emotional changes in the respondents over time. It had a relatively small sample and involved some of emotional measures only. Conclusion: These data are of help in planning psychological interventions for the different subpopulations in general public during and after COVID-19 outbreak.

58,Predictors of heart-focused anxiety in patients with stable heart failure,"Background: It has been shown that heart-focused anxiety raises the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart disease. Yet, there is a lack of studies investigating this association. We aim at identifying predictors of heart-focused anxiety in patients with stable heart failure to facilitate the identification of individuals with increased risk for adverse outcomes. Methods: We assessed heart-focused anxiety and a set of psychological, demographic/lifestyle, and medical/laboratory variables in a sample of 107 patients with stable chronic heart failure to identify predictors of heart-focused anxiety. Results: Heart-focused anxiety was best predicted by self-reported anxiety and quality of life. Moreover, the personality dimension conscientiousness as well as physical activity, and the laboratory value of renal function, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), had predictive validity for heart-focused anxiety. Limitations: The present findings should be replicated in a longitudinal design with a less selective sample including more women and participants with more divers ethnical backgrounds. Conclusion: Heart-focused anxiety is predictable by psychological and lifestyle variables. eGFR, as a laboratory marker for renal function, showed also predictive validity. The awareness of such predictors may help detecting comorbid underlying heart-focused anxiety and thus identify patients with an increased need for psychological care.

59,"Financial threat, hardship and distress predict depression, anxiety and stress among the unemployed youths: A Bangladeshi multi-city study","Introduction: Unemployment has a contributory role in the development of mental health problems and in Bangladesh there is increasing unemployment, particularly among youth. Consequently, the present study investigated depression, anxiety, and stress among recent graduates in a multi-city study across the country. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 988 Bangladeshi graduate jobseekers in six major cities of the country between August to November 2019. The measures included socio-demographics and life-style factors, study and job-related information, Economic Hardship Questionnaire, Financial Threat Scale, Financial Well-Being Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Results: Depression, anxiety and stress rates among the present sample were 81.1% ( n = 801), 61.5% ( n = 608) and 64.8% ( n = 640) respectively. Factors related to gender, age, socioeconomic conditions, educational background, lack of extra-curricular activities, and high screen activity were significant risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. Structural equation modeling indicated that (while controlling for age, daily time spent on sleep study, and social media use), financial threat was moderately positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress. Financial hardship was weakly positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas financial wellbeing was weakly negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations: Due to the nature of the present study (i.e., cross-sectional study) and sampling method (i.e., convenience sampling), determining causality between the variables is not possible. Conclusions: The present results emphasized the important detrimental role of financial troubles on young people's mental health by showing that financial problems among unemployed youth predict elevated psychiatric distress in both men and women.

60,"Role of anxiety, depression and neurocognition for cognitive behavioural therapy pre-therapy skills in people living with dementia, older and younger adults","Background: Anxiety and depression are common in people living with dementia (PLWD) and Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) seems to be one of the few efficacious interventions. However, PLWD's ability to engage with CBT has been questioned due to the presumed impact of neurocognitive impairment on core skills necessary to engage with CBT (pre-therapy skills). Here, we (i) compare CBT pre-therapy skills in PLWD to older and younger adults (OA, YA), (ii) examine potential confounders and mediators and (iii) explore associations of neurocognition, anxiety and depression with pre-therapy skills in PLWD. Methods: Pre-therapy skills were compared between PLWD ( n = 102), OA ( n = 77) and YA ( n = 56). Structural equation modelling was used to assess mediators and confounders of differences in pre-therapy skills between groups. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the relationship of pre-therapy skills with neurocognition and mood in PLWD. Results: Group differences in pre-therapy skills were found, following the pattern YA &gt; OA &gt; PLWD. Neurocognition mediated the difference between OA and PLWD. In PLWD, language was associated with performance on all skills. There was little evidence that anxiety or depression contributed to variability in skill performance within PLWD. Limitations: Cross-sectional design limited ability to ascertain cause and effect. Pre-therapy skill measures have not been used in the context of actual CBT; consequently, their relationship with CBT outcomes needs to be established. Conclusions: PLWD may have a relative difficulty in CBT pre-therapy skills. Yet, there seems to be substantial variability of skill level, independent of mood. Therefore, mild dementia does not necessarily preclude CBT readiness.

61,"Depression, anxiety and health status across different BMI classes: A representative study in Germany","Background: Changes in body mass index (BMI) over the course of one's lifetime are related to the development of mental disorders. In the current study we compared symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety as well as general health status in the four BMI-classes: underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity. Furthermore, mediator role of general health status on the relationship between BMI and depression and generalized anxiety was analyzed. Methods: A representative sample (random-route sampling) of the German population ( N = 2350) was investigated in a cross-sectional survey by measuring the three questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D-5L. Results: The results showed significant differences between the four BMI-classes in all three questionnaires. Individuals with obesity demonstrated higher values in depression, anxiety and general health compared to the three other BMI-classes. However, there was no U-shaped association between BMI and depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. Regarding to the mediation analysis, general health status fully mediated the association between BMI, depressive symptoms as well as generalized anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The assessment of the three factors depression, anxiety and general health status were measured by questionnaires, but no clinical diagnoses can be provided. Conclusions: Evidence supports that individuals with obesity have an increased risk for depression and anxiety as well as lower general health. Further research on potential intervention and strategies in public health policies is needed to be able to target the developing of mental disorders in individuals with obesity. Taking their general health status into account is also of great importance.

62,Maternal psychological distress &amp;amp; mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods: Participants ( N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.

63,Development of the Macquarie Anxiety Behavioural Scale (MABS): A parent measure to assess anxiety in children and adolescents including young people with autism spectrum disorder,"Objective: This study examined measurement variance for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Parent Form (SCAS-P; Spence, 1999). In addition, we developed and evaluated a new parent report measure for anxiety (Macquarie Anxiety Behavioural Scale; MABS). Method: The sample consisted of 734 parents of children aged 3–19 years (i) who were seeking help for their child's anxiety, (ii) who had received a diagnosis of ASD, or (iii) from the community. Results: Evidence for measurement variance of the SCAS-P and MABS was found, revealing different factor structures between the ASD and non-ASD groups. MIMIC modelling showed that the scales performed significantly different across ASD and non-ASD groups. Differential item functioning on a number of the SCAS-P and MABS items was also found. Limitations: This study relied on parent report of symptoms and of community acquired diagnoses of ASD. Conclusion: The MABS is a new parent measure to assess anxiety in children and adolescents and the proposed factor structure produced a reasonably good fit for the data. Similar to the SCAS-P, ASD was found to impact on some of the MABS items indicating that ASD influences parental responding. Eighteen MABS items showed measurement invariance across the anxious and ASD groups and can be considered suitable items for the assessment of anxiety in ASD.

64,Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak,"Background: Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. Limitations: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.

65,Pregnancy-related anxiety among Chinese pregnant women in mid-late pregnancy under the two-child policy and its significant correlates,"Background: Pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) is a global public health concern. This study aims to understand the PRA among Chinese pregnant women at mid-late pregnancy and to explore the significant correlates. Methods: The Chinese PRA scale was used to measure PRA among 342 pregnant women from Zhejiang Province in China at their mid- and late- pregnancy respectively. Results: The participants aged from 21 to 42 years old, and their mean age was 30. 1 (SD = 4. 0). The average scores of the Chinese PRA scale at mid- and late- pregnancy were 1. 60 (SD = 0. 33) and 1. 58 (SD=0. 33) respectively. Unplanned pregnancy (mid-pregnancy: β = 0. 18, p &lt; 0. 001; late-pregnancy: β = 0. 11, p = 0. 024) and gender of the first child being male (mid-pregnancy:β = -0. 20, p = 0. 001; late-pregnancy: β = -0. 14, p = 0. 016) were significantly correlated with PRA among pregnant women at mid- and late- pregnancy. Living with parents-in-law was not associated with the PRA overall and domain scores. Limitations: This study was done among pregnant women at their mid-late pregnancy, and no follow-up was conducted at postpartum. The sample size of this study was relatively small which might affect the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: The current study found that the correlates of PRA at mid- and late-pregnancy were generally similar. For future studies, special attention should be paid to pregnant women who are in the condition of unplanned pregnancy and those who already have a female child to relieve their anxiety levels.

In the original article, there were errors in the authors and affiliations lists. The correct authors and affiliations lists are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-56963-030). Background: Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods: A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR = 4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR = 2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without ( P &lt; 0.001). Limitations: All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.

67,"Comparative efficacy of add-on rTMS in treating the somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms of depression comorbid with anxiety in adolescents, adults, and elderly patients—A real-world clinical application","Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant treatment for depression. Many patients with depression have comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, previous rTMS studies have focused on patients with depression, and often excluded comorbid anxiety. This real-world study aimed to investigate the comparative efficacy of add-on rTMS in treating the somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms of depression comorbid with anxiety in adolescents, adults and elderly patients. Methods: This study included 147 depression patients with anxiety symptoms who were treated with at least 10 sessions of rTMS. The symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. This was done to compare the improvement degree of add-on rTMS on somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms in adolescents, adults and elderly patients respectively. Results: Both somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms were significantly improved after the add-on rTMS in adolescents, adults and elderly patients. The improvement of somatic anxiety was better than that of psychic anxiety after rTMS treatment in elderly patients ( t 2w = 3.895, P &lt; 0.001; t 4w = 2.823, P = 0.008). Limitation: The overall sample was mostly composed of elderly patients, while adolescents and adult patients were fewer. Conclusions: The add-on rTMS treatment can improve somatic anxiety better than psychic anxiety in depression with anxiety symptoms, especially in elderly patients.

68,Properties of common anxiety scales among patients with bipolar disorder,"OBJECTIVES: Almost half of the patients with a bipolar disorder (BD) have anxiety disorder(s) (AD) during their lifetime, but feasible measures for all AD are few. Furthermore, cognitive impairments can compromise reliability of existing scales, since many are needed for full coverage. Thus, we investigated how reliably patients responded to anxiety scales and any symptom overlap to propose future improvements to anxiety assessments. METHODS: We collected 152 observations in patients with BD with the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Panic Disorder Severity Measurement, and Trauma Screening Questionnaire (in total, 57 items). The scales were analyzed as a set in a Rasch model. RESULTS: During our analyses, we found indication that BD outpatients had difficulty differentiating response options to 70% (40/57) of items which were rescored or deleted. Only one case was misfitting (-2.65±.41). In total, 22 items were locally dependent and one indicated misfit. The final model included 25-items and fit the Rasch model (χ2=35.92, DF=50, p=.93). The model was unidimensional, without losing appropriate associations with depression (r = 0.62), suicidality (r = 0.37), and hypomania (r= -0.01). LIMITATIONS: Bolstering the size of less frequent subgroups should be accomplished in future work. CONCLUSION: A unidimensional rather than categorical approach to severity of anxiety might be both useful and feasible in this population. Further development of screens is necessary to enable systematic screening and measurement of anxiety in BD.

69,Trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms from early pregnancy to six weeks postpartum and their risk factors—A longitudinal study,"Background: Few studies explored trajectories of depressive symptoms from early pregnancy and covered the whole perinatal period. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. Results: Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (“Low-throughout”); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (“Antenatal-high”); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (“Postpartum-high”). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the “Antenatal-high” and “Postpartum-high” trajectories, respectively. Limitations: Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. Conclusions: We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy. Factors associated with each trajectory were different, raising the potential of individualized intervention to reduce the occurrence of depression.

70,"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. Methods: 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Results: The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p &lt; 0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p &lt; 0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. Limitations: This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with depressive symptoms.

71,Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. Method: To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results: Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional nature and use of sample of convenience. Conclusions: This study suggests that “simple” coping behaviors may protect against anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

72,Psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study,"Presents a study which aims to examine the psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China. The authors adopted a cross-sectional survey design to assess the anxiety, depression, and fatigue status of frontline staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in China with an anonymous online questionnaire. The authors e received responses from 2,614 participants, including community workers, health care workers, volunteers, market administrators and others, the last including commanders, police, and journalists. This is the first study to investigate the mental health and fatigue of frontline staff fighting COVID-19. Most participants experienced depression and anxiety, and indeed more than 55.6% of frontline staff felt tired. The psychological response of frontline staff to the epidemic of infectious diseases is complex. The authors found the level of depression, anxiety, and fatigue of community workers to be much higher than that of other occupations, while the level of health care workers was slightly lower in this survey. On the one hand, compared with medical staff, community workers lack professional medical knowledge and access to medical materials in epidemic emergencies. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the higher the level of family support, the greater the satisfaction of patients, and the better their sleep, the lower the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff, which is consistent with research results in other fields. This study also revealed a positive correlation between fatigue, depression, and anxiety in frontline workers during the epidemic.

73,Posttraumatic growth as a buffer and a vulnerability for psychological distress in mothers who are breast cancer survivors,"Background: This study investigated the role of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in moderating the associations between parenting efficacy and psychological distress, and between fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and psychological distress, in mothers who are breast cancer survivors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, mothers who were breast cancer survivors ( N = 91) completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Cancer-Related Parenting Self-Efficacy (CaPSE), Concerns About Cancer Recurrence (CARS) and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory Short Form (PTGI-SF). Hierarchical multiple linear regressions and simple-slope tests were used to examine the main effects of the predictors (CaPSE and CARS) and moderator (PTGI-SF), and interaction effects of CaPSExPTGI-SF and CARSxPTGI-SF. The analyses were repeated for each outcome variable: Depression, Anxiety and Stress. Results: Higher CARS significantly predicted higher Depression, Anxiety and Stress, and lower CaPSE significantly predicted higher Depression and Stress. Significant CaPSExPTGI-SF and CARSxPTGI-SF interactions predicted Depression. Simple-slopes tests indicated a significant positive association between CARS and Depression for mothers with high levels of PTG, but not with low levels of PTG. A negative association was indicated between CaPSE and Depression for mothers with low levels of PTGI-SF, though neither slope was significant. Limitations: Our results are only generalisable to mothers with similar socio-demographic backgrounds. Conclusions: PTG may serve as both a protective and a risk factor for depression in mothers who are breast cancer survivors. Debate remains whether PTG is best conceptualised as a perceived positive outcome or an ongoing coping mechanism in the face of parenting challenges and cancer-related threats such as FCR.

74,An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in China during the outbreak of COVID-19,"Objective: : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods: : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results: : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion: : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.

75,The association of changes in repetitive negative thinking with changes in depression and anxiety,"Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a common feature of different mental disorders in the affective spectrum. Most measures of RNT are disorder-specific and measure e.g. rumination in depression or worry in anxiety. Methods: In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), 1820 adults completed the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire to assess content-independent RNT over a 3-year follow-up period. We investigated the relative stability of content-independent RNT (Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire), over time as well as the association between changes in RNT and changes in affective disorder status (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and depressive and anxiety severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). Results: In the total group, baseline RNT was strongly related to RNT three years later, while the difference between the scores at baseline and three years later was negligible. Increases and decreases in RNT were associated with the occurrence and recovery of affective disorders, respectively. Furthermore, changes in RNT between baseline and three years later were associated with corresponding changes in depression, anxiety, and avoidance symptom severity. These associations were small or negligible. Limitations: Our findings may not be representative of all affective disorders as individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder were excluded from our sample. Conclusions: The findings suggest that RNT is not primarily an index of disorder status or epiphenomenon of symptom severity and may constitute a relatively stable transdiagnostic person characteristic.

76,"The loneliness pandemic: Loneliness and other concomitants of depression, anxiety and their comorbidity during the COVID-19 outbreak","Presents a study which aims to evaluate COVID-19 related psychiatric symptoms of depression and anxiety, and their comorbidity in a Western society, where restrictive social-distancing has been employed. Using the Qualtrics web-based public platform, the authors collected data across Israel using a snowball design, via social media platforms. On the last day of data collection, 6902 people in Israel tested positive for COVID-19, 241 recovered and twenty-five had died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that after entering demographics, health-related factors, exposure to COVID19 related events, behavioral change and loneliness; loneliness was the most prominent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Moreover, the results showed that relative to those with low loneliness, those with high loneliness were 82% more susceptible to suffer from depression-anxiety comorbidity due to the coronavirus outbreak. The first main finding of the study is somewhat counterintuitive, indicating that old age as an actual risk for COVID-19 complications was negatively related with depression and anxiety. Moreover, neither the suffering from chronic medical conditions nor exposure to COVID-19 related risk situations were link to higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Critically, for age, this was even reversed, namely, adults above 60 who are at higher risk for COVID-19 complications, actually displayed greater resilience to psychiatric disorders associated with the COVID-19 crisis.

Methods: Unmedicated adults (N=166) participated in a paradigm assessing associative fear acquisition, extinction, extinction recall, and fear renewal. Data were analyzed from two perspectives: comparison of each disorder to HC and exploratory latent class analysis (LCA) of the combined data. Results: The diagnosis-based analyses indicated significantly increased fear renewal in OCD and trends toward decreased extinction recall in OCD and increased renewal in SAD. The LCA indicated four Response Types, none of which were congruent with the diagnostic categories. Most participants had a normative response (50%) or a moderate extinction recall deficit (30%). The two remaining groups (8% each) had more extreme responses: one showed complete failure of extinction recall; the other persistent arousal in expectation of, but prior to, actual conditioning (threat sensitivity). Limitations: Due to small sample size (N = 20) results for AN are regarded as preliminary. Conclusions: Our diagnosis-based findings are consistent with previous data suggesting an association between pathological anxiety and difficulties maintaining fear extinction. The LCA reveal substantial within-diagnosis heterogeneity in fear processing and support inclusion of empirically driven approaches as a complement to standard analyses. This heterogeneity may also have implications for treatment, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, which relies on strengthening extinction recall and requires patients to tolerate anxious expectation in order to engage with feared situations.

78,"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 276 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-64969-141). In the original article, there were errors in the authors and affiliations lists. The correct authors and affiliations lists are given in the erratum.] Background: Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods: A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR = 4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR = 2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without ( P &lt; 0.001). Limitations: All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.

79,"Connectomic signatures of working memory deficits in depression, mania, and euthymic states of bipolar disorder","Background: Working memory (WM) deficit is a feature persistently reported across mania, depression, and euthymic periods of bipolar disorder (BD). WM capacity relates to distributed brain regions that are systemically organized at the connectome level. It is not clear whether the same disruption of this network-level organization underlies the WM impairment seen in different phases of BD. Methods: We used graph theory to examine the topology of the functional connectome in different granularity in 143 subjects (72 with BD [32 depression; 15 mania; 25 euthymic] and 71 healthy controls) during a n-back task. Linear regression analysis was used to test associations of altered graph properties, clinical symptoms, and WM accuracy in patients. Results: Altered topological properties characterised by an increase in small-worldness of the whole-brain connectome, were specific for bipolar depressed, but not in manic and euthymic states. Depressed subjects showed a shift in the distribution of the number of connections per brain region (degree) within the connectome during WM task. Increased small-worldness related to worse WM accuracy in patients with more severe depression, anxiety and illness burden. Limitations: We used only 2-back load, limiting our ability to study the parametric effects of task demand. Conclusions: We demonstrate a putative state-dependent mechanistic link between connectome topology, hub re-distribution and impaired n-back performance in bipolar disorder. The aberrant task-dependent modulation of the connectome relates to worse WM performance especially when anxiety and depression are prominent in BD.

80,Effects of aromatherapy on anxiety: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Scope: The effects of aromatherapy on relieving anxiety were controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of aromatherapy on anxiety in patients. Methods and results: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about aromatherapy on decreasing anxiety on PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE (January 1990 to October 2019), COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE (updated to October 2019), and the Chinese databases CNKI, WanFang and CBMD. Twenty-five articles (Thirty-two trials) were included in this meta-analysis. The data of scale scores of Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were extracted. The pooled results demonstrated that inhalation and massage aromatherapy significantly decreased anxiety levels in different conditions. The weighted mean difference was -5.16 for State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) (95%CI: -5.78, -4.55, p &lt; 0.001) and -2.85 for Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) (95%CI: -3.95, -1.75, p &lt; 0.001). No side effects were mentioned in all of studies. Conclusion: The meta-analysis suggested that aromatherapy with different essential oils could alleviate anxiety significantly no matter the reason of anxiety. However, the proper dosage of essential oils needs further research.

81,Big Five personality facets explaining variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms in a community sample,"Background: Personality traits are risk and protective factors in affective disorders. However, few studies have investigated the role of narrow personality facets, with existing research yielding contradictory results. Previous research has mostly focused on simple correlations. Several studies have performed separate multiple regressions within each trait, and have used non-standard measures of personality, making it difficult to determine how individual facets make unique contributions. Method: This study performed secondary analysis of the NewMood data set (collected 2004–2009), comprising 264 participants from Greater Manchester. Participants provided self-reports of all NEO-PI-R personality facets, and semi-structured questionnaires of clinical depression and anxiety. All personality facets were entered into multiple regressions to explain variance in depression and anxiety. Results: Variance in both anxiety and depression were explained by a small number of personality facets, namely facet depression (referring to demotivation), facets positive emotion and assertiveness in extroversion, and facet competence in conscientiousness. Limitations: This study relies on cross-sectional data and cannot determine causation. This study uses a mostly female sample, and the results were not stratified by sex due to the small sample. Conclusion: Previous studies suggest that broad trait neuroticism positively associates with affective disorders; this study adds that the effect of neuroticism is limited to facet depression (related to demotivation). Contrary to previous studies, no facet of agreeableness or openness explained variance in affective disorders, and facet assertiveness positively associated with affective disorder scores. These findings may help to improve treatment matching and explain the mechanisms through which affective disorders develop.

82,Emotional reactivity and eating disorder related attitudes in response to the Trier Social Stress Test: An experimental study in people with anorexia nervosa and with bulimia nervosa,"Background: In order to experimentally asses the role of socio-emotional problems in Eating Disorder (ED) psychopathology, we have measured affective states and ED-related attitudes in response to an acute psychosocial stress and their relationships with interpersonal sensitivity in people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Methods: Twenty-one women with AN, 21 with BN and 27 healthy women underwent an acute psycho-social challenge, the Trier Social Stress Test. Anxiety feelings, hunger perception, amount of desired food and body dissatisfaction were measured throughout the experimental procedure. The relationships between these variables and with interpersonal sensitivity measures were explored through Pearson's correlation and mediation analyses. Results: Stress-induced anxiety was increased in people with EDs. People with AN showed reduced hunger perception, decreased desire for food and a negative association between anxiety feelings and desire for food. In people with EDs, baseline ineffectiveness predicted post-stress body dissatisfaction through the mediation of post-stress anxiety levels. Limitations: The relatively low sample size and the lack of an experimental control condition are the main limitations of the study. Conclusions: The present findings show, for the first time, the relationships between socio-emotional distress and ED-related attitudes in people with EDs, providing experimental support to the interpersonal model of EDs. This gives empirical evidence to treatments targeting interpersonal problems in EDs.

83,"Risk of psychological burden in polycystic ovary syndrome: A case control study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Background: While increased risk of psychiatric burden in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is reported in the literature, there is dearth of reports from Saudi Arabia on occurrence of psychological burden in women with PCOS. This study aimed to compare the sociodemographic and clinical features of PCOS cases with non-PCOS control and explore the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in PCOS and non-PCOS women. Materials and Methods: This is a case–control study carried out in PSMMC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from March 2019 to June 2019. Samples were recruited by convenience sampling and simple random method in PCOS cases (82) and control group (85), respectively. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure the presence of psychological burden. Results: High percentage of participants were in an age group of 26–35 years (51%) and university educated (64%). Significantly ( P = 0.001) high proportion of PCOS cases found with irregular menses, hirsutism, infertility and presence of acne ( P = 0.001) when compared to control group. The odds of developing depression ( P = 0.006), anxiety ( P = 0.028) and stress ( P = 0.000) was significantly higher in PCOS cases compared to control participants. Further, among the three parameters, the occurrence of stress (odds ratio, OR = 10.45) in women with PCOS was more common than depression (OR = 2.675) and anxiety (OR = 2.056). Limitations: Recall bias and inclusion of only one hospital. Conclusion: In conclusion, most of the PCOS cases had stress, depression and anxiety compared to control group. Meeting the psychological need of the PCOS women will help in improving their quality of life.

84,Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation,"Background: Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results: We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.

85,"Depression, anxiety and stress in different subgroups of first-year university students from 4-year cohort data","Background: Limited studies have been conducted to investigate the mental health status of subgroups of university students. This study hypothesized that there would be differences among student subgroups in the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress; and association of age, gender, academic performance and mental health status. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Since 2014, first-year university students in a university in Hong Kong were invited to complete the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) before the commencement of their study. These DASS data were then merged with objectively measured data from university records. 9,479 students completed the DASS survey, this being 56.5% of the total student population in the records. Kruskal-Wallis Tests were applied to compare the differences among student subgroups. Results: Community college transfer (CCT) students were the highest-risk group for depression, anxiety and stress, and their study load was the highest as well. Unexpectedly, mainstream students ranked after the CCT students in the prevalence and levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Student athletes had the highest prevalence of depression. Although there were declining trends for depression, anxiety and stress, it was only a slight drop. Overall, age, gender, study load and academic performance were associated with the mental health profile (p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: After admission, students’ mental health conditions could have changed. Further studies are needed to measure mental health during their study. Conclusions: Mental health problems were not distributed evenly across different student subgroups, psychological support should be designed according to the needs of each student subgroup.

86,The heterogeneity of social anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents: Results of latent profile analysis,"Background: The main objective of the current study was to investigate the symptoms of social anxiety in Chinese adolescents by conducting latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered statistical approach, with items from the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A). Method: In total, a sample of 2,755 adolescents aged 11-19 years were recruited from six urban public schools in the Beijing District and Sichuan Province, China. Latent profile analysis, regression mixture modelling, and multinomial logistical regression were adopted to investigate the latent profiles and profiles validity. Results: A four-profile model was suggested as the optimum: low group with diffuse social anxiety, moderate group with difficulties in new situations, moderate group with cognitive disturbance, and high group with diffuse social anxiety. With regression mixture modelling, results showed a greater possibility for older adolescents and girls fall into the high group with diffuse social anxiety. Finally, to examine the validity and interpretability of the social anxiety profiles, two cognitive factors—post-event rumination and self-focused attention—were adopted for their potential to significantly predict the moderate and high group social anxiety profiles. Conclusions: The current study, which was the first effort to investigate the features of social anxiety among Chinese adolescents with LPA, supports an innovative model of social anxiety symptoms in a large, non-Western sample. Limitations and clinical implications are included. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
87,Abnormal fear circuits activities correlated to physical symptoms in somatic anxiety patients,"Background: Somatic anxiety patients complain of physical symptoms and exhibit repeated checking behavior. Overgeneralization of fear is a characteristic of anxiety disorders. However, the role of fear in the somatic anxiety patients remains unclear. We hypothesized that somatic anxiety patients have abnormal fear circuits, including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which can aggravate physical symptoms. Methods: 33 anxiety patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The severity of the anxiety and somatic symptoms was assessed with the Hamilton anxiety scale and the 15-item somatic symptom severity scale from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess abnormalities in the fear circuit. We compared the ALFF between patients and HCs with respect to the fear circuit and conducted correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between somatic symptoms and the ALFF in abnormal cerebral regions. Results: The ALFF of the left thalamus and left hippocampus was significantly higher in the patient group than the HC group, and was positively correlated with the PHQ-15 values. Limitations: We did not divide the patient group into drug treated or drug free in our subgroup analysis. There was a lack of the paradigm to test the generalization of fear for patients in this study. Furthermore, the small sample size may have affected the results. Conclusion: Somatic symptoms in patients with anxiety are related to abnormal fear circuits, whose degree of abnormality is associated with symptom severity.

88,Sex differences in the associations between blood pressure and anxiety and depression scores in a middle-aged and elderly population: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA),"Background: Anxiety and depression are considered risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but their relationship to blood pressure (BP) is still uncertain. Lifestyle factors and age-related comorbidities may confound these relationships. Our study aimed to evaluate the associations between BP and anxiety and depression scores in a population aged ≥ 49 years. Methods: Data on 8504 participants from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed for associations between BP and anxiety and depression questionnaire scores, accounting for relevant confounding factors. Results: Multivariable analyses showed negative associations between systolic BP and anxiety and depression scores, independent of age, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, level of physical activity, self-reported CVDs (≥ 2) and antihypertensive medication use in men (coefficient = −0.112, P = 0.013; coefficient = −0.051, P = 0.026) but not in women (coefficient = -0.001, P = 0.855; coefficient = -0.005, P = 0.556). Diastolic BP was not associated with anxiety or depression scores in either men (coefficient = −0.018, P = 0.223; coefficient = −0.001, P = 0.924) or women (coefficient = −0.007, P = 0.338; coefficient = −0.015, P = 0.293) after adjusting for these same confounding factors. After a follow-up of 4 years, lower BP in subjects not using antihypertensive medications was significantly associated with more anxiety and depression events. Limitation: Time-varying confounding factors may have interfered with our results. Conclusion: Our results show that systolic BP in a middle-aged and elderly population is negatively associated with anxiety and depression scores in men but not women after adjustment for a range of lifestyle factors. These results contrast with the predisposition of anxious or depressed participants to CVDs in later life when decades of unhealthy lifestyles have persisted.

89,Short and long-term effects of cannabis on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Many individuals use cannabis to manage symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid system represents a viable target for treating these symptoms. Method: Data from 404 medical cannabis users who self-identified as having PTSD were obtained from Strainprint®, a medical cannabis app that patients use to track changes in symptoms as a function of different strains and doses of cannabis across time. This sample collectively used the app 11,797 times over 31 months to track PTSD-related symptoms (intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, irritability, and/or anxiety) immediately before and after inhaling cannabis. Latent change score models were used to examine changes in symptom severity and predictors of these changes (gender, dose, cannabis constituents, time). Multilevel models were used to explore long-term consequences of repeatedly using cannabis to manage these symptoms. Results: All symptoms were reduced by more than 50% immediately after cannabis use. Time predicted larger decreases in intrusions and irritability, with later cannabis use sessions predicting greater symptom relief than earlier sessions. Higher doses of cannabis predicted larger reductions in intrusions and anxiety, and dose used to treat anxiety increased over time. Baseline severity of all symptoms remained constant across time. Limitations: The sample was self-selected, self-identified as having PTSD, and there was no placebo control group. Conclusions: Cannabis provides temporary relief from PTSD-related symptoms. However, it may not be an effective long-term remedy as baseline symptoms were maintained over time and dose used for anxiety increased over time, which is indicative of development of tolerance.

90,Exposure to food in anorexia nervosa and brain correlates of food-related anxiety: Findings from a pilot study,"Background: Although the primary target of treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) is weight gain, established psychological interventions focus on maintaining factors of AN, and do not specifically address eating behaviours. We have previously reported results of a case series investigating in-vivo food exposure in AN, demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment together with evidence of significant clinical change (Cardi, Leppanen, Mataix‐Cols, Campbell, &amp; Treasure, 2019). The current study examined the neural circuitry of food-related anxiety. Methods: We examined neural reactivity (fMRI) to food images pre- and post-food exposure therapy (n = 16), and compared it to a group of healthy control participants (HC n = 21) who were scanned on two occasions. Results: Prior to treatment, the AN group (compared to HC) showed less reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Following exposure treatment, patients (compared to HC), show increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, decreased activity in the superior parietal lobe and no differences in the ACC. The level of activation of the insula (pre-treatment) predicted the degree of post-treatment reduction in self-reported food anxiety in AN. Changes in food-related anxiety were also associated with changes in neural activation in a cluster located in the middle temporal gyrus/lateral parietal cortex. Limitations: The primary limitations of this work are the small sample size and lack of patient comparison group. Conclusions: Exposure to food in AN may be associated with changes in neural circuitries implicated in emotion regulation and attentional processes. However, these findings need replication in larger and controlled studies.

In the original article, there was an error in the order of affiliations. The correction order is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-43903-051). Background: Optimal strategies for prevention and treatment for post-stroke depression (PSD) remain unclear and a greater understanding of effect of resilience on PSD is promising. The aim was to examine the association between baseline resilience and depression at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, which contributes to early detection and management of PSD. Methods: A total of 217 ischemic stroke survivors were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China from February 2017 to January 2018. The Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience at acute hospitalization. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was employed to ascertain baseline anxiety, baseline depression, and post-discharge depression. Social-demographic and disease-related information were obtained from participants’ self-report and medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSD. Results: The prevalence of depression at baseline was 21.2% and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge was 34.4%, 33.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. Logistics regression analyses indicated that resilience may independently predict PSD at 1 month (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.097, 0.518), 3 months (OR:0.302, 95%CI: 0.151, 0.607), and 6 months (OR: 0.03, 95%CI: 0.006, 0.153) after controlling for social-demographics, disease-related characteristics, baseline anxiety, and baseline depression. Limitations: Non-multicenter survey and mild stroke severity may affect the generalization of these findings. Moreover, response bias should be acknowledged because some participants were read questionnaires out aloud. Conclusion: Resilience is independently associated with PSD at different timepoints. Our findings reveal the important role of resilience as a protective factor against PSD.

92,COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults,"Background: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusions: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.

93,Childhood determinants of past-year anxiety and depression in recently transitioned military personnel,"Background: Anxiety and depression may hamper a smooth transition from military to civilian life and may be important predictors of longer-term health and functioning. However, it is as yet unclear to what extent they are determined by childhood factors in a recently transitioned population. Methods: We utilised logistic regression and Generalised Structural Equation Modelling to analyse associations of ICD-10 past-year anxiety and depression with childhood trauma and disorder in a recently transitioned population using detailed interview data from the ADF (Australian Defence Force) Transition and Wellbeing Research Programme. Results: Past-year anxiety (including PTSD) was prevalent (36.4%, 95% CI, 31.9-41.1) and associated with childhood anxiety (but not other types of childhood disorder), childhood interpersonal trauma (but not other childhood trauma) and adult-onset trauma. Childhood anxiety had a direct and significant association with past-year anxiety. The pathway between childhood interpersonal trauma and past-year anxiety was fully mediated by childhood anxiety. Past-year depression was less prevalent (11.3%, 95% CI, 8.7-14.5) and had no association with childhood disorder or trauma variables. Limitations: The main predictor variables utilized in this analysis were childhood experiences recalled from adulthood, thus rendering the responses vulnerable to autobiographical bias. Conclusions: Past-year anxiety was highly prevalent in the period of transition and had strong associations with childhood and military factors, suggesting predictability and potentially preventability.

94,"Risk of dementia in persons who have previously experienced clinically-significant depression, anxiety, or PTSD: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Depression, anxiety and PTSD appear to be linked to dementia, but it is unclear whether they are risk factors (causal or prodromal) for, comorbid with, or sequelae to (secondary effect of) dementia. Existing meta-analyses have examined depression or anxiety in all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), but have not considered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The current meta-analysis examined the risk of developing dementia (AD, VaD, DLB, FTD, all-cause) in people with and without a history of clinically-significant depression, anxiety or PTSD in order to better understand the link between mental illness and dementia (PROSPERO number: CRD42018099872). Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL searches identified 36 eligible studies. Results: There is a higher risk of developing all-cause dementia and AD in people with previous depression, and a higher risk of all-cause dementia in people with prior anxiety, than in persons without this history. Prior PTSD was not associated with a higher risk of later being diagnosed with dementia. Limitations: The data for anxiety, PTSD, DLB and FTD were limited. Conclusions: Depression and anxiety appear to be risk factors for dementia, but longitudinal studies across adulthood (young adult/mid-life/older adult) are needed to evaluate the likely causal or prodromal nature of this risk. The link between PTSD and dementia remains unclear. Regular screening for new onset mental illness and for cognitive changes in older adults with a history of mental illness may assist with earlier identification of dementia.

95,"How sex differences in schooling and income contribute to sex differences in depression, anxiety and common mental disorders: The mental health sex-gap in a birth cohort from Brazil","Background: Reasons for the higher rates of depression, anxiety and common mental disorders among women are unclear. We investigated the mediating effect of schooling and personal income and the effect modification of maternal schooling and family income at baseline. Methods: In 1982, the maternity hospitals of Pelotas (Southern Brazil) were daily visits and those livebirths whose family lived in the urban area of the city were examined and their mothers interviewed. At 30 years, the presence of major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was assessed using the Mini-International Psychiatric Interview, and common mental disorders (CMD) with the self-rated questionnaire. We used Mantel-Haenszel test to assess effect modification and a counterfactual framework using inverse probability weights (IPW) and G-computation to analyze mediation. Results: Income at 30 years captured part of the association of sex with MD (16.5%), GAD (14.2%), and CMD (18.0%). Schooling at 30 years was higher in women (p &lt; 0.001), and therefore inversely mediated the association with MD (-5.4%), GAD (-4.8%), and CMD (-6.7%). If we fixed the mediator to earning more than 3 minimum salaries, the effect of sex, was reduced in 64.9%, 56.7% and 31.4%, for MD, GAD and CMD, respectively, and 62.4%, 13.6% and 23.8%, if fixed to 12 or more years of schooling. Limitations: We were not able to evaluate mental health and socioeconomic changes, or assess a bidirectional effect Conclusion: Personal income and schooling at 30 years, are important mediators and effect modifiers of the association between sex and MD, GAD, and CMD.

96,"Prevalence and associated factors of postpartum anxiety and depression symptoms among women in Shanghai, China","Background: Postpartum anxiety (PPA) and postpartum depression (PPD) are associated with immediate and long-term health risks for both mothers and babies. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, perinatal variables, and PPA and PPD symptoms of parturients 6 weeks postpartum. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1204 women who had a healthy and term birth in a baby-friendly hospital, Shanghai, China. PPA and PPD symptoms were measured by using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The mean score of SAS and EPDS was 40.79 ± 8.48 and 8.18 ± 5.80, respectively. The estimated prevalence of PPA and PPD symptoms was 15.2% and 23.2%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of fatigue and PPD symptoms were risk factors for PPA symptoms, whereas having support from family and being satisfied with labor experience were protective factors. In terms of PPD symptoms, its risk factors included smoking before pregnancy, maternal separation from baby, fatigue, encountering difficulties in breastfeeding, and the presence of PPA symptoms. In contrast, the protective factors for PPD symptoms were having support from family and having support from colleagues or friends. Limitations: Convenience sampling and voluntary participation may have led to a selection bias. Conclusion: PPA and PPD symptoms occur commonly among parturients in Shanghai, China. The findings from this research provide a better understanding of factors associated with PPA and PPD symptoms and will help guide personalized approaches to the management of postpartum anxiety and depression.

97,"Increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders in transsexual individuals","Background: The aim of this study was to explore rates of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders in a large sample of transsexual individuals (TSI), compared with matched non-TSI cohorts from general practices in Germany. Methods: Individuals initially documented as transsexual (index date) between January 2010 and December 2018 were identified in 468 general practices (GP) from the IMS Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA). Non-transsexual women (NTSW) and men (NTSM) were matched (1:1) with transsexual individuals by age, index year, and physician. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and adjustment and somatoform disorders among TSI compared to NTSW and NTSM. Results: A total of 535 TSI, 535 NTSW, and 535 NTSM were analyzed (mean age in each group was 35 years). Depression was documented in 20% of TSI versus 7.7% of NTSW and 5.5% of NTSM ( p &lt; 0.001), reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders in 10% of TSI versus 4.3% of NTSW and 2.9% of NTSM ( p &lt; 0.001), somatoform disorders in 9.7% of TSI versus 5.8% of NTSW and 5.8% of NTSM (p 0.016), and anxiety disorders in 5.8% of TSI versus 1.9% of NTSW and 1.6% of NTSM, ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings indicate a need to promote TSI mental health. Furthermore, primary care physicians and psychiatrists should be aware of the importance of detecting and treating mental disorders in TSI and thereby improve their quality of life.

98,Evidence for inhibited temperament as a transdiagnostic factor across mood and psychotic disorders,"Background: The conceptualization of risk for psychiatric illness is moving from risk factors for specific psychiatric disorders to factors that confer risk for multiple disorders. One potential transdiagnostic risk factor is inhibited temperament, a trait characterized by a fearful or avoidant response to novelty. Inhibited temperament is an established risk factor for anxiety disorders, and evidence suggests inhibited temperament is elevated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Methods: In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibited temperament is a transdiagnostic factor in 490 participants including individuals with schizophrenia (n = 184), psychotic bipolar disorder (n = 61), major depression disorder (n = 53), or no disorders (n = 192). Participants completed assessments of temperament, personality, clinical symptoms, cognition, and functioning. An ANOVA was used to test for group differences in inhibited temperament scores. Regressions were used to test whether inhibited temperament scores were associated with the current measures and whether the associations were similar across disorders. Results: Inhibited temperament was similarly elevated in all patient groups compared to controls. Inhibited temperament was similarly associated with anxiety, depression, negative affect, and quality of life across patient groups. Inhibited temperament was not associated with cognition or functional impairment. Limitation: Although the inhibited temperament measure is commonly used, it is a retrospective self-report which may be susceptible to biases. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that inhibited temperament is a transdiagnostic factor impacting affective systems across mood and psychotic disorders. Inhibited patients may especially benefit from treatments that specifically target anxiety and depression.

99,Sexual-orientation based discrimination is associated with anxiety and depression in young physicians. A national study,"Introduction: The professional risk factors for depression and anxiety are underexplored in young physicians. While there has been increasing research on the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay and bisexual patients, few studies have examined the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay and bisexual young physicians. Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Sexual Orientation-Based Discrimination (SOBD) in French young physicians and if SOBD was associated with increased anxiety and depression in this population. Method: This national study is a cross-sectional observational epidemiological national study. The participants were recruited between April 1st 2019 and June 31st 2019. One question with binary answer was asked on SOBD. Mental health was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety &amp; Depression scales. Results: On the 2003 participants, 148 (7%) reported SOBD exposure, 647 (32%) current anxiety disorders and 174 (9%) a current major depressive disorder according to their HAD score. SOBD was almost twice more frequently reported in participants with anxiety disorder and major depression (respectively 10%,vs 6% and 12% vs. 7%, p&lt;0.05). In the first model of multivariate analyses, current anxiety disorder was significantly associated with being woman (adjusted odds ratio aOR=1.688, 95%CI 1.350-2.110, p&lt;0.001) and SOBD (aOR=1.729, 95%CI 1.226-2.440, p=0.002). In the second model of multivariate analyses, current major depression was significantly associated with only SOBD (aOR=1.748, 95%CI 1.057-2.888, p=0.029). Conclusion: SOBD has been associated with increased rates of anxiety disorder and major depression in young physicians and should be targeted in mental health prevention programs.

100,Social criticism moderates the relationship between anxiety and depression 10 years later,"Background: Research has consistently documented anxiety and depression as bidirectional risk factors for one another. However, little research investigates the sequential comorbidity of anxiety and depression over lengthy durations, and the influence of contextual variables on this relationship have not been fully empirically investigated. Method: The current study examined perceived social criticism as a moderator of the relationship between a history of anxiety and a past 12-month depressive episode at least 10 years later (and vice versa) utilizing the National Comorbidity Survey Baseline ( N = 8,098) and Re-interview data ( N = 5,001). History of anxiety and depressive diagnoses were assigned at Wave 1, past year diagnosis at Wave 2, and perceived social criticism was assessed at Wave 1. Results: Structural equation modeling indicated that when controlling for a Wave 1 latent depression factor, a positive relationship between Wave 1 latent anxiety and a Wave 2 latent depression emerged for those endorsing higher perceived social criticism from friends and relatives, respectively. Unexpectedly, when controlling for Wave 1 latent anxiety, a negative relationship between Wave 1 latent depression and Wave 2 latent anxiety emerged for those endorsing higher perceived social criticism from friends, but no relationship when moderated by perceived social criticism from relatives. Limitations: Perceived social criticism was self-reported, which may introduce self-perception bias. Conclusions: Results identified perceived social criticism as an important moderator in the sequential comorbidity of anxiety and depression over a long period of time.

In the original article, additional affiliation for co-author Heng-Kien Au was missing. The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-06001-004). Introduction: Considerable concern persists on tobacco use during perinatal periods. No study has simultaneously investigated the longitudinal association of paternal smoking with maternal and paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during perinatal periods. Methods: In this prospective study, 533 couples (pregnant women and their husbands) completed 5 self-report instruments from early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analyses. Results: We found that fathers who smoked in the mother’s presence had higher depressive (regression coefficient = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3–1.8) and anxiety symptoms (3.0, 95% CI = 1.2–4.7) during perinatal periods compared with nonsmoking fathers. Paternal smoking in the mother’s presence also increased maternal disturbances, especially for depression during pregnancy (1.2, 95% CI = 0.1–2.3) and anxiety during the postpartum period (3.4, 95% CI = 0.6–6.3). No significant association was found between paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence and maternal emotional disturbances. Paternal smoking but not in the mother’s presence affected only paternal anxiety, especially in the postpartum period (regression coefficient 2.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.7) compared with nonsmokers. Limitations: Self-report measures were used. The effects of maternal smoking could not be estimated because of the small sample of pregnant women who disclosed their smoking status. Conclusions: These findings imply a necessity to combine strategies for smoking cessation with interventions for affective disturbances in fathers. We also stress the importance of at least restricting the father’s smoking in the presence of the pregnant wife during perinatal periods if smoking cessation is tentatively unattainable.

102,Do adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) and co-morbid anxiety and/or depressive symptoms think differently to those who do not have co-morbid psychopathology?,"Background: Co-morbid anxiety and/or depression is common in adolescents with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME). Adolescents with psychopathology typically endorse more negative cognitive errors. We do not know whether they make negative cognitive errors in response to fatigue. We examined the thinking patterns of adolescents with CFS/ME and co-morbid psychopathology compared to those without this co-morbidity. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 205 adolescents (age 11–18) with CFS/ME, who completed measures of anxiety and depression, information processing biases and responses to fatigue. We grouped participants as having co-morbid psychopathology (or not) by applying a threshold score. We compared groups’ thinking pattern subscale scores using independent samples T tests. We examined the association between psychopathology and general negative thinking and specific responses to fatigue symptoms. Results: Adolescents with CFS/ME with co-morbid psychopathology more strongly endorsed general negative cognitive errors ( d = 0.61–1.31). They also more strongly endorsed damage beliefs ( d = 0.49), embarrassment avoidance ( d = 1.05), catastrophising ( d = 0.97) and symptom focusing ( d = 0.75) in response to fatigue but did not differ significantly on fear avoidance from those without co-morbid psychopathology. Both negative cognitive errors and unhelpful responses to symptoms explained 43% of the variance in psychopathology. Conclusions: Adolescents with CFS/ME with co-morbid psychopathology tend to be negatively biased in their thinking, both generally and about their symptoms of fatigue specifically. This may have implications for the sequencing of cognitive and behavioural strategies to address both fatigue and psychopathology.

103,Parental corporal punishment and child anxiety in China: The moderating role of HPA-axis Activity,"Background: Although negative associations between parental corporal punishment and child anxiety are well-documented, the potential moderators of these associations are not well characterized. Contemporary developmental perspectives suggest that biological vulnerability may influence the degree to which the environment affects child development. Thus, this study investigated the moderating role of one potential physiological marker, HPA-axis activity, in the relations between both maternal and paternal corporal punishment and child anxiety in China. Methods: Participants were 158 elementary school-age children and both their parents in China. Parental corporal punishment was measured based on children's self-report, maternal report, and paternal report. Children self-reported their anxiety and undertook saliva sampling during 3 consecutive school days at 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. in their classroom. Hierarchical regressions were calculated to examine the moderating role of HPA-axis activity in the link between corporal punishment and child anxiety. Results: Both maternal and paternal corporal punishment were positively associated with child anxiety. Low morning and afternoon basal cortisol exacerbated the relations between paternal corporal punishment and child anxiety, and flatter diurnal rhythm exacerbated the relations between both paternal and maternal corporal punishment and child anxiety. Limitations: Causal conclusions cannot be drawn based on cross-sectional research design. Conclusions: The findings provide partial support for the diathesis-stress model and highlight the importance of considering how the biological vulnerability may interact with parenting to influence child adjustment.

104,"Women with premature ovarian failure using hormone therapy do not experience increased levels of depression, anxiety and stress compared to controls","Objective: To evaluate anxiety, depression and stress of POI women using hormone therapy. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study included 61 women diagnosed with POI receiving HT, and 61 women with preserved ovarian function, matched 1:1 for age (control group). Instruments used to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Lipp's Stress Symptom Inventory (LSSI). The chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman's correlation coefficient or logistic regression analysis with stepwise criteria were used for analysis. Results: The mean age of POI women and control group was 35.03 ± 7.68 and 34.49 ± 7.55 years old ( p = 0.63). POI group and control group had a mean of 0.44 ± 0.92 and 1.28 ± 1.38 children ( p = 0,001); the total BDI, BAI and LSSI scores were 15.72 ± 11.68 and 13.66 ± 8.44 ( p = 0.64); 17.54 ± 13.16 and 17.25 ± 11.05 ( p = 0.90), 19.39 ± 12.08 and 18.93 ± 11.21 ( p = 0.945). The majority of women did not have depression or presented mild depression, but approximately one-third had moderate-severe undiagnosed depressive or anxiety symptoms. In POI group, depression was positively correlated with the number of children and anxiety. Anxiety and stress were also positively correlated. It was observed that for each point in the BDI, the risk of stress above 20 increased 19.6%, while for each point in the BAI, the risk of greater stress increased 32.4%. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study, which made it impossible to draw cause and effect conclusions Conclusion: Women with POI receiving HT have indexes of depression, anxiety and stress similar to the population of women with preserved ovarian function.

105,There is a non-evidence-based app for that: A systematic review and mixed methods analysis of depression- and anxiety-related apps that incorporate unrecognized techniques,"Background: Recent studies have utilized available online data to examine the impact of depression- and anxiety-related apps that incorporate evidence-based techniques; however, the impact of apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques is unknown. Understanding this impact is important in order to assess the potential benefits or harm from their use. Methods: We systematically reviewed apps incorporating relevant techniques aimed at depression- and anxiety-related conditions, found through Google Play search. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of user reviews, and analyzed app usage utilizing an independent user panel. Results: Compared to apps incorporating evidence-based techniques ( n = 14), user ratings of apps classified as non-evidence-based ( n = 27) were lower (4.0 versus 4.5, p = .001, η² = 0.24) and a smaller percentage of users found these apps to be beneficial for mental health (76.2% versus 100%, p = .003, η² = 0.23). Users found apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques to be mostly helpful in providing in-the-moment relief; however, some users described these apps as containing content that could be harmful for a person in such a mental state. Limitations: The data do not enable the differentiation of user experiences based on user groups (e.g. according to the severity of symptoms), which should be examined in future studies. Conclusions: This study indicates that depression and anxiety apps incorporating non-evidence-based techniques are viewed less favorably and have more potential to cause harm. However, many users found them helpful mostly in providing in-the-moment relief. Examining user experiences with these apps is an important way to learn about unmet user needs and potential benefits or harm.

106,Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization are independent risk factors for the development or persistence of psychological distress in the general population: Results from the Gutenberg health study,"Background: Symptoms of depersonalization (DP) and derealization (DR) have a high prevalence in patient and community samples. Previous studies suggested that DP/DR symptoms might represent a marker of disease severity and poor prognosis. However, population-based studies investigating the impact of DP/DR symptoms on the course of depression and anxiety are sparse. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether symptoms of DP/DR are longitudinally associated with the persistence or incidence of elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety. Methods: We analyzed observational data from a sample of 13.182 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study. The outcomes were elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety at the 2.5 years follow-up as determined by the 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2), the 2-item anxiety scale (GAD-2), and the compound measure PHQ-4 respectively. The predictor was the 2-item Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-2). Results: 8.7% of the sample were bothered by symptoms of DP/DR at baseline. They had an increased risk for elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety at the 2.5-year follow-up beyond baseline depression/anxiety and other factors. Each point increment in the CDS-2 scale, ranging from 0-6, was associated with a 21% increase of risk for PHQ-4 ≥ 3 at the follow-up (odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.32). Limitations: The study was mostly questionnaire-based. Conclusion: Symptoms of DP/DR are independent risk factors for the persistence or incidence of elevated symptoms of depression/anxiety. Symptoms of DP/DR represent an easily assessable risk factor for the course of mental disorders. Treatment and prevention of mental disorders might benefit from the broader recognition of these phenomena.

107,"Impact of earthquake exposure, family adversity and peer problems on anxiety-related emotional disorders in adolescent survivors three years after the Ya'an earthquake","Background: Traumatic experiences often give rise to an increased risk of anxiety problems in adolescents. This study investigated the anxiety prevalence in adolescent earthquake survivors and the effect of secondary stressors such as bullying, poverty, or being “left behind” by parents working in the cities. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted three years after the 2013 Ya'an (China) earthquake on 6,132 adolescents aged 9 to 18 years from 11 public schools in three severely earthquake affected counties. The participants completed self-report questionnaires that assessed anxiety, earthquake exposure, poverty level, left-behind duration and bullying. Results: Separation anxiety (38.7%) and panic symptoms (32.2%) were found to be the primary contributors to anxiety in this adolescent sample. The regression and structural equation modeling indicated that adolescents who had suffered from high earthquake exposure, peer bullying, being left-behind, or poverty were more likely to report problems in all anxiety subcategories, with females reporting more anxiety symptoms than males. The likelihood of all anxiety disorders except separation anxiety was found to increase with age. Conclusions: This study highlighted the need for post-disaster interventions aimed at minimizing post-earthquake adversity such as peer bullying and specialized psychological services that target subgroups that might be more susceptible to anxiety-related emotional problems. The results could be used to identify possible markers for anxiety problems in children who had not experienced any major traumas.

108,Attachment and social support mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms,"Objective: To examine attachment insecurity and low social support as potential mediators of the association between childhood maltreatment (CM) types and depression severity in patients with a lifetime history of major depressive disorders (MDD). Method: Participants with an acute or remitted MDD ( N = 580) completed questionnaires about CM (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), attachment (Relationship Scales Questionnaire), social support (Social Support Questionnaire), and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory). Mediation and path models with CM types as independent variables, attachment avoidance and anxiety as mediators and depression severity as dependent variable were calculated. In addition, a sequential mediation model with attachment insecurity and social support as mediators of the association between CM and depression was tested. Results: Attachment avoidance and anxiety partially mediated the effect of CM on depression. In the path model including the different CM types, there were significant indirect effects of emotional abuse on depression via attachment anxiety and of emotional neglect on depression via attachment avoidance. Results also supported the hypothesized sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Limitations: A cross-sectional design with a retrospective self-report measure of CM was used and the developmental timing of exposure to CM was not considered. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the effect of emotional abuse and emotional neglect on depression is partially mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety. Further, the results support the hypothesis of a sequential mediation via attachment insecurity and social support. Accordingly, attachment insecurity is discussed as a target of psychotherapy for patients with MDD and CM.

109,Women with polycystic ovary syndrome associated with increased anxiety risk: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with developing mental disorders in Western populations, but this association is poorly studied in Asians. Hence, using insurance claims data, this study evaluated the anxiety risk in women with PCOS. Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 7026 women aged 15–49 years with newly diagnosed PCOS without anxiety in 1998–2013 as the PCOS cohort. We also randomly selected 28,104 women without PCOS and anxiety as the comparison cohort, which was frequency-matched to cases by age and index year. Determined by incidence and Cox method, the hazard ratio (HR) of anxiety and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association with PCOS were estimated after a 16-year follow-up. Results: The incidence of anxiety was 19.5% higher in the PCOS cohort than in the comparison cohort (15.3 vs. 12.8 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted HR of 1.18 (95% CI = 1.07–1.30). For women with both PCOS and comorbid depression, it was 32.1 per 1000 person-years, with an adjusted HR of 2.24 (95% CI = 1.24–4.06), compared with those without PCOS or depression. Moreover, it was 48.0 per 1000 person-years for women with depression alone (adjusted HR = 3.46; 95% CI = 2.58–4.64). Limitations: We used a diagnostic code to identify PCOS cases without reference to pathology records. Miscoding might have occurred in the database. Conclusions: PCOS is associated with an increased risk of developing anxiety independently. Comorbid depression could increase the risk further. Our findings provide vital information for Asian women to cope with anxiety.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize research on the prevalence and factors associated with PTSD, depression, anxiety symptoms, and other mental health problems among survivors. Methods: We searched six databases and retained 50 articles for the systematic review, 28 of which were included in three random effects meta-analyses on the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms in survivors. Results: Following the earthquake, more than one out of four individuals (28.44%,CI 95%,17.68%−42.37%; k = 24) reported severe symptoms of PTSD, one out of three reported severe symptoms of depression (32.16%,CI 95%,23.60%−42.11%; K = 14), and one out of five reported severe symptoms of anxiety (20.49%,CI 95%,15.74%−26.24%;k = 5). Studies revealed important rates of other mental health problems (including psychological distress and disturbance, suicidal ideations, and increased alcohol consumption) in survivors. Females were 41.38% more likely than males to experience severe symptoms of PTSD (OR = 1.41,CI 95%,1.22−1.64). Time was a moderator for depression and anxiety but not for PTSD, while the average age of participants only moderated depression. Limitations: The studies included are observational and most used self-reported measures. Conclusions: In a global context where natural disasters tripled since 1980, this first systematic review showed that human and material damages associated with the earthquake were sufficiently traumatic to induce severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems.

111,Latent profile analysis of exercise addiction symptoms in Brazilian adolescents: Association with health-related variables,"Background: The purpose of the present study is to identify profiles of adolescent exercisers based on exercise addiction symptoms (EA), and to examine differences in several health-related variables potentially related to EA across these profiles. Methods: A sample consisting of 618 adolescents, aged from 13 to 17 years, completed a questionnaire assessing EA, exercise characteristics (i.e., frequency and intensity of exercise), depression, body image (i.e., body appreciation and social physique anxiety), and disordered eating (i.e., concerns about eating and body weight gain as well as restrictive and compensatory practices). Results: The profile analysis identified three EA profiles, which were labelled: low-risk, high-risk with conflict and high-risk without conflict. Based on their scores for the health-related variables considered, the low-risk profile emerged as the least problematic; this increasing in the high-risk without conflict and even more so in the high-risk with conflict profiles. Nevertheless, individuals belonging to the high-risk without conflict profile showed similar body appreciation scores but lower social physique anxiety scores than those belonging to the low-risk profile. Limitations: The study is limited by both its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of the collected data. Conclusions: Conflict symptom may be relevant in explaining the differences in certain health-related variables between adolescents showing similarly high levels of EA.

112,Anxiety predicts dyadic sleep characteristics in couples experiencing insomnia but not in couples without sleep disorders,"Background: Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with sleep problems. Despite growing acknowledgement that bedpartners are important determinants of sleep quality, few studies have explored mental health as a risk factor for disrupted sleep of the bedpartner. We examined whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted an individual's sleep or their bedpartner's sleep, in couples where one partner experienced insomnia and in couples without sleep disorders. Methods: Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia (“Patient”), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission). Results: Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples. Limitations: The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power. Conclusions: Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia. These data underscore the importance of considering sleep, the bedpartner, and affective symptoms in mental health and sleep assessments.

The aim was to examine the association between baseline resilience and depression at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, which contributes to early detection and management of PSD. Methods: A total of 217 ischemic stroke survivors were recruited in two tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China from February 2017 to January 2018. The Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience at acute hospitalization. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was employed to ascertain baseline anxiety, baseline depression, and post-discharge depression. Social-demographic and disease-related information were obtained from participants’ self-report and medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSD. Results: The prevalence of depression at baseline was 21.2% and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge was 34.4%, 33.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. Logistics regression analyses indicated that resilience may independently predict PSD at 1 month (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.097, 0.518), 3 months (OR:0.302, 95%CI: 0.151, 0.607), and 6 months (OR: 0.03, 95%CI: 0.006, 0.153) after controlling for social-demographics, disease-related characteristics, baseline anxiety, and baseline depression. Limitations: Non-multicenter survey and mild stroke severity may affect the generalization of these findings. Moreover, response bias should be acknowledged because some participants were read questionnaires out aloud. Conclusion: Resilience is independently associated with PSD at different timepoints. Our findings reveal the important role of resilience as a protective factor against PSD.

114,Relationship of anxiety and depression symptoms with the different domains of physical activity in breast cancer survivors,"Background Physical activity (PA) has shown benefits in the mental health of breast cancer (BC) survivors. However, it is unclear if different domains of PA are related to the emotional well-being of this population. The objective of this study was to verify the relationship between different domains of PA [occupational, exercise/sport participation and leisure time/commuting] with symptoms of anxiety and depression in BC survivors. Methods It is a cross-sectional study, composed of 128 women breast cancer survivor, in which the socioeconomic class was evaluated through the questionnaire of the Brazilian Association of Research Companies (ABEP), PA level was evaluated through the Baecke questionnaire, and, symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results It was verified that occupational PA related to anxiety ( B = 1.44 [95% CI: 0.11; 2.76]) and leisure time/commuting PA was negatively related to depression ( B = -0.99 [95% CI: -1.64;-0.34]), even after adjustment of analysis by age, marital status, and socioeconomic status. There was no correlation between exercise/sport participation with scores of anxiety and depression in BC survivors. Physical activity at leisure time/commuting was negatively related with depression in BC survivors with mastectomy ( B = -1.20 [95% CI:-1.92; -0.47). Limitations The difficulty of recruiting the studied population and the absence of subsidy for participation in the study are factors to be considerate. Conclusions Occupational PA may not to be indicated in the management of emotional disorders in BC survivors; however, leisure time/commuting may be recommended to contribute to the mental well-being of this population.

115,"Women with major depressive disorder, irrespective of comorbid anxiety disorders, show blunted bilateral frontal responses during win and loss anticipation","Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) studies suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with lower left than right frontal brain activity (asymmetry), a pattern appearing stronger in women than men, and when elicited during emotionally-relevant paradigms versus an uncontrolled resting state. However, it is unclear whether this asymmetry pattern generalizes to the common presentation of MDD with co-occurring anxiety. Moreover, asymmetry may differ for anxiety subtypes, wherein anxious apprehension (AnxApp: worry characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder) appears left-lateralized, but anxious arousal (AnxAro: panic characteristic of social anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and panic disorders) may be right-lateralized. Methods: This analysis attempted to replicate frontal EEG asymmetry patterns using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants completed clinical interviews and a monetary incentive delay (MID) task during fMRI recording. We compared five groups of right-handed women from the Tulsa 1000 study, MDD ( n = 40), MDD-AnxApp ( n = 26), MDD-AnxAro ( n = 34), MDD-Both (with AnxApp and AnxAro; n = 26), and healthy controls (CTL; n = 24), as a function of MID anticipation condition (no win/loss, win, loss) and hemisphere on frontal blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Results: CTL exhibited higher bilateral superior, middle, and inferior middle frontal gyrus BOLD signal than the four MDD groups for high arousal (win and loss) conditions. However, frontal attenuations were unrelated to current depression/anxiety symptoms, suggestive of a trait as opposed to a state marker. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional analysis restricted to women. Conclusions: Reduced prefrontal cortex recruitment during processing of both positively and negatively valenced stimuli is consistent with the emotion context insensitivity theory of MDD.

116,Afraid of injustice? Justice sensitivity is linked to general anxiety and social phobia symptoms,"Background: Justice sensitivity (JS), the tendency to perceive and adversely respond to injustice, is related to externalizing problem behavior. Less is known about relations with internalizing problems including affective disorders, such as social phobia or general anxiety. Methods: We had N = 904 participants rate their JS, general anxiety and social phobia symptoms, and control variables. Results: All JS subscales were positively correlated with general anxiety and social phobia symptoms. Victim JS predicted both anxiety measures beyond the control variables, beneficiary JS predicted social phobia symptoms. These links were fully mediated by negative affect and fear of rejection and criticism. Limitations: The present study used cross-sectional data and requires replication with longitudinal data. Influences from anxiety symptoms on JS are also possible. Conclusions: The present findings indicate that JS is linked to anxiety symptoms in the general population, irrespective of the perspective from which individuals are justice sensitive and beyond other well-established risk factors. JS may be a vulnerability and a stress factor that may add to developing and maintaining anxiety and phobia symptoms. Therefore, JS may deserve consideration in anxiety research and treatment.

117,"Cannabis use during adolescence and the occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorder across adulthood: Findings from a longitudinal cohort study over 30 years","Objective: To examine the association between cannabis use in adolescence and the occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorders during adulthood. Methods: A stratified population-based cohort of young adults (n = 591) from Zurich, Switzerland, was retrospectively assessed at age 19/20 for cannabis use in adolescence. The occurrence of depression, suicidality and anxiety disorders was repeatedly assessed via semi-structured clinical interviews at the ages of 20/21, 22/23, 27/28, 29/30, 34/35, 40/41, and 49/50. Associations were controlled for various covariates, including socio-economic deprivation in adolescence as well as repeated time-varying measures of substance abuse during adulthood. Results: About a quarter (24%) reported cannabis use during adolescence; 11% started at age 15/16 or younger and 13% between the ages of 16/17 and 19/20. In the adjusted multivariable model, cannabis use during adolescence was associated with adult depression (aOR = 1.70, 95%-CI = 1.24–2.32) and suicidality (aOR = 1.65, 95%-CI = 1.11–2.47), but not anxiety disorders (aOR = 1.10, 95%-CI = 0.82–1.48). First use at age 15/16 and younger (as against first use between age 16/17 and 19/20 and no use) and frequent use in adolescence (as against less frequent use and no use) were associated with a higher risk of depression in adult life. Conclusions: In this longitudinal cohort study over 30-years, cannabis use during adolescence was associated with depression and suicidality in adult life. Young age at first use and high frequency of use in adolescence may particularly increase the risk of depression in adulthood. All associations were independent of cannabis abuse and other substance abuse during adulthood.

118,Adolescent and young adult mental health problems and infant offspring behavior: Findings from a prospective intergenerational cohort study,"Background: Parental depression and anxiety have been consistently linked to offspring behavior problems across childhood. However, many of the risks for these common mental health problems are established well before pregnancy. This study takes advantage of rare, prospective data to examine relations between parental mental health histories (from adolescence onwards) and next generation offspring behavior problems. Methods: Data were drawn from a multi-generational cohort study that has followed Australians from infancy to adulthood since 1983, and 1171 of their offspring assessed prospectively from pregnancy. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate associations between parents’ depression/anxiety symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood and offspring behavior problems at 1 year. Results: In analyses of 648 mother-infant and 423 father-infant dyads, after adjustment for confounders and concurrent mental health problems, mean behavior problem scores in infants of mothers with a history of mental health problems in both adolescence and young adulthood were over half a standard deviation higher than those of mothers without problems during these periods, B = 2.19, 95% CI 1.21 – 3.17, β = 0.52. No association was observed for fathers. Limitations: We only included infants born to participants aged 29–35 years and we assessed behavior problems via parent-report. Conclusions: A mother's history of persistent depression and anxiety from adolescence to young adulthood can predict higher levels of behavior problems in her infant. Findings support calls for greater policy and prevention focus on preconception and postnatal mental health, particularly a mother's early emotional health history, prior to parenthood.

119,Suicidal ideation and affect lability in single and multiple suicidal attempters with Major Depressive Disorder: An exploratory network analysis,"Introduction: A better understanding of the specific contribution of risk factors to suicidal behavior could arise from analyzing suicidal ideation (SI) in clinical samples, and comparing single versus multiple suicide attempters through contemporary methods allowing complex and dynamical analyses of multiple and simultaneously interacting suicide risk factors. Method: We explored associations among suicidal ideation (SI), affect lability and other suicide risk factors in 323 suicidal attempters diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). We analyzed the network structure and centrality of the total sample, and compared single versus multiple attempters and subjects with low and high suicidal ideation. Results: SI was connected with anxiety (trait) and hopelessness. Central nodes for global and specific groups were affect lability (from anxiety to depression), anxiety as a trait, and harm avoidance. We observed some specific differences between clinical profiles of repeaters and non-repeaters and significant network density between high and low SI. Limitations: Because our cross-sectional design, we cannot establish casual relationships among variables. We only examined associations at group level but not at single subject level. Conclusions: Affect lability (mainly the shifts from anxiety to depression) and trait anxiety were central in each estimated network. These symptoms might be suitable targets for early detecting and treating suicidal patients.

120,The associations of interpersonal sensitivity with mental distress and trait aggression in early adulthood: A prospective cohort study,"Background: To explore the longitudinal associations of interpersonal sensitivity (IS) with mental distress and trait aggression among participants passing through adolescence into adulthood. Methods: A total of 306 participants were recruited at baseline and received a 24-month follow-up. Questionnaires investigating sociodemographics; IS; depression, anxiety, and stress; and trait aggression were used. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and cross-lagged analyses were also performed. Results: At base, 22.5%, 18.3%, 24.2%, and 9.2% of the participants reported higher levels of IS, depressive, anxious, and stressful symptoms. IS at baseline was a partial risk factor for new problems, including anxiety, stress, and anger at follow-up. Newly developed or persistent IS was significantly associated with ongoing symptoms. Discontinued IS, however, only resolved the association with stress and anxiety symptoms. Similarly, newly developed or persistent IS was significantly associated with increased persistence of some problems (anxiety symptoms and physical aggression), while the discontinuation of IS was associated with a lessening of these outcomes. Cross-lagged analyses revealed bidirectional associations of IS with anxiety symptom and stress symptom. Limitations: All subjects were recruited from one medical college, which could limit applicability. This study had a relatively small sample size. Self-reported questionnaires can lead to recall bias. Further research is needed to test causality. Conclusions: IS can predict adolescents’ newly developed partial mental distress and aggression. Our findings highlight the crucial role of early recognition of both higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity and associated behavioral problems.

121,"Perceptions, clinical characteristics, and other factors associated with prolonged and high daily dose of benzodiazepine use among patients with anxiety or depressive disorders","Background: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have been widely used to treat anxiety; however, the risk of adverse health effects caused by their long-term use is high. This study examined the factors associated with the duration and higher daily dose of BZDs use among a population with anxiety or depressive disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Patients from a psychiatric outpatient department who had been prescribed BZDs were recruited. Data were collected from 250 patients. Results: Nearly 94% of patients were long-term BZDs users. The mean duration of BZDs use was 5.5 years; and mean defined daily dose (DDD) of BZDs use, converted to diazepam milligram equivalent (DDD), was 1.53 DME-DDD. Patients who knew more about alternative treatments were less prone to use BZD longer. Patients aged 65 years or older and those with difficulty falling asleep were more prone to use BZDs longer. Patients who were currently taking BZDs at higher daily dose were those who felt more depressed, prescribed second generation antipsychotics, suffered from disrupted sleep, less aware of alternative treatments, had comorbid chronic physical illness, and were current smokers. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design limited its ability to confirm causal relationships. Conclusions: Long-term and excessive daily dose of BZDs use in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders needs to be noted. Providing information or program of non-pharmacological treatment in reducing anxiety and improving specific sleep disturbance is suggested. Elderly, suffering from depressive mood, had comorbid chronic physical illness need to be targeted for further intervention.

122,Spanish Adaptation of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) and a study of its psychometric properties,"Background: The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) is composed of 99 items organized into 18 specific scales that provides dimensional assessment of depression, anxiety and bipolar symptoms. To date, IDAS-II is only available in the English and Turkish population. The main purpose of this study is to adapt the IDAS-II to the Spanish population and to assess the psychometric properties. Methods: Participants included community adults (n = 620) and college students (n = 378). All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hypomania Check List-32, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, in addition to the Spanish version of the IDAS-II. Results: The results indicate good internal consistency and high temporal stability of the Spanish version of the IDAS-II. Confirmatory factor analyses show for the first time that the three-factor structure of the IDAS-II (Distress, Obsessions/Fear, and Positive Mood) loads on a second order factor, labeled “Internalizing” according to the Hierarchical Taxonomy Of Psychopathology (HiTOP). Limitations: Study was conducted exclusively on student and community samples and some of the measures used as gold-standard have presented limitations Conclusions: According to previous studies, the results supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the majority of IDAS-II scales. IDAS-II is useful in assessing the severity of depression, anxiety and bipolar symptoms in research contexts in a Spanish population according to the HiTOP model. However, more evidence is required to prove the adequate functioning of the IDAS-II in clinical samples.

123,Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and their links to depression and anxiety in clinic- and community-based pediatric samples: A network analysis,"Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and associated with more severe OCD, greater impairment, and worse treatment outcome. Beyond twin studies showing that genetic factors contribute to the high co-occurrence, few studies have examined how OCD, depression, and anxiety are linked in youth, and current studies often fail to account for OCD and anxiety heterogeneity. Methods: Network analysis was used to investigate how OCD were linked to depression and anxiety in multinational youth diagnosed with OCD (total n = 419) and in school-recruited, community-based samples of youth (total n = 2 991). Results: Initial results aligned with earlier work showing that severity of obsession-related symptoms are important in linking OCD to depression in youth with OCD. However, when symptom content of OCD (e.g., washing, ordering) was fully taken into account and when measures of anxiety were included, specific OCD symptom dimensions (primarily obsessing and doubting/checking) were linked to specific anxiety dimensions (primarily panic and generalized anxiety) which in turn were linked to depression. These results were replicated in three separate community-based samples from Chile, Italy, and Spain using different measures of anxiety and depression. Limitations: Cross-sectional data were analyzed which precludes causal inference. Self-report measures were used. Conclusions: Youth with OCD with symptoms related to doubting/checking and obsessing should be carefully assessed for symptoms of panic and generalized anxiety. Non-responders to standard OCD treatment may benefit from interventions targeting panic and generalized anxiety, but more research is needed to test this hypothesis.

124,Change in neural response during emotion regulation is associated with symptom reduction in cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders,"Background: Anxiety disorders are debilitating conditions that can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Increased understanding of the neurobiological correlates of CBT may inform treatment improvements and personalization. Prior neuroimaging studies point to treatment-related changes in anterior cingulate, insula, and other prefrontal regions during emotional processing, yet to date the impact of CBT on neural substrates of “top down” emotion regulation remains understudied. We examined the relationship between symptom changes assessed over the course of CBT treatment sessions and pre- to post-treatment neural change during an emotion regulation task. Method: In the current study, a sample of 30 participants with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder completed a reappraisal-based emotion regulation task while undergoing fMRI before and after completing CBT. Results: Reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus was observed from pre- to post-treatment during periods of reducing versus maintaining emotion. Parahippocampal activation was associated with change in symptoms over the course of treatment and post-treatment responder status. Results suggest that, from pre- to post-CBT, participants demonstrated downregulation of neural responses during effortful cognitive emotion regulation. Limitations: Effects were not observed in frontoparietal systems as would be hypothesized based on prior literature, suggesting that treatment-related change could occur outside of fronto-parietal and limbic regions that are central to most models of neural functioning in anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Continued work is needed to better understand how CBT affects cognitive control and memory processes that are hypothesized to support reappraisal as a strategy for emotion regulation.

125,Structural abnormalities in nucleus accumbens in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Although the pathogenesis of panic attacks has been well studied in patients with panic disorder (PD), the neurobiological basis of the long-term fear memories and avoidance behavior that are often observed in PD have not been well investigated. Recent animal studies have suggested that nucleus accumbens (NAcc) plays an important role in neurobiological basis of long-term fear memories and avoidance behavior. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 matched healthy control subjects (HC) participated in this study. Differences in relative volumes and shape deformations of NAcc were evaluated between groups. Correlation analyses were conducted to quantify the association between structural abnormalities in the NAcc and trait, state anxiety measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Significant volume reductions were observed in the bilateral NAcc in the patients with PD, relative to the HC. In terms of shape differences, the PD patients demonstrated significant inward deformation of the NAcc bilaterally, compared to the HC. Degree of shape deformation in the right NAcc was associated with higher scores of the STAI-Trait, and STAI-State measures in the PD patients. Limitations: All the patients received medication such as Psychotropic drug. Conclusion: Patients with PD showed reduced volumes in the NAcc, especially in lateral regions, compared with HC. Furthermore, shape deformation in the right NAcc was associated with trait anxiety and state anxiety, which has been associated with avoidance behavior.

126,The influence of pre and postnatal adversity on depression and anxiety over two decades,"Introduction: Perinatal and later postnatal adversity (e.g., child sexual abuse) are predictors of psychopathology across the lifespan. However, little is known about the impact of the joint effects of perinatal and postnatal adversity on the longitudinal trajectories of mental health problems from adolescence through adulthood. Method: We utilized data from a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort of extremely low birth weight (ELBW; &lt; 1000 g) survivors and normal birth weight (NBW; &gt; 2500 g) control participants. Self-report data on internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (antisocial) problems were collected at 12–16, 22–26, and 30–35 years of age. Results: A birth weight by child sexual abuse (CSA) interaction was observed such that ELBW survivors exposed to CSA had higher levels of internalizing problems from adolescence through adulthood than NBW participants exposed to CSA. Differences remained significant after adjustment for covariates. Likewise, ELBW survivors exposed to CSA had higher levels of internalizing problems from adolescence through adulthood than ELBW participants who were not exposed to CSA. Limitations: Findings are limited by sample attrition due to the longitudinal nature of the study spanning over 30 years as well as the retrospective nature of child sexual abuse reporting. Conclusions: Exposure to both perinatal and later postnatal adversity leads to persistently higher internalizing problems than exposure to either adversity alone over more than two decades. These findings suggest that individuals exposed to perinatal adversity may be especially vulnerable to, and persistently affected by, childhood adversity, particularly in the form of depression and anxiety.

127,The centrality of depression and anxiety symptoms in major depressive disorder determined using a network analysis,"Background: Comorbid anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent and closely linked with poorer treatment outcomes, chronicity, and hospitalization in major depressive disorder (MDD). Our study aimed to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms that was developed based on a sample of MDD patients. Methods: We constructed a network of the 21 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) symptoms and 21 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) symptoms in 223 patients with MDD who were beginning psychiatric treatment. In addition, each of the depression and anxiety symptoms was considered to be an ordered categorical variable ranging in value from 0 to 3. Results: The three depression symptoms including loss of energy, loss of interest, and worthlessness and the seven anxiety symptoms including faintness or lightheadedness, feeling of choking, feeling scared, fear of the worst happening, nervousness, inability to relax, and feeling shaky were identified as the ten most central nodes within a network of depression and anxiety symptoms. The inter-connection between irritability and nervousness was a strong trans-diagnostic edge within the network of depression and anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Because our study was designed in a cross-sectional manner, the networks were estimated undirectionally. Conclusions: Our findings show that depression symptoms are not more central than anxiety symptoms within an estimated network structure of symptoms in patients with MDD. Moreover, the inter-connection between irritability and nervousness may suggests a probable trans-diagnostic association in MDD symptomatology.

128,"Depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of psychological strains: Towards an etiological theory of mood disorders and psychopathologies","Background: The etiological factors of mood disorders and psychopathologies are understudied. In this paper, we explored whether social psychological strains are related to depression, anxiety, and stress in non-clinical populations. Methods: 6,305 college students (39.3% men; 60.7% women) from six Chinese provincial-level jurisdictions completed a paper-and-pencil survey with Psychological Strain Scales (PSS-40) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), both validated in Chinese populations. Results: Both PSS-40 and DASS-21 have high internal consistency reliabilities, and are highly correlated with each other. Hence, Chinese college students with greater psychological strains (value, aspiration, deprivation, or coping) have greater depression, anxiety, and stress. These results still held after controlling for relevant socio-demographic variables in the multiple regression models. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study, and the sample only included several provinces in mainland China, not a representative sample of all of them. Conclusions: Mood disorders and psychopathologies are linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The results of this study extend the Strain Theory of Suicide from explaining the risk factors of suicidality to mood disorders and psychopathologies. Hence, these findings can inform prevention measures among college students, and possibly the general population.

129,Common mental disorders among young refugees in Sweden: The role of education and duration of residency,"Background: Studies investigating risks of common mental disorders (CMDs) in refugee youth are sparse. The current study examined health care use due to CMDs in unaccompanied and accompanied refugee youth and Swedish-born, and the role of education and residency duration. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included 743,671 individuals (whereof 33,501 refugees) between 19 and 25 years, residing in Sweden in 2009. Refugees were classified as unaccompanied/accompanied. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as health care use and antidepressant treatment, between 2010 and 2016 were calculated as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Highest attained education in 2009, and residency duration were examined as potential modifiers. Results: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.73 (95% CI 0.68–0.78) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.70–0.79) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had an 8-fold elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 8.40, 95% CI 6.16–11.47) and accompanied refugees had a nearly 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 2.78, 95% CI 2.29–3.37). Rates of PTSD decreased with years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education. Limitations: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. Conclusion: Refugees had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased. Last, low education was an important predictor for CMDs.

130,Age-dependent association of polymorphisms in the promoter and 5′-untranslated region of the norepinephrine transporter gene with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Norepinephrine transporter (NET), which regulates synaptic norepinephrine for noradrenergic signaling, is involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety, while expression of the NET gene differs at different ages. Here, we examine whether genetic variants in the NET gene are associated, in an age-specific manner, with increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), one of the most disabling anxiety disorders. Methods: Three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter (rs168924: A/G; rs2242446: T/C) and 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) (rs2397771: G/C) of the NET gene were genotyped in 2,317 Han-Chinese participants (791 GAD patients and 1,526 controls; age: 20–65). Potential confounding factors, such as gender, stress levels and psychiatric comorbidities, were included as covariates. Results: An interaction between age and NET genotypes and haplotypes was found for the risk of GAD. In the younger participants, rs168924 minor allele G homozygotes had the lowest incidence of GAD; however, older subjects displayed an inverse pattern, with homozygous G/G carriers presenting the highest prevalence of GAD. Additionally, younger individuals carrying 2 copies of the GGT haplotype composed of rs2397771-rs168924-rs2242446 had the lowest rate of GAD. However, those with 2 copies of the same haplotype exhibited the highest risk of GAD in the older groups. Limitations: Only 3 common SNPs in the promoter and 5′-UTR of the NET gene were analyzed. Conclusions: Our findings are the first to demonstrate that potentially functional SNPs in the NET promoter and 5′-UTR are associated with an increased risk of GAD, and that such associations are determined in an age-specific way.

Results: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.72) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.71) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had a nearly 6-fold elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 5.82, 95% CI 4.60–7.34) and accompanied refugees had a 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 3.08, 95% CI 2.54–3.74). Rates of PTSD decreased with years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education. Limitations: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. Conclusion: Refugees had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased. Last, low education was an important predictor for CMDs.

132,Comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) at early stages of the pregnancy. A multicultural cross-sectional study,"Introduction: When anxiety and depression are comorbid (CAD), symptoms are more severe and the response to treatments is worse. Given the links between mood disorders and poor perinatal outcomes, CAD and its correlates deserve special clinical attention during pregnancy. The main objective of this study was to learn about the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) in early stages of the pregnancy analyzing the relationship between CAD and cultural and sociodemographic factors. Methods: We have studied a multicultural sample of 514 Turkish and Spanish pregnant women (264 in Málaga, 102 in Istambul and 148 in Antalya) recruited at the moment of their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated versions of the Edinburg postnatal depression scale (EDS), the state and trait anxiety scale (STAI) and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables. Results: We found a CAD prevalence rate of 26.9% and a significant higher prevalence rate among Turkish women (47.6%) when compared to Spanish participants (9.5%) ( p &lt; 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the lack of someone who provided emotional support was the variable that best predicted CAD symptoms. Conclusion: The CAD prevalence rate was high and significant differences were found depending on the geographic and cultural context.

133,High-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling during sleep correlates with memory in depressed patients: A pilot study,"Background: It has been demonstrated that a reduction in the amount of high-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) is indicative of unstable sleep in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Considering the close relationship between sleep quality and memory consolidation, this study sought to investigate the potential of high-frequency CPC as a novel biomarker for objective evaluation of memory impairment in MDD. Methods: A total of 64 depressed patients and 35 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. High-frequency coupling (HFC) was assessed by electrocardiogram-based CPC analysis using a portable sleep-respiration monitor during sleep for one night. The next day, subjects completed the cognition assessment with the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD₁₇) and the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety (HAMA) were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety in each patient, respectively. Results: There was no significant difference in the proportion of HFC between depressed patients and healthy controls. In patients with low HFC proportion (&lt; 35%), severe anxiety could significantly decrease HFC proportion. The HFC proportion positively correlated with immediate and delayed memory in depressed patients. Further analysis showed that patients with low HFC proportion may have worse delayed memory. Limitations: The lack of prior exposure to the monitoring equipment and procedure could have generated artefacts that would have disappeared after habituation. Conclusions: These results support a positive correlation between the HFC proportion and memory in depressed patients. Further research is required to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

134,Generalized anxiety disorder is prospectively associated with decreased levels of interleukin-6 and adiponectin among individuals from the community,"Background: Anxiety disorders have been related to cardiovascular diseases via low-grade inflammation, but longitudinal studies on the association between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and inflammatory biomarkers are sparse. Furthermore, no studies have examined the association between GAD and the “cardio-protective” adipocytokine adiponectin in this context so far. Methods: In a Swiss population-based sample of 2,415 adults participating in baseline and follow-up exams (mean follow-up duration = 5.5 years), we diagnosed a total of 55 persons (2.3%) with GAD using a validated semi-structured psychiatric interview. We prospectively examined the relation between GAD and circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin), in linear regression models, statistically controlled for the baseline inflammatory marker, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk factors, health behaviors, and psychiatric disorders. Results: Compared to those without GAD, individuals with GAD had lower IL-6 (β = -0.249, 95%-CI -0.493-(-0.004), p = 0.046), and adiponectin (β = -0.264, 95%-CI -0.482-(-0.045), p = 0.018) levels at follow-up after adjustment for all covariates. Moreover, GAD was unrelated to several other inflammatory measures. Conclusion: Individuals with GAD do not seem to exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation, suggesting different underlying biobehavioral mechanisms to those from other anxiety disorders. Low adiponectin levels may be linked to symptoms of GAD through brain areas directly involved in the processing of fear and anxiety.

135,Adult separation anxiety disorder: The human-animal bond,"Background: The introduction of an adult onset Separation Anxiety Disorder in the DSM-V recognises that separation anxiety can occur at any stage across the lifespan. In this paper, we examine whether adult separation anxiety, which is known to occur when people are apart from other people close to them, can also develop when people are separated from animal companions. The social and individual psychological correlates of this reported phenomenon are examined. Methods: Participants ( N = 313, aged 18–76, M = 41.89 years), completed demographic information and questionnaires measuring separation anxiety from companion animals and humans, attachment towards companion animals and humans, and social support. Results: Significant positive relationships were observed between separation anxiety from humans, people substitution and separation anxiety from animals. Participants with greater separation anxiety from animals also reported less social support and greater attachment anxiety involving humans. People substitution was also positively related to greater animal-related separation anxiety. Associations were generally weaker when cats were identified as the principal companion animal. Participants without children reported significantly less attachment-related avoidance (human); less perceived social support; greater people substitution; and, greater separation anxiety towards companion animals. Separation anxiety from humans, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety accounted for 41% of variance in separation anxiety from animals. Limitations: The correlational design does not allow the investigation of causal associations. Conclusions: A strong, positive relationship was observed between human-related separation anxiety and animal-related separation anxiety, which was significantly stronger for people with lower levels of social support.

However, the authors disagree with the commentators claim that we have ignored the very important, if not major, role of the regular exposure of adolescents to artificial light at night and its deleterious impact on health. We invite the authors to consider the possible causal chain order among social anxiety, screen time before sleep, sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Importantly, one of the ultimate goals of an epidemiological observational study is to provide relevant insights for designing effective interventions improving the participants’ health. In this case, we would still recommend interventions to target social anxiety, which would impact sleep quality, depressive symptoms and adiposity in adolescents according to our study. It is also likely that adolescents who decrease their social anxiety levels would decrease their screen time before going to sleep.

137,Adolescent social anxiety and clock disruption. A commentary,"Comments on an article by Rodrigo Antunes Lima et al.(see record 2019-64167-029). In the article, Antunes Lima et al evaluated the cross sectional synergic relationship between social anxiety, poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and body fatness in a cohort of Brazilian adolescents. The authors reported that social anxiety was positively associated with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, and body fatness and that poor sleep quality was associated with depressive symptoms. They concluded that social anxiety plays a major role in the health of adolescents. The article by Antunes Lima et al. examined the relationship between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep, and being overweight in adolescents. All up, the exposure of children and adolescents to artificial light in the evening has a number of negative health consequences that correspond to social desynchronization or chronodisruption of the circadian system. This should be considered in studies of adolescent social anxiety. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Comment/Reply",2020
138,Type 3 adenylyl cyclase in the main olfactory epithelium participates in depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours,"Background: Deficiency of olfaction is thought to be associated with depression, and type 3 adenylyl cyclase (AC₃) genetic knockout and forebrain knockout mice show depression-like behaviours. AC₃ is expressed in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and hippocampus, which plays an important role in olfactory signal transduction. However, it is unclear whether AC₃ in the MOE also plays a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, we aimed to study the relationship between AC₃ in the MOE and the pathogenesis of depression. Methods: We obtained anosmic mice by intranasal perfusion of zinc sulphate (ZnSO₄) (ZnSO₄ mice), and distinctively knocked down AC₃ in the MOE (AC 3KD/MOE mice) by CRISPR/cas9 technology. Behavioural tests related to depression and anxiety were employed to evaluate the depression- and anxiety-like behaviours of mice. The mRNA and protein expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine receptors (Drds), and N-Methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) in the hippocampus of mice were investigated by qPCR and western blotting to explore the mechanism of depression and anxiety caused by AC₃ in the MOE, preliminarily. Results: Compared with NaCl mice, ZnSO₄ mice exhibited depression-like behaviours in tail suspension tests (TST), forced swimming tests, and social (FST) interaction tests (SIT), but showed no anxiety-like behaviours in anxiety-related behavioural tests. The mRNA and protein expressions of Drd₃ and GluN2B in the hippocampus of ZnSO₄ mice were significantly downregulated. Compared with the negative control mice (NC mice), AC 3KD/MOE mice showed depression-like behaviours in TST, FST, and SIT tests, anxiety-like behaviours in light/dark transition test, elevated-plus maze test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test. The protein expressions of Drd₃, TH, and GluN2B were significantly downregulated in the hippocampus. Limitations: We did not further demonstrate that AC₃ in the MOE causes depression through the dopaminergic nervous system with dopamine or dopamine receptor agonists. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that intranasal infusion of ZnSO₄ can cause depression-like behaviours and has no effect on anxiety-like behaviours. Specific knockdown of AC₃ in the MOE can cause depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours. The behavioural changes caused by intranasal ZnSO₄ and specific knockdown of AC₃ in the MOE can be related to the significant downregulation of dopaminergic system and GluN2B expressions in the hippocampus of mice.

139,Prefrontal-amygdala connectivity in trait anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder: Testing the boundaries between healthy and pathological worries,"Background: Current brain-based theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) suggest a dysfunction of amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex emotional regulatory mechanisms. These alterations might be reflected by an altered resting state functional connectivity between both areas and could extend to vulnerable non-clinical samples such as high worriers without a GAD diagnosis. However, there is a lack of information in this regard. Methods: We investigated differences in resting state functional connectivity between the basolateral amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (amygdala-vmPFC) in 28 unmedicated participants with GAD, 28 high-worriers and 28 low-worriers. We additionally explored selected clinical variables as predictors of amygdala-vmPFC connectivity, including anxiety sensitivity. Results: GAD participants presented higher left amygdala-vmPFC connectivity compared to both groups of non-GAD participants, and there were no differences between the latter two groups. In our exploratory analyses, concerns about the cognitive consequences of anxiety (the cognitive dimension of anxiety sensitivity) were found to be a significant predictor of the left amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of our study preclude us from assessing if functional connectivity measures and anxiety sensitivity scores entail an increased risk of GAD. Conclusions: These results suggest a neurobiological qualitative distinction at the level of the amygdala-vmPFC emotional-regulatory system in GAD compared to non-GAD participants, either high- or low-worriers. At this neural level, they question previous hypotheses of continuity between high worries and GAD development. Instead, other anxiety traits such as anxiety sensitivity might confer a greater proneness to the amygdala-vmPFC connectivity alterations observed in GAD.

140,Prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depression in older adults: Gender differences in psychosocial indicators,"Background: With increasing numbers of people living into old age, health functioning and good quality of life are central to public health policy in aging. However, quality of life for many elders is undermined by anxiety and depression. Understanding gender differences in the determinants of anxiety and depression symptoms is crucial to policy and practice. Objective: To examine gender-specific symptom subtypes of later-life anxiety and depression, in relation to their socio-demographic, social and health context. Method: Cross-sectional study using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, 2009–2011). Latent class analysis defined gender-specific symptom profiles for anxiety and depression. Correlates of latent classes were analysed using logistic regression, assessing associations between socio-demographic factors; social indicators and health indicators. Results: Four classes of self-reported anxiety and depression were derived: ‘low’, ‘comorbidity’, ‘anxiety and subthreshold depression’ and ‘anxiety’ only. With males 8% were comorbid, 26% subthreshold and 26% with anxiety only. With female 12% were comorbid, 27% subthreshold and 29% with anxiety only. While symptom expression may relate to stress from common ageing, our findings show clear gradations of symptoms associated with a range of social and health indicators. Conclusion: Our findings support the actuality of comorbid depression and anxiety with further evidence for anxiety and subthreshold depression . A sizeable subgroup confirms that many older people experience anxiety only. Our study indicates the need for a more sensitive recognition of needs and a more nuanced policy agenda for older people towards improving the quality of their social life.

141,Body dissatisfaction and Fat Talk during pregnancy: Predictors of distress,"Background: During pregnancy, women are vulnerable to mood and anxiety disorders due to the significant physical and emotional changes that occur during this period. For some women, pregnancy can also present as a period of immense body dissatisfaction due to the substantial changes in body shape and size. Objectives: This study examined the mediating role of Fat Talk (i.e., engaging in disparaging comments about one's body shape and size with others) in the relationship between (a) body dissatisfaction and distress in pregnant women (i.e., pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology), and (b) sociocultural pressure to meet the thin ideal and distress. Method: A nonclinical sample of 408 pregnant women (M age = 28.24 years, SD age = 5.04, range 18–44 years) completed measures of body dissatisfaction, sociocultural pressure, pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. Findings: Analyses confirmed the partial mediating role of Fat Talk between body dissatisfaction and all three measures of distress, when examined individually. Fat Talk also mediated the relationship between sociocultural pressure (i.e., peers/family and media) and the three measures of distress. Age also partially mediated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and a composite measure of pregnancy distress. Conclusions: The results suggest that women face sociocultural pressures for thinness and body dissatisfaction even when pregnant, and that engaging in Fat Talk contribute to greater levels of pregnancy-related anxiety, depression and eating disorder symptomatology. The role of Fat Talk in regard to pregnancy distress may be more pertinent to younger women.

142,Anxiety sensitivity and emotion regulation as mechanisms of successful CBT outcome for anxiety-related disorders in a naturalistic treatment setting,"Background: Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing anxiety symptoms. However, relatively fewer studies have examined the effectiveness of CBT in naturalistic treatment settings. There is even less known about the mechanisms underlying successful outcomes in naturalistic samples receiving CBT. This study aimed to examine the absolute and relative mediation of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties and anxiety sensitivity (AS) on anxiety symptom reduction. Methods: Participants were treatment-seeking patients ( N = 247) at an outpatient anxiety clinic. Measures of difficulties in ER, AS, and disorder specific symptoms were administered at baseline, mid, and post-treatment. A composite anxiety score was calculated to measure anxiety disorder symptom severity across anxiety-related diagnoses. Results: Individual mediation models revealed that both AS and ER significantly mediated the reduction in anxiety-related symptoms over the course of treatment. A multiple mediation model found that ER was the strongest mediator (indirect effect = −1.030, 95% CI = −2.172 to −0.153). Further analyses revealed that the ER subscale of impulse control difficulties (e.g., the tendency to avoid when confronted with a feared stimulus) was the strongest mediator (indirect effect = −0.849, 95% CI = −1.913 to −0.081). Limitations: This study relied solely on self-report measures of ER, AS, and anxiety pathology, and did not have a control group. Conclusions: These results suggest that improvement in the ability to control impulses may act as a mechanism of anxiety symptom reduction and may be important to target in CBT with naturalistic samples.

143,Influence of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas in China: The mediator and moderator role of perceived social support,"Objective: to explore the influence of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas, and to verify the mediator and moderator role of perceived social support. Methods: 797 rural left-behind children were studied with physical exercise rating scale, social anxiety scale and perceived social support assessment scale. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between physical exercise and social anxiety, and regression and structural equation models were used to check whether perceived social support played a mediator and moderator role or not. Results: the effect of physical exercise on social anxiety of left-behind children in rural areas is significant ( P &lt; 0.01); exercise time, exercise intensity and exercise frequency have significant effects on social anxiety; perceived social support has significant effects on social anxiety ( P &lt; 0.01); family support, friend support and other support have significant negative effects on social anxiety. Regression analysis shows that the dimensions of perceived social support (family support, friend support and other support) have some mediator effects in explaining social anxiety in sports. Perceived social support plays a moderator role in the relationship between physical exercise and social anxiety. Conclusions: The results suggests the impact of perceived social support on left-behind children in rural areas. Specifically, perceived social support has a positive impact on the level of social anxiety and a positive impact on physical exercise. It is suggested that attention should be paid to social support of rural left-behind children in the process of mental health education and school physical education.

144,Threat-sensitivity in affective disorders: A case-control study,"Background: Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with major depression but differ in their symptom profiles and pharmacological responses. Threat-sensitivity may explain such differences, yet research on its relationship to specific disorders is lacking. Methods: One-hundred patients (71 women) and 35 healthy controls (23 women) were recruited. Thirty-five had Panic Disorder (PD), 32 had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and 33 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Threat-sensitivity was measured via behavior (Joystick Operated Runway Task; JORT) and self-report (Fear Survey Schedule; FSS). Results: Behavioral sensitivity to simple threat was higher in females compared to males ( p = .03). Self-reported sensitivity to simple threat (FSS Tissue Damage Fear) was higher in PD patients compared to other groups ( p ≤ .007) and in GAD patients compared to controls ( p = .02). Behavioral sensitivity to complex threat was higher in females than males ( p = .03) and a group by sex interaction ( p = .01) indicated that this difference was largest in PD patients. Self-reported sensitivity to complex threat (FSS Social Fear) was higher in all patients compared to controls ( p ≤ .001). Females scored higher than males on FSS Tissue Damage Fear and FSS Social Fear). Conclusions: Our findings oppose the simple/complex threat dichotomy, instead suggesting elevated sensitivity to physical threat differentiates anxiety disorders from MDD, whereas elevated sensitivity to social threat is associated with both anxiety disorders and MDD.

145,Where perception meets belief updating: Computational evidence for slower updating of visual expectations in anxious individuals,"Background: Surprising events are important sources of internal model updating which adjusts expectations for both decision-making and perceptual processing circuits. Anxious individuals display relatively intact updating of internal models used to make decisions, however how these individuals update their perceptual expectations remains poorly understood. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that anxious individuals experienced exaggerated surprise to predictable events, which imbues them with undue salience. Methods: To model the rate of updating of internal models for both decision-making and perceptual processing, we applied a hybrid Rescorla Wagner (RW)/Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to a change point detection task in a transdiagnostic group of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders and examined the relationship between learning rates and anxiety and negative affect. Results: Model comparison provided evidence that decision-making and perceptual processing rely on separate internal models with different learning rates. Anxiety and older age were associated with slower updating of models used in perceptual processing, but not those used in decision-making. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study and lacked neural data to examine the role of specific brain circuits in updating of perceptual predictions. Conclusions: Anxious individuals display slower updating of internal models used in perceptual processing, but not those used in decision-making. This deficit could contribute to exaggerated salience of harmless stimuli in anxiety. The results have implications for the assessment and treatment of basic processing dysfunctions in anxiety.

146,A tale of two systems: Testing a positive and negative valence systems framework to understand social disconnection across anxiety and depressive disorders,"Background: Social disconnection is a common and pernicious feature of anxiety and depressive disorders, yet is insufficiently addressed by our best available treatments. To better understand why people with anxiety and depression feel socially disconnected, we tested a positive and negative valence systems framework informed by research on how normative social connections develop and flourish. Method: Individuals seeking treatment for anxiety or depression (N = 150) completed measures of perceived social connectedness, positive and negative valence temperament, social goals, affect, symptoms, and life satisfaction. Results: Feeling less socially connected was associated with diminished life satisfaction, beyond clinical symptom severity. Regression analyses revealed that both diminished positive valence and heightened negative valence temperament, and their corresponding motivational and affective outputs, were significantly and uniquely (with no significant interaction between them) associated with lower perceived connectedness. Limitations: Data was cross-sectional and based on self-report—limiting conclusions about causality and social disconnection processes at different units of analysis. Conclusions: Understanding social disconnection through the lens of a positive and negative valence systems framework may inform transdiagnostic models and treatment approaches.

In the original article, there were some errors in the Abstract section on page 82 and the Results section on page 85. The corrected texts are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-07272-009). Background: Social network, loneliness, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression disorder (MDD) are interrelated. However, as the directions of these associations are still unclear, we examined them prospectively using community-based data. Methods: Data on 5066 adults aged ≥ 50 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were analyzed. Loneliness was assessed through the UCLA loneliness scale. Social integration was measured using the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index. MDD and GAD were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Logistic regression models were conducted. Results: The longitudinal association between experiencing loneliness and higher likelihood of suffering from MDD or GAD two years later is bidirectional but stronger with loneliness as origin, whereas the association between social isolation and higher likelihood of subsequent MDD or GAD as well as those between loneliness and subsequent deterioration of social integration are unidirectional. Conclusion: Objective and perceived social isolation independently affect the probability of suffering from MDD or GAD whereas loneliness is a risk factor for the deterioration of social life, which highlights the need to address the subjective factors (such as loneliness) and objective factors (such as social network size) of social isolation in a complementary way in order to improve the mental health of the older adult population.

148,Joint association of ultra-processed food and sedentary behavior with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among Brazilian adolescents,"Aims: We analyzed the joint association of high ultra-processed food ingestion and sedentary behavior (SB) with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among Brazilian adolescents. Methods: Data from the Brazilian Scholar Health Survey, a nationally representative survey of 9th grade adolescents [mean: 14.28 years (range: 11–18 years)] conducted in 2015 ( n = 100,648) were used. Self-reported anxiety-induced sleep disturbance, SB (TV viewing and total sitting time), and frequency of ingestion of different ultra-processed foods were collected. Age, ethnicity, type of city (capital or interior), region of the country, and habitual physical activity (global scholar survey questionnaire) were covariates. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations. Results: High ultra-processed food ingestion plus low SB [boys:OR:1.44(99%CI:1.16–1.79), girls:OR:1.41(99%CI:1.22–1.63)] were risk factors for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The highest risk of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance was observed among those who joint high ultra-processed food ingestion with high SB [boys:OR:1.85(99%CI:1.46–2.35), girls:OR:1.62(99%CI:1.39–1.89)]. In addition, the interaction of high ultra-processed food ingestion with TV-viewing substantially increased the odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance [boys:OR:2.03(99%CI:1.61–2.56), girls:OR:2.04(99%CI:1.76–2.36)]. Conclusions: Both the high consumption of ultra-processed foods and SB (especially TV-viewing) appear to be independently associated with anxiety-induced sleep disturbance in both sexes. However, the co-occurrence of both negative lifestyle behaviors is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. Future longitudinal research is required to confirm/refute our findings and explore potential mechanisms.

149,Reduced anti-inflammatory gut microbiota are associated with depression and anhedonia,"Introduction: Characterize gut microbiota distributions of participants with co-occurring depression and anxiety, in those with only depression or with anxiety, and determine if gut bacteria differentially correlates with distinct clinical presentations. Methods: Participants (10 healthy controls [mean age: 33, 60% female] and 60 psychiatric subjects; major depressive disorder (comorbid with anxiety), n = 38 [mean age: 39.2, 82% female], anxiety only, n = 8 [mean age: 40.0, 100% female], depression only without anxiety, n = 14 [mean age: 41.9, 79% female]) were characterized by psychiatric assessments. Quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to characterize the gut microbiota in stool samples. Results: Altered microbiota correlated with pre-defined clinical presentation, with Bacteroides ( p = 0.011) and the Clostridium leptum subgroup ( p = 0.023) significantly different between clinical categories. Cluster analysis of the total sample using weighted UniFrac β-diversity of the gut microbiota identified two different clusters defined by differences in bacterial distribution. Cluster 2 had higher Bacteroides ( p = 0.006), and much reduced presence of Clostridales ( p &lt; 0.001) compared to Cluster 1. Bifidobacterium ( p = 0.0173) was also reduced in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1. When evaluated for clinical characteristics, anhedonia scores in Cluster 2 were higher than in Cluster 1. Limitations: The sample is smaller and predominately female. Conclusions: Reduced or absent Clostridia was consistently seen in those with depression, independent of the presence of anxiety. Conversely, reduced Bacteroides may be more associated with the presence of anxiety, independent of the presence of depression. These differences suggest that gut microbiota distribution could help clarify the underlying pathology of comorbid clinical presentation.

150,Trajectories of maternal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder predict long-term mental health of children following the Wenchuan earthquake in China: A 10-year follow-up study,"Background: Maternal psychopathology can be an important factor associated with psychological adjustment of children. However, there is limited research on long-term impacts of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on children's mental health. This study examined how PTSD trajectories of women exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China predicted their children's mental health symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. Methods: 410 dyads of mothers and their adolescent children who exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake were investigated at 12 and 18 months post-earthquake. While the mothers completed measures of earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms, the children completed measures of earthquake exposure, PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. In the 10-year follow up, 257 out of the 410 children completed measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Data were analyzed using linear regression. Results: Four trajectories of maternal PTSD symptoms were identified: (a) chronic (9.5%); (b) resilient (66.3%); (c) delayed (7.6%); and (d) recovery (16.6%); More importantly, the findings demonstrated that children whose mothers experienced chronic PTSD reported higher level of PTSD and anxiety symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. Limitations: Only two waves of maternal PTSD were collected, self-reported tools other than clinical reviews were used to collect data, and a significant proportion of participants did not respond at the 10-year follow-up. Conclusions: This study identified maternal PTSD trajectories following the Wenchuan earthquake. Chronic PTSD symptoms in mothers were associated with increased risk of children's PTSD and anxiety 10 years after the earthquake.

151,Emotionally valenced stimuli impact response inhibition in those with substance use disorder and co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms,"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with impaired response inhibition. Given the deficits in emotion regulation associated with SUD, it is unclear if this impairment is exacerbated by emotionally valenced stimuli. Co-occurring conditions may further exacerbate these impairments as many co-occurring conditions further impact emotion regulation. It was hypothesized that negative stimuli may further impact response inhibition for this population. Methods: The current study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition to negative, neutral and positive stimuli in a sample of those with a history of SUD and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Response inhibition was poorer for negative stimuli relative to neutral stimuli. There was no difference between negative and positive stimuli. Depression severity moderated the difference between response inhibition for negative and neutral stimuli. At elevated depression, response inhibition was worse and there was no difference across emotional stimuli. At low depression, there was a significant difference between negative and neutral stimuli. This effect was not found for anxiety symptoms. Limitations: Study participants presented with polysubstance use of varying duration and amount. It is unclear whether findings are attributed to specific substances, or substance use broadly. Additionally, happy, angry, and calm facial emotions were used to represent positive, negative, and neutral valences respectively. It is unclear whether these findings are generalizable to other emotional expressions. Conclusion: Results suggested that emotionally valenced stimuli affected response inhibition among those with low symptom severity. At elevated symptom severity, response inhibition to all stimuli were impaired.

152,Autism spectrum disorder traits are associated with empathic abilities in adults with anorexia nervosa,"Background: Social and emotional difficulties have been identified as key factors in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). However, few studies have investigated the influence of comorbid psychopathology on social cognition. The aim of the current study was to examine perception of nonverbal communication and empathy in AN using ecologically valid, performance-based measures, and to explore associations with comorbid psychopathology (anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits, alexithymia, and social anxiety). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) and the Mini Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (MiniPONS) were administered to 51 adults with AN, 51 recovered AN (REC), and 51 healthy controls (HCs). Comorbid psychopathological traits were assessed using self-report questionnaires and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule—2nd edition (ADOS-2). Results: Individuals with AN showed reduced affective empathy to positive stimuli compared to HCs, and a trend towards lower vocal prosody recognition scores relative to REC. Around a quarter of AN and REC scored above the clinical cut-off for ASD on the ADOS-2, and high ASD symptoms predicted lower cognitive and affective empathy scores. Limitations: The study is cross-sectional, future research would benefit from examining social-cognition performance and comorbid psychopathology longitudinally. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of ASD symptoms in empathy dysfunction in those with a lifetime history of AN. Future research should explore whether treatment adaptations to accommodate for differences in social-cognitive abilities may be helpful in the treatment of AN.

153,Perceived burdensomeness uniquely accounts for suicidal ideation severity in social anxiety disorder,"Background: High rates of suicidal ideation in those with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been attributed to feelings of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, but most work has been in non-clinical samples. We assessed the contributions of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness to suicidal ideation severity, over clinical covariates, in individuals diagnosed with SAD. Methods: Participants were 58 adult outpatients (mean age 25.62 years, 69% female) with SAD. Hierarchical linear regression assessed contributions of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness to suicidal ideation, before and after covarying other potential explanatory variables (depression, agitation, brooding rumination). Results: Perceived burdensomeness was significantly positively related to suicidal ideation severity ( p &lt; .001) above thwarted belongingness, which was not incremental ( p = .791). The same pattern was found after inclusion of additional covariates (perceived burdensomeness p = .006; thwarted belongingness p = .757). Greater agitation also uniquely accounted for more severe suicidal ideation ( p = .001). Limitations: This study was cross-sectional, did not assess all potential confounding variables, and utilized a treatment-seeking sample. Conclusions: Results suggest perceived burdensomeness is independently related to suicidal ideation severity in SAD, over thwarted belongingness and other clinical features. Future work should seek to replicate these findings and evaluate causal, longitudinal relationships among perceived burdensomeness, agitation, and severity of suicidal ideation in those with SAD in order to determine whether these may be clinically-relevant mechanisms.

154,Adolescent internalizing symptoms: The importance of multi-informant assessments in childhood,"Background: Childhood internalizing symptoms can be associated with adolescent internalizing symptoms, but only a small proportion of symptomatic children are at long-term risk. Our objectives were to (1) distinguish between typical and atypical levels of internalizing symptoms using mother- and teacher-assessments and (2) test the association between childhood internalizing symptoms and adolescent generalized anxiety, depression, and social phobia symptoms in boys and girls. Methods: Multi-trajectory models were used to estimate the evolution of mother- and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms across childhood (1.5 to 12 years) in a large population-based cohort ( n = 1431). Multiple linear regression models were implemented to estimate the association between childhood group membership of internalizing symptoms and self-reported specific internalizing symptoms at 15 years by sex. Results: Five groups of childhood internalizing symptoms were identified: Mother &amp; teacher low (22.6%), Mother moderate/teacher low (37.9%), Mother moderate/teacher high (18.3%), Mother high/teacher low (11.8%) and Mother &amp; teacher high (9.5%). Multiple linear regression models showed that compared to the low group, (1) boys in the high group reported higher social phobia symptoms ( p = 0.04), (2) girls in the high group reported higher depression ( p = 0.01) and generalized anxiety ( p &lt; 0.01) symptoms, and (3) girls in the moderate/high group reported higher generalized anxiety symptoms ( p = 0.02) in adolescence. Limitations: The main limitation is that mothers’ and teachers’ assessments mostly covered different developmental periods. Conclusions: A multi-informant assessment of childhood internalizing symptoms improves adolescent specific internalizing symptoms identification in a general population sample over reliance on a single informant.

155,Common mental disorders among young refugees in Sweden: The role of education and duration of residency,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 270 of Journal of Affective Disorders (see record 2020-30279-030). In the original article, there were a number of errors. The correct and final version is included in the present issue (see record 2020-30279-031).] Background: Studies investigating risks of common mental disorders (CMDs) in refugee youth are sparse. The current study examined health care use due to CMDs in unaccompanied and accompanied refugee youth and Swedish-born, and the role of education and residency duration. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study included 746,517 individuals (whereof 36,347 refugees) between 19 and 25 years, residing in Sweden in 2009. Refugees were classified as unaccompanied/accompanied. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as health care use and antidepressant treatment, between 2010–2016 were calculated as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Highest attained education in 2009, and residency duration were examined as potential modifiers. Results: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.72) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.71) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had a nearly 6-fold elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 5.82, 95% CI 4.60–7.34) and accompanied refugees had a 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 3.08, 95% CI 2.54–3.74). Rates of PTSD decreased with years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education. Limitations: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. Conclusion: Refugees had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased. Last, low education was an important predictor for CMDs.

156,The relationship between sleep efficiency and clinical symptoms is mediated by brain function in major depressive disorder,"Background: Sleep disturbance is a common and key symptom that affects most of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, neural substrates underlying sleep disturbance and their clinical relevance in depression remain unclear. Methods: Ninety-six MDD patients underwent resting-state functional MRI. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) were used to measure brain function. Overnight polysomnography was performed to objectively measure sleep efficiency (SE), which was used to classify patients into normal sleep efficiency (NSE) and low sleep efficiency (LSE) groups. Between-group differences in fALFF and rsFC were examined using two-sample t -tests. Moreover, correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to test for potential associations between SE, brain functional changes, and clinical variables. Results: LSE group showed decreased fALFF in right cuneus, thalamus, and middle temporal gyrus compared to NSE group. MDD patients with low SE also exhibited lower rsFC of right cuneus to right lateral temporal cortex, which was associated with more severe depression and anxiety symptoms. More importantly, mediation analyses revealed that the relationships between SE and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly mediated by the altered rsFC. In addition, these low SE-related brain functional alterations were not affected by antidepressant medication and were independent of structural changes. Limitations: The lack of healthy controls because of “first-night effect”. Conclusion: These findings not only may expand existing knowledge about neuropathology of sleep disturbance in depression, but also may inform real-world clinical practice by improving depression and anxiety symptoms through sleep regulation.

157,Affective temperaments and eating psychopathology in anorexia nervosa: Which role for anxious and depressive traits?,"Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness. Personality traits and comorbidity with affective and anxiety disorders are key-aspects of its pathogenesis but little attention has been paid so far to affective temperaments in AN. Also, childhood anxiety is proposed to impact on AN clinical severity. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if affective temperaments could be related to AN eating psychopathology also clarifying if those with low versus high scores on depressive and anxious temperaments could differ in AN clinical current and lifetime severity. Methods: One-hundred and forty-seven inpatients with AN were consecutively recruited. All participants completed: Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire, Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical data were collected upon admission. Results: Regression models showed that all affective temperaments were associated with eating psychopathology (eating restraint and eating, shape, and weight concerns); however, when controlling for confounders, only the anxious temperament remained significant. Also, those patients with higher scores on depressive and anxious temperaments reported higher current and lowest lifetime body mass index (BMI). Limitations: Only inpatients were recruited; self-report assessments were used and follow-up data are lacking. Conclusions: Results from this study support the association between affective (anxious in particular) temperament traits and the presence of altered eating psychopathology in AN. Also, higher traits of depressive and anxious temperaments reported higher current and lowest lifetime BMI. Should these findings be confirmed, the assessment of the anxious temperament could fruitfully inform prevention and treatment interventions for AN.

158,Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome,"Background: Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results: Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations: A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.

159,Mid-pregnancy insomnia is associated with concurrent and postpartum maternal anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Although many perinatal women are affected by anxiety, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and its potential triggers. The primary aim of this study was to examine concurrent and prospective associations between mid-pregnancy insomnia and perinatal anxiety. Furthermore, we compared psychosocial and reproductive characteristics between participants with and without mid-pregnancy insomnia and explored changes in the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms from mid-pregnancy to 8 weeks postpartum. Methods: This study was part of the Norwegian Depression and Anxiety in the Perinatal Period (DAPP) prospective, population-based, cohort study. We analyzed hospital birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy week 17 and postpartum week 8 ( n = 530). The Bergen Insomnia Scale was used to measure insomnia and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist to measure anxiety. OCD symptoms were measured based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: Mid-pregnancy insomnia was significantly associated with both concurrent and postpartum anxiety in a linear mixed model adjusted for several potential confounders. Participants with mid-pregnancy insomnia had significantly higher levels of perinatal anxiety and postpartum OCD symptoms than participants with normal mid-pregnancy sleep. OCD symptoms affected more women after delivery than before (6.4% vs. 3.8% p = 0.034). Limitations: Immigrants were underrepresented in our sample. Conclusion: Our results suggest that mid-pregnancy insomnia is a marker for concurrent anxiety and predictor of postpartum anxiety. Future research should examine whether insomnia treatment starting in mid-pregnancy reduces both perinatal insomnia and anxiety. Health providers should also be aware that postpartum women have an increased risk of developing OCD symptoms.

160,Worry as a mediator between psychosocial stressors and emotional sequelae: Moderation by contrast avoidance,"Background: Worry is the core feature of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is prevalent among emerging adults. The contrast avoidance model proposes that individuals with GAD use worry to avoid negative emotional contrasts by maintaining a state of negative affect. Research suggests worry in response to stressors increases anxiety, but more research is needed to examine depression as an outcome and the predictions of contrast avoidance in the context of multiple stressor subtypes. The current study examined whether worry may be associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, regardless of stressors, due to the use of worry as an avoidance strategy, moderating these associations. Methods: 367 undergraduate college students from a medium-sized, public university completed self-report questionnaires online. Results: Worry significantly mediated the associations from academic stressors and social stressors to symptoms of anxiety and depression. Contrast avoidance significantly moderated associations between academic stressors and worry as well as worry and anxiety. For those high in contrast avoidance, worry was relatively high regardless of academic stressors; for those low in contrast avoidance, students with fewer academic stressors reported less worry. Limitations: The present study relied on self-report. In addition, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw conclusions about temporal relations. Conclusions: Contrast avoidance elevated worry regardless of academic stressors, and strengthened the association between worry and anxiety but not worry and depression. Individuals who experience high levels of contrast avoidance may benefit from cognitive interventions focusing on reducing beliefs about the perceived benefits of worry.

161,"Severity profiles of posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in treatment seeking traumatized refugees","Background: Western countries are facing many challenges hosting refugees from several regions in the world. Many of them are severely traumatized and suffer from a variety of mental health symptoms, which complicates the identification and treatment of refugees at risk. This study examined subgroups based on a broad range of psychopathology, and several predictors, including trauma characteristics and gender. Methods: Participants were 1147 treatment-seeking, traumatized refugees. Latent profile analysis was conducted to identify different subgroups based on levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of subgroup membership. Results: Three distinct subgroups were identified, reflecting Moderate (10.2%), Severe (43.0%), and Highly Severe (45.9%) symptom severity levels, respectively. Symptom severity of all psychopathology dimensions was distributed equally between the subgroups. Participants in the Severe and Highly Severe Symptoms subgroups reported more types of traumatic events compared to the Moderate subgroup. In particular, traumatic events associated with human right abuses, lack of human needs and separation from others predicted subgroup membership, as did gender. Limitations: The results are confined to treatment-seeking, traumatized refugee populations. Conclusions: Distinguishable symptom severity profiles of PTSD, depression, anxiety and somatic complaints could be identified in this large treatment-seeking refugee population, without qualitative differences in symptom distribution. Instead of focusing on specific mental disorders, classification based on overall symptom severity is of interest in severely traumatized patients. This knowledge will help to identify individuals at risk and to enhance existing treatment programs for specific patient groups.

162,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and suicidality in children: The mediating role of depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms","Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with increased suicidality risk. Yet, potential mechanisms transmitting the effect of ADHD to suicidality remain unclear. We investigated whether depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms mediate between ADHD symptoms and suicidality. Methods: ADHD, depression, irritability and anxiety symptoms as well as suicidality (composited of suicidal ideation, attempts or self-harm) were measured in an outpatient clinic for ADHD ( N = 1,516, 6–17 years old, 61.1% diagnosed with ADHD) using parent and teacher questionnaires. Multiple mediator models adjusted for age, sex and psychosocial adversities were constructed separately for parent- and teacher-report. Results: Parents reported higher rates of suicidality than did teachers (12.1% and 3.8%, p &lt; .001). Suicidality was associated with parent (OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 1.07–1.14) and teacher (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.03–1.15) reported ADHD symptoms. The association between ADHD symptoms and suicidality was mediated by both parent- and teacher-reported depression (39.1% and 45.3% of total effect, respectively) and irritability symptoms (36.8% and 38.4% of total effect, respectively). Anxiety symptoms mediated between ADHD and suicidality for parent- but not teacher-report (19.0% of total effect). No direct effect of ADHD symptoms was found once depression, irritability and anxiety were controlled. Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits the ability to determine causal order between mediators and outcome. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the association between ADHD symptoms and suicidality. However, this association was indirect and fully mediated by symptoms of depression, irritability and anxiety. Assessing these symptoms may enable an estimate of suicidality and help managing suicidal risk in ADHD.

163,"Achieving complete mental health despite a history of generalized anxiety disorders: Findings from a large, nationally representative Canadian survey","Ideally, the clinical goal for individuals with a history of anxiety disorder is not only to remit from the disorder, but also to reach optimal well-being. This broader concept of recovery aligns with Keyes' concept of complete mental health (CMH), including presence of happiness or life satisfaction, and social and psychological well-being, and absence of any past year mental illness including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance dependence and suicidal ideation. This study's aim was to identify factors associated with CMH in a population-based sample of Canadians with a previous diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) ( n = =2128), of whom 40% are currently in CMH. Data were from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (response rate=68.9%). The World Health Organization version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHOCIDI) scales were used to define lifetime and past-year GAD. Factors associated with complete mental health include female gender, older age, being married, reporting good to excellent physical health, being free of chronic insomnia, being able to manage household activities without difficulties, using religion or spirituality to cope, having a confidant, and never having had a major depressive disorder nor substance dependence. Results of this study suggest many with a history of anxiety disorders can achieve CMH and point to factors that appear to facilitate this process.

164,"The association of physical activity and sleep duration with incident anxiety symptoms: A cohort study of 134,957 Korean adults","Background: Maintaining adequate levels of sleep and physical activity (PA) as self-help for the prevention of new-onset anxiety symptoms is becoming more important. Methods: A cohort study was performed with 134,957 adults, free of anxiety symptoms at baseline who underwent at least two comprehensive health screening examinations between 2012 and 2017. At baseline, the amount of PA was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form and sleep duration per day was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. The study's end point was new-onset anxiety symptoms, defined as a Beck Anxiety Inventory score of ≥19. Results: During 361,969 person-years of follow-up, 5086 participants developed case-level anxiety. Compared with a reference (0–600 METs-min/wk), a U-shaped relationship was observed between PA and case-level anxiety. The most beneficial levels of PA for reducing incident anxiety symptoms were higher in men than women (men: 1800–3000 METs-min/wk HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–0.81], 3000–6000 METs-min/wk HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70–0.93]; women: 600–1,200 METs-min/wk HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76–0.98]). In comparison with a reference (&lt;6 h), the relationship between sleep duration and case-level anxiety also had a U-shaped pattern. The optimal sleep duration for decreasing the onset of case-level anxiety was 7–8 h, regardless of sex (men: HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63–0.90]; women; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.54–0.70]). Limitations: PA, sleep duration, and anxiety symptoms were measured using self-report questionnaires. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed the appropriate levels of PA and total sleep time for reducing incident anxiety symptoms.

165,Sensitivity to change and minimal clinically important difference of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7),"Background: Effective treatment requires regular follow-up and monitoring of symptoms. We investigated sensitivity to change and minimal clinically important difference of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Methods: This study included all participants from a multisite trial of chronic depression. Baseline and follow-up (12 and 48 weeks) data were used to assess treatment response. Effect sizes (ES) and standardized response means (SRM) of pre- and post-GAD-7 mean changes were calculated for subgroups of patients, who did or did not improve according to ratings in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24). Results: N = 261 patients were included in the analyses. In the subgroup of patients who improved according to HRSD-24, GAD-7 scores were significantly lower after 12 weeks ( t = −6.31, df = 120, p &lt; .001; ES = −0.51, SRM = −0.57), and 48 weeks of treatment ( t = −12.68, df = 141, p &lt; .001; ES = −1.0, SRM = −1.7), when compared to admission. In the group who worsened, GAD-7 scores were significantly higher after 12 weeks ( t = 2.96, df = 41, p = .005; ES = 0.30, SRM = 0.46), and increased after 48 weeks ( t = 1.99, df = 21, p = .059; ES = 0.37, SRM = 0.43), when compared to baseline. The unchanged group showed no significant difference between baseline and follow-up. MCID was estimated 4 points on the GAD-7 total score. Limitations: Confirmation of these findings and further investigation of the GAD-7 in populations and trials focusing on anxiety-specific treatment is highly recommended. Conclusions: Results show that the GAD-7 is sensitive to detect change in psychopathology over the course of treatment.

166,Depression and trait-anxiety mediate the influence of clinical pain on health-related quality of life in fibromyalgia,"Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition associated with a substantial decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study investigated the relationships of HRQoL with clinical parameters of FMS (pain, insomnia and fatigue) and affective variables (depression and anxiety). Methods: Women with FMS (n = 145) and healthy women (n = 94) completed the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to evaluate HRQoL, and self-report questionnaires pertaining to clinical pain, symptoms of anxiety and depression, fatigue and insomnia. Patterns of associations were assessed by correlation, multiple linear regression, and mediation analyses. Results: FMS patients showed lower scores on all SF-36 scales than healthy individuals. Clinical and emotional factors were inversely associated with SF-36 scores. Although depression was the strongest predictor of global HRQoL (explaining 36% of its variance), clinical pain and fatigue were the main predictors of physical components of HRQoL; depression and trait-anxiety were the main predictors of mental HRQoL components. Results of mediation analysis showed that depression, trait-anxiety and fatigue mediated the effect of clinical pain on HRQoL. Additionally, depression, trait-anxiety and fatigue mutually influenced each other, increasing their negative effects on the different areas of HRQoL. Limitations: Among all emotional factors, only anxiety and depression were considered. Conclusions: Our results suggest that FMS pain and related functional disability may increase depression and anxiety, in turn aggravating the primary symptoms of FMS and indirectly increasing the negative influence of pain on HRQoL. These results showed the need to evaluate and treat negative affective states in FMS.

167,Fear of positive evaluation and social anxiety: A systematic review of trait-based findings,"Background: Although fear of negative evaluation (FNE) has long been recognized as a core cognitive bias in social anxiety, fear of positive evaluation (FPE) has received considerable attention over the past several years. The literature would benefit from a synthesis of the current state of the research in order to contribute to our understanding of FPE. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to address several questions: (a) Is self-reported FPE distinct from self-reported FNE? (b) Is self-reported FPE related to social anxiety symptomatology? and (c) Is self-reported FPE uniquely related to social anxiety symptomatology when accounting for self-reported FNE? Inclusion criteria included studies published in English, testing FPE and FNE with trait-based measures, and testing social anxiety with either self-report or diagnostic interviews. Results: There were 33 studies identified in this review that provided convincing empirical support for each of these questions across community and clinical samples of adolescents, undergraduates, and adults. Limitations: The systematic review did not have access to null results, present meta-analytic results, or include studies that evaluated FPE or social anxiety with experimental designs. Conclusions: The findings from the systematic review support updated theoritical models of social anxiety and highlight the importance of assessing and treating FPE in clinical interventions.

168,How might childhood adversity predict adult psychological distress? Applying the Identity Disruption Model to understanding depression and anxiety disorders,"Background: Experiencing adversity in childhood is associated with increased risk of a range of psychopathologies, including depression and anxiety disorders. However, there is limited understanding of psychological mechanisms that may help to explain these relationships. The Identity Disruption Model proposes that early adversity can disrupt typical identity development, which may then increase one's vulnerability to psychopathology. The present study aims to apply the Identity Disruption Model to understanding symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety. Methods: A non-clinical sample of adults from the United States ( n = 382) completed an online survey assessing early adversity, self-concept clarity, intolerance of uncertainty, and depression, generalized anxiety, OCD, and social anxiety symptoms. Structural equation models: (1) tested whether early adversity predicts psychopathology via a disrupted sense of self, and (2) explored the role of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between early adversity and psychopathology. Results: Early adversity predicted more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety via lower self-concept clarity. Furthermore, a parallel mediation model showed that self-concept clarity and intolerance of uncertainty simultaneously mediated the relationship between early adversity and psychopathology. Limitations: The data are cross-sectional in nature and longitudinal research is needed to more conclusively test the causal pathways. Conclusions: Disrupted identity may be one mechanism through which childhood adversity predicts depression and anxiety disorder symptoms later in life. The Identity Disruption Model provides new avenues for future research and suggests potential points of early intervention for the prevention of depression and anxiety disorders.

169,Assessing treatment efficacy by examining relationships between age groups of children with autism spectrum disorder and clinical anxiety symptoms: Prediction by correspondence analysis,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental in nature and are frequently accompanied by anxiety. To fully assess treatment efficacy, we examined rates of anxiety symptom change by age groups following either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: One hundred sixty-three children with ASD and ASD-related anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to either CBT or TAU. Utilizing prediction by correspondence analysis (CA), we evaluated the age effect (defined in three groups; ages 6–9, 10–12, and 13–16) and the changes in correlations between age and anxiety severity levels over the course of treatment. Results: Significantly greater anxiety symptom reduction was associated with CBT compared with TAU across the three age groups. Of particular note, the children ages 10–12 who received CBT showed the greatest improvement compared to all other groups. Late childhood, prior to adolescence, showed the best response to CBT for anxiety in ASD. Discussion: These findings suggest that treatment programs need to more closely address developmental factors within narrower bands of age groups. The present results are limited in their generalization to the CBT efficacy for a specific age band (ages 10–12). Longitudinal investigations are recommended to confirm whether the similar age group children who receive CBT experience the greatest benefit in reducing their ASD-related anxiety symptoms.

170,Vagus nerve stimulation produces immediate dose-dependent anxiolytic effect in rats,"Background: Chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) attenuates anxiety in rats and humans. However, it is unclear whether VNS can promote acute anxiolytic effects. Here we examined short-term anxiolytic effects of VNS using single or multiple trains in rats submitted to a battery of tests. Methods: Three groups of rats were implanted with VNS cuffs and tested for anxiety using the elevated plus maze (EPM), novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), and acoustic startle response (ASR), after receiving either one or five VNS trains (0.4 mA/30 Hz/30‑sec), or sham stimulation. Results: Both single and multiple VNS trains reduced state anxiety as measured using the EPM, but only multiple trains reduced anxiety in the EPM and NSF. VNS did not decrease arousal as measured using the ASR. Limitations: The anxiolytic effects of VNS may be differently influenced by test order or prior-exposure to stress. VNS did not affect startle responses in naïve rats but the present findings do not determine whether VNS would affect startle responses that are potentiated by fear or anxiety. Conclusion: A single VNS train can produce an anxiolytic-like effect in the EPM minutes later, an effect that is not observed in the NSF. Delivering 5 VNS trains restores the immediate effects across tests of anxiety, indicating that more trains produce a more robust anxiolytic effect. The lack of effects on ASR suggests that VNS affects state anxiety but not baseline arousal in naïve rats. We suggest that the anxiolytic effect of VNS can increase tolerability and reduce dropout in exposure-based therapies.

171,The relation of gender role attitudes with depression and generalised anxiety disorder in two russian cities,"Background: Reported traditional gender role attitudes (GRAs) have been related to worse mental health in western countries. This study examined the link of GRAs with symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in two Russian cities. Methods: We used interview data from the cross-sectional Know Your Heart Study conducted among 5099 adults aged 35-69 in the Russian cities of Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk between 2015 and 2017. Attitudes about gender inequality and division of labour between women and men at home or in the public sphere were measured by single items. Binary variables indicating presence of symptoms of depression and GAD were defined by a cut-off of ≥ 5 of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine crude and adjusted associations. Results: There was evidence that all types of GRAs were associated with symptoms of depression and GAD consistent with a U-shape after controlling for confounding with stronger evidence for all relationships for depression than for GAD. Odds of depressive symptoms were elevated among participants strongly agreeing to gender inequality and gender division of labour. There was good evidence for effect measure modification by age. Limitations: The possibilities of measurement error of the exposure and outcomes, residual confounding and reverse causality are important limitations of this study. Conclusions: Agreeing to gender inequality and gender division of labour was associated with reporting symptoms of common mental disorders in Russia. This study adds evidence for a link of GRAs with mental health from a non-western context.

172,Mental health outcomes among Chinese prenatal and postpartum women after the implementation of universal two-child policy,"Background: Poor mental health status among both pregnant and postpartum women is commonly reported worldwide. The associations between mental health outcomes and giving birth to the second child since the implementation of China's universal two-child policy have not been identified. Methods: A large-scale based mental health survey was conducted between March 2017 and December 2018 in Suzhou, China. The survey evaluated the symptoms of anxiety, hypomania, depression and poor sleep quality among both pregnant and postpartum women. Results: A total of 3113 questionnaires were collected, the prevalence of anxiety, hypomanic and depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality in our sample were 3.2% (95%CI: 2.6%–3.9%), 51.7% (95%CI: 49.9%–53.4%), 12.4% (95%CI: 11.3%–13.6%) and 37.8% (95%CI: 36.0%–39.5%), respectively. Logistic regression showed that giving birth to the second child was positively associated with women's age, and was negatively correlated with higher educational level and living in rented housing. Women with the second pregnancy or child were positively associated with anxiety symptoms in the whole sample (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.11–2.75) and among prenatal women (OR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.16–3.83), while it was inversely correlated with depressive symptoms among postpartum women (OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.41–0.99). Conclusions: Women giving birth a second time were more prone to have anxiety symptoms among the prenatal women and the whole sample, and less likely to have depressive symptoms among the postpartum women. Efficacious measures and interventions are essential to improve maternal mental health.

173,Sex and age differences in the association between anxiety disorders and narcolepsy: A nationwide population-based case control study,"Background: To examine the association between narcolepsy and anxiety disorders. Methods: This population-based, retrospective case-control study analyzed Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2013. We included narcoleptic patients aged at least 12 years, diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 347. The cases and the propensity score-matched controls were selected in a 1:4 ratio. Each subject with anxiety disorders (ICD-9-CM code 300) was required to visit the outpatient clinic at least three times within a year. Multivariate logistic regression and interaction analyses were used to calculate the association between anxiety disorders and narcolepsy. Results: This study enrolled 478 and 1912 subjects with and without narcolepsy, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety disorders had an approximately 2.7 odds ratio of developing narcolepsy when compared to the control subjects (adjusted odds ratio [aOR)] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.699–4.344). Interaction analysis and subgroup analysis showed a higher incidence of previously diagnosed anxiety disorders in narcoleptic patients aged 12 to 17 years and female patients (aOR = 25.9; 95% CI = 15.194–42.896; aOR = 3.6; 95% CI = 1.818–7.062, respectively). Limitations: The narcolepsy and anxiety disorders were not distinguished by validated structural diagnostic instruments. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed higher comorbidity rates of anxiety disorders in narcoleptic patients. The incidence of previously diagnosed anxiety disorders was higher in narcoleptic patients aged 12 to 17 years and female patients.

174,"Influencing factors and correlation of anxiety, psychological stress sources, and psychological capital among women pregnant with a second child in guangdong and shandong province","Background: After the one-child policy has been effective for over 30 years, China implemented the universal two-child policy in 2015. The number of high-risk pregnant women had increased dramatically ever since, increasing negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Our study aims to investigate the status of anxiety, psychological stress sources, and psychological capital among women pregnant with a second child, and to assess influencing factors and correlations, providing scientific basis for promoting women's health during pregnancy. Methods: We recruited 513 participants from maternity hospitals in Guangdong and Shandong Province. All participants completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Pregnant women psychological stress sources questionnaire and the psychological capital questionnaire (PCQ-24). Results: The prevalence of anxiety of women pregnant with a second child was 27.5%. The score of psychological stress sources was 74.93 ± 16.07. The risk factors for the anxiety of the women pregnant with a second child included low education level of the husband, gender expectation and the sources of psychological stress of the pregnant woman. The risk factors for psychological stress were dissatisfaction of residence and unplanned pregnancy. The main factors influencing psychological capital were the participants’ education level, whether they have learned antenatal care knowledge and satisfaction with the residence. Limitations: All participants were recruited only from tertiary hospitals in Guangdong and Shandong province. Conclusions: Anxiety and psychological stress is prevalent during pregnancy among women pregnant with a second child in Guangdong and Shandong. Psychological capital was a protective factor for anxiety.

175,Effects of a transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy-based programme on the natural course of anxiety symptoms in adolescence,"Background: Anxiety disorders frequently have an onset during adolescence, which when left untreated could lead to a chronic course and outcome. This study aimed to examine the way in which a cognitive behaviour therapy-based programme (Super Skills for Life—adolescent version; SSL-A) could change the course of anxiety symptoms through adolescent's behavioural performance and cardiac function. Method: Sixty-one adolescents at risk of developing an anxiety disorder (45.30% boys; M = 13.76 years, SD = 0.32) were randomly assigned to either an intervention (IG), placebo (PG), or a waitlist group (WG). Adolescents in the IG participated in SSL-A over an 8-week period. Adolescents in the PG participated in an 8-session school-work programme. Adolescents in the WG did not receive any intervention. Anxiety symptoms were assessed every six months, twice before the intervention, as well as at the post-intervention and six months after the intervention. Participants in the IG additionally underwent a stressful task to assess behavioural performance and cardiac adjustment. Results: Adolescents in the IG significantly reported lower levels of social phobia and generalised anxiety symptoms at the follow-up assessment compared to the adolescents in the PG and the WG. They also showed a significant improvement in vocal quality and lower discomfort during a stressful task at post-intervention, and showed attenuated cardiac recovery indexes, in terms of sample entropy. Limitations: The study has a small sample size. Conclusion: SSL-A changed the natural course of anxiety symptoms, as shown by a significant reduction in social phobia and generalised anxiety symptoms, and a significant improvement in behaviour and physiological (cardiac) function during a stressful situation.

176,"A systematic review of treatments targeting cognitive biases in socially anxious adolescents: Special section on “translational and neuroscience studies in affective disorders” section editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD","Background: Adolescence is a period of brain plasticity that is affected by social and affective stimuli. Adaptive neurodevelopmental changes in the context of complex social situations may precipitate or exacerbate cognitive biases (i.e., attention and/or interpretation biases) and predispose at-risk individuals to symptoms of social anxiety. Methods: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Nine adolescent studies were examined including 3 studies using Cognitive Bias Modification Training (CBMT) to target attention biases (CBMT-A), 3 studies using CBMT to target interpretation biases (CBMT-I), and 3 aimed at reducing both attention and interpretation biases. Results: The studies of CBMT-A alone did not find significant effects on cognitive and clinical outcomes. However, studies of CBMT-I alone showed some improvement in interpretation bias. The combination of CBMT-A and CBMT-I appeared promising in reducing both attentionl and interpretation biases. Limitations: The paucity of studies and the heterogeneity across studies (e.g., format of CBMT, assessment measures) limit the calculation of overall effect sizes and the examination of predictors, moderators, and mediators of outcome. Conclusions: Technology-driven interventions such as CBMT have the potential to extend treatments outside the clinic setting and to augment current therapies for social anxiety. Further research is needed to develop CBMT procedures that optimize learning in group and real-world settings and to identify predictors of treatment response. Understanding the neural correlates of response to CBMT may help identify future targets for intervention.

177,The role of serum oxytocin levels in the second trimester in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression: A sample from Shanghai maternal-child Pairs cohort study,"Background: Recent research suggested that oxytocin might be associated with prenatal anxiety or depression. Also, our previous study indicated that resilience could buffer the effect of stress on prenatal anxiety and depression, which is a kind of psychological adjustment ability to stress in life. The effects of oxytocin and resilience are supposed to be similar but no study was carried out to find the association between them. Current evidence on the effect of oxytocin on prenatal mental health were with small sample size and equivocal results, especially with a lack of studies in Chinese pregnant women. Aims: To investigate the relationship between oxytocin and resilience, and its role in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression among Chinese women. Methods: The study was based on a sub-sample of the Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) by stratified random sampling. A total of 632 participants completed blood collection for serum oxytocin measurement and questionnaires pertaining to early pregnancy stress and resilience in the second trimester, which were assessed by the Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) and the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), respectively. Prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively, at the third trimester. Correlation analysis and stratified linear regression analyses were conducted to understand the role of oxytocin in regulating prenatal anxiety and depression. Results: The concentration of serum oxytocin in the second trimester ranged from 98.14 pg⋅ml −1 to 197.28 pg⋅ml −1 , and there was no significant difference between different gestational age ( r = 0.024, P = 0.579). The association between stress and prenatal anxiety was stronger in high oxytocin group than that in low oxytocin group, with B value of 3.338 and 2.638, respectively, after adjusting for residence, educational level, family income and parity. The same effect was found in the association between stress and prenatal depression, with B value of 2.360 and 2.060, respectively. However, it was not significantly associated with early pregnancy stress ( Z = 1.933, P = 0.630), prenatal anxiety ( Z = 1.387, P = 0.165), prenatal depression ( Z = −0.027, P = 0.978), nor resilience ( F = 1.282, P = 0.280). Limitations: The existence of recall bias and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the extrapolation of the study. Also, unsynchronized sampling timing of the oxytocin and psychological resilience measures is another limitation. Conclusions: Serum oxytocin levels in the second trimester had an effect of modification between early pregnancy stress and prenatal anxiety and depression. Pregnant women with high oxytocin in the second trimester should receive more attention and further study is needed on the mechanism of oxytocin for the mental health of pregnant women.

178,The gut microbiota is associated with psychiatric symptom severity and treatment outcome among individuals with serious mental illness,"Background: Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiota in central nervous system functioning via its effects on inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and/or neurotransmission. Our understanding of the cellular underpinnings of the brain-gut relationship is based almost exclusively on animal models with some small-scale human studies. This study examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and psychiatric symptom severity and treatment response among inpatients with serious mental illness. Method: We collected data from adult inpatients ( N = 111). Measures of diagnoses, suicide severity, trauma, depression, and anxiety were collected shortly after admission, while self-collected fecal swabs were collected early in the course of hospitalization and processed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole genome shotgun sequencing methods. Results: Results indicate that depression and anxiety severity shortly after admission were negatively associated with bacterial richness and alpha diversity. Additional analyses revealed a number of bacterial taxa associated with depression and anxiety severity. Gut microbiota richness and alpha diversity early in the course of hospitalization was a significant predictor of depression remission at discharge. Conclusions: This study is among the first to demonstrate a gut microbiota relationship with symptom severity among psychiatric inpatients as well as a relationship to remission of depression post-treatment. These findings are consistent with animal models and limited human studies as well as with the broader literature implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression. These findings offer the foundation for further studies of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment, prevention of, or recurrence of serious mental illness.

179,Prenatal symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with sex differences in both maternal perceptions of one year old infant temperament and researcher observed infant characteristics,"Background: Sex differences in the behaviour of children exposed to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety have been reported. This study compared depression and anxiety symptoms reported by mothers at term with maternal perceptions of one year old male and female infant temperament and with researcher observed infant characteristics, identifying differences for males and females with both approaches. Methods: Infant behaviour and temperament was assessed via maternally completed questionnaires including Infant Behavioural Questionnaire Revised—Short form and by researcher administered subcomponents of Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery and Bayley Scales of Infant Development III. Results: For female infants, higher prenatal scores for depression and anxiety were associated with maternal perceptions of lower bonding, higher aggression and negativity, and lower soothability ( n = 67 mother-infant dyads). In the laboratory assessment, intensity of escape was the only female infant factor significantly associated with maternal mood ( n = 41). For male infants, there was minimal association between prenatal mood scores and maternal perceptions ( n = 46) whereas in the laboratory assessment ( n = 35) depression scores were associated with expressive language, facial interest and facial fear while anxiety scores were associated with expressive and receptive language, parent behaviour and facial fear. Limitations: Findings may be restricted to a single ethnicity or mode of delivery. Fewer infants attended the infant assessment. A laboratory setting may mask symptomatology in females. Conclusions: Atypical maternal perceptions may present a barrier to the early identification of male infants impacted by maternal depression and anxiety.

180,Treating depressive disorders with the unified protocol: A preliminary randomized evaluation,"Objectives: This study aims to examine the efficacy of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) for individuals diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Method: Participants included 44 adults who met criteria for major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or another specified depressive disorder according to the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS). These individuals represent a subset of patients from a larger clinical trial comparing the UP to single-disorder protocols (SDPs) for discrete anxiety disorders and a waitlist control (WLC) condition (Barlow et al., 2017); inclusion criteria for the parent study required participants to have a principal anxiety disorder. Results: Significant reductions in depressive symptoms were observed within the UP condition across clinician-rated and self-report measures of depression from baseline to post-treatment, as well as to the 12-month follow-up assessment. Compared to the WLC group, individuals in the UP condition demonstrated significantly lower levels on our continuous, clinician-rated measure of depressive symptoms at post-treatment. There were no differences between the UP and SDP conditions on depressive symptoms at post-treatment or at the 12-month follow-up timepoint. Conclusions: In this exploratory set of analyses, the UP evidenced efficacy for reduction of depressive symptoms, adding to the growing support for its utility in treating depression.

181,Physical activity and blood pressure during pregnancy: Mediation by anxiety symptoms,"Background: During pregnancy, physiological systems and psychological perceptions vary across individuals. Prenatal physical activity has been linked to reduced anxiety symptoms and lower blood pressure values. However, whether anxiety symptoms can mediate the relationship between physical activity and blood pressure during pregnancy remains unclear. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1275 pregnant women enrolled in Nanjing, China. Life behaviours and anxiety symptoms were investigated during the first trimester. Anxiety symptoms were measured by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Blood pressure values were taken during the third trimester. Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of physical activity with anxiety symptoms and blood pressure, and mediating effect models were used to detect the regulating effect by anxiety. Results: The participants were assigned to 3 groups based on their frequency and intensity of physical activity, and those who engaged in regular physical activity had lower blood pressure values. Anxiety symptoms were milder in the regular group than in the insufficient group. Partial mediating effect of anxiety on the association between regular physical activity and systolic blood pressure was significant after accounting for some confounders. Limitations: The participants' physical activity and anxiety symptoms were self-reported, as well as the lack of details of physical activity during pregnancy may restrict the power of our findings. Conclusions: Regular physical activity might be beneficial for anxiety and blood pressure. Physical activity likely stabilises systolic blood pressure by alleviating anxiety symptoms. Our research could provide a positive theoretical reference for guiding prenatal care.

182,The effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety in routine care,"Introduction: Randomised controlled trials have shown that internet-delivered cognitive behavioural treatment (iCBT) is an effective treatment for health anxiety, but the effectiveness of these programs in routine care has not been investigated. This study examined the effectiveness of iCBT for health anxiety symptoms in routine care settings in the community. Methods: Using an open-trial design, we investigated adherence to, and effectiveness of a 6-lesson iCBT program for health anxiety symptoms amongst individuals ( n = 391, mean age 41 years, 64% female) who enrolled in the program either self-guided ( n = 312) or under the supervision of community clinicians (general practitioners, psychologists and other allied health professionals) ( n = 79). Primary outcome was health anxiety severity on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), and secondary outcomes were depression severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) (depression) and distress (Kessler-10: K-10). Results: Adherence to the iCBT program was modest (45.6% in the clinician-supervised group, 33.0% in the unguided group), but within-subjects effect sizes were large (SHAI: g = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.45–1.88; PHQ-9: g = 1.12, 95%CI: 0.92–1.32; K-10: g = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15–1.56). Limitations: No control group, lack of follow-up data. Conclusions: iCBT is an effective treatment for health anxiety symptoms in routine care, but methods to increase adherence are needed to optimise benefits to participants. Randomised controlled effectiveness trials with long-term follow-up are needed.

183,Panic attack provocation in panic disorder patients with a computer simulation,"Background: Computer simulations (CS) and virtual reality exposure are promising techniques for research and treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). The objective of this study was to ascertain whether a given CS was a stimulus capable of producing panic attacks (PAs), anxiety and psychophysiological changes in patients with PDA. Methods: Thirty PDA patients and 30 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Subjects were exposed to a 3-min CS of a situation relevant to agoraphobic patients. Anxiety, panic symptoms, PAs, heart rate, skin conductance and respiration were recorded before, during and after the CS exposure. Results: The CS effectively induced anxiety, hyperventilation and electrodermal responses in PDA patients but not in healthy subjects. Forty percent of PDA patients had a PA while none of the control subjects had a PA. A subgroup of patients who were less sensitive to the CS than the other subgroup of PDA patients and did not present full-blown PAs still had more panic symptoms, higher anxiety levels and more respiratory irregularities than the controls. Limitations: Low immersion and low sense of presence, lack of interaction with the environment. Conclusions: Exposure to the CS produced effects similar to in vivo exposure, respiratory and caffeine challenges. Subsequent studies should: make direct comparisons between CS and other challenges for PDA; investigate if CS can be a tool for predicting effects of medication; determine the potential of CS as a desensitization technique for situational PAs.

184,Prevalence and clinical correlates of psychotic depression in first-episode and drug-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Few systemic studies of psychotic depression (PD) have been conducted in first-episode and drug-naïve (FEDN) patients. This study was to examine the prevalence of PD and its clinical correlates in a large sample of FEDN outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a Chinese Han population, which to our best knowledge has not been studied. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1718 FEDN MDD outpatients were recruited. All patients were rated on the positive symptom subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychotic symptoms, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) for depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) for anxiety. Results: The prevalence of PD was 10.0% (171/1718) in MDD patients. Compared to the non-PD patients, PD patients had significantly older age, lower educational levels, higher anxiety symptom score and were more likely to attempt suicide. Further logistic regression analysis indicated that PD was associated with older age, suicide attempt and comorbid anxiety (all p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed that both HAMD and HAMA total scores were significantly associated with PANSS positive symptom subscale score. Limitations: Our cross-sectional study design does not show a direct causal relationship between psychiatric symptoms and related factors in patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our results suggest a high prevalence of PD in MDD patients in the acute early stage in a Chinese Han population, which is associated with demographic variables and clinical symptoms.

185,Prevalence and clinical correlates of subclinical hypothyroidism in first-episode drug-naive patients with major depressive disorder in a large sample of Chinese,"Background: The coexistence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and depression has been intensively examined in the patients receiving thyroxine or antidepressant treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of severe SCH in Chinese first-episode drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited a total of 1706 MDD patients. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Severity of anxiety and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively. Serum thyroid function parameters were measured by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Based on the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, SCH was further divided into mild (TSH &lt; 10 mIU/L) and severe SCH (TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L). Results: More patients with severe SCH had severe anxiety, psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts (all p &lt; 0.001), compared with those without severe SCH. Logistic regression showed that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms were associated with severe SCH (both p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that age ( p &lt; 0.05), BMI ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMD score ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMA score ( p &lt; 0.001), PANSS positive subscore ( p = 0.001) and CGI score ( p = 0.001) were associated with TSH levels. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms may be associated with severe SCH. Moreover, severe anxiety, depressive and psychotic symptoms, as well as older age and higher BMI are possibly related to elevated TSH levels.

186,Comorbidity in post-traumatic stress disorder: A population-based study from the two largest cities in Brazil,"Background: This study investigated the patterns of comorbidity between PTSD and depression, other anxiety disorders, alcohol-related disorders using the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. The temporal sequence of the comorbid diagnoses was also investigated. Methods: We used data from a large population-based survey carried out between 2007 and 2008 in the two largest cities in Brazil: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Results: Diagnoses of depression, other anxiety disorders, and alcohol-related disorder were more prevalent in the people with PTSD than in those without PTSD. Using the DSM-IV criteria, approximately 67% of cases presenting PTSD were also diagnosed with another mental disorder. The diagnosis category of other anxiety disorders presented the highest proportion of comorbidity (53%). Depression was found in 34% person with PTSD whilst alcohol-related disorders were observed in 7%. Considering the temporal relationship, the onset of comorbid depression was uniformly distributed through the periods before, within the same year and after PTSD's onset. When other anxiety disorders were comorbid with PTSD, in almost 90% of the cases the other anxiety disorders preceded PTSD. For comorbidity between of alcohol-related disorders and PTSD, in 50% of the cases alcohol-related disorders preceded the diagnosis of PTSD. Limitations: The cross-sectional design imposes limitations on establishing a temporal relationship between the onset of psychiatric disorders due to memory bias. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that among individuals presenting comorbid PTSD and other anxiety disorders, this diagnosis tend to precede PTSD. Comorbid cases are more frequent and more severe, and this should be taken into account in therapeutic research and clinical practice.

Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed at baseline with the CIDI-V. Psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession–compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) were measured with the BSI three times during pregnancy and three times after delivery. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed that women with versus without lifetime anxiety (β = 0.22 to β = 0.32) and depressive (β = 0.24 to β = 0.34) disorders prior to pregnancy experienced higher peripartum psychopathological symptoms. All symptoms linearly decreased during pregnancy (β = -0.02 to β = -0.07 per month). Somatization (β = -0.46) was lower, whereas paranoid ideation (β = 0.26) and obsession-compulsion (β = 0.21) were higher after delivery than during pregnancy. Though, obsession-compulsion linearly decreased after delivery (β = - 0.02). Lifetime anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy interacted with linear changes in anxiety (β = -0.04) and phobic anxiety (β = -0.05) during pregnancy. That is, only women with, but not without anxiety disorders prior to pregnancy experienced a linear decline in anxiety and phobic anxiety during pregnancy. Limitations: Lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders were assessed in early pregnancy and might be biased. Conclusions: Peripartum psychopathological symptoms are higher in women with versus without lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy, but symptom changes only slightly vary by lifetime diagnostic status.

188,"Social anxiety disorder among children and adolescents: A nationwide survey of prevalence, socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and comorbidities","Background: Social anxiety disorder is a frequent psychiatric disorder. We aimed to estimate the life-time prevalence, socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and co-morbidities of this condition among children and adolescents. Methods: This was a cross sectional national survey conducted in Iranian individuals aged 6 to 18 years. Face-to-face household interviews were performed by trained clinical psychologists. The Farsi version of the kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children/present and lifetime version (K-SADSPL) was administered to estimate the SAD prevalence. Parental personality traits and their psychopathologies were also obtained using Millon clinical multiaxial inventory, third edition (MCMI-III) to find the possible risk factors. Results: From 29,878 participants, 585 individuals were diagnosed with SAD and weighted lifetime prevalence of 1.8% was observed. The odds of this condition was significantly higher among older adolescents (odds ratio (OR):1.47; 95% confidence interval(CI): 1.11-1.95) and individuals with paternal history of psychiatric hospitalization (OR: 2.96; 95%CI: 1.29-6.79). Higher means of persistent depression disorder (OR: 1.009; 95%CI: 1.000-1.018) and melancholic personality trait (OR: 1.007; 95%CI: 1.001-1.014) in mothers as well as schizophrenia spectrum (OR: 1.014; 95%CI: 1.001-1.027) and anxiety (OR: 1.010; 95%CI: 1.010-1.021) in fathers were statistically associated with higher odds of SAD in their children. Other anxiety disorders and behavioral disorders were the most prevalent co-morbidities. Limitations: The cross-sectional analysis does not enable analyses of possible causal associations. Lacking control group and follow-up periods were other major limitations that should be resolved in future studies. Conclusion: Clinicians and researchers need to continue studying this condition at all levels and in all developmental periods.

189,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in group format for anxiety and depression. A systematic review,"Background: : Emotional disorders, such as anxiety and depression, are one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Recent reviews suggest that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is effective in treating emotional disorders. However, they appraise mainly individual approaches. This review aimed to analyze published studies regarding the usefulness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, applied on a group basis, in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Web of Science, from 2008 to 2019. Fifteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results: Those patients who received interventions based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy showed a better emotional state and greater psychological flexibility than patients in control groups without treatment. No differences are found with Cognitive Therapy and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. Limitations: : the studies reviewed show limitations, principally regarding sample characteristics, study design and manner in which mechanisms responsible for changes are evaluated. Conclusion: Group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy proved to be useful in the psychological treatment of emotional disorders. However, the heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, make it impossible to determine the exact therapeutic elements, and if they are specific to the approach and procedure of this therapy. More research would be necessary to ascertain what patient and/or intervention characteristics might improve results and what the active and specific ingredients of the therapy are. This has clinical relevance because group-based interventions could be more cost-efficient, and it would help facilitate health-care decisions aimed at giving the public access to useful treatments.

190,Associations of body dissatisfaction with anxiety and depression in the pregnancy and postpartum periods: A longitudinal study,"Background: Pregnancy is a time of increasing vulnerability to the development of body dissatisfaction, anxiety, and depression. The present study aims to examine associations of body dissatisfaction with anxiety and depression at the following points: 6 months before pregnancy (retrospective report); in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy; and up to 6 weeks postpartum. Methods: A prospective longitudinal design with a quantitative approach was adopted. A consecutive sample of 1,371 Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong was assessed using standardized instruments at four time points. Results: A mixed-effects model with repeated measures revealed that body dissatisfaction and depression symptoms changed across different stages of pregnancy. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that, after adjusting for the identified risk factors, body dissatisfaction before and during pregnancy were positively associated with antenatal anxiety and depression symptoms. Concurrent body dissatisfaction was positively associated with postpartum depression symptoms. Limitations: There was a high attrition rate in the follow-up assessments. Antenatal anxiety symptoms were assessed using the scale for general anxiety, which may not adequately capture the experience of anxiety among pregnant women. Conclusions: Primary healthcare practitioners should be made aware of body dissatisfaction among pregnant women in order to facilitate early intervention for anxiety and depression, because untreated psychological disturbance during pregnancy may persist into the postpartum period.Body dissatisfaction Antenatal anxiety Antenatal depression Postpartum anxiety Postpartum depression (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
191,Self-perception of physical health conditions and its association with depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students,"Background: Self-perception of physical health conditions is associated with depression and anxiety. Although some recent studies revealed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students, no study has yet investigated the link between self-perception of physical health and these common psychological disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association of self-perception of physical health conditions with depression and anxiety among university students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August and November 2017 among 897 undergraduate students of Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between the variables. Results: 13.9% of the respondents had poor self-rated health (SRH) and 49.9% had self-rated body image (SRBI) dissatisfaction. 25.6% of the students reported to be overweight/obese whereas 18.7% to be underweight. Poor and moderate SRH was found to be significantly associated with students’ depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 6.700; 95% CI: 3.821–11.749 and AOR: 2.155; 95% CI: 1.582–2.934) and anxiety (AOR: 4.365; 95% CI: 2.599–7.332 and AOR: 1.776; 95% CI: 1.270–2.484). Furthermore, SRBI dissatisfaction, underweight SRBI, overweight/obese SRBI, low blood pressure and hypertension were also significantly linked with students’ depression and anxiety. Conclusion: Students dissatisfied with their physical health status had higher chances to suffer from depression and anxiety. The findings of this study would create room for further research and could be used to design a comprehensive health program for young students.

192,Responses to academic stress mediate the association between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents,"Objective: Sleep difficulties are pervasive in Chinese adolescents, which exert aversive influence on their emotional health. However, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. This study addressed whether stress responses mediate the concurrent and prospective relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Method: 17,946 adolescents (14–18 years-old) were administrated the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Responses to Stress Questionnaire. Further, 710 of them finished the one-year follow-up assessments. Structural equation models were conducted to determine the concurrent and prospective mediation effects of stress responses and the moderated effect of gender and age. Results: Involuntary engagement and disengagement responses, as well as engagement coping, significantly mediated the cross-sectional relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. Moreover, sleep difficulties at baseline predicted enhanced involuntary engagement responses but reduced the use of engagement coping strategies one year later, resulting in an elevated level of depressive/anxiety symptoms. Finally, females and younger adolescents with greater sleep difficulties were more likely to generate maladaptive stress responses. Limitations: First, sleep difficulties were only measured using self-reported approaches. Second, potential confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) were not adjusted for. Third, our study only focused on typically-developing youth samples rather than clinical samples. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the important role of stress responses in the relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. The findings might also shed some light on the psychological intervention of sleep difficulties and mood disorder in adolescent populations.

193,"Gender differences in depression, anxiety, and stress among college students: A longitudinal study from China","Background: The objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the gender differences in college students' depression, anxiety, and stress over the four academic years, and to explore possible anxiety-related factors among first year students. Methods: The study analyzed 1892 undergraduate students from 15 universities in China, with 898 females and 994 males. The students have been followed for four years and completed a survey containing the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 questionnaire, students’ socio-demographic information, and their educational background, etc. Results: (1) On average, both female and male college students suffered from mild anxiety in the first three years. Female students scored significantly higher in anxiety than males in the first and second years, and there was no significant gender difference in students’ average depression and stress levels. (2) A significantly larger proportion of female students experienced anxiety above the normal threshold, whereas a higher percentage of male students endured different degrees of depression; no significant gender differences were found in stress problems. (3) Anxiety had a significant positive correlation with introversion. Female freshmen's anxiety levels were also associated with their body image, drinking habits, and academic performance. Limitations: Response bias may exist considering that self-reported data was used. Due to data unavailability, we only explored the anxiety-related factors in freshman year, which cannot sufficiently reflect the consistency of correlations over time. Conclusions: Anxiety turned out to be the most prevalent and serious issue for college students, especially for female students; while a growing prevalence of depression was found among male students during college. It is of great significance to adopt collegiate policies reflecting the gender differentials.

194,Is cognitive performance associated with anxiety and depression in first-episode psychosis?,"Background: In first-episode psychosis (FEP), symptoms of anxiety and depression are common. We examined whether cognitive performance is associated with these clinical measures in FEP during a one-year follow-up. Methods: Young adults with non-affective FEP ( n = 52) were assessed two months after their first psychiatric contact for psychosis. Matched controls ( n = 62) were administered a baseline assessment. 32 FEP subjects and 44 controls were assessed again at a one-year follow-up. In both assessments, a broad neuropsychological test battery was administered. Clinical evaluation was done with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Cross-sectional correlations were calculated at both time points. Cognitive test scores were used as independent variables in regression models, predicting both baseline and follow-up symptom levels. Results: At baseline, better performance especially in verbal memory and executive functioning was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in FEP. In addition, better performance especially in verbal working memory was associated with depression. A year later, better cognitive performance was no longer associated with affective symptoms. Limitations: Small sample sizes are a limitation. Conclusions: In the FEP group, higher cognitive performance associated with affective symptoms. Right after getting severely ill, anxiety and depression may be a part of normal adaptive reactions to the situation and markers of an intact cognitive performance. This association seems to cease during the year following the FEP.

195,Strategies for engaging patients and families in collaborative care programs for depression and anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Background: Patients and families are often referred to as important partners in collaborative mental health care (CMHC). However, how to meaningfully engage them as partners remains unclear. We aimed to identify strategies for engaging patients and families in CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: We updated a Cochrane review of CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders. Searches were conducted in Cochrane CCDAN and CINAHL, complemented by additional database searches, trial registry searches, and cluster searches for ‘sibling’ articles. Coding and data extraction of engagement strategies was an iterative process guided by a conceptual framework. We used narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics to report on findings. Findings: We found 148 unique CMCH programs, described in 578 articles. Most programs (96%) featured at least one strategy for engaging patients or families. Programs adopted 15 different strategies overall, with a median of two strategies per program (range 0–9 strategies). The most common strategies were patient education (87% of programs) and self-management supports (47% of programs). Personalized care planning, shared decision making, and family or peer supports were identified in fewer than one third of programs. Limitations: Our search strategy was designed to capture programs evaluated in clinical trials and so other innovative programs not studied in trials were likely missed. Conclusion: Most CMHC programs for depression and anxiety disorders adopted a limited number of strategies to engage patients and families in their care. However, this review identifies numerous strategies that can be used to strengthen the patient- and family-centeredness of collaborative care.

196,Prevalence and clinical correlates of subclinical hypothyroidism in first-episode drug-naive patients with major depressive disorder in a large sample of Chinese,"Background: The coexistence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and depression has been intensively examined in the patients receiving thyroxine or antidepressant treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of severe SCH in Chinese first-episode drug naïve patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited a total of 1706 MDD patients. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Severity of anxiety and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively. Serum thyroid function parameters were measured by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Based on the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, SCH was further divided into mild (TSH &lt; 10 mIU/L) and severe SCH (TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L). Results: More patients with severe SCH had severe anxiety, psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts (all p &lt; 0.001), compared with those without severe SCH. Logistic regression showed that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms were associated with severe SCH (both p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that age ( p &lt; 0.05), BMI ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMD score ( p &lt; 0.001), HAMA score ( p &lt; 0.001), PANSS positive subscore ( p = 0.001) and CGI score ( p = 0.001) were associated with TSH levels. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that suicide attempts and psychiatric symptoms may be associated with severe SCH. Moreover, severe anxiety, depressive and psychotic symptoms, as well as older age and higher BMI are possibly related to elevated TSH levels.

197,Prevalence and clinical correlates of psychotic depression in first-episode and drug-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Few systemic studies of psychotic depression (PD) have been conducted in first-episode and drug-naïve (FEDN) patients. This study was to examine the prevalence of PD and its clinical correlates in a large sample of FEDN outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a Chinese Han population, which to our best knowledge has not been studied. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1718 FEDN MDD outpatients were recruited. All patients were rated on the positive symptom subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychotic symptoms, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) for depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) for anxiety. Results: The prevalence of PD was 10.0% (171/1718) in MDD patients. Compared to the non-PD patients, PD patients had significantly older age, lower educational levels, higher anxiety symptom score and were more likely to attempt suicide. Further logistic regression analysis indicated that PD was associated with older age, suicide attempt and comorbid anxiety (all p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed that both HAMD and HAMA total scores were significantly associated with PANSS positive symptom subscale score. Limitations: Our cross-sectional study design does not show a direct causal relationship between psychiatric symptoms and related factors in patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our results suggest a high prevalence of PD in MDD patients in the acute early stage in a Chinese Han population, which is associated with demographic variables and clinical symptoms.

198,Comorbidity in post-traumatic stress disorder: A population-based study from the two largest cities in Brazil,"Background: This study investigated the patterns of comorbidity between PTSD and depression, other anxiety disorders, alcohol-related disorders using the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. The temporal sequence of the comorbid diagnoses was also investigated. Methods: We used data from a large population-based survey carried out between 2007 and 2008 in the two largest cities in Brazil: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Results: Diagnoses of depression, other anxiety disorders, and alcohol-related disorder were more prevalent in the people with PTSD than in those without PTSD. Using the DSM-IV criteria, approximately 67% of cases presenting PTSD were also diagnosed with another mental disorder. The diagnosis category of other anxiety disorders presented the highest proportion of comorbidity (53%). Depression was found in 34% person with PTSD whilst alcohol-related disorders were observed in 7%. Considering the temporal relationship, the onset of comorbid depression was uniformly distributed through the periods before, within the same year and after PTSD's onset. When other anxiety disorders were comorbid with PTSD, in almost 90% of the cases the other anxiety disorders preceded PTSD. For comorbidity between of alcohol-related disorders and PTSD, in 50% of the cases alcohol-related disorders preceded the diagnosis of PTSD. Limitations: The cross-sectional design imposes limitations on establishing a temporal relationship between the onset of psychiatric disorders due to memory bias. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that among individuals presenting comorbid PTSD and other anxiety disorders, this diagnosis tend to precede PTSD. Comorbid cases are more frequent and more severe, and this should be taken into account in therapeutic research and clinical practice.

201,Relationship between maternal pregnancy-related anxiety and infant brain responses to emotional speech—A pilot study,"Background: Maternal pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) is reportedly related to neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants. However, the relationship between maternal PRA and the processing of emotions in the infant brain has not been extensively studied with neuroimaging. The objective of the present pilot study is to investigate the relationship between maternal PRA and infant hemodynamic responses to emotional speech at two months of age. Methods: The study sample included 19 mother-infant dyads from a general sample of a population of Caucasian mothers. Self-reported Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R2) data was collected from mothers during pregnancy at gestational weeks (gwks) 24 ( N = 19) and 34 ( N = 18). When their infants were two months old, the infants’ brains functional responses to emotional speech in the left fronto-temporoparietal cortex were recorded using diffuse optical tomography (DOT). Results: Maternal PRAQ-R2 scores at gwk 24 correlated negatively with the total hemoglobin (HbT) responses to sad speech on both sides of the temporoparietal junction (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ = -0.87). The correlation was significantly greater at gwk 24 than gwk 34 (ρ = -0.42). Limitations: The field of view of the measurement did not include the right hemisphere or parts of the frontal cortex. The sample size is moderate and the mothers were relatively highly educated, thus there may be some differences between the study sample and the general population. Conclusions: Maternal pregnancy-related anxiety may affect child brain emotion processing development. Further research is needed to understand the functional and developmental significance of the findings.

202,Psychological distress profiles in expectant mothers: What is the association with pregnancy-related and relational variables?,"Introduction: Research has progressively focused on antenatal psychological disease of expectant mothers, showing that anxiety and depression as well as fear of childbirth occur frequently during pregnancy. Some studies have investigated the connection between anxiety, depression, and fear of childbirth with contrasting results. Several authors have analyzed the association between psychological disease of pregnant women and numerous medical-obstetric and relational variables, still reporting inconclusive findings. The present study had three aims: 1) to investigate the psychological well-being of pregnant women based on their levels of anxiety, depression, and fear of childbirth, by identifying psychological profiles; (2) to analyze the association between the emergent psychological profiles and some medical-obstetric variables related to pregnancy; and (3) to examine the association between these profiles and couple's adjustment and social support. Methods: 410 Italian primiparous pregnant women in the 7th-8th month of pregnancy completed a questionnaire packet on site that included the following scales: Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Results: Findings revealed the presence of three different clusters: “psychologically healthy women” (34.9%), comprised of women characterized by low levels of symptoms on all the scales; “women experiencing pregnancy- and childbirth-related anxiety” (47.3%), which groups women with an average state anxiety over the clinical value; and “psychologically distressed women” (17.8%), comprised of women who reported high levels of symptoms on all the scales, some above the clinical cut-offs. These profiles were not related to the medical-obstetric variables. On the other hand, findings revealed a significant association between marital adjustment as well as social support and cluster membership. Discussion: These results support the importance of early and multilevel psychological screening in order to understand the experience of pregnant women and to develop targeted and increasingly personalized interventions.

203,Examining the boundaries between ICD-11 PTSD/CPTSD and depression and anxiety symptoms: A network analysis perspective,"Background: Two newly identified sibling disorders – ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD – have been well validated in the last few years. Although these trauma-related disorders are suggested to be neatly separated from depression and anxiety, no study has used a network analysis to examine those definitions’ construct validity when they also interplay with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, no research has focused upon the specific boundaries between these four disorders’ symptoms, the bridges between them, and the ways they influence each other among clinical populations. Methods: A sample of 234 men drawn randomly from a national sample of 1,600 Jewish men receiving treatment for domestic violence in Israel completed the ICD-11 International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Results: The ICD-11 CPTSD, depression and anxiety clustering network results revealed, within the EGA, a four-cluster solution in which PTSD and CPTSD symptoms are differentiated from two other distinct clusters of anxiety and depression symptoms. Feelings of worthlessness and avoiding internal reminders of the experience were the most central symptoms. Limitations: Due to the use of a cross-sectional design, causal interpretation of the network correlation between symptoms should be made cautiously. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the approach that ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD have a distinct construct; however, they also reflect a strong positive connection to anxiety and depression symptoms and no clear boundaries between disorders. Specifically, dysphoria/avoidance-related symptoms act as a bridge between the disorders, which may be important targets for specific assessments and related interventions.

204,The effects of aerobic physical exercises on body image among women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Background: Both physical and mental health care for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) require a multidisciplinary approach. We evaluated the effects of continuous (CAT) and intermittent (IAT) aerobic training in different protocols that measure body image, anxiety, depression and sexual dysfunction in women with PCOS. Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, women with PCOS were randomly allocated for 16 weeks to 1 out of 3 groups: CAT ( n = 28), IAT ( n = 29), or control group (CG, n = 30). For data collection, we used the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Measurement Scales (HADS). Results: No effects of CAT, IAT or CG groups were identified in the perceptual dimension of body image. The dis(satisfaction) grade improved after exercise in the CAT group ( p ≤ 0.01) compared to the CG, as well as improved within CAT and IAT groups. Total FSFI, and HADS-A and HADS-D scores improved after exercise in the both groups. At baseline and after the study period, there were positive correlations between scores for dis(satisfaction), HADS-A and HADS-D scores. HADS-A and HADS-D scores had a negative correlation with FSFI total in the IAT ( p = =0.02) group compared to the CG, as well as within CAT and IAT groups. Limitations: The participants were not matched for body mass index (normal, overweight and obese) which may interfere on body image dimensions. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise improves sexual function and indices related to anxiety and depression. Likewise, it interferes in cognitive-affective dimension of the body image.

205,Updating the evidence for an association between anxiety and risk of Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,"Objectives: Anxiety is postulated to be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our primary aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies investigating the association between anxiety and AD risk. Design: We searched multiple scientific databases to identify relevant papers published up to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were: prospective cohort studies with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year, baseline anxiety assessment, absence of dementia at baseline, investigated the association between anxiety and AD incidence, and reporting Relative Risks (RRs), or equivalents (HRs and SHRs), for the association between anxiety and AD risk. We excluded studies that: focused on subjective memory or mild cognitive impairment samples, review and meta-analyses, not reporting original, published peer-reviewed results. We used a random-effects model that accommodated the differences in association statistics. Results: 7 prospective cohorts (reported in 6 studies), with a total of 24,528 participants, were included in our meta-analysis. A marginally significant association between anxiety and AD risk was found, with a pooled RR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.00–2.12), and a population attributable fraction for AD of 2.8% (95% CI: 1.2%–4.3%). Limitations: There was a high level of heterogeneity across the studies, which may be associated with differences in the covariates adjusted for. Studies also differed considerably in how they measured anxiety. Conclusion: Anxiety is marginally associated with an increased risk of AD in this meta-analysis. Future research is needed to determine the extent to which anxiety might be a cause of AD rather than a prodrome or marker.

206,Augmenting the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders with transcranial direct current stimulation in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder and comorbid depression: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: The aim of the current study was to compare the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) with and without transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and comorbid depression. Methods: A total of 43 individuals diagnosed with GAD and comorbid depression enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (IRCT20140929019334N1). Participants were randomly assigned to three groups including UP with tDCS (UP+tDCS; n = 15), UP alone (UP; n = 13) or wait-list control ( n = 15). GAD and depression symptoms, worry severity, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results: Treatment with both UP+tDCS and UP alone resulted in significant lower ratings across all measures relative to wait-list controls at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up (all p -values &lt; 0.001). UP+tDCS showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety ( p = 0.001 post-treatment; p = 0.003 follow-up), worry ( p = 0.001 post-treatment; p = 0.002 follow-up), and anxiety sensitivity ( p = 0.003 post-treatment; p = 0.002 follow-up) relative to UP alone. Limitations: The present study had some limitations. First, the sample size was low. Another limitation was the use of a short-term follow-up. Conclusions: These results suggest augmenting UP treatment with tDCS may be an efficacious strategy to improve treatment outcomes in GAD with comorbid depression.

207,"Measurement invariance of assessments of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) across sex, strata and linguistic backgrounds in a European-wide sample of patients after Traumatic Brain Injury","Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) are two widely used instruments to screen patients for depression and anxiety. Comparable psychometric properties across different demographic and linguistic groups are necessary for multiple group comparison and international research on depression and anxiety. Objectives and Method: We examine measurement invariance for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 by: (a) the sex of the participants, (b) recruitment stratum, and (c) linguistic background. This study is based on non-randomized observational data six months after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that were collected in 18 countries. We used multiple methods to detect Differential Item Functioning (DIF) including Item Response Theory, logistic regression, and the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: At the 6-month post-injury, 2137 (738 [34.5%] women) participants completed the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires: 885 [41.4%] patients were primarily admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 805 [37.7%] were admitted to hospital ward, and 447 [20.9%] were evaluated in the Emergency Room and discharged. Results supported the invariance of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 across sex, patient strata and linguistic background. For different strata three PHQ-9 items and one GAD-7 item and for different linguistic groups only two GAD-7 items were flagged as showing differences in two out of four DIF tests. However, the magnitude of the DIF effect was negligible. Limitation: Despite high number of participants from ICU, patients have mostly mild TBI. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate adequate psychometric properties for PHQ-9 and GAD-7, allowing direct multigroup comparison across sex, strata, and linguistic background.

208,"Association of antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery","Background: Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of preterm birth (PTB) and low infant birth weight (LBW) complications where affective and anxiety disorders are more common in the antepartum period than in industrialized countries. Objective: To evaluate the extent to which early pregnancy antepartum depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery among a cohort of pregnant women in Peru. Methods: Our prospective cohort study consisted of 4408 pregnant women. Antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD were assessed in early pregnancy using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version, respectively. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear and logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted measures of association (β coefficients and odds ratios) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: After adjusting for confounders, women with antepartum generalized anxiety (32.6% prevalence) had higher odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.47; 95%CI: 1.10–1.95) and were more likely to deliver small for gestational age (OR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.01–1.92) infants compared to those without anxiety. Compared to those without PTSD, women with PTSD (34.5%) had higher odds of delivering preterm (OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 1.00–1.65) yet PTSD was not associated with LBW nor gestational age at delivery. Women with antepartum depression (26.2%) were at no increased risk of delivering a preterm, low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant. Limitations: Our ability to make casual inferences from this observational study is limited; however, these findings are consistent with prior studies. Conclusion: Generalized anxiety disorder during pregnancy appeared to increase odds of delivering a low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant, while PTSD was associated with increased odds of delivering preterm. Our findings, and those of others, suggest antenatal care should be tailored to screen for and provide additional mental health services to patients.

209,Antidepressant resistance in adolescents with major depressive disorder: A nationwide longitudinal study,"Background: Studies have suggested that psychiatric comorbidities have major effects on antidepressant resistance in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the association between psychiatric comorbidities and antidepressant resistance remains unclear in adolescents with MDD. Methods: A total of 10,624 adolescents with MDD were selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2001 and 2010 and followed for one year. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) was defined as unresponsiveness to at least two antidepressants, and treatment resistant tendency was defined as unresponsiveness to the first antidepressant. Psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were assessed as confounding factors. Results: In our study, only 1.7% (n = 184) of adolescents with MDD met the TRD criteria but 23.3% (n = 2480) were classified as exhibiting treatment resistant tendency. Anxiety disorders (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.73–3.16) and substance use disorders (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.28–4.54) exhibited a correlation with TRD, and ADHD (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08–1.66) was associated with treatment resistant tendency. Conclusions: Approximately one-fourth of adolescents with MDD respond poorly to the first antidepressant treatment. The psychiatric comorbidities of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and ADHD may increase the risk of treatment resistance in adolescents with MDD.

210,One-Year follow-up effects of a cognitive behavior therapy-based transdiagnostic program for emotional problems in young children: A school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background: The present study examined the long-term efficacy of a transdiagnostic prevention program, Super Skills for Life (SSL), among young children with emotional problems. SSL is based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and social skills training. Methods: One-hundred and twenty-three Spanish-speaking children, aged 6 to 8 years, and their parents participated in the study. They were recruited from ten schools. Schools were randomly allocated to either the intervention (IG) or waiting-list control (WLC) groups. The children's parent completed a set of questionnaires to measure their child's anxiety and depressive symptoms, general difficulties and positive attributes, and psychosocial impairment. Parent's assessment at baseline and at a 12-month follow-up was assessed using an intent-to-treat approach. Results: The IG, compared to WLC group, showed significant baseline-to-follow-up reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as in behavioral difficulties and psychosocial impairment in various life domains. Limitations: The small sample size and the reliance on parental reports were the major limitations of this study. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence of the long-term effects of SSL, suggesting that it is a promising indicated preventive intervention for young children with emotional problems.

211,Fear of missing out predicts repeated measurements of greater negative affect using experience sampling methodology,"Background: Fear of missing out (FOMO) has been increasingly researched recently, especially in relation to negative affectivity constructs. Our aim was to examine relations between FOMO and repeated measurements of negative affect over one week. Method: We investigated associations between FOMO and prospectively-measured negative affect over one week in an experience sampling study of 93 undergraduate students. Participants completed an initial web survey assessing depression, anxiety and FOMO. Over the week, participants responded to daily text messages, assessing negative affect from earlier in the day. Results: On a bivariate basis, FOMO, depression and anxiety severity were related to daily negative affect assessments. Using multivariate growth modeling, higher initial negative affect was related to decreasing negative affect over the week. Female sex and higher anxiety related to higher initial negative affect ratings. Higher FOMO levels related to increasing negative affect over the week. Limitations: Findings were based on self-report methodology, using university students and only one week of measurement. Conclusions: Results suggest that women and more anxious individuals had higher initial negative affect, while FOMO predicted increasing negative affect over the week. Results advance understanding of FOMO in relation to psychopathology, and are discussed in the context of Self-Determination Theory.

212,Gender-specific predictors of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms in older adults: Results of a large population-based study,"Background: Anxiety in older age is common. In comparison with men, older women experience higher levels of anxiety and show different patterns of co-occurring mental disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate gender-specific biopsychosocial predictors associated with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) symptoms after a period of three years in the elderly population. Methods: Data were derived from the third (2008–2010) and the fourth follow-up (2011–2014) of the large population-based German ESTHER study. 2254 participants ages 55–85 were included in the study (52.3% female; 47.7% male). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Symptoms were measured using the GAD-7 questionnaire at both follow-ups. Linear regression analyses were performed to predict GAD severity after three years; the analyses were separated by gender and adjusted for demographic variables, biopsychosocial health, cognitive impairment, loneliness, and psychosocial resources. Results: In women, GAD severity after three years (t1) was positively associated with younger age, depression symptoms, loneliness, and GAD severity at t0. In men, GAD severity was positively associated with somatic symptoms as well as with GAD severity at t0. In both genders GAD severity at baseline was the strongest predictor of elevated future anxiety symptoms. Limitations: GAD was examined by the use of questionnaires rather than by personal assessment; underreporting of GAD symptoms is therefore possible. Conclusions: Our study shows that an increase as well as a decrease of GAD severity in older women and men can be predicted by several biopsychosocial variables.

214,"Neuroimaging, genetic, clinical, and demographic predictors of treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder","Background: Correct prediction of treatment response is a central goal of precision psychiatry. Here, we tested the predictive accuracy of a variety of pre-treatment patient characteristics, including clinical, demographic, molecular genetic, and neuroimaging markers, for treatment response in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Methods: Forty-seven SAD patients (mean ± SD age 33.9 ± 9.4 years, 24 women) were randomized and commenced 9 weeks’ Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) combined either with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (20 mg daily [10 mg first week], SSRI + CBT, n = 24) or placebo (placebo +CBT, n = 23). Treatment responders were defined from the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I ≤ 2). Before treatment, patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Multi-Source Interference Task taxing cognitive interference. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to separate responders from nonresponders based on pre-treatment neural reactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, and occipital cortex, as well as molecular genetic, demographic, and clinical data. SVM models were tested using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The best model separated treatment responders ( n = 24) from nonresponders based on pre-treatment dACC reactivity (83% accuracy, P = 0.001). Responders had greater pre-treatment dACC reactivity than nonresponders especially in the SSRI+CBT group. No other variable was associated with clinical response or added predictive accuracy to the dACC SVM model. Limitations: Small sample size, especially for genetic analyses. No replication or validation samples were available. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that treatment outcome predictions based on neural cingulate activity, at the individual level, outperform genetic, demographic, and clinical variables for medication-assisted Internet-delivered CBT, supporting the use of neuroimaging in precision psychiatry.

215,Fruit and vegetable intake in relation to depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescents in 25 low- and middle-income countries,"Background: Fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) has been inversely associated with the risk of depression. However, there is a gap in evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and among adolescents. Further, little is known about FVI in relation to the risk of anxiety. Therefore, we examined these associations among adolescents in 25 LMICs. Methods: Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed in 65267 adolescents aged 12–15 years (mostly nationally representative). Depressive and anxiety symptoms during the past 12 months were self-reported. Frequencies of FVI during the past 30 days were collected. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analyses of country-wise estimates were undertaken. Results: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms were 30.3% and 9.8%, respectively. A meta-analysis indicated that FVI of &lt; 5 times/d (vs. higher) was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.02–1.18). The pooled estimate for anxiety symptoms was insignificant. When examined separately, fruit intake was significantly associated with both lower risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms; vegetable intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms, but not with anxiety. Limitations: Only adolescents attending school were included; the cross-sectional design cannot reveal causality; outcomes were not measured against the gold-standard diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Our study provides multi-national evidence of the protective effect of FVI against depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescents in LMICs, enabling key stakeholders to address mental health issues among adolescents globally.

216,Contributions of fixed mindsets and hopelessness to anxiety and depressive symptoms: A commonality analysis approach,"Background: Fixed mindsets (beliefs that personal traits are unchangeable) show consistent associations with internalizing symptoms. However, the mindset-internalizing symptom link has previously been studied in isolation of other maladaptive cognitions that relate to internalizing symptoms. Thus, the unique contributions of mindsets to internalizing symptoms remains unclear. Method: We used commonality analysis (CA), which yields unique and shared effects of independent variables on an outcome, to assess unique contributions of emotion and anxiety mindsets to anxiety and depression symptoms, relative to the contributions of hopelessness. Participants in two online studies ( N s = 200, 430) self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and emotion and anxiety mindsets. Results: In Study 1, neither mindset type contributed unique variance to depression or anxiety beyond the contribution of hopelessness. In Study 2, emotion mindsets again explained no unique symptom variance. Anxiety mindsets uniquely contributed 2.0% and 6.5% of depression and anxiety variance, respectively—but far larger proportions of symptom variance (20.0%-60.9%) were contributed by hopelessness alone, variance shared by hopelessness and anxiety mindsets, and variance shared among hopelessness, anxiety mindsets, and emotion mindsets. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions, and the non-referred adult samples may limit generalizability. Discussion: Mindsets contributed little unique variance to internalizing symptoms beyond hopelessness. Interventions teaching growth mindsets have been shown to reduce internalizing problem in past studies. However, these interventions might not necessarily operate by shaping mindsets; rather, they may affect symptom change by shaping closely-linked maladaptive cognitions—like hopelessness—with stronger ties to internalizing distress.

217,Abnormal dynamic functional connectivity density in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background: Numerous studies have revealed the abnormal static functional connectivity (FC) among different brain regions in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, little is known about the dynamic changes of FC in patients with GAD. Methods: This study investigated the whole-brain dynamic changes of FC in patients with GAD by combining global FC density (FCD) and sliding window correlation analyses. The standard deviation of dynamic FCD (dFCD) was calculated to evaluate its temporal variability along time. Support vector regression was then employed to predict the symptom severity of patients based on abnormal dynamic connectivity patterns. Results: The abnormal dFCD variability between 81 GAD patients and 80 healthy controls showed that the patients had higher dFCD variability in the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and left hippocampus while lower dFCD variability in the right postcentral gyrus. The abnormal dFCD variability of the left dmPFC is an important feature for anxiety prediction. Limitations: The selection of sliding window length remains controversial, and most of our patients have been treated with medications. Future studies are expected to rule out the potential confounding effects from applying different parameters of the sliding window and recruiting large samples of medication-free patients. Conclusion: The altered patterns of time-varying brain connectivity in the frontolimbic and sensorimotor areas may reflect abnormal dynamic neural communication between these regions and other regions of the brain, which may deepen our understanding of the disease.

218,Postnatal depressive symptoms display marked similarities across continents,"Background: Postnatal depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) are reported to display measurement variance regarding factor structure and the frequency of specific depressive symptoms. However, postnatal depressive symptoms measured by EPDS have not been compared between women representing three continents. Methods: A cross-sectional study including birth cohort samples from Denmark, Vietnam and Tanzania. Women were included during pregnancy at routine care sites. Depressive symptoms were self-reported 40–90 days postpartum using the EPDS. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and generalized additive regression models were performed. Results: A total of N = 4,516 participated in the study (Denmark N = 2,069, Vietnam N = 1,278, Tanzania N = 1,169). Factor analyses identified three factors (anhedonia, anxiety and depression) that were almost identical in the three study populations. The only variation between countries was that the item ‘self-harm’ loaded differently. Women from Tanzania and Denmark were more likely to have an EPDS total score above cut-off 12 (12.6% and 6.4%), compared to women from Vietnam (1.9%) ( p &lt; 0.001). A low level of education was associated with significantly more depressive symptoms after adjusting for country ( p &lt; 0.001). Limitations: EPDS data was collected at a later time point in the Danish sample. Conclusions: Postnatal depressive symptoms constitute a three-factor model across cultures including the factors anhedonia, anxiety and depression. The frequency of postnatal depressive symptoms differs between high-, medium-, and low-income countries. However, clinicians should bear in mind that low-educated women worldwide are more likely to experience postnatal depressive symptoms.

219,The effect of emotional working memory training on emotional and cognitive outcomes in individuals with elevated social anxiety,"Background: Although cognitive-behavioural therapy is the gold standard psychological treatment for individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), it does not benefit everyone. Emotional working memory training (eWMT) is a promising alternative intervention. This study examined the effects of eWMT versus control training (CT) on emotional and cognitive outcomes in individuals with elevated social anxiety. Methods: Forty participants with elevated social anxiety were randomly allocated to eWMT ( n = 21) or CT ( n = 19), each consisting of six training sessions. At pre- and post-training, participants completed: a working memory task, an impromptu speech, and self-reported measures of emotional and cognitive outcomes (anticipatory processing, peak anxiety and attentional focus during the speech, post-event processing). Results: Participants in both training conditions exhibited performance improvements on their respective training tasks. As expected, there was a Time x Condition interaction for peak anxiety, reflecting a decrease in peak anxiety for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition. Exploratory analyses also indicated a Time x Condition interaction for an aspect of post-event processing, reflecting a decrease in thinking about the past for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition. Limitations: Although the level of social anxiety of the current sample is comparable to that of samples of individuals diagnosed with SAD in the literature, participant diagnoses were not assessed in this study. Conclusions: The findings suggest that eWMT has potential as an alternative intervention for individuals with elevated social anxiety.

Method: Parents of children aged 7–18 years with anxiety or ASD completed the SCAS-P. Multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) structural equation modelling was utilized to analyse the data. Results: Analysis revealed different factor structures between the Anxious and ASD groups and evidence for measurement variance across groups in some parts of the SCAS-P. Conclusion: Results on the SCAS-P in children with ASD need to be interpreted with caution. Some SCAS-P items cannot be interpreted in the same way in an ASD population compared to neurotypical children with anxiety.

221,"The synergic relationship between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and body fatness in adolescents","Background: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cross-sectional synergic relationship among social anxiety, poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms and body fatness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with 1,242 adolescents from a north-eastern district in Brazil. It was used the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents for symptoms of social anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality and the Depression Scale of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for depressive symptoms. Body fatness was the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate associations among these comorbidities. Results: Social anxiety was directly and positively associated with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and body fatness (β = 0.316 standard deviations [SD]; β = 0.299 SD; β = 0.072 SD, respectively). Moreover, social anxiety was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms via poor sleep quality (β = 0.113 SD). Poor sleep quality was directly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.377 SD). We did not observe a significant relationship of poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms with body fatness. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study; therefore, we cannot infer causality in the interpretation of the findings. Conclusions: Social anxiety seemed to play pivotal role in adolescents’ health, since it was associated with poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms and body fatness. Interventions targeting sleep quality, depressive symptoms and body fatness in adolescents should designate relevant effort addressing social anxiety.

222,"Cyclothymic temperament: Associations with ADHD, other psychopathology, and medical morbidity in the general population","Background: Cyclothymic temperament (CT) is an affective disposition often preceding bipolar disorder (BD), and is the most common affective temperament in patients with BD. In depressed patients, CT is a predictor for developing a bipolar course. In a clinical sample of adults with BD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), CT was associated with higher loads of psychiatric symptoms, somatic comorbidity, impairment, and higher morbidity among first-degree relatives. We aimed to investigate the morbidity and occupational functioning of persons with CT in the general population. Methods: Randomly recruited Norwegian adults ( n = 721) were assessed with a 21-item cyclothymic subscale from the TEMPS Autoquestionnaire. Self-reported data were collected on psychiatric symptoms, comorbidity, educational and occupational level, and known family morbidity. Results: Thirteen percent had CT associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD, BD, high scores on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), and childhood and adulthood ADHD symptoms. CT was found in 75% ( p &lt; .001) of the bipolar participants, and in 68% ( p &lt; .001) of those with a positive MDQ score. CT was associated with more anxiety/depression, substance and alcohol problems, lower educational and occupational levels, and having a first-degree relative with anxiety/depression, alcohol problems, ADHD, and BD. Limitations: The CT subscale alone might include overlapping features with cyclothymic, anxious, irritable, and depressed temperaments, thus increasing the prevalence estimate of CT. Conclusions: CT is a strong predictor of occupational failure and associated with more psychiatric impairment in the participants and their families. CT should be assessed in both mood disorder and ADHD patients.

223,Prospective relationships between mobile phone dependence and mental health status among Chinese undergraduate students with college adjustment as a mediator,"Background: This 3-year longitudinal study investigated the prospective relationships between mobile phone dependence and mental health status (i.e., subjective well-being, anxiety and depression) and the mediating role of college adjustment among Chinese undergraduate students. Methods: The study recruited 265 first-year undergraduate students from a university (mean age = 18.95 years, SD = 0.72) in Wenzhou, China. A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys were conducted between November 2013 and December 2015 (the response rate was 76.4%). The validated Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS), Chinese College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS), Index of Well-being, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used for assessments. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression at Year 3 was 7.5% and 9.4%, respectively. Correlation analyses showed that mobile phone dependence at Year 1, college adjustment at Year 2, and mental health status at Year 3 were significantly correlated with each other. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that mobile phone dependence at Year 1 significantly predicted poor mental health status at Year 3. College adjustment at Year 2 significantly mediated the effect of mobile phone dependence at Year 1 on mental health status at Year 3. Conclusions: Interventions both on reduction of mobile phone dependency and improvement of college adjustment (especially among those with mobile phone dependence) are possible and needed among new college students to prevent their future depression and anxiety. Such interventions should be incorporated into regular education programs in universities.

224,"Clarifying stress-internalizing associations: Stress frequency and appraisals of severity and controllability are differentially related to depression-specific, anxiety-specific, and transdiagnostic internalizing factors","Background: Dependent (self-generated) stress is a strong risk factor for depression and anxiety, but perceptions of stress can alter its impact. Appraisals of dependent stress controllability and severity additionally relate to depression and anxiety over and above stress exposure. Due to the high comorbidity of depression and anxiety, it is unclear whether dependent stress frequency and appraisals relate specifically to depression or anxiety or are transdiagnostically associated shared aspects of internalizing disorders. Consistent with the tripartite model, the current study represented internalizing symptoms with three latent factors—depression-specific, anxiety-specific, and common internalizing—and tested how dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity were associated with these factors. Methods: Bifactor modeling was used to create the latent internalizing factors in a treatment-seeking sample of emerging adults ( n = 356). Structural equation models tested dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity as predictors of these latent factors. Results: Dependent stress frequency was associated with common internalizing while perceived controllability was associated uniquely with depression-specific variance. Continuous stress severity was not associated with latent factors, but high-severity stressors were associated with anxiety-specific variance. Limitations: Without longitudinal data conclusions regarding temporal directionality cannot be made. Participants’ appraisals of stressors could not be compared to expert ratings. Conclusions: Dependent stress frequency, controllability appraisals, and high-severity stressful events have distinct links with different dimensions of internalizing psychopathology. This suggests there may be several distinct mediating mechanisms between stress constructs and psychopathology, which have potential to serve as targets for intervention.

225,Sleep spindle density is associated with worry in children with generalized anxiety disorder and healthy controls,"Background: Childhood generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by uncontrollable worry, is associated with long-term psychopathology risk, yet understanding of developmental trajectories is limited. Despite common complaints about sleep, ‘macro’ sleep abnormalities have not been identified. Emerging findings suggest micro-architectural features of sleep, including sleep spindles, differentiate various psychiatric populations. The current study investigated sleep spindle density during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep among youth with GAD and healthy controls, including relationships with anxiety, worry, global functioning, and subjective sleep quality. Methods: 58 pre-pubertal children, n = 26 with GAD and n = 32 matched healthy controls, aged 7–11 years ( M = 8.86, SD = 1.47), completed diagnostic assessments and a week of actigraphy monitoring prior to a night of polysomnography (PSG) either at home or in a sleep laboratory. NREM spindle activity was detected in frontal and central regions. Results: Sleep spindle activity did not differ based on diagnostic group or sex. Sleep spindles were unassociated with anxiety and sleep quality but showed a significant positive association with worry in all youth. Among youth with GAD, global functioning was negatively associated with spindle density in frontal regions during NREM stage 3. Spindle density was significantly greater during in-lab compared to at-home PSG. Limitations: The small sample size and reliance on only one night of PSG necessitate additional studies. Conclusions: The identified link between spindle activity and worry in pre-pubertal children highlights a need for investigations on transdiagnostic features of child psychopathology rather than specific disorders. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore spindle characteristics and affective risk across development.

226,The longitudinal course of pregnancy-related anxiety in parous and nulliparous women and its association with symptoms of social and generalized anxiety,"Background: There is evidence that pregnancy-related anxiety (PrA) has a negative impact on birth outcomes and infant development. However, little is known about worrisome levels and individual trajectories of PrA dimensions across pregnancy and their predictive factors, particularly the association of PrA with symptoms of social phobia (SP) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: A sample of 180 pregnant women was assessed three times during pregnancy with the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised 2 (PRAQ-R2). Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the course of different PrA dimensions across pregnancy, and to relate PrA to symptoms of social and generalized anxiety. Additionally, distinct developmental patterns of PrA were explored by latent class growth analyses. Results: While the PrA total score remained stable, the different dimensions of PrA varied significantly over time. After controlling for obstetric and sociodemographic factors as well as depression, perceived social support and self-efficacy, symptoms of SP significantly predicted higher levels of fear of childbirth, child-related worries and concerns about mother´s appearance. Symptoms of GAD predicted higher child-related worries. Moreover, two distinct groups of women with either consistently higher or lower PrA scores were identified. Limitations: Our results are limited due to the use of self-report questionnaires and would benefit from a larger sample size and replication in high-risk samples. Conclusion: Our study suggests that a longitudinal and differentiated investigation of specific forms of prenatal anxiety may improve our understanding of women at high risk for PrA and promote the development of individualized forms of interventions initiated during pregnancy.

227,"Peripheral adiponectin levels in anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor-related disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor-related disorders confer increased risk for metabolic disease. Adiponectin, a cytokine released by adipose tissue is associated with these disorders and obesity via inflammatory processes. Available data describing associations with mental disorders remain limited and conflicted. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for English, peer-reviewed articles from inception until February 2019 that assessed for serum or plasma adiponectin levels in adults with an anxiety, mood or trauma-related disorder. Diagnoses were determined by psychiatric interview, based on DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria. Analyses were performed using STATA 15 and Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval was applied to pool the effect size of meta-analysis studies. Results: In total 65 eligible studies were included in the systematic review and 30 studies in this meta-analysis. 19,178 participants (11,262 females and 7916 males), comprising healthy adults and adults with anxiety, mood and trauma-related disorders, were included. Overall results indicated an inverse association between adiponectin levels and examined mental disorders. Specifically, patients with an anxiety disorder (SMD = −1.18 µg/mL, 95% CI, −2.34; −0.01, p = 0.047); trauma or stressor-related disorder (SMD = −0.34 µg/mL, 95% CI, −0.52; −0.17, p = 0.0000) or bipolar disorder (SMD = −0.638 µg/mL, 95% CI, −1.16, −0.12, p = 0.017) had significant lower adiponectin levels compared to healthy adults. Limitations: Heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and lack of control for important potential confounders were significant limitations. Conclusion: Peripheral adiponectin levels appear to be inversely associated with anxiety, mood, trauma- and stressor related disorders and may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and disease monitoring.

228,Changes in the mental health status of adolescents following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident and related factors: Fukushima Health Management Survey,"Background: The present study examined the data from the Fukushima Health Management Survey conducted after the Great East Japan Earthquake to identify disaster-related factors affecting the mental health status of adolescents following the disaster and obtained basic data necessary in providing mental healthcare. Methods: The study included 2808 adolescents aged 15–19 years (male: 1327; female: 1481) who completed the 2011 edition of the registered questionnaire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale scores, age, sex, health status, sleep satisfaction level, Great East Japan Earthquake experience, experience of losing a loved one, change in employment status, change in residence, and awareness of the impact of radiation on health were examined. Results: Psychological distress was significantly correlated with sex, health status, sleep satisfaction of, experience of losing a loved one, change in employment status, extreme anxiety regarding the acute health impact of radiation, and extreme anxiety regarding the impact of radiation on health in adolescents and the next generation. Limitations: The present study is limited because of its cross-sectional design, due to which, the causal relationship between each factor and psychological distress could not be clarified. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that appropriate mental healthcare should be administered immediately following an earthquake to adolescents who have lost a loved one and experienced anxiety regarding the health impact of radiation following a nuclear accident.

229,Verbal memory predicts treatment outcome in syndromal anxious depression: An iSPOT-D report,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and high levels of anxious symptoms are associated with impaired cognitive functioning. However, little is known of how cognitive functioning is impaired in people with anxious depression. Here, we compared cognitive functioning between people with anxious depression, non-anxious depression, and healthy controls. We also tested whether anxious depression moderated the relationship between cognitive functioning and treatment outcome. Methods: 1008 adults with MDD and 336 healthy controls completed IntegNeuro: a computerized cognitive functioning test battery. Participants were then randomised to one of three antidepressants and reassessed at 8 weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD₁₇) and the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated for remission and response. Syndromal anxious depression was defined as MDD with a comorbid anxiety disorder. HRSD anxious depression was defined as MDD with a comorbid HRSD₁₇ anxiety/somatisation factor score ≥ 7. Results: Syndromal anxious depression was associated with better psychomotor functioning and poorer working memory, cognitive flexibility and information processing speed compared to their non-anxious counterparts. HRSD anxious depression was associated with better psychomotor functioning compared to their non-anxious counterparts. Syndromal anxious depression moderated the relationship between verbal memory and treatment outcome. In people with syndromal anxious depression, poorer baseline verbal memory predicted poorer treatment outcome. Limitations: As DSM-IV criteria was used, the DSM-5 anxious distress specifier characterisation of anxious depression could not be assessed Conclusions: Syndromal anxious depression is characterised by impaired executive functions and moderates the relationship between verbal memory functioning and treatment outcome.

230,Influence of comorbid anxiety symptoms on cognitive deficits in patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with comorbid anxiety symptoms showed obvious cognitive deficits. However, it remains unclear whether comorbid anxiety symptoms will make a specific contribution to cognitive deficits in MDD. Methods: Executive function, processing speed, attention and memory were assessed in 162 MDD patients, and 142 healthy controls (HCs) by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was used for anxiety symptoms and MDD patients with HAM-A total score &gt; 14 were classified into MDD with comorbid anxiety (MDDA) group. A multivariate analysis of covariance and regression models was conducted to evaluate the effects of anxiety symptoms on cognitive deficits. Results: There were no significantly differences in all 4 cognitive domains between MDD alone and MDDA patients (all p &lt; 0.05). In MDDA subgroup, HAM-A total score contributed to executive function and memory (both p &lt; 0.05), while HAM-A psychic symptoms contributed to all 4 domains (all p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, after controlling for the severity of depression, either anxiety symptoms shown as HAMA total score or psychic anxiety symptoms only contributed significantly to the executive function performance. Limitations: The cross-sectional design made it hard to acquire a cognitive performance trajectory accompanied by the fluctuations in anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is no significant difference in cognitive performance between MDD alone and MDDA patients. However, comorbid anxiety, especially psychic anxiety may contribute to extensive cognitive deficits in MDDA patients. Notably, anxiety symptoms only independently triggered executive dysfunction when eliminating effect of the severity of depression.

231,Comorbidity with more anxiety disorders associated with a poorer prognosis persisting at the 10-year follow-up among patients with major depressive disorder,"Objective: No study has investigated the association between number of anxiety disorders (NADs) and long-term outcome over 10 years among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study investigated this issue. Methods: At baseline, 290 outpatients with MDD were enrolled, 149 with at least one anxiety disorder (AD). Subjects were followed-up at six-month, two-year, and 10-year points. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR was used to confirm psychiatric diagnoses. NADs at baseline was recorded. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and the somatic subscale (SS) of the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale were employed. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used for statistical analysis. Results: MDD patients with ADs had greater depression, anxiety, and somatic severities at the three follow-up points than those without. NADs was significantly and positively correlated with the three dimensions and total duration of pharmacotherapy at follow-up. NADs was independently associated with symptom severity after controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline and pharmacotherapy. When the DSM-5 criteria for ADs were applied, the results were unchanged. Specific phobia, panic disorder and social phobia, and panic disorder and specific phobia were independently associated with depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, respectively. Limitation: Pharmacotherapy at follow-up was not controlled. The three follow-up intervals were unequal. Conclusions: Comorbidity with more ADs was associated with a poorer prognosis. The negative impacts of ADs on MDD persisted at the ten-year follow-up point. NADs was associated with the long-term prognosis of MDD.

232,Single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human &lt;i&gt;TIA1&lt;/i&gt; gene interacts with stressful life events to predict the development of pathological anxiety symptoms in a Swedish population,"Background: The TIA1 gene encodes a prion-related RNA-binding protein that regulates stress-dependent synaptic plasticity and fear memory in mice. It is unknown whether genetic variation in human TIA1 is associated with differences in stress- and fear-related behavior in people. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted in Sweden to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic status, exposure to stressful life events and psychiatric symptoms. DNA samples were obtained from study participants to allow genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human TIA1 locus. Results: We identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human TIA1 gene that interacts with exposure to previous-year stressful life events to predict the development of pathological anxiety symptoms in a non-clinical cohort. Limitations: Sample population is limited in both size and scope, and we did not perform functional analysis of allelic variants of TIA1. Conclusions: TI A1 may represent a susceptibility locus for stress-dependent psychopathology. These studies support an evolutionarily conserved role of TIA1 in the mammalian brain, and may provide molecular and genetic insight into the development of stress-related psychiatric conditions such as PTSD and anxiety.

233,Is prenatal maternal distress context-dependent? Comparing United States and the Netherlands,"Background: Maternal anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy can compromise a woman's well-being and affect offspring development. The present study represents a comparison of maternal late-pregnancy internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) between the United States of America (US) and the Netherlands. We hypothesized that women in the US would report higher levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy compared to their Dutch counterparts, both on individual symptom indicators and overall latent distress, due to more favorable policies/accessible services relevant to perinatal health in the Netherlands. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited at two comparable sites in the Netherlands ( n = 327) and the US ( n = 228). Measures included self-reports of internalizing distress and key covariates (i.e., parity, gestational, and maternal age). Results: Expectant mothers in the US reported higher depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to their Dutch counterparts. Results were consistent across individual internalizing symptom indicators and the overall latent prenatal distress means computed for US and Dutch samples, with an estimated large effect size for the latter after controlling for covariates. Limitations: Despite their relatively large sizes, our samples were limited in their representativeness of the two cultures and mechanisms contributing to observed differences were not examined. Conclusions: Pregnant women in the US reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms than women in the Netherlands. Implications concern perinatal policy and clinical services (e.g., emotional health support provided to mothers).

In the original article, there is a numerical error in Figure 1 (page 58). The “Finally included (HCs: n=36)” in the lower left corner should be corrected to “Finally included (HCs: n=24)”. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-62700-011). Background: Associations between abnormal gut microbiome compositions and anxiety-like behaviors are well established. However, it is unknown whether the gut microbiome composition is associated with the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and relief from clinical symptoms in patients. Methods: Stool samples from 36 patients with active GAD (A-GAD group) and 24 matched healthy control subjects (HC group) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anxiety was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and global assessments of functioning were performed at baseline and 1 month after drug treatment. Results: Gut microbiome compositions were altered in A-GAD patients, with fewer operational taxonomic units and lower fecal bacterial α-diversity. Specifically, Firmicutes and Tenericutes abundances were lower in A-GAD patients, and several genera were differentially represented in the A-GAD and HC groups. The abundances of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes _group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated negatively with the anxiety severity and positively with anxiety reduction, whereas the abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella were positively associated with anxiety severity. Sex, smoking, and alcohol intake influenced the gut microbiome composition. Limitations: The sample sizes were small and the stool samples were collected only at baseline; therefore, a causal association between changes in intestinal flora and disease remission was not established. Moreover, the effects of different drugs on gut microbiome composition were not investigated. Conclusions: Altered gut microbiome composition may contribute to GAD pathogenesis and remission.

8,Predicting engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) over the course of 12 months: the roles of borderline personality disorder pathology and emotional consequences of NSSI,"Background: Despite theories that negative reinforcement in the form of relief from negative emotions maintains nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), no studies have examined the extent to which specific emotional consequences of NSSI predict the maintenance of NSSI over time or explain the greater risk for NSSI found among individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) pathology. This study examined whether specific emotional consequences of NSSI relate to the continuance of NSSI behavior over a 12-month period and explain the relation of baseline BPD pathology to future NSSI. Methods: Participants with a history of recent repeated NSSI ( N = 84) completed baseline measures of BPD pathology, NSSI, and the emotional antecedents and consequences of NSSI, including self-conscious emotions, undifferentiated negative affect, anger, emptiness, sadness, and anxiety; follow-up data on NSSI were collected every three months for one year. Results: Of the emotional consequences of NSSI examined here, only self-conscious emotions significantly predicted the presence and frequency of NSSI during the 12-month follow-up period. Likewise, whereas BPD pathology was not directly associated with later NSSI, both overall BPD pathology and the specific BPD feature of identity problems were indirectly related to the presence of 12-month NSSI through the greater frequency of post-NSSI self-conscious emotions. Limitations: Emotional consequences of NSSI were assessed using a retrospective self-report measure. Only frequency, and not intensity, of emotions before and after NSSI were assessed. Conclusions: Results suggest a distinct role of post-NSSI self-conscious emotions in the maintenance of NSSI among individuals with and without BPD pathology.

9,"Linking peripheral IL-6, IL-1β and hypocretin-1 with cognitive impairment from major depression","Background: Cognitive impairment has long challenged the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), hypocretins and inflammation have recently been implicated in cognitive function. However, limited studies have compressively assessed their associations with cognitive impairment in MDD. Methods: A total of 100 MDD patients and 100 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for this study. They were tested with HAMD, HAMA, and MCCB scales. The plasma level of selected inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and hypocretin-1 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the plasma level of the factors and clinical performances. Results: Patients with MDD showed cognitive impairment in each MCCB subdomain except working memory compared with HC. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β and hypocretin-1 in MDD patients were higher than HC. Besides, IL-1β levels was negatively correlated with overall cognitive function in the combined group. Hypocretin-1 was positively correlated with socially cognitive impairment in MDD patients. A negative correlation between plasma hypocretin-1 levels and HAMA scales was also observed in MDD patients. Limitation: The study was cross-sectional, thereby limiting causal inference, and had a relatively small sample size. There are no subcategories for MDD based on characteristics. Conclusion: IL-1β, IL-6 and Hypocretin-1 were reported as potential factors involved in MDD pathology. Hypocretin-1 could contribute to the biological mechanisms of anxiety relief. Hypocretin-1, therefore, may be important in exploring the pathological mechanisms of social cognitive impairment in MDD patients. Conclusively, this study provides new insights for exploring cognitive impairment in depression.

10,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review,"Background: As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (≤ 40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations: A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance. Mitigating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health is an international public health priority.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-64969-140). Background: Bisexual people have been found to be at increased risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) when compared to heterosexual and gay or lesbian people. The purpose of this review was to update the estimated risk of NSSI for bisexual people and to examine variables that have been associated with NSSI in this population. Methods: The protocol for this paper was pre-registered (CRD42019145299). An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, PubMed, Ovid Online and Web of Science was undertaken from earliest available date to October 2019. Twenty-four eligible papers were identified. Meta-analyses, including moderator analysis, were conducted to ascertain NSSI risk and a narrative synthesis was undertaken of predictors and correlates. All studies were assessed for risk of bias. Results: Bisexual people had up to six times the odds of engaging in NSSI compared to other sexualities. Mental health variables of anxiety and depression symptoms were found to be most commonly associated with NSSI for this population. The majority of studies had moderate risk of bias. This review demonstrates that bisexual people have an elevated risk of engaging in NSSI. Increased incidence of anxiety and depression and exposure to negative life events may explain this increased risk. Limitations: Studies were found to be consistently cross-sectional in design and limited to western cultures. A limitation of this review was that only English language papers were included. Conclusions: Results are clinically relevant as they suggest early identification and prevention of NSSI can be achieved. Future research should examine bisexual people independently of others.

12,What are the emotions underlying feeling fat and fear of weight gain?,"Background: Eating disorders (EDs) are most always accompanied by cognitive-affective comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. In addition to these common comorbidities, EDs are unique in that they are characterized by affective symptoms centered on body image and weight. Two of these primary, yet understudied, affective symptoms are feelings of fatness and fears of weight gain, which are theorized to be maintaining symptoms of EDs and are highly common in those with EDs. Despite the importance of these symptoms, there is no research characterizing which cognitive-affective symptoms contribute to feelings of fatness and fears of weight gain. Methods: The current study ( N = 168 individuals with an ED) tested cross-sectional and prospective models of cognitive-affect variables (negative affect, guilt, shame, fear of negative evaluation, anxiety sensitivity, and depression) to identify which thoughts and emotions were uniquely associated and prospectively predicted feelings of fatness and fear of weight gain. Results: Depression both cross-sectionally and prospectively predicted feeling fat over and above all other forms of affect. Fears of negative evaluation and depression were uniquely associated with fears of weight gain, and shame prospectively predicted fear of weight gain. Limitations: Variables were self-reported, and the sample primarily consisted of women. Fear of weight gain and feelings of fatness were assessed using single items. Conclusions: This research suggests that depression may be an important intervention target when individuals with an ED report feeling fat. Additionally, treatment targeting fear of negative evaluation, depression, and shame may decrease fears of weight gain.

13,Validation of a Chinese version of the short form of Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30),"Background: This study investigated the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the short form of Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30), which is an effective tool to assess metacognitive beliefs that have been linked to mental disturbance/disorder. We also tested whether metacognition factors would correlate with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) tendency. Methods: Six hundred and eighty Chinese university students (Mean age = 19.72, SD = 1.38; 31.9% male) voluntarily completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Using standard translation procedures, the MCQ-30 items were translated from English into Chinese language and then back-translated. Depression, anxiety, and IGD tendency were assessed by validated scales. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results supported the five-factor structure of the MCQ-30, with satisfactory model fit and good reliability. Criterion-related validity was also supported by significant positive correlations between the five factors and depression/anxiety symptoms. All of the five metacognition factors were also significantly correlated with IGD tendency, with positive beliefs about worry and cognitive confidence being the most salient factor after controlling for gender and age. Limitations: This study did not examine the test–retest reliability of this scale, and the generalizability of the findings to other age groups remains unclear. Conclusions: This study showed satisfactory psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the MCQ-30 and is the first to demonstrate a positive association between specific metacognition factors and IGD tendency among Chinese people. The latter finding supports an application of metacognitive therapy to the treatment of behavioral addictions, including IGD.

14,Depression in and after COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the role of stress and loneliness in lockdown: A longitudinal study,"Governmental lockdown measures to prevent the uncontrolled spreading of the novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) are effective but can decrease mental health. For example, depression rates were 4% in 2014 and increased to 20% during the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. It is less known if depression changes when lockdown measures are lifted and who is at risk to still have depression after lockdown. Only one study addressed the question how mental health changes in vs. after quarantine but this previous study focused on anxiety and anger. In the current study, we explored changes of depression in vs. after lockdown and whether stress and loneliness during the lockdown affect subsequent depression after the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. Stress and loneliness were selected since they have been found to be associated with depression and are relevant problems in times of COVID-19.

15,Physical activity in early adolescence predicts depressive symptoms 3 years later: A community-based study,"Background: Physical activity (PA) during adolescence is associated with a wide range of health benefits, including lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Although the association between PA and mental health has been established, there are few prospective studies investigating if the association between PA and internalizing/externalizing symptoms remains after adjustment for the baseline occurrence of such symptoms, and those exploring any sex-specific pattern of the association. Methods: Swedish adolescents (N = 1428; mean age = 14.38 years) were assessed and followed up 3 years later. Self-reported data were collected for PA (recoded as low, moderate and high levels), internalizing (depression and anxiety) and externalizing (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behaviours) symptoms. A full path analysis was used to determine the main and interaction effects of PA and sex on internalizing/externalizing symptoms 3 years later, adjusting for these symptoms at baseline. Results: Higher levels of PA were correlated with lower internalizing/externalizing symptoms. In the full path analysis, PA during early adolescence predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or externalizing problems, 3 years later. A sex-specific effect of PA on depressive symptoms was found, wherein boys, but not girls, with high levels of PA showed reduced symptoms. Limitations: Including parental ratings, diagnostic assessments and objective measures of PA would have provided additional information to the study. Conclusions: Low levels of PA during early adolescence are a unique predictor for the development of depressive symptoms among boys. PA should be considered when discussing prevention and treatment for depression in adolescents.

The primary outcome was Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and secondary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and state anxiety inventory (SAI), which were assessed at baseline (Week 0), during the trial (Week 4), and after completion of the light therapy (Week 8). Results: A total of 142 participants completed the trial. The LT-5000 (effect size [d] = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.98) and LT-500 conditions (d = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.26) were significantly superior to the WLC condition. For the LT-5000, LT-500, and WLC conditions by the end of the 8-week trial, a response on the HAMD was achieved by 70.0%, 42.0% and 19.0% of the participants, and remission was achieved by 76.0%, 54.0%, and 19.0%, respectively. Limitations: The subjects were not followed up regularly after completion of the trial. Conclusion: Light therapy, both at high- and low-intensity, was efficacious in the treatment of college students with non-seasonal subthreshold depression. High-intensity light therapy was superior to low-intensity light therapy by the end of an 8-week trial.

18,Prevalence of perinatal depression and its determinants in Mainland China: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Perinatal depression is a maternal mental health condition that is associated with various adverse health outcomes both for the mothers and the babies. The study aim was to estimate the prevalence of perinatal depression and its risks and determinants in Mainland China. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in 10 major databases and random effect meta-analysis was performed to achieve the pooled variance of perinatal depression. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on region, scale, methods of diagnosis and study design. Meta-regression was performed with the variables such as age, quality assessment score and gross domestic product (GDP) of the province. Results: Pooled prevalence of perinatal depression was 16.3% (CI = 95%; 14.7% to 18.2%, P &lt; 0.001), with antenatal depression 19.7% (CI = 95%; 15.8% to 24.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and postnatal depression 14.8% (CI = 95%; 13.1% to 16.6%, P &lt; 0.001). Significant publication bias was found and heterogeneity was I ² = 98.13%. Lower socioeconomic status, poor physical health, anxiety about pregnancy and reduced social support were major risk factors while better living conditions and higher level of education were protective factors. The prevalence of perinatal depression showed a significant increasing trend in the last decade. Limitations: The review does not include studies with small sample size ( n &lt; 250). Moreover a narrative review of risk and protective factors was done, these were not included in meta-analysis. Conclusion: The prevalence of perinatal depression in China is similar to low and middle-income countries. Urgent attention is needed to address this public health priority in China.

19,Public mental health under the long-term influence of COVID-19 in China: Geographical and temporal distribution,"Background: The mental health status caused by major epidemics is serious and lasting. At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. Results: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. Limitations: This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, people's mental state is affected by the geographical and temporal distributions.

20,Regional cortical thinning and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Although recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that functional deficits in facial perception are associated with panic disorder (PD), the possibility of cortical thickness and perfusion abnormalities have not been studied in patients with PD. We aimed to investigate alterations in cortical thickness and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs) using three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) and 3D arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI. Method: An automated surface-based method (Cat12) measured the cortical thickness of each subject. Z-score normalization for CBF maps was used to generate Z-score maps. Statistical comparisons were performed using statistical parametric mapping with two-sample t-tests. Results: Subjects with PD, unlike HCs, displayed cortical thinning in the right fusiform gyrus (FG). Post hoc analysis also revealed a decreased Z-score in the right FG. There was significant positive correlation between the Z-score and the cortical thickness of the right FG. The cortical thickness and Z-score were negatively correlated with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores. Limitations: The small sample size may have restricted the identification of additional differences. Other caveats included the use of medication by nine participants. Conclusions: These results provide further evidence of the significant role structural and functional deficits in the right FG play in patients with PD. Due to the observed regional specificity, this finding bears important clinical implications for potential treatment strategies.

21,Longitudinal trajectories of mood symptoms and global functioning in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder,"Background: Little is known about the longitudinal course of mood symptoms and functioning in youth who are at high risk for bipolar disorder (BD). Identifying distinct course trajectories and predictors of those trajectories may help refine treatment approaches. Methods: This study examined the longitudinal course of mood symptoms and functioning ratings in 126 youth at high risk for BD based on family history and early mood symptoms. Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial of family-focused therapy and followed longitudinally (mean 2.0 years, SD = 53.6 weeks). Results: Using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), we observed three mood trajectories. All youth started the study with active mood symptoms. Following the index mood episode, participants were classified as having a “significantly improving course” ( n = 41, 32.5% of sample), a “moderately symptomatic course” ( n = 21, 16.7%), or a “predominantly symptomatic course” ( n = 64, 50.8%) at follow-up. More severe depression, anxiety, and suicidality at the study's baseline were associated with a poorer course of illness. LCGA also revealed three trajectories of global functioning that closely corresponded to symptom trajectories; however, fewer youth exhibited functional recovery than exhibited symptomatic recovery. Limitations: Mood trajectories were assessed within the context of a treatment trial. Ratings of mood and functioning were based on retrospective recall. Conclusions: This study suggests considerable heterogeneity in the course trajectories of youth at high risk for BD, with a significant proportion (32.5%) showing long-term remission of symptoms. Treatments that enhance psychosocial functioning may be just as important as those that ameliorate symptoms in youth at risk for BD.

22,Mental disorders and subsequent suicide events in a representative community population,"Objective: This study examined the patterns of association between mental disorders and subsequent suicide in a community sample representative of the Canadian household population. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2002 linked to the Death Database 2000-2011 and the Hospitalization Database 1999/2000-2012/2013) (n=27,000). Mental disorders (past year major depressive episodes (MDE), bipolar disorders (BPD), anxiety disorders (AD), and substance dependence (SD)) and subsequent suicide events (deaths or hospitalizations for suicide attempts) were identified. Competing risk regression models were used to analyze the time-to-event data, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and educational attainment. Results: Past year mental disorders were diagnosed in 11.38% of the cohort and 0.41% had suicide events. An increased hazard of suicide events associated with MDE, SD and AD weakened over-time, but this was not observed for BPD. For example, the HR of suicide events for MDE was 6.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.65, 13.68) in the first 4 years, whereas, it was 2.03 (95% CI = 0.91, 4.53) after 4 years. Whereas, the HRs of suicide events for BPD were 16.95 (95% CI = 6.88, 41.75) and 15.81 (95% CI = 5.89, 42.45) before and after 4 years. Limitations: Diagnostic data are likely to underestimate the prevalence of suicide events. Conclusions: The risk of suicide events declined over time for MDE, SA and AD, but remained high for BPD. This may reflect improvement over time in MDE, SA and AD, but indicates that people living with BPD have a persistent elevated hazard of suicide events.

23,Family and couple integrated cognitive-behavioural therapy for adults with OCD: A meta-analysis,"Background: Integrating family into the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is standard in pediatric populations; however, in adult populations, patients are typically treated independent of their family. Yet, there is compelling evidence to suggest that family members exacerbate OCD symptoms, and thus there is a strong rationale for integrating family members into the treatment of adult OCD. The present meta-analysis examined whether family treatment is effective for OCD in adult populations as well as moderators of treatment outcome. Methods: Fifteen studies were reviewed (16 independent samples). Results: Family treatment for adult OCD was found to improve patient OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment. There was also improvement in patient and family-reported general relationship satisfaction, antagonism, accommodation, and family member's mental health. Individual treatment format and targeting family accommodation were especially beneficial for improving patient depression. Family members reported greater relational improvements than patients. Fewer patient treatment sessions were associated with greater improvement in antagonism, as was female gender. Fewer sessions for family members was associated with greater improvement in family member mental health. FIT outperformed controls with individual ERP on reduction of OCD and depression symptoms, accommodation, and improvement in functional impairment. Limitations: Limitations of the present review include a relatively small sample size, lenient study inclusion criteria, and the subjectivity of some moderator categories. Conclusions: Family-integrated treatment appears to be effective for adult OCD, related symptoms, and relationship factors. There is preliminary support that family-integrated treatments lead to better outcomes than individual treatment. Clinical recommendations are discussed.

24,Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Method: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). Limitations: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Conclusion: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.

25,The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures: Experience from 4000 participants,"Background: In February 2020 the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in Kuwait. Inevitably as many countries worldwide, the general public were negatively affected by the pandemic. Unemployment, uncertainty, distress, increasing deaths, lockdown measures all of which are potential burdens on mental health. Aim: To assess the impact of COVID19 outbreak on mental health in Kuwait, and to explore the potential influencing risk factors. Methods: We conducted an online questionnaire-based study in Kuwait between 25th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. Questions were based on demographics, lifestyle during outbreak, depression and anxiety assessment. Total PHQ9 and GAD7 scores were calculated for each responder. Results: We had 4132 responders. Most were females (69.31%), married (59.37%), between the age of 21-30 (23.84%) and non-smokers (81.46%). Only (7.96%) had a positive past psychiatric history, (32.04%) had a past history of a chronic medical disease. During the outbreak most of the responders lost their jobs (39.21%) and only (12.83%) were attending work regularly, only (6.82%) worked in the healthcare sector. 59.27% report increased social media use compared to before the lockdown. When asked about their daily time spent following COVID19-related news, most (37.8%) spend more than 2 hours and (7.74%) spend more than 4 hours. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was (30.13%) and the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was (25.28%). Limitations: In the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a burden on mental health. Psychological support and mental health awareness should be implemented and made accessible to all individuals during pandemics.

26,Efficacy of phase 1 of life goals programme on symptom reduction and mood stability for bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND: Life Goals Programme (LGP) was developed as a psychological intervention for bipolar disorder, with its structured 6-session psychoeducation phase (Phase 1) targeting understanding of the disorder, medication adherence, early warning signs, and coping with symptoms and triggers. The present study tested the efficacy of Phase 1 of the LGP on symptom recovery and moment-by-moment mood stability, as well as medication adherence and quality of life. METHODS: Adults with bipolar disorder were randomly allocated to the LGP condition (six weekly group sessions) or the waitlist condition (six weeks of standard care, followed by the same LGP intervention). Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 6-month follow up. Waitlist participants were additionally assessed at baseline. Assessment included a clinical interview (SCID, MADRS, YMRS, and HAM-A), self-reported questionnaires, and 6-day experience sampling assessment on a mobile device. RESULTS: 64 out-patients with bipolar disorder (44 Bipolar I and 20 Bipolar II subtypes) participated in this study. LGP was well received and attended. Following LGP, there were significant improvements in knowledge about illness and level of anxiety, which were of large effect sizes and sustained at 6-month follow-up. Experience sampling assessment revealed small but significant improvements in moment-by-moment mood stability. Improvement in medication adherence was significant at 6 months and was of a moderate-to-large effect size. Changes in anxiety and mood stability were significantly greater following LGP than standard care. LIMITATIONS: Our results warrant further testing against active control. CONCLUSIONS: There was a robust improvement in emotional regulation following the 6-week LGP.

27,Prevalence and factors associated with postpartum posttraumatic stress in a population-based maternity survey in england,"Background: Studies on prevalence and factors associated with postpartum posttraumatic stress (PTS) typically do not distinguish between PTS related to childbirth (PTS-C) and PTS related to other stressors (PTS-O). This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with PTS-C and PTS-O in postpartum women. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional population-based survey of 16,000 postpartum women, selected at random from birth registrations in England to receive a postal questionnaire, including the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 4,509 women. The median age was 32 years (IQR=29-36), 64% were married, 77% were UK-born, and 76% were White-British. Prevalence of PTS-C was 2.5% (95%CI:2.0-3.0) and prevalence of PTS-O was 6.8% (95%CI:6.0-7.8). Women with PTS-C were significantly more likely to report re-experiencing symptoms (Chi-Square=7.69,p&lt;0.01). Factors associated with PTS-C were: higher level of deprivation, not having a health professional to talk to about sensitive issues during pregnancy, and the baby being admitted for neonatal intensive care. Factors associated with PTS-O were: age ≤24 years, depression during pregnancy, and having a pregnancy affected by long-term health problems. Factors associated with both were: living without a partner, anxiety during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific health problems, and lower birth satisfaction. Conclusions: PTS during the postpartum period is relatively common and, for many women, unrelated to childbirth. Increased awareness among health professionals of prevalence, clinical characteristics and factors associated with postpartum PTS-C and PTS-O will aid the development of appropriate management protocols to identify and support women during the perinatal period.

28,An ecological momentary assessment study of the role of emotional dysregulation in co-occurring adhd and internalising symptoms in adulthood,"Previous ecological momentary assessment (EMA) research in children has suggested that emotional dysregulation problems are commonly associated with ADHD symptoms and may help explain their relatively strong co-occurrence with anxiety and depression (collectively referred to as ‘internalising problems’); however, this has yet to be replicated for adults. In this study, we used data from a n=260 longitudinal cohort and EMA study, to evaluate the hypothesis that emotional dysregulation mediates the association between ADHD symptoms and internalising problems in emerging adulthood. Emotional dysregulation was based on affect data collected in near real time and in ecological context over a 14-day period, providing a measure of emotional lability in the context of participants’ daily lives. Cross-sectional mediation was tested using structural equation modelling. Emotional lability significantly mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and internalising problems. Results suggest that interventions that address the emotional dysregulation aspects of ADHD are likely to be beneficial for preventing and managing secondary internalising symptoms.

29,The prevalence of suicidal behaviors and their mental risk factors among young adolescents in 46 low- and middle-income countries,"BACKGROUND: To describe the prevalence of suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, and attempt) and their associated factors in young adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: We used the latest data from the Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) for adolescents aged 12–15 years during 2009–2015. The weighted prevalence and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) of suicidal behaviors were calculated using a random-effects model. The factors associated with suicidal behaviors were examined using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 130,488 adolescents (48.13% boys) in 46 LMICs were included in the study. Across all countries, the pooled 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempt were 14.5%, 14.6%, and 12.7%, respectively. The highest prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempt were all in Africa (16.7%, 19.3% and 17.0%), and the lowest prevalence were all in South-East Asia (8.2%, 10.5% and 7.4%). The overall prevalence of three suicidal behaviors were higher in girls (all P &lt; 0.001). Suicidal ideation and planning were more common in the 14–15 age group than 12–13 age group (both P &lt; 0.001). The factors associated with suicidal behaviors were being female, older age, loneliness, anxiety, a lack of close friends, and having family supportive (all P &lt; 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The GSHS data were obtained from a self-report questionnaire and the participants included in the GSHS were adolescents in school. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of suicidal behaviors remains high among young adolescents in LMICs, especially in Africa. These countries should be intervention priorities.

30,How are you sleeping? Starting the conversation with fathers about their mental health in the early parenting years,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 10 fathers of infants experience symptoms of common mental health disorders, prompting calls for paternal postpartum screening. However, numerous obstacles exist to screening implementation. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary evidence for an alternative approach that starts with asking fathers about their sleep. METHODS: Using self-reported father data at 0 to 36 months postpartum (N=1204) from four Australian cohort studies, we assessed associations between responses to various single-item questions about sleep (good to poor), and scores on validated measures of mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). We conducted regressions, unadjusted and adjusted for father age, child age, household income, education, first or later child, and marital status, to test associations between sleep and each indicator of mental health. We then meta-analyzed effects and assessed interactions between sleep and each of the covariates. RESULTS: Consistent associations between fathers’ subjective poor sleep and depression, anxiety and stress were replicated across the four cohorts despite heterogeneity in the sleep questions. At the meta-analytic level, effects ranged from weak to moderate (0.25 to 0.37) and were robust to all adjustments. Interactions were only detected between family income and poor sleep, such that the association was stronger for high income fathers. LIMITATIONS: This study does not address the sensitivity or specificity of single-item sleep questions for assessing paternal mental health risk. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost, non-stigmatizing single question to postpartum fathers about their sleep may present a gateway opportunity to enquiring about mental health.

31,Using classification and regression tree modelling to investigate treatment response to a single low-dose ketamine infusion: Post hoc pooled analyses of randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials,"Background: Evidence suggests that clinical markers, such as comorbid anxiety, body weight, and others can assist in predicting response to low-dose ketamine infusion in treatment resistant depression patients. However, whether a composite of clinical markers may improve the predicted probability of response is uncertain. Methods: The current study investigated the results of our previous randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials in which 73 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) received a single ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg. Clinical characteristics at baseline, including depression severity, duration of the current episode, obesity, comorbidity of anxiety disorder, and current suicide risk, were assessed as potential predictors in a classification and regression tree model for treatment response to ketamine infusion. Results: The predicted probability of a composite of age at disease onset, depression severity, duration of current episode, and obesity/overweight was significantly greater (area under curve = .736, p = .001) than that of any one marker (all p &gt; .05). The most powerful predictors of treatment response to ketamine infusion were younger age at disease onset and obesity/overweight. The strongest predictors of treatment nonresponse were longer duration of the current episode and greater depression severity at baseline. Discussion: Depression severity, duration of the current episode, obesity, and age at disease onset may predict treatment response versus nonresponse to low-dose ketamine infusion. However, whether our predicted probability for a single infusion may be applied to repeated infusions would require further investigation.

32,Have I argued with my family this week?”: What questions do those with lived experience choose to monitor their bipolar disorder?,"BACKGROUND: Electronic self-report mood monitoring tools for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are rapidly emerging and predominately employ predefined symptom-based questions. Allowing individuals to additionally choose what they monitor in relation to their BD offers the unique opportunity to capture and gain a deeper insight into patient priorities in this context. METHODS: In addition to monitoring mood symptoms with two standardised self-rated questionnaires, 308 individuals with BD participating in the Bipolar Disorder Research Network True Colours electronic mood-monitoring tool for research chose to create and complete additional personalised questions. A content analysis approach was used to analyse the content of these questions. RESULTS: 35 categories were created based on the personalised questions with the most common being physical activity and exercise, anxiety and panic, sleep and coping/stress levels. The categories were grouped into six overarching themes 1) mental health; 2) behaviour and level of functioning; 3) physical wellbeing; 4) health behaviours; 5) active self-management; and, 6) interpersonal. LIMITATIONS: The average age of the sample was around 50 years meaning our findings may not be generalisable to younger individuals with BD. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of BD important to patients in relation to longitudinal monitoring extend well beyond mood symptoms, highlighting the limitations of solely relying on standardised questions/mood rating scales based on symptoms primarily used for diagnosis. Additional symptoms and aspects of life not necessarily useful diagnostically for BD may be more important for individuals themselves to monitor and have more meaning in capturing their own experience of changes in BD severity.

33,Measurement and correlates of irritability in clinically referred youth: Further examination of the affective reactivity index,"Background: Research on youth irritability has proliferated in recent years, largely facilitated by items from existing measures and by key new instruments like the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI). The present study extends this literature by investigating the psychometric properties of the parent- and youth-report ARI and the correlates of irritability in an independent, clinically referred sample. Method: Baseline assessment data were collected from 237 youths (ages 3-18; 36% female) and their parents, seen for outpatient therapy and/or assessment. We examined the ARI in terms of (1) its item, scale, and factor properties; (2) convergent/discriminant validity with internalizing, externalizing, and emotion regulation problems; (3) specificity of associations with reactive aggression, anger, dysregulation, and coping; and (4) robustness of associations after controlling for demographic variables (e.g., age, gender). Results: The ARI's internal consistency and unidimensional factor structure were acceptable or better, with some variation across items and informants. Irritability, as measured by parent- and youth-report, was associated with variables in the externalizing (inattention, hyperactivity, executive dysfunction, aggression), internalizing (anxiety, depression, suicidality), and emotion regulation domains. Associations with reactive aggression, anger, dysregulation, and coping problems were especially pronounced. Irritability's links with internalizing and externalizing problems remained robust after controlling for demographic covariates. Limitations: The sample was limited in diversity and moderate in size. Conclusions: Findings support the reliability and validity of the ARI for assessing parent- and youth-rated irritability among clinically referred youth. Future research is needed to understand variations in irritability's manifestations, measurement, and correlates across demographic groups.

34,Association between angiotensin receptor blockers and suicide: Nationwide population-based propensity score matching study,"Background: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to ameliorate anxiety and mood disorders in animal models. Cohort links between ARB use and suicide risk in humans require clarification. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients diagnosed as having hypertension according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (401–405) from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2012 were enrolled as the target population. We defined enrollees who had received ARB prescriptions for at least 28 days as ARB users. Those who had never taken ARB prior or during the study period were defined as ARB nonusers and were propensity score–matched with ARB users. The end outcome was confirmation of a suicide attempt. Results: After propensity score matching was conducted, 40,976 ARB users and 40,976 nonusers were selected as the matched cohorts. The overall incidence rate of suicide attempt was significantly lower in ARB users than in nonusers (0.51 vs. 1.07 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval = 0.26–0.87). A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test revealed a lower cumulative incidence of suicide attempt in ARB users than in nonusers ( p &lt; 0.001 for the unmatched cohort; p = 0.01 for the matched cohort). Conclusions: ARB use was not associated with an increased risk for suicide compared with non-ARB use.

35,Blunted neural effects of perceived control on reward feedback in major depressive disorder,"Background: Blunted reward processing has emerged as an endophenotype of major depressive disorder (MDD), but mechanistic understanding for this deficit remains elusive. The current event-related potential study examined whether this aberration is driven by the blunted effect of perceived control on reward processing. Methods: We adapted a well-validated gambling task in which perceived control was exercised by choice in 29 individuals with current MDD and 31 healthy controls. We examined the reward positivity in response to personally chosen versus passively received rewards. Results: We found that MDD patients relative to healthy controls exhibited a blunted reward positivity when rewards were delivered following voluntary choices but not when they were delivered following passive choices. This pattern was not observed during the relatively late stage, as indexed by the P300, of feedback processing. Limitation: The current findings may be confounded with medication and anxiety. Conclusions: These findings suggest that deficient reward processing in MDD is attributable to the deficiency in boosting reward responsivity by perceived control exercised by choice.

36,A randomised wait-list controlled pilot trial of one-session virtual reality exposure therapy for blood-injection-injury phobias,"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been recognized as an effective treatment for specific phobias and has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional in vivo exposure therapy (e.g., acceptability). No past research has evaluated the efficacy of VRET for the treatment of blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the acceptability and efficacy of a single-session VRET intervention for BII phobias. Participants who met DSM-5 criteria for BII phobia ( N = 43) were randomized to VRET or a waiting list control group, and completed self-report measures of BII severity (Medical Fear Survey [MFS] and Multidimensional Blood Phobia Inventory [MBPI]) and dental anxiety (Modified Dental Anxiety Scale), as well as clinician ratings of BII phobia severity and catastrophic cognitions at baseline, one-week post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. We found medium to large differences in catastrophic cognitions (probability [ g = 0.88] and cost [ g = 0.66] ratings), favouring VRET. We found moderate to large differences favouring VRET on the MBPI Injection and Injury fears subscales ( g's = 0.64–1.14) at one-week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, and on the MBPI Fainting subscale ( g = 0.84) and Injections subscale of the Medical Fear Survey ( g = 0.63) at follow-up. There were no other significant group differences. These findings provided some initial evidence to suggest that a single-session VRET may provide some improvements in fears of injections, injury, and fainting. While it may be a useful adjunct or interim step before in vivo exposure therapy, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for BII phobia.

37,Are Internet- and mobile-based interventions effective in adults with diagnosed panic disorder and/or agoraphobia? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: There is no meta-analysis that specifically evaluates the effectiveness of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) in adults with diagnosed panic disorder and/or agoraphobia (PD/A) so far. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap (PROSPERO CRD 42016034016). Methods: Systematic literature searches in six databases for randomised and controlled clinical trials investigating IMIs in adults, who met diagnostic criteria for PD/A. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses, pre-planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted when appropriate. Primary outcomes were PD and A symptom severity. In addition, adherence, response, remission, quality of life, anxiety and depression symptom severity were examined. Results: A total of 16 trials (1015 patients), with 21 comparisons (9 IMI vs. waitlist; 7 IMI vs. IMI; 5 IMI vs. active treatment condition), were included. IMIs revealed beneficial effects on panic (Hedges’ g range −2.61 to −0.25) and agoraphobia symptom severity when compared to waitlist (pooled g = −1.15, [95%-CI = −1.56; −0.74]). Studies comparing IMIs to active controls (i.e., face-to-face CBT and applied relaxation) did not find significant differences for reductions in panic ( g = −0.02, [95%-CI = −0.25; 0.21]) and agoraphobia symptom severity ( g = −0.10, [95%-CI = −0.39; 0.19]). Furthermore, IMIs were superior to waitlist controls regarding anxiety and depression symptom severity and quality of life. Limitations: Tests for publication bias were not feasible due to the limited number of trials per comparison, and the risk of bias assessment indicated some methodological shortcomings. Conclusions: Findings from this meta-analytic review provide support for the effectiveness of IMIs in patients with verified PD/A. However, before IMIs can be included in treatment guidelines for PD/A, future high quality research is needed that substantiates and extends the evidence base, especially in regard to intervention safety.

38,Network structures and temporal stability of self- and informant-rated affective symptoms in Alzheimer's disease,"Background: Affective symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be rated with both informant- and self-ratings. Information from these two modalities may not converge. We estimated network structures of affective symptoms in AD with both rating modalities and assessed the longitudinal stability of the networks. Methods: Network analyses combining self-rated and informant-rated affective symptoms were conducted in 3198 individuals with AD at two time points (mean follow-up 387 days), drawn from the NACC database. Self-rated symptoms were assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale, and informant-rated symptoms included depression, apathy and anxiety questions from Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Results: Informant-rated symptoms were mainly connected to symptoms expressing lack of positive affect, but not to the more central symptoms of self-rated worthlessness and helplessness. Networks did not differ in structure ( p = .71), or connectivity ( p = .92) between visits. Symptoms formed four clinically meaningful clusters of depressive symptoms and decline, lack of positive affect, informant-rated apathy and anxiety and informant-rated depression. Limitations: The symptom dynamics in our study could have been present before AD diagnosis. The lack of positive affect cluster may represent a methodological artefact rather than a theoretically meaningful subgroup. Requiring follow-up lead to a selection of patients with less cognitive decline. Conclusions: Informant rating may only capture the more visible affective symptoms, such as not being in good spirits, instead of more central and severe symptoms, such as hopelessness and worthlessness. Future research should continue to be mindful of differences between self- and informant-rated symptoms even in earlier stages of AD.

39,Assessment of near-term risk for suicide attempts using the Suicide Crisis Inventory,"Background: The Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) describes a pre-suicidal mental state marked by entrapment accompanied by affective disturbances, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal and social withdrawal. This study tested the consistency and validity of the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), a proposed measure of SCS severity, amongst a large, heterogeneous patient sample. Methods: The SCI was used to assess 867 adult psychiatric inpatients and outpatients. Confirmatory factor analysis, logistic regressions and area under the curve analyses (AUC) were used to examine internal structure, construct validity and predictive validity for suicide ideation, plan and attempt one-month post-assessment. Results: The five-factor model of the SCS demonstrated good fit and excellent internal consistency. SCI scores indicated significant associations but non-redundancy with depression, anxiety, and independence from other dimensions of psychiatric distress. SCI scores specifically predicted suicide attempts with an AUC of 0.733 and odds ratio = 8.62 ( p &lt; 0.001) at optimal cut-off point. SCI incremental predictive validity over and beyond suicidal ideation and attempts history reported at baseline was supported for predicting suicide attempts (β = 0.012, S.E = 0.006; p = 0.046). Limitations: The SCI is subject to self-report bias and does not include the SCS social withdrawal component. Follow-up assessment retention was partial (68%, n = 591). Conclusion: The SCI is validated as a tool for the assessment of the SCS intensity and of imminent suicidal behavior. The SCI is suggested as a tool that could aid both researchers and clinicians in comprehensive assessment of a pre-suicidal mental state within moderate to high-risk populations, regardless of self-report on suicidal intent.

40,Clinical correlates of DSM-5 mixed features in bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis,"Background: Systematic data on clinical correlates of mixed features in bipolar disorder are not available, so far. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the association between DSM-5 mixed features and candidate characteristics in depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. Methods: We included observational studies indexed in the main electronic databases. The association between DSM-5 mixed features and relevant correlates was estimated using odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Analyses were based on random effects models. Results: Eight studies were included, involving 3070 individuals (1495 with a major depressive episode and 1575 with hypo/manic episode). No clinical characteristics were associated with mixed features in subjects with a depressive episode. Among subjects with a manic/hypomanic episode, those with mixed features were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.42 to 3.94; I² = 39.7%), co-occurring anxiety disorders (OR: 2.67; 95%CI: 1.28 to 5.57; I² = 0%), and a rapid cycling course (OR = 4.23; 95%CI: 1.29 to 13.81; I² = 0%), with less severe manic symptoms (SMD = -0.40; 95%CI: -0.65 to -0.16; I2=0%). Limitations: (1) the heterogeneity of methods across studies and the inconsistency of findings; (2) the limited amount of data on correlates of DSM-5 mixed features; (3) the possible influence of publication bias. Conclusions: Findings of this meta-analysis show that mixed features among individuals with a manic/hypomanic episode may identify a special clinical population, characterized not only by depressive symptoms, but also by anxiety, rapid cycling, and suicidality.

41,Brain functional abnormalities in the amygdala subregions is associated with anxious depression,"Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have provided strong support for the critical role the amygdala plays in emotional processing. The amygdala is composed of three primary distinct nuclei that have different functions in emotional regulation. Anxious depression (AD) was considered as a common dimensional symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, the neuroimaging basis of this special MDD subtype remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to study the functional connectivity of the amygdala's subregions in AD patients. Methods: Eighty-three patients with AD, 70 non-anxious depression (NAD) patients, and 62 healthy controls were collected. Age and gender were well-matched. The functional connectivity of three amygdala subregions, including centromedial (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF), were compared among the AD, NAD, and HC groups. The correlation between functional connectivity in the amygdala subregions and the HAMD factor scores were further analyzed. Results: Patients with AD showed decreased functional connectivity between the right CM/LB and the right middle frontal gyrus relative to the NAD group. The NAD patients showed decreased functional connectivity between the right precentral gyrus and the right CM/SF compared to the HC group. The functional connectivity between the right CM and the right middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the anxiety/somatization factor. Conclusion: The functional connectivity between the right CM/LB and the right middle frontal gyrus might be the neurobiological mechanism of anxious depression. The FC between the right CM and the right middle frontal gyrus may help to explain the special clinical feature of the AD patients.

42,"Skin autofluorescence of advanced glycation end products and course of affective disorders in the lifelines cohort study, a prospective investigation","Background: Skin autofluorescence (SAF), indicating concentration of advanced glycation end products in the skin and oxidative stress, is cross-sectionally associated with affective disorders. Prospective studies of oxidative stress markers will help to clarify the pathophysiological role of oxidative stress. Methods: Data of a population-based cohort study were used. Presence of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia was assessed at baseline and at 5-year follow-up with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Associations between SAF at baseline and incidence and persistence/recurrence of affective disorders were assessed with logistic regression. Results: Of 43,267 participants with no disorder at baseline, 2885 (6.7%) developed an incident disorder during follow-up. In 1360 of 3648 participants (37.3%) with an affective disorder at baseline, a persisting/recurrent disorder was present at follow-up. A modest association existed between SAF and incident affective disorders (OR = 1.07 [95%CI 1.03–1.12], P &lt; .001), specifically major depressive disorder (OR = 1.11 [95%CI 1.04–1.19], P = .003); this association lost statistical significance after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Associations between SAF and persistence/recurrence were not significant. Limitations: Many confounders might also act as intermediate: extensive adjustment for confounders caused overfitting and possibly masked effects of SAF on course of affective disorders. Relatively small sample sizes for analyses of SAF and persistence/recurrence of affective disorders resulted in a low power. Conclusions: Increased SAF modestly raises the odds of incident affective disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, providing evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in subsequent occurrence of affective disorders. However, significance of effects faded after adjustment for socioeconomic status.

43,Predictors of emotional distress in people with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review of prospective studies,"Background: Emotional distress (defined as any negative mood state, including anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms and global distress) is common in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). To develop more integrated care for PwMS requires a better understanding of causal variables underlying persistent emotional distress. This systematic review critically appraised and synthesised the findings of prospective studies investigating predictors of emotional distress in PwMS. Method: CINAHL, Medline, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for: i) prospective cohort studies with ≥1-month follow-up period, which; ii) evaluated baseline clinical and demographic, social and/or psychosocial predictors of emotional distress; iii) presented results for adults with MS; and iv) used validated measures to assess emotional distress. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Thirteen studies, reported in 17 papers, were included. A wide range of outcome measures and statistical methods were used. The most reliable finding was that baseline emotional distress and stress-coping variables predicted emotional distress. Less robust support was found for income, negative cognitive illness appraisals and poor social support. No other variables often predicted emotional distress. Limitations: Lack of consistency across included studies may limit confidence in the results obtained. Conclusions: Little is currently known about how or why some people become and remain distressed following a diagnosis of MS, whilst others do not. However, psychological and social factors such as emotional distress and stress-coping variables appear to be important. A better understanding of the psychological factors underpinning distress in PwMS is needed.

44,Personality traits in adults with hoarding disorder,"Background: Prior research has demonstrated a link between compulsive hoarding symptoms and personality traits; however, no studies have investigated the link between hoarding and personality traits utilizing a sample of individuals diagnosed with hoarding disorder (HD) using formal diagnostic criteria. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the frequency and type of personality traits in adults diagnosed with HD and to explore the associations among hoarding severity and personality disorder traits within this sample. Methods: Seventy-two veterans enrolled in an ongoing treatment trial for HD completed a battery of self-report measures during their initial assessment. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the unique variance accounted for by hoarding severity in predicting scores on the personality disorder scales from the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III). Results: The majority of participants had an elevated score on at least one of the MCMI-III Personality scales. The most frequently elevated scores were for the Avoidant, Dependent, Depressive, and Schizoid scales. Hoarding severity was a significant predictor of personality traits in 10 out of 14 MCMI-III scales. Limitations: Given the exploratory nature of the investigation, we did not control for multiple comparisons or the presence of mood or anxiety disorders. Conclusions: The elevated prevalence of co-occurring personality pathology in adults with HD indicates the importance of considering underlying personality structure when developing individualized treatment plans.

45,"Prospective associations between bullying victimisation, internalised stigma, and mental health in South African adolescents living with HIV","Background: Adolescents living with HIV may be at elevated risk of psychological problems, which are correlated with negative health outcomes. In cross-sectional research with HIV-affected adolescents, bullying victimisation and internalised HIV stigma have been associated with poorer psychological health. We extended these findings and tested longitudinal associations between bullying victimisation, internalised stigma, and mental health among adolescents living with HIV. We also tested whether relationships between bullying victimisation and psychological symptoms were mediated by internalised stigma. Method: Adolescents living with HIV ( n = 1060, 10–19 years, 55% female), who had ever initiated HIV treatment in 53 public health facilities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, were interviewed and followed up 18 months later ( n = 995, 94% retention). Participants completed well-validated measures of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, bullying victimisation, and internalised stigma. Results: After adjusting for baseline mental health and sociodemographic characteristics, baseline internalised stigma prospectively predicted poorer outcomes on all psychological measures. Bullying victimisation at baseline was not directly associated with any psychological measures at follow up; however, it was indirectly associated with all psychological measures via internalised stigma. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures and poor reliability of the depression scale. Conclusions: Bullying victimisation is associated with internalised stigma, which in turn predicts psychological symptoms over time. Interventions reducing internalised stigma and associated psychological distress are needed, and these should be integrated into HIV care to ensure optimal HIV management. The implementation of bullying prevention programs may reduce internalised stigma and promote mental health among adolescents living with HIV.

46,Dynamic fluctuations of emotional states in adolescents with delayed sleep phase—A longitudinal network modeling approach,"Background: Very late sleep rhythms are risks for social adjustment problems in adolescence. Using ecological momentary assessment data, we quantified and visualized temporal and contemporaneous within-persons dynamical relations of sleepiness and emotions in adolescents with and without late sleep rhythms. Methods: We analyzed a temporal network via multilevel vector autoregression (mlVAR) modeling and a contemporaneous network through the partial associations between the residuals of temporal and the between-subject multilevel models. We tested whether these networks were different between those with a late circadian rhythm [concurrent delayed sleep phase (DSP) N = 172, 37% boys, 63% girls] and those without ( N = 143, 22% boys, 78% girls). Results: In adolescents without DSP, the temporal networks showed continuity only for low mood from the previous to the following time point. In adolescents with DSP, there were more predictable patterns of emotions. Feelings of depression led to a decrease of positive emotions and increase of irritation and anxiety. The contemporaneous networks showed clusters of positive and negative emotions in both groups and sleepiness decreased the experience of positive emotions concurrently. Limitations: DSP in our current study was based only on one out of three diagnostic criteria of the full disorder (DSM-5) and it was assessed only once. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the dynamic organization of emotions and sleepiness is different in adolescents with and without DSP. DSP adolescents have more predictable and maladaptive emotional patterns during the day. Results provide new insight about why individuals with DSP are at a heightened risk for decreased emotional adjustment.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. Results: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (β = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (β = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (β = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.

The authors wish to acknowledge an additional affiliated institution for Dr Samantha Hartley: Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Old Street, Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.] Background: Bisexual people have been found to be at increased risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) when compared to heterosexual and gay or lesbian people. The purpose of this review was to update the estimated risk of NSSI for bisexual people and to examine variables that have been associated with NSSI in this population. Methods: The protocol for this paper was pre-registered (CRD42019145299). An electronic search of PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, PubMed, Ovid Online and Web of Science was undertaken from earliest available date to October 2019. Twenty-four eligible papers were identified. Meta-analyses, including moderator analysis, were conducted to ascertain NSSI risk and a narrative synthesis was undertaken of predictors and correlates. All studies were assessed for risk of bias. Results: Bisexual people had up to six times the odds of engaging in NSSI compared to other sexualities. Mental health variables of anxiety and depression symptoms were found to be most commonly associated with NSSI for this population. The majority of studies had moderate risk of bias. This review demonstrates that bisexual people have an elevated risk of engaging in NSSI. Increased incidence of anxiety and depression and exposure to negative life events may explain this increased risk. Limitations: Studies were found to be consistently cross-sectional in design and limited to western cultures. A limitation of this review was that only English language papers were included. Conclusions: Results are clinically relevant as they suggest early identification and prevention of NSSI can be achieved. Future research should examine bisexual people independently of others.

49,Eating disorder symptoms and core eating disorder fears decrease during online imaginal exposure therapy for eating disorders,"Background: Few evidence-based treatments for eating disorders (EDs) exist. Imaginal exposure therapy is a key component of effective treatment for anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, imaginal exposure has not been systematically tested as a treatment for EDs. The current study aimed to develop and test online imaginal exposure as a treatment for EDs. Methods: The current study tested a four-week trial of online imaginal exposure for EDs ( N = 229 participants with EDs recruited globally). Participants completed diagnostic interviews and four sessions of weekly online imaginal exposure, in which they wrote about and imagined a core ED fear (identified with a therapist). Participants completed measures of ED symptoms and fears (i.e., fear of weight gain, food) at pre-imaginal exposure, post-imaginal exposure, and six-month follow-up. Participants were recruited and participated in the protocol from November 2016 to October 2018. Results: All primary outcomes (ED symptoms, ED fears) significantly decreased at study completion and six-month follow-up with medium-to-large effect sizes. State anxiety across the exposure and follow-ups significantly decreased, specifically from initial sessions to follow-up. Worry, but not depression, significantly decreased. Limitations: This study was an open case trial and did not include a control condition. Conclusions: Significant decreases in ED symptoms and fears occurred during the course of imaginal exposure treatment. Online imaginal exposure is a feasible treatment for EDs and is associated with decreases in core ED symptomatology, which are comparable in magnitude to decreases seen from other evidence-based treatments. A future randomized-controlled trial is needed. Clinical trials registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03712748.

50,Data mining algorithm predicts a range of adverse outcomes in major depression,"Background: Course of illness in major depression (MD) is highly varied, which might lead to both under- and overtreatment if clinicians adhere to a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Novel opportunities in data mining could lead to prediction models that can assist clinicians in treatment decisions tailored to the individual patient. This study assesses the performance of a previously developed data mining algorithm to predict future episodes of MD based on clinical information in new data. Methods: We applied a prediction model utilizing baseline clinical characteristics in subjects who reported lifetime MD to two independent test samples (total n = 4226). We assessed the model's performance to predict future episodes of MD, anxiety disorders, and disability during follow-up (1–9 years after baseline). In addition, we compared its prediction performance with well-known risk factors for a severe course of illness. Results: Our model consistently predicted future episodes of MD in both test samples (AUC 0.68–0.73, modest prediction). Equally accurately, it predicted episodes of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and disability (AUC 0.65–0.78). Our model predicted these outcomes more accurately than risk factors for a severe course of illness such as family history of MD and lifetime traumas. Limitations: Prediction accuracy might be different for specific subgroups, such as hospitalized patients or patients with a different cultural background. Conclusions: Our prediction model consistently predicted a range of adverse outcomes in MD across two independent test samples derived from studies in different subpopulations, countries, using different measurement procedures. This replication study holds promise for application in clinical practice.

51,Fear acquisition and extinction in elderly patients with depression,"Background: Depression in elderly patients is common and characterized by anxiety symptoms and cognitive impairment. To our knowledge, no studies have yet investigated the process of fear extinction in these patients. We investigated fear extinction with a paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition and extinction. Methods: We included three age matched (mean age: 75.7 years) groups: Late Life Depression (LLD, n = 33), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 39), healthy controls (HC, n = 39). All participants were diagnosed with a standardized procedure including clinical examination, CERAD cognitive test battery, as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm consisting of habituation, acquisition, and extinction. During acquisition, a neutral face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an electrical unconditioned stimulus, whereas another face (safety stimulus, CS-) was unpaired. Conditioned responses were measured by US-expectancy and valence ratings. Results: Compared to HC, both patient groups showed a significantly lower, differential (CS+ vs. CS-) fear acquisition across all measurements. Patients with cognitive impairment showed a significantly slower extinction, which is characterized by higher US-expectancy and reduced positive valence for CS+. Fear extinction was significantly less differential (CS+ vs. CS-) in patients with LLD. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design we cannot distinguish whether the observed differences in fear extinction are state or trait markers in the LLD patients. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that fear extinction is impaired in elderly patients with depression. These results can have influence on treatment strategies.

52,An acute manic episode during 2019-nCov quarantine,"Background: The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation: A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion: Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.

53,The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing,"Background: There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method: An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results: 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers ( P &lt; 0.05). Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion: There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected.

54,Emotional “inflection point” in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China,"Background: The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results: In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion: This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.

55,Insight into the psychological problems on the epidemic of COVID-19 in China by online searching behaviors,"The letter presents a study on the psychological problems due to epidemic of COVID-19 in China. Authors tried to explore the potential psychological problems among the public in Wuhan city and the whole country of China, by using their online searching behaviors. According to the 2019 Chinese search engine user behavior study report released by China Internet Network Information Center Reports, there are 695 million searching engine users in China as of June 2019. Data on online searching behaviors indicated that the public were more likely to develop anxiety symptoms as panic and fear than depressive symptoms and insomnia in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic. With prevailed online services and well-developed network, we suggest that it is imperative to build network-based systems throughout the country which include active monitoring, early warning and intervention of potential psychological problems, to better serve the public, especially during public health-related emergencies. There were limitations in this study as we only discussed the short-term psychological impact of the epidemic among the public but the long-term psychological involvement will depend on the control of COVID-19. Again, we only offered insight on the “potential psychological problems” through keyword searching behaviors, rather than “disease diagnosis”. Hence, extrapolation of the conclusion needed to be cautious. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Letter",2020
56,Effectiveness of an alternative intervention in the treatment of depressive symptoms,"Background: There is a scarcity of studies in the international literature regarding alternative treatment to the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention in the face of depression symptoms. This study aimed to test a protocol based on natural therapy, alternatives to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic, through Mindfulness Meditation, Reiki, Acupuncture and Auriculotherapy, to treat the symptoms of depression for those who were with no pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatment for these symptoms. Methods: this is a randomized single-blind controlled pilot study. The final sample was 21 participants divided in two groups: experimental and control. Participants were evaluated by validated instruments during the screening process and after the intervention. The instruments were: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Intervention was performed in eight sessions, during two months. All the techniques were used in the experimental group. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to compare pre-intervention to post-intervention moments. Results: the result of analysis indicates a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression after the intervention among the experimental group. Limitations: there is no way to determine which of the techniques used produced the most significant result. Conclusions: The protocol proposed in this study was effective in reducing the symptoms of depression to whom are not eligible for traditional treatment.

57,"Reaching reliable change using short, daily, cognitive training exercises delivered on a mobile application: The case of Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) symptoms and cognitions in a subclinical cohort","Background: Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) is a presentation of OCD centering on interpersonal relationships. The aim of this Randomized Control Trial (RCT) was to assess the efficacy of short, game like, daily cognitive interventions delivered via mobile application in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated phenomena. Methods: Fifty university students identified as having subclinical levels of ROCD symptoms (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinical Version) were randomized into: immediate-use group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed-use group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the evaluated cognitive-behavioral training application at baseline for 15 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group commenced using the application at T1 for 15 days (T1 to T2). All participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 15 days from baseline (T1), and 30 days from baseline (T2). Results: Repeated measure MANOVAs showed significant Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interactions. These interactions indicated greater decrease in ROCD symptoms, OCD beliefs and social anxiety symptoms, as well as a greater increase in self-esteem in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1. Moreover, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) indicated reliable change on ROCD symptoms for a significant portion of participants (42–52%). Limitations: Sample size and the use of self-report measures limits the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Short, daily cognitive training interventions delivered via mobile applications may be useful in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated features. Further testing is needed for clinical populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article",2020
58,The role of psychiatric symptoms and environmental vulnerability factors in explaining the relationship between child maltreatment and suicidality: A prospective investigation,"Background: Childhood maltreatment has been associated with suicide thoughts and attempts; however, few longitudinal studies have assessed risk of suicidality into adulthood. Fewer have examined potential mediators (psychiatric symptoms and environmental vulnerability factors). Methods: Prospective cohort design. Children with documented cases of maltreatment ( N = 495, ages 0–11) were matched with non-maltreated children ( N = 395) and followed up into adulthood. Psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, dysthymia, post-traumatic stress,antisocial personality,and substance use) and environmental vulnerability (social isolation, physical disability/illness, and homelessness) were assessed at mean age 29 and suicide thoughts and attempts at 39. Structural equation models tested for mediation, controlling for age, sex, race, and IQ. Results: Childhood maltreatment predicted suicide attempts (Beta = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001), but not suicide thoughts only.Individuals with only suicide thoughts differed significantly from those with suicide attempts in psychiatric symptoms, physical disability/ illness, and homelessness. There were significant paths from child maltreatment to suicide attempts through psychiatric symptoms (0.18, p &lt; 0.001), ASPD (0.13, p &lt; 0.001), substance use (0.07, p &lt; 0.01), and homelessness (0.10, p &lt; 0.05). Limitations: Court cases of child maltreatment may not generalize to middle- or upper- class and non-reported cases.Effect sizes were small but significant. Conclusions: Psychiatric risk factors for suicide are well recognized. These new results provide strong evidence that environmental vulnerability factors, particularly homelessness, are associated with increased risk for suicide attempts and warrant attention.Although many people report suicide thoughts, maltreated children with more psychiatric symptoms and experience homelessness are more likely to attempt suicide and warrant targeted interventions.

59,"Characteristics associated with later self-harm hospitalization and/or suicide: A follow-up study of the HUNT-2 cohort, Norway","Background: To improve suicide and self-harm prevention in adults, better knowledge on preexisting characteristics and risk factors is of great importance. Methods: This is a population-based case-control study; baseline measures were collected in the second wave of the North-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT-2, 1995–1997) in Norway, and outcomes were observed for up to 19 years. Average follow up time was 4.9 years for self-harm and 6.8 years for suicides. Out of 93,898 eligible adult inhabitants aged 20 and above, a total of 65,229 (70%) participated in the study. The data were linked to the National Mortality Registry and hospital patient records in the three hospitals covering the HUNT-2 catchment area. Results: Among the participants, 332 patients (68% women) were hospitalized because of self-harm (HSH), and 91 patients (32% women) were died by suicide (SU). A total of 10% of those who died by SU had previously been HSH. People in the HSH and SU groups were younger, reported more depression and anxiety symptoms, sleeping problems, higher use of alcohol and tobacco, poorer social network and more economic problems, compared to the rest of the HUNT-2 population. In addition, the HSH group reported more somatic health problems, higher use of health services, higher sick leave, and lower work participation than the SU group. Limitations: Younger adults (20–40 years) were under-represented in HUNT-2. Younger adults (20–40 years) were constituted 31.7% in HUNT-2, 50% in HSH and 33% in SU. Further, we did not identify less severe self-harm, not requiring hospitalization. Life changes, adverse events, and other possible triggers to self-harming behavior were not recorded. Conclusion: Psychological problems were long-term predictors of both HSH and SU. Somatic health problems and lower functional performance were more present in HSH-group compared to the SU-group.

60,Trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms from early pregnancy to six weeks postpartum and their risk factors—A longitudinal study,"Background: Few studies explored trajectories of depressive symptoms from early pregnancy and covered the whole perinatal period. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms, their heterogeneity of onsets and peaks, and relations to demographic and psychological factors. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted at two hospitals in China amongst 1,126 participants. Perinatal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Demographic and psychological factors were collected by self-developed questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Women completing at least three depression screens (n = 879) were included. Latent Growth Curve Model and Growth Mixture Model were performed to identify the depression trajectories and logistic regression was used to analyse factors of trajectories. Results: Three trajectories were identified: 90.0% of women never presented with depressive symptoms (“Low-throughout”); 5.1% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the antenatal period (“Antenatal-high”); 4.9% presented with depressive symptoms mainly during the postpartum period (“Postpartum-high”). 52.4% of women experienced their first depressive symptoms during early pregnancy. Suffering from anxiety and being unsatisfied with their marriage were associated with the “Antenatal-high” and “Postpartum-high” trajectories, respectively. Limitations: Response rate was not high. We also do not have information on clinical diagnoses or changes in some variables over time. Conclusions: We identified three trajectories and heterogeneity existed concerning the timing of their peaks. Women should be considered for depression screening and intervention in early pregnancy. Factors associated with each trajectory were different, raising the potential of individualized intervention to reduce the occurrence of depression.

61,The feasibility of acupuncture as an adjunct intervention for antenatal depression: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"Background: Antenatal depression is common and associated with adverse consequences for mothers, babies, and future generations. Limitations with conventional approaches has resulted in additional therapies being considered. This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of acupuncture for improving mental health. Methods: Fifty-seven pregnant women with depressive symptomologies were randomised to acupuncture (n = 19) plus treatment as usual (TAU), progressive muscle relaxation (PMR, n = 19) plus TAU or TAU (n = 19). Treatments were conducted from 24 to 31 weeks gestation. Clinical assessments were performed throughout the intervention, as well as at a six-week postnatal follow-up. The primary outcome measure was depression. Secondary outcome measurements were stress, anxiety, psychological distress, quality of life and adjustment to mothering. Intention to treat (ITT), Linear Mixed Model (LMM) repeated measures and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. Results: At end-of-intervention there were significantly lower depression scores in the acupuncture group versus TAU and PMR respectively [ITT p &lt; 0.001, mean difference (MD) -5.84 (95% CI -9.10 to -2.58); MD -3.42 (95% CI -6.64 to -0.20)]. LMM repeated measures analysis (including postnatal follow-up) also demonstrated significantly lowered acupuncture group scores for stress (p=0.006) and psychological distress (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to PMR and TAU. Between group differences were not significant at six-weeks postnatal. No adverse events were reported. Limitations: Main limitations are small sample size and the use of self-reported outcome measures. Conclusion: Prenatal acupuncture reduced depression, stress and distress, whilst also being well-tolerated and free from adverse events. Further research is warranted.

62,Impact of coronavirus syndromes on physical and mental health of health care workers: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of developing physical/mental health outcomes related to coronavirus syndromes. Nature and frequency of these outcomes are undetermined. Methods: PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant (PROSPERO-CRD42020180205) systematic review of Web of Science/grey literature until 15th April 2020, to identify studies reporting physical/mental health outcomes in HCW infected/exposed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS-, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -MERS-, Novel coronavirus -COVID-19-. Proportion random effect meta-analyses, I 2 statistic, quality assessment and sensitivity analysis. Results: 115 articles were included (n = 60,458 HCW, age 36.1±7.1, 77.1% female). Physical health outcomes: 75.9% HCW infected by SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported fever (95%CI = 65.9–83.7%, k = 12, n = 949), 47.9% cough (95%CI=39.2–56.8%, k = 14, n = 970), 43.6% myalgias (95%CI=31.9–56.0%, k = 13, n=898), 42.3% chills (95%CI = 20.2–67.9%, k = 7, n = 716), 41.2% fatigue (95%CI = 18.2–68.8%, k = 6, n = 386), 34.6% headaches (95%CI = 23.1–48.2%, k = 11, n = 893), 31.2% dyspnoea (95%CI = 23.2–40.5%, k = 12, n = 1003), 25.3% sore throat (95%CI=18.8–33.2%, k = 8, n = 747), 22.2% nausea/vomiting (95%CI = 14.9–31.8%, k = 6, n = 662), 18.8% diarrhoea (95%CI = 11.9–28.4%, k = 9, n = 824). Mental health outcomes: 62.5% HCW exposed to SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported general health concerns (95%CI = 57.0–67,8%, k = 2, n = 2254), 43.7% fear (95%CI=33.9–54.0%, k = 4, n = 584), 37.9% insomnia (95%CI = 30.9–45.5%, k = 6, n = 5067), 37.8% psychological distress (95%CI = 28.4–48.2%, k = 15, n = 24,346), 34.4% burnout (95%CI = 19.3–53.5%, k = 3, n = 1337), 29.0% anxiety features (95%CI=14.2–50.3%, k = 6, n = 9191), 26.3% depressive symptoms (95%CI = 12.5–47.1%, k = 8, n = 9893), 20.7% post-traumatic stress disorder features (95%CI = 13.2–31%, k = 11, n = 3826), 16.1% somatisation (95%CI=0.2–96.0%, k = 2, n = 2184), 14.0% stigmatisation feelings (95%CI = 6.4–28.1%, k = 2, n = 411).

63,The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study,"Background and objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI = 1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.

64,Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic functional connectivity alterations in major depressive disorder,"Background: The cerebellum plays an important role in the neural mechanism of depression and its static functional connectivity (FC) with the cerebrum is disrupted in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC alterations in MDD remain largely unknown. Methods: 50 patients with MDD and 36 well-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC analyses were performed using the cerebellar seeds previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Inter-group differences in the cerebellar dynamic FC and their associations with clinical and cognitive variables were examined. Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had decreased cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the executive, default-mode and affective-limbic networks. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregion connecting with the affective-limbic network was related to severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in MDD patients. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the default-mode and affective-limbic networks were related to sustained attention and prospective memory in controls, while the correlations were inverse or non-significant in patients. Limitations: The fairly modest sample size and potential medication effect may increase the instability of the results. Conclusions: Our findings provide further evidence for the pivotal role of the cerebellum in the neuropathology of depression, pointing to potential targets of cerebellar-cerebral pathways for alternative intervention or monitoring therapeutic responses.

65,Association between skin autofluorescence of advanced glycation end products and affective disorders in the lifelines cohort study,"Background: Oxidative stress may be a mechanistic link between affective disorders (depressive and anxiety disorders) and somatic disease. Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. Methods: Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. Results: Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18–91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR = 1.09 [95%CI 1.07–1.12], P &lt; .001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR = 1.31 [95%CI 1.25–1.36], P&lt;.001 in the crude model; OR = 1.12 [95%CI 1.07–1.17], P &lt; .001 in the fully adjusted model). For other disorders, associations lost significance after adjustment for cardiometabolic parameters and somatic morbidities. Limitations: Persons of non-Western descent and severely (mentally or physically) ill individuals were underrepresented. Conclusions: SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders, suggesting a link between these disorders and cumulative oxidative stress. For major depressive disorder, this association was strongest and independent of sociodemographic, cardiometabolic factors, and somatic morbidities.

66,"Effects of circulating vitamin D concentrations on emotion, behavior and attention: A cross-sectional study in preschool children with follow-up behavior experiments in juvenile mice","Background: Although few studies show that vitamin D (VitD) deficiency has a negative effect on children's emotion and behavior, the effects of the excessive VitD and the appropriate 25(OH)D concentration have never been reported. We investigated the effect of the deficient and excessive VitD on emotion, behavior and attention. Methods: 351 preschool children in a multicenter study in Shanghai, China that had serum 25(OH)D measurements and emotion, behavior and attention measures were included in the analyses. In animal experiments, C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control (C) group, VitD deficiency (VDD) group, and VitD overdose (VDO) group. The emotion, behavior and attention of juvenile mice were evaluated through the behavioral experiments. Results: There was an “U"" relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and emotion, behavior and attention. Compared with 20–40 ng/mL group, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.5 (1.0, 4.8) for emotional problem, 3.8 (1.2, 12.1) for conduct problem and 1.8 (1.1, 5.7) for inattention in &lt;20 ng/mL group. Meanwhile, compared with 20–40 ng/mL group, ORs were 9.5 (2.9, 31.4) for impulsive hyperactivity, and 3.9 (1.2, 12.9) for conduct problem in &gt;40 ng/mL group. Consistent with the results in children, animal experiments showed that the attention level decreased in VDD group, while the anxiety level, hyperactive level and aggressiveness in VDD group and VDO group were significantly increased, respectively. Limitations: 25(OH)D measurements were only available in one season. Conclusion: The deficient and excessive VitD status both adversely affected children's emotion, behavior and attention.

67,Negative memory bias as a transdiagnostic cognitive marker for depression symptom severity,"Background: Negative memory bias is a strong risk factor for the development and maintenance of depression. Recent evidence also found negative memory bias in other mental disorders. Here, we aim to: 1) assess the presence and strength of negative memory bias in a range of (comorbid) mental disorders, 2) investigate which disorder-specific symptoms are associated with negative memory bias, and 3) test whether negative memory bias might be a transdiagnostic mechanism. Methods: Negative memory bias was measured in patients with at least one diagnosis of a stress-related disorder ( n = 86), a neurodevelopmental disorder ( n = 53), or both ( n = 68), and 51 controls. Depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder symptom severity was assessed using questionnaires. Groups were compared on negative memory bias and the associations between negative memory bias and symptom severity were made using linear regression models. Results: All patient groups showed stronger negative memory bias than the controls. Negative memory bias was individually associated with all symptom severity indices, but when added into a single model, only the association with depressive symptom severity remained. This persisted after controlling for diagnostic group. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional sectional study design, we could only look at the associations between negative memory bias and disorder-specific symptoms and not at the direction of the effects. Conclusions: Negative memory bias is characteristic of a depressotypic processing style and present in different mental disorders. It might play a mechanistic role in the development of (subclinical) co-occurrence between mental disorders.

68,Exploring and assessing demoralization in patients with non-psychotic affective disorders,"Background: Demoralization, as assessed through the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research–Demoralization (DCPR/D) interview or the Demoralization Scale (DS), has been found to affect about 30% of patients with medical disorders, while few studies have been done in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: A convenience sample of 377 patients with ICD-10 diagnoses of mood, anxiety, stress-related disorders or other non-psychotic disorders was recruited from two Italian university psychiatry centers. The DCPR/D interview and the Italian version of the DS (DS-IT) were used to assess demoralization and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression. Results: Demoralization was diagnosable in more than 50% of the patients. Factor analysis of the DS-IT indicated four main factors, Meaninglessness/Helplessness, Disheartenment, Dysphoria and Sense of Failure, explaining 62% of the variance of the scale. Patients with bipolar or unipolar major depression and personality disorders had the highest prevalence of demoralization (DCPR/D) and the highest scores on all the DS-IT factors in comparison with patients with adjustment or anxiety disorders. About 50% of patients with moderate demoralization (DS-IT) were not clinically depressed (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), while almost all with severe demoralization were depressed. Limitations: Prospective studies on larger samples with other psychiatric disorders, also taking into account subjective incompetence, are needed. Since the DCPR/D assesses demoralization as a categorical construct, a dimensional framework should be necessary. Conclusions: The findings enrich the research on demoralization, showing for the first time the importance of this construct, as measured by the DCPR/D and the DS-IT, in patients with psychiatric disorders.

Methods: Data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analysed. Mental (i.e., depression, chronic anxiety, other psychiatric disorders) and oral health (i.e., dental caries, dental extraction, dental filling, gingival bleeding, tooth movement, dental material, missing tooth) were evaluated. Control variables included sex, age, marital status, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical multimorbidity. Associations between psychiatric conditions (independent variables) and the number of poor oral health outcomes (dependent variable) were assessed using Poisson regression models. The associations were investigated in the overall population, in married participants and in those who were single/widowed/divorced/separated. Results: There were 23,089 participants [54.1% women; mean (standard deviation) age 53.4 (18.9) years]. The prevalence of at least one psychiatric condition was 15.4% in the overall sample, while the mean (standard deviation) number of poor oral health outcomes was 2.9 (1.4). There was a positive association between any psychiatric condition and the number of poor oral health outcomes [incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.12], and there was a significant interaction between any psychiatric condition and marital status. The association was stronger in those participants who were single/widowed/divorced/separated. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Oral and mental health were assessed with Yes/No questions. Exposure, outcome and covariates were self-reported. Conclusions: Those with poor mental health have worse oral health but being married has some protective benefits.

70,Use of ketamine to treat depression may increase the risk of relapse into drinking in abstinent alcoholics,"The letter presents a case report of a 59-year-old woman with severe treatment resistant depression (TRD), posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was in 12-year remission from alcohol dependence syndrome. She underwent 9 ketamine infusions across 50 days for TRD associated with anxiety and suicidal ideation; the dose increased in steps from 35 mg infused across 50 min to 90 mg infused across 60 min. Whereas she did not find the ketamine infusions pleasurable, she experienced 3 incidents of alcohol craving, triggered by environmental alcohol cues, between her third and eighth infusions. Three days after her eighth ketamine infusion, she consumed alcohol. She stated that oral ketamine gave her a “buzz”, similar to an “acid trip” with mild euphoria. She reported that discussions about her ketamine experiences triggered further alcohol cravings. She also reported that ketamine “triggered something” towards alcohol craving and use, which had been dormant for 12 years. Clinical trials of ketamine for depression generally exclude from recruitment patients with recent history of substance use disorders, and there is no examination of the effect of ketamine on issues related to craving and substance use in recruited, long-abstinent alcohol users. This is therefore an area that requires careful attention and documentation in clinical practice and in future research.

71,Chronic retinoic acid treatment induces affective disorders by impairing the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus,"Background: More and more people are suffering from depression in modern society. It is believed that the development of depression results from alterations in synaptic transmission, especially in the hippocampus. Animal experiments and clinical studies have demonstrated that retinoids are essential components in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and they have a close relationship with depression. However, it is still unclear how excessive retinoic acid (RA) causes depression and what synaptic and molecular mechanisms underlie it. Methods: Behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular approaches were employed to characterize the effects of RA on depression and synaptic plasticity. RA was continuously administered intracerebroventricularly through an osmotic pump. Results: RA treatment induced depression-like behaviors, as evidenced by decreased sucrose preference and increased immobile duration in both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. RA administration also induced anxiety-like behaviors, indicated by decreased duration in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central of the open field. RA treatment decreased the neuronal excitability of the hippocampus either by changing the excitatory/inhibitory receptor balance or by promoting the synthesis of inhibitory neurotransmitters. Moreover, long-term potentiation was decreased in both the excitatory postsynaptic potential and the population spike in RA-treated rats, presumably a consequence of the reduced glur1 transcript level. Limitations: The mechanism of how excess RA affects the hippocampal gene expression and synaptic plasticity requires further study. Conclusions: RA treatment can induce depression-like behavior in rats and impair hippocampal plasticity. Thus, improving synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus may ameliorate the affective disorders caused by excessive RA.

72,Birth with synthetic oxytocin and risk of childhood emotional disorders: A Danish population-based study,"Background: Concerns have been raised that synthetic oxytocin, a widely used obstetric tool for labor induction and augmentation, may have deleterious effects on the neuropsychological development of children. Few studies have examined the relationship between oxytocin-stimulated labor and emotional disorders. Methods: We conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study including 677,629 singletons born in Denmark in the years 2000 to 2012 and followed through 2016 (median age = 10.6 years). Data on oxytocin-stimulation were obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register. Cases of emotional disorders—anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood or traumatic stress disorders or a redeemed prescription for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor—were identified using Danish patient and prescription registries. Results: Oxytocin was used to stimulate 31% of births, and oxytocin-stimulated labor was not associated with childhood emotional disorders (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11) after adjustment for maternal history of psychopathology, antidepressants during pregnancy, cohabitation status, highest educational attainment, smoking status during pregnancy, birth year, and indications for labor stimulation. The crude cox model was also small and close to unity (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03, 1.15). Limitations: About 50% of our population had reached the age of 10 years, but the outcome included disorders with later average debut ages. Oxytocin dosage levels are not recorded in the registers. Conclusions: Our small effect size estimates suggest that perinatal synthetic oxytocin does not contribute to the development of emotional disorders. Current evidence does not warrant revision of guidelines for the use of oxytocin in obstetrics.

73,"The effectiveness of modified, group-based CBT for dementia worry among Chinese elders","Objectives: Dementias are highly prevalent among Chinese elders. This study examined the effectiveness of a modified group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on dementia worry among Chinese older adults. Methods: Eighty-two older adults recruited from four elder group homes were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group. The intervention group (n = 44) received eight weekly 60-minute face-to-face CBT, while the control group (n = 38) received treatment-as-usual. Results: Outcomes indicated that the modified group CBT has significantly reduced dementia worry and culturally biased beliefs about dementia ( p &lt; .001). Study findings supported both statistically and clinically significant effect of modified group CBT on dementia worry [ g = -1.52, 95% CI (-2.01, -1.03)] and biased beliefs about dementia [ g = -.95, 95% CI (-1.40, -.49)]. Discussion: The culturally adapted CBT is promising in alleviating worries and anxiety over dementia among Chinese older adults.

74,Predictors of cognitive impairment in treatment-resistant depression,"Background: Cognitive impairment is a well-recognized symptom of major depressive disorder; however, contributing factors are not fully characterized. The present study examined the neurocognitive profiles and predictors of cognitive impairment in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: Moderate to severely depressed TRD patients were compared to matched healthy volunteers (HV) in verbal learning and recall and executive functions. Based on cognitive scores, cluster analysis was performed to identify subsets within the TRD sample. Predictors of cognitive impairment were also investigated. Results: TRD patients showed worse performance in tests assessing verbal memory, executive attentional shifting, and inhibitory control. The cluster analysis revealed two groups: a cognitively impaired (CI) group that showed a generalized deficit across cognitive domains, and a relatively cognitively intact group that performed better than CI in all domains except attentional shifting. A logistic binomial regression of the two groups revealed three significant contributing risk factors for CI: 1) older age, 2) lower premorbid IQ, and 3) benzodiazepine use. Cognitive impairment and benzodiazepine use were associated with worse functioning. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment is present in TRD and is associated with worse functioning. Age, lower premorbid IQ, and benzodiazepine use increased the likelihood of generalized cognitive impairment in TRD patients. The detrimental effect of benzodiazepine on cognitive impairment is independent of anxiety symptoms. Further research is needed to characterize the timeline of cognitive impairment in depression.

75,A mixed methods exploration of electrical stimulation in veterans with fibromyalgia symptoms &amp;amp; affective disorders,"Introduction: Past research has shown that electrical stimulation has modest beneficial effects on symptoms of fibromyalgia, which is also commonly associated with anxiety and depression. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness and utilization of electrical stimulation (AID or M units) at-home by Veterans. Methods: Sixty Veterans were identified using the Fibromyalgia Symptoms Questionnaire for an electrical stimulation trial during January 1-December 31, 2016 at a Midwestern VA Medical Center. Each patient completed a brief, semi-structured phone interview, which included an inquiry about the benefits of the units on affective symptoms. Results: Quantitative findings suggest that participants who were given any kind of unit (AID or M units) did not have a significant change in pain level from baseline to follow-up. Participants who were given any kind of unit (AID or M units) did not report a significant change in anxiety, depressive, or insomnia symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Qualitative findings produced three thematic maps: utilization, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Limitations: This study used a quasi-experimental, one group, pre-/post-test design, and explored the benefits of programming when based on patient self-selection. The instruments used in this study were self-report measures, and the lack of change may have been due to the use of binary versus continuous measures. The findings may differ among other Veterans as the current sample had a larger representation of minority groups compared to the typical Veteran profile. Conclusions: This information is invaluable in helping patients who suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms and affective disorders and for the providers aiding in their treatment.

76,"The effectiveness of repeated intravenous ketamine on depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and functional disability in adults with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence","Background: The effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) receiving care in real-word settings is insufficiently characterized. Herein, results from a naturalistic, retrospective study are presented from a Canadian outpatient IV ketamine clinic. Methods: Adults ( N = 213; M age = 45) with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, with a minimum of Stage 2 antidepressant resistance, received IV ketamine at a community-based multi-disciplinary clinic. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to post-infusion 4 on the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR16; n = 190). Secondary measures included QIDS-SR₁₆-measured response and remission rates, changes from baseline to endpoint in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7; n = 188) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; n = 168). Results: Significant improvement in total depressive symptoms severity ( p &lt; 0.0001) was observed after four infusions of IV ketamine 0.5–0.75 mg/kg. Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score change ≥ 50%) was 27% and remission (QIDS-SR₁₆ total score ≤ 5) rate was 13%. Patients receiving IV ketamine exhibited anxiolytic effects ( p &lt; 0.0001,), improved overall psychosocial function ( p &lt; 0.0001), and reduced suicidal ideation ( p &lt; 0.0001). Compared to the baseline infusion, dissociation severity significantly reduced in subsequent infusions. Limitations: This was a naturalistic, retrospective study, without a control group. Conclusions: IV ketamine was safe, well-tolerated, and effective at improving depressive, anxiety, and functional impairment symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of adults with TRD.

77,Sexual harassment exposure and impaired mental health in medical students. The MESSIAEN national study,"Background: A previous national study has suggested that around 20% of French working women reported sexual harassment (SH) at work but we lack of data in medical students of French hospitals to guide prevention programs. Objectives: To determine SH prevalence in a national sample of French medical students and to validate a theoretical model explaining SH causes and its impact of mental health. Methods: The study is a cross-sectional observational epidemiological national study. SH was defined according to the French legal definition. We further explored other discriminations and their potential association with impaired mental health in medical students. Mental health was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety &amp; Depression scale, psychotropic drug consumption and psychotherapy follow-up. A Structured Equation Modeling was carried out to confirm our theoretical model. Results: 2003 participants were recruited. SH was reported by 15.7% of the participants (19.8% of women and 5.2% of men). The SEM model showed good fit (RMSEA = 0.024, CFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.87, WRMR = 1.165). SH was associated with risk factors such as feminine gender and surgical and anesthesiology specialties. SH was also associated with exposure to discriminations based on the specialty choice and sexual orientation. SH was associated with impaired mental health. Conclusion: French medical student women reported similar rates of SH than other working women, suggesting that SH prevention programs are needed in French hospitals. Surgery and anesthesiology should be targeted in priority. The prevention programs should also target other discriminations and should be evaluated in terms of potential mental health improvement.

78,COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry,"Background: The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations: Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations: Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions: Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.

79,The biological underpinnings of perinatal depressive symptoms: A multi-systems approach,"Background: Well-established evidence exists of an association between depressive symptoms and alterations in the stress and inflammatory response systems; however, the picture is far less coherent during the perinatal period. This study combines the assessment of multiple stress and inflammatory biomarkers in late pregnancy and after delivery in order to investigate cross-sectional and prospective associations with perinatal depressive symptoms. Methods: One-hundred-ten healthy women were assessed in late pregnancy (mean gestational age = 34.76; SD = 1.12) and 89 were re-evaluated after delivery (mean hours after delivery = 52.36; SD = 19.70) for depressive and anxiety symptoms through the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and diurnal salivary cortisol levels were measured on both occasions, while diurnal salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels were assessed in late pregnancy. Results: Using Hierarchical Linear Models, higher depressive symptoms were found to be associated with higher IL-6 levels, lower morning cortisol levels and a flatter cortisol diurnal slope during pregnancy, while adjusting for potential confounders. No significant associations were found after delivery or with change in biomarker levels from pre- to post-partum. Furthermore, preliminary evidence of a positive association between inflammation and stress markers in women with higher antenatal depressive symptoms was found. Limitations: The sample was relatively small and highly selected, thus limiting generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Results emphasize the need for an integrated multi-systems approach to the understanding of the biological underpinnings of perinatal depression and suggest that the stress-immune interactions represent a promising avenue for future endeavor.

80,"The human gut microbiota and depression: Widely reviewed, yet poorly understood","Background: A large number of existing reviews have discussed the role of the gut microbiota in affective disorders, though syntheses have been overwhelmingly narrative in their focus. Method: In this correspondence, we compliment Sanada et al. (see record 2020-22174-002) on their recent systematic review of the gut microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the first to incorporate a meta-analysis. We also comment on how this synthesis should be extended in future research. Results: Sanada et al. (2020) conducted a meta-analysis of alpha diversity in participants with MDD compared to controls, whereby they unexpectedly observed no significant difference between groups. A meta-analysis was only able to be performed on alpha diversity indices. Future research should consider research quality, other forms of depression, incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses, where possible, as well as investigate associations between anxiety/depression symptom measures and the gut microbiota. Limitations: Further consideration of papers which incorporate functional analyses (e.g., metabolomics) is required to integrate this body of literature. Conclusions: Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression. We encourage further systematic reviews in this space, particularly which consider research quality and incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses.

81,Impacts of &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; variants on large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults,"Background: FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) rs1360780 polymorphism has been identified as a molecular genetic marker associated with the dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The impact of FKBP5 rs1360780 on the large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults is still unknown. Methods: 479 healthy volunteers (age: 20-80years) completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments and blood analysis.All subjects were divided into CC, CT and TT genotypes. Within and between network connectivities (10 sub-networks) were calculated using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The genetic effects and gene-gender/age interaction on large-scale network connectivity were explored. Results: Compared with CC and CT groups, TT group showed increased intra-connectivity in default mode network (DMN) and increased inter-connectivity mainly distributed among the network of DMN, salience network (SAN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), subcortical network (SUB), and visual network (VIS). Gene-by-gender and gene-by-age interaction were found in inter-connectivity of DAN to VIS and DMN to FPN, respectively. The altered connectivities correlated with anxiety status test score. Limitations: Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cortisol were not measured,or else, we could estimate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity which may strengthen our results. Conclusions: FKBP5 rs1360780 modulates the large-scale brain network connectivity in healthy adults. TT carriers showed the increased intra- and inter-connectivities mainly distributed among the network of DMN, SAN, DAN, VAN, SUB and VIS.

82,"Self-esteem, symptom severity, and treatment response in adolescents with internalizing problems","Background: Adolescents with low self-esteem often experience internalizing psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, depression). Self-esteem may therefore be a clinically relevant construct for assessment and treatment outcomes. We examined whether general and domain-specific (family, peer, academic) self-esteem are related to adolescents’ internalizing symptom severity and response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Method: Participants were 89 adolescents ages 14 to 18 years ( M = 16.3, 70% females) from an outpatient clinic who were referred for CBT. Adolescents completed measures of self-esteem at baseline and measures of internalizing symptoms at baseline and at the end of a manualized group CBT intervention. Results: Lower peer and family self-esteem, but not academic self-esteem, were associated with more internalizing symptoms at baseline, after controlling for general self-esteem. However, only higher general self-esteem, and not any of the specific self-esteem domains, predicted lower internalizing symptoms at posttreatment. Follow-up analyses revealed differential associations between family and peer self-esteem domains and anxious and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Only self-report measures were used. The relatively small sample size may have limited power to detect small effects. Conclusions: Self-esteem in domains regarding family and peer relationships may be important in the evaluation of adolescents with internalizing problems. Adolescents with low general self-esteem may benefit less from CBT than other adolescents. Addressing negative self-perceptions may be necessary to reduce internalizing symptoms for adolescents with low self-esteem.

83,Depression with and without a history of psychotic symptoms in the general population: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics,"Background: : The aim of this study was to find the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of major depressive episode (MDE) with (MDE-HPS +) and without a history of psychotic symptoms (MDE-HPS) in the general population. Methods: : The Mental Health in the General Population survey interviewed 38,694 individuals in France by using the MINI. The prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of MDE-HPS + were assessed. Results: : Of the sample, 11.2% were diagnosed with current MDE and among them, 39.3% presented a history of at least one psychotic symptom (hallucination or delusion). Patients with MDE-HPS + were younger with more severe social impairment than those with MDE-HPS-. We also found a higher proportion of three generations of migrants in the MDE-HPS+ group. Comorbid psychiatric disorders such as a history of a manic episode, alcohol use disorder, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and a personal history of a suicide attempt were more frequent in patients with MDE-HPS+ than in those with MDE-HPS-. Finally, we found a specific gradient of severity for psychiatric comorbid disorders depending on the number of psychotic symptoms lifetime in MDE. Limitations: : The study also has an observational cross-sectional design that does not permit causal inferences, and it is difficult to eliminate recall bias and reporting errors. Conclusion: : In the general population, patients with MDE-HPS +, when compared to MDE-HPS-, presented with a more severe clinical profile, with increased rates of psychiatric comorbidities, particularly a history of bipolar disorder and a history of a suicide attempt.

84,"Mental disorders in Spanish university students: Prevalence, age-of-onset, severe role impairment and mental health treatment","Background: The university period carries risk for onset of common mental disorders. Epidemiological knowledge on mental disorders among Spanish university students is limited. Aims: To estimate lifetime and 12-month prevalence, persistence and age-of-onset of mental disorders among Spanish first-year university students, as well as associated role impairment and mental health treatment use. Methods: First-year university students (N = 2,118; 55.4% female; mean age = 18.8 years) from five Spanish universities completed a web-based survey, screening possible DSM–IV mental disorders (major depressive episode(MDE), mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder(GAD), panic disorder(PD), alcohol abuse/dependence(AUD), drug abuse/dependence(DUD), and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD)). Role impairment and treatment associated with mental disorders were assessed. Results: Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of any possible mental disorder was 41.3%(SE = 1.08) and 35.7%(SE = 1.05), respectively. Persistence (i.e., ratio of 12-month to lifetime prevalence) was 86.4%(SE = 1.58). Median age-of-onset was 14 for adult ADHD, 15 for mood disorders and AUD, and 16 for anxiety disorders and DUD. One third (29.2%) of 12-month disorders were associated with role impairment. Twelve-month PD (OR = 4.0;95%CI = 1.9-8.5) had the highest odds for role impairment. Only 12.6% of students with 12-month disorder received any mental health treatment. Twelve-month treatment was the highest among those students with 12-month GAD (OR = 7.4;95%CI = 3.7-14.8). Limitations: The assessment of mental disorders was based on self-reports. Cross-sectional nature of the data prevents causal associations. Conclusion: One third of Spanish university students report a common mental disorder in the past year, and one third of those report severe role impairment. Only one out of eight students with 12-month mental disorders receives mental health treatment.

85,Efficacy of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy in mood disorders: A critical review,"Background: Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) is an intervention introduced by Davanloo in order to treat anxiety, mood and somatic symptom, and personality disorders. It is a brief intervention aiming to identify and process painful or forbidden emotions and consequently to override symptoms and self-destructive tendencies. In this review we examine the efficacy of ISTDP on symptoms in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). Methods: A thorough search of articles in Pubmed, PsycINFO, Isi Web of Knowledge was carried out in order to obtain available studies of ISTDP for BD and MDD. We included all studies conducted on patients with a diagnosis of MDD or BD and who received ISTDP. Results: Eight studies were included. These were two randomized controlled trials and six observational studies. Overall the results of the included manuscripts suggest a positive effect of ISTDP on depressive symptoms for patients affected by mood disorders. Furthermore, they suggest ISTDP may be cost-effective through reducing doctor visits and hospitalizations in follow-up. Limitations: Most studies had small samples and consisted of non-randomized trials. Conclusions: These are preliminary positive results on the effectiveness of this approach for the treatment of depressive symptoms. They have to be confirmed by studies with larger sample sizes and by comparing this technique with other psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.

86,Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.

87,The role of alexithymia in social cognition: Evidence from a non-clinical population,"Background: Alexithymia is a personality construct characterised by difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions. We investigated whether people with alexithymia, who struggle with emotion-processing abilities, have diminished emotion-related social cognitive competencies, where social cognition encompasses the set of abilities that allows one to navigate one's social environment. Methods: We assessed alexithymia and four components of social cognition: recognition of others’ emotions, representation of others’ affective and cognitive mental states, empathy, and regulation of one's own feelings. We investigated whether alexithymia could significantly predict each of these components, beyond the effect of other individual difference variables (i.e., anxiety/depressive symptoms), which have been previously associated with both social cognition and alexithymia. Two hundred six participants were recruited. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed to assess the possible relationships between alexithymia and social cognition skills. Results: Alexithymia significantly predicted emotion recognition, empathy, and emotional regulation, even after controlling for the effect of potentially competing factors (i.e., anxiety/depressive symptoms). Alexithymia did not predict representation of others’ affective and cognitive mental states. Limitations: The present study adopted a cross-sectional design, which does not permit us to draw firm conclusions about the causality of the emergent relationships. Conclusions: These data provide support for the argument that recognising others’ emotions and feelings relies on the ability to identify correctly one's own feelings. Our results also indicate the importance of taking into consideration individual differences in levels of alexithymia when investigating social cognition in non-clinical populations, as alexithymia appears to be clearly related to social cognitive functioning.

88,Predicting second-generation antidepressant effectiveness in treating sadness using demographic and clinical information: A machine learning approach,"Introduction: Current guidelines for choosing antidepressant medications involve a trial-and-error process. Most patients try multiple antidepressants before finding an effective antidepressant. This study uses demographic and clinical information to create models predicting effectiveness of different antidepressants in treating sadness in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods: A secondary analysis of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey (CPES) was performed. Participants with or without a mental health diagnosis who reported sadness as a symptom, and were taking fluoxetine (n=156), sertraline (n=224), citalopram (n=91), paroxetine (n=156), venlafaxine (n=69), bupropion (n=92), or trazadone (n=26) within the past year were included. Two sets of principal component analyses (PCAs) and logistic regressions were performed: one determined associations between symptom clusters and antidepressant effectiveness for sadness, and the other created models to predict effectiveness. Both PCAs controlled for psychiatric and medical diagnoses, substance use, psychiatric medications, alternative treatments, and demographics. Results: Anxiety was associated with ineffectiveness of fluoxetine in treating sadness. Low mood scores were associated with ineffectiveness of paroxetine and venlafaxine, and fatigue was associated with ineffectiveness of sertraline. The models for predicting drug effectiveness had a mean accuracy of 83% and internal validity of 72%. Limitations: CPES data were collected from 2001-2003, so newer drugs were not included. Effectiveness was for sadness, so results are not directly comparable to studies using overall depressive symptom reductions as outcomes. Conclusion: Since fewer than 50% of patients currently respond to their first antidepressant, this model could provide modest improvement to choosing starting antidepressants in treating sadness.

Typically, studies focus on specific symptoms, with few providing comprehensive examination of risk factors. In this study we examined the prevalence of suicidal ideation among UK university students and assessed the association with multiple psychiatric risk factors. Methods: A total of N = 1273 students completed online measures of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, insomnia, mania, psychosis, and perceived stress. Results: 37.3% students were classified as high-risk for suicidal behaviour. Moreover, 42.2% of students contemplated suicide at least once within the past twelve months, and 25.1% reported telling someone about these thoughts at least once. Logistic regression analysis showed that suicidal ideation was significantly associated with symptoms of depression, mania, psychosis, and stress. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of ours study does not allow us to infer causality in the observed associations. Conclusions: Our results indicate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in a large sample of university students in the UK, and highlight associated mental health risk factors associated with it. Our findings have implications for mental health practitioners working with University students.

90,Prevalence of and recovery from common mental disorder including psychotic experiences in the UK Primary Care Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme,"Background: Psychotic experiences (PE) may co-occur with common mental disorders (CMD), such as depression and anxiety. However, we know very little about the prevalence of and recovery from PE in primary mental health care settings, such as the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in the UK National Health Service (NHS), where most CMD are treated. Methods: We used the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences—Positive 15-item Scale (CAPE-P15) to determine the prevalence of PE in patients receiving treatment from IAPT services. Patient-reported measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) are routinely collected and establish recovery in IAPT services. We studied recovery rates according to the absence and presence of PE. Multi-group growth models estimated improvement trajectories for each group. Results: A total of 2,042 patients with CMD completed the CAPE-P15. The mean age was 39.8. The overall prevalence of PE was 29.68%. The recovery rate was 27.43% compared to 62.08% for those without PE. Although patients with or without PE shared similar improvement trajectories, the initial severity of patients with PE impeded their likelihood of recovery. Limitations: We mirrored routine data collection in IAPT services, including self-report questionnaires that may affect valid reporting of symptoms. Missing data in the calculation of improvement trajectories may reduce generalisability. Conclusions: At least one in four patients receiving treatment from IAPT services in primary care experience CMD and PE. This significant group of people experience a lower recovery rate, with adverse implications not only for them but also for efficiency of services.

91,Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are related to reduced awareness of emotional valence,"Background: The Seeking Proxies for Internal States (SPIS) model of OCD asserts that obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies are associated with attenuated access to internal states. Here we explore the implications of this model for awareness of emotional valence. Methods: In Study 1, participants with high and low OC tendencies ( n = 30 in each group) rated how they felt while viewing different pictures with positive, neutral, or negative valence taken from the International Affective Picture System. Study 2 replicated Study 1 among non-selected participants ( n = 99) that rated positive and negative pictures chosen from the recently developed Basic-Emotions Nencki Affective Picture System. In both studies, mean deviation from norm ratings (of each picture system) served as the primary outcome measure. Results: Study 1 showed that high OC participants’ mean deviation score was significantly higher, compared with low OC participants, across positive, neutral, and negative pictures ( p = .01). Follow-up analyses revealed that while no group difference emerged for mean valence rating ( p = .16), groups differed on the mean standard deviation of ratings within each valence category ( p = .002). In Study 2, only OC tendencies, not depressive or anxiety symptoms, were positively correlated with mean deviation from norm ratings ( p = .026). Dividing the sample to high and low OC groups based on an OC cutoff score yielded similar group differences to those observed in Study 1 ( p &lt; .001). Limitations: Analog samples and a relative small sample size (Study 1). Conclusions: This study suggests that OC symptoms are associated with reduced awareness of emotional valence, possibly emanating from a noisier emotional perception.

92,Psychometric properties of the child and adolescent perfectionism scale in ecuadorian adolescents,"Background: This study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) in Ecuadorian adolescent population. Methods: The study involved 1,562 students aged 12 to 18 ( M age = 14.83, SD = 1.86) from Quito (Ecuador). Data analysis included Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with Satorra-Bentler scaled χ², Cronbach's alpha coefficients, Pearson's correlations, and Multigroup CFA to test factorial invariance across sex and age (configural, measurement and structural). Latent means differences were also examined across sex and age groups. Results: Results confirmed the structure of Spanish version of the CAPS with 13 items divided into three factors, Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (SPP), Self-Oriented Perfectionism-Critical (SOP-C) and Self-Oriented-Striving (SOP-S). Additionally, this model remained invariant across sex and age. Significant and positive correlations were obtained between SPP, SOP-C and the three measures of psychological distress (Anxiety, Depression and Stress), whereas SOP-S showed a more adaptive pattern of association. Acceptable reliability values were obtained and latent mean differences across sex and age groups were mainly observed in the SOP-S factor. Concretely, males reported significantly higher latent mean scores than females in SOP-S as well as students aged from 14 to 18 years old in comparison with their younger peers (12- and 13-year olds). Conclusions: The Spanish version of the CAPS has satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of validity and reliability remaining invariant across sex and age in Ecuadorian adolescents.

93,Euthymic bipolar disorder patients and EEG microstates: A neural signature of their abnormal self experience?,"Background: A growing number of neuroimaging studies have revealed spatial abnormalities of resting-state functional brain network activity in bipolar disorder (BD). Conversely, abnormalities of resting state temporal dynamics have been scarcely investigated so far. The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG microstates activity in BD patients with a history of manic predominant polarity. Patients were euthymic and pharmacologically stabilized. Methods: Nineteen BD patients (mean age 34.4 ± 11.0, 7 female) and 19 healthy controls (HC; mean age 38.2 ± 9.9, 7 female) were recruited. The psychometric evaluation included the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Two runs of 2 minutes of EEG activity by a 128-channel system were acquired at rest and analyzed through microstate analysis. Results: We found a reduced presence of microstate B in BD patients compared to HC, since BD patients have a tendency to transit from the microstate B to the microstates C and D significantly more than HC. Furthermore, microstate B features were correlated with DES, state STAI and trait STAI scores. Conclusion: The reduced presence of microstate B might be associated with episodic autobiographic memory deficit, exaggerated self-focusing and states of dissociations characteristic of BD. Strong correlations of microstate B metrics and dynamics with symptoms of dissociation and anxiety across the two groups supported this interpretation.

94,The rs6311 of serotonin receptor 2A ( &lt;i&gt;5-HT2A&lt;/i&gt;) gene is associated with alexithymia and mental health,"Backgrounds: Alexithymia, difficulties in identifying and describing one's own feelings, is related to substantial clinical practice. Inspired by the links between serotonin functions and affective disorders, this study investigated associations of the serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2A) gene with alexithymia and mental health. Methods: We differentiated subjects according to two functional polymorphisms (i.e., rs6311 and rs6313) of 5-HT2A gene and scored alexithymia and mental health of college students with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), respectively. Results: The analyses basing on sample 1 ( N = 566) and sample 2 ( N = 602) indicated that the G allele of rs6311 was related to higher score on the TAS-20 as compared to the AA genotype. The analysis with 467 individuals from sample 2 indicated that the rs6311 was associated with mental health, and this association was mediated by alexithymia. Limitations: The potential confounding variables such as depression and anxiety were neglected in the analyses. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the contribution of the 5-HT2A to alexithymia, and highlight the link between alexithymia and mental health at genetic level.

95,EZH2 is involved in vulnerability to neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress in different aged mice,"Background: Microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression is closely related to pathogenesis of depression. Aging is a known risk factor for neuroinflammation in the central nervous system and subsequent behavioral impairment. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a methyltransferase of histone H3 lysine 27 which regulates microglial activation, plays a crucial role in proinflammatory cytokines expression. However, whether the EZH2 is involved in susceptibility to depression in different ages remains elusive. Methods: Young and aged C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress for three weeks. Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, spatial memory impairment, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, P-p65, EZH2, H3K27me3 and SOCS3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were measured using an established behavioral battery, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques. Moreover, EPZ-6438, an inhibitor of EZH2, was utilized to detect the role of EZH2 in neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities. Results: CUMS induced depression-like behaviors and spatial memory impairment, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and P-p65, enhanced M1 microglia activation, and increased levels of EZH2, H3K27me3 and SOCS3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in young and aged mice. Both unstressed and stressed aged mice displayed attention-deficit behavioral outcomes, alteration of protein levels compared with young mice. However, inhibition of EZH2 could relieve most of behavioral and molecular alterations. Limitations: A relative small sample size is a limitation. Conclusions: EZH2 might be involved in susceptibility to neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors in different aged mice.

96,Attitudes towards suicide and risk factors for suicide attempts among university students in South Korea,"Background: In the new global socioeconomic development, suicidal deaths have increased which is progressively gaining more attention in the field of psychiatry, social work, psychology, and public health research. The present study aimed at examining the evidence for the attitudes towards suicide and risk factors for suicide attempts among university students in South Korea and suggested significant recommendations for future prevention programs and research. Method: A study was conducted by reviewing recent publications and significant research journals published since 2000 related to the study objective, themes, and drawn broader perspectives and implications. The recent journal articles from PubMed, Global Health journal database, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Academic Journals Database, WHO, and PsychInfo data sources were included. The study key terms were “suicide”, “attitudes”, “risk factors”, “university students”, &amp; “South Korea”. Results: The negative attitudes towards self, confusion of meaning in life, anxiety and stress about academic achievement, family problems, hopelessness, depression, and bipolar disorder were the main factors. Limitations: We mainly included peer review journals in our study, but address the few relevant books and reports also. Conclusions: The authors discussed important implications for future actions, including conducting relevant studies and regular collaborative discussions among responsible stakeholders.

97,Naturalistic follow-up in bipolar patients after successful electroconvulsive therapy,"Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for acute depression, mania and mixed states. We evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with bipolar depression or mixed state, responsive to ECT. Methods: this observational follow-up study was conducted in 70 patients with Bipolar Disorder: 36 patients met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) and 34 for a mixed episode (MXE). During the follow-up after ECT, the relapse rates and the duration of response and remission periods were recorded. Results: the mean duration of the follow-up was 57 weeks. 93% of the patients maintained at least a partial therapeutic response for more than 90% of the follow-up period. 73% of patients fulfilled the criteria for a full remission, 33% showed a depressive relapse and 10% a mixed relapse. No manic relapses occurred but almost 1/3 of the sample presented hypomanic episodes. MDE patients presented higher rates of remission compared to MXE ones. Patients with anxiety disorders reported earlier relapses than those without this comorbidity. Relapsed-patients showed higher functional impairment at baseline evaluation, compared to non-relapsed ones. Limitations: nonrandom allocation, limited sample size, possible influence of psychopharmacological treatment. Conclusions: Given several methodological limitations, this study cannot draw definite conclusions but could suggest that in treatment-resistant bipolar patients with severe depression or mixed state, ECT may represent a useful treatment option. Patients with mixed features, comorbid anxiety disorders and higher functional impairment present less favorable outcome. Future research on long-term efficacy of ECT and on clinical predictors of relapse is needed.

98,Prospective associations between hsCRP and GlycA inflammatory biomarkers and depression: The Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil),"Background: Although low-grade inflammation is associated with onset and persistence of depression, most biomarkers display modest predictive effects. GlycA (glycoprotein acetylation) is a unique metabolomic composite of pro-inflammatory acute-phase glycoproteins. We hypothesized that GlycA levels would predict depression incidence, remission and persistence, with higher accuracy than high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also explored the additive predictive value of GlycA above and beyond hsCRP. Methods: Cohort design using the sample of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)'s São Paulo site. Baseline GlycA and hsCRP levels were measured in blood plasma. Depression incidence, remission, and persistence were assessed using the Clinical Interview Scheduled Revised (CIS-R) at two time points separated by a mean of 3.8 years. Multivariable Poisson, logistic and linear regression models were used for prediction. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical confounders, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, cardiovascular assessments, antidepressant and anti-inflammatory drug use, anxiety disorders, alcohol use, and body mass index. Results: We included 4,364 participants (53.2% females, mean age 51.4 ± 8.9 years) with no autoimmune disorders. GlycA robustly predicted depression persistence (relative risk of 7.28, 95% confidence interval 1.33–45.57, p = 0.023 in the fully-adjusted model), but not depression onset. Although hsCRP also predicted depression persistence, its effects were fully explained by confounders and by GlycA levels. GlycA also predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in depressed patients and depression persistence vs. remission in fully-adjusted models. Limitations: Brief depressive episodes could not be measured by our assessments. Conclusions: GlycA might be a new inflammatory prognosis biomarker for depression.

99,Neuropsychiatric symptoms as prognostic makers for the elderly with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis,"Background: Although several neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) have been demonstrated to have value in the prediction of the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, these symptoms are less studied for the prediction of the transition from normal cognition (NC) to MCI. Methods: Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported on at least one NPS at baseline and had MCI as the outcome. Results: We obtained 13 cohort studies with a total population of 33,066. Depression was the most common neuropsychiatric symptom and could significantly predict transition to MCI (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13–1.86). However, depression was more capable of predicting amnestic MCI (RR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.04-1.83) than non-aMCI (RR= 0.96, 95% CI 95% CI: 0.60-1.33). Subgroup analysis suggested that the association between depression and MCI changed with depression severity, depression criteria, apolipoprotein-E-adjusted status, age, the percentage of females, and follow-up times, but some data were too sparse for a reliable estimate. Regarding other NPSs, there were insufficient data to assess their effect on the development of MCI. However, apathy, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and agitation might be risk factors for the prediction of NC-MCI transition with strong predictive value. Conclusions: Depression was associated with an approximately 1.5-fold sincreased risk of the progression to MCI in the population with normal cognition. Other NPSs with underlying predictive value deserve more attention.

100,Suicidal risks in 12 DSM-5 psychiatric disorders,"Objective: As modern studies evaluating suicidal behaviors in large samples of major psychiatric disorder patients are rare, we compared suicidal risks associated with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: We quantified rates of intake suicidal ideation and lifetime attempts, suicides, and violent acts (attempts + suicides) in 6050 adult patients in a European psychiatric center, diagnosed with 12 prevalent, DSM-5 psychiatric disorders. Results: Ideation ranged from 53.9% of subjects with bipolar disorder (BD) with mixed features, to 8.70% in anxiety disorders. Subjects making at least one suicide attempt were most prevalent in BD with mixed or psychotic features. Suicide rates ranked: substance abuse&gt;BD with psychotic features &gt; psychotic disorders ≥ BDI &gt; major depressive disorder (MDD). Suicidal intensity (acts/100 PEY) was highest with BD, psychotic disorders, and MDD; lethality (lower attempt/suicide ratio) was greatest with substance abuse, psychotic disorders, and BD with psychotic features. Rates of suicidal acts in BD vs. MDD were similarly high among ever-hospitalized subjects but much lower in never-hospitalized MDD subjects. Women had higher overall risks of ideation and attempt s, but violent acts and suicide were more likely among men, whereas SMR for suicide was greater among women, presumably reflecting very low risks among women in the regional general population. Conclusions: Suicidal risks were particularly high in BD with psychotic or mixed features as well as with substance abuse and in severe MDD with hospitalization.

101,Prevalence and related factors of suicide attempts in first-episode and untreated Chinese Han outpatients with psychotic major depression,"Background: Major depressive depression (MDD) is often accompanied by suicidal behavior. Increasing evidence shows that MDD patients display psychotic symptoms. However, the relationship between psychotic symptoms and suicide attempt in MDD has not been reported. Therefore, this study was to identify the prevalence and associated factors of suicide attempts in first-episode and untreated Chinese Han outpatients comorbid with psychotic major depression (PMD). Methods: 1718 first-episode and untreated MDD outpatients were assessed with Positive Symptom Scale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and clinical global impression of severity scale (CGI-S). Some glycolipid metabolism and thyroid hormone parameters were measured. Results: In MDD patients, the percentage of PMD was 10.0%. The incidence of attempted suicide in PMD patients was 51.5%, which was more than 3 times higher than that in non-PMD patients (16.7%). In PMD patients, compared to non-attempters, suicide attempters were older, had a longer course of disease, scored higher on all scales, as well as had higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidases antibody, anti-thyroglobulin and blood glucose. PANSS positive symptom, CGI, diastolic blood pressure and TSH were independently associated with suicide attempts of PMD. Conclusions: PMD patients have a higher prevalence of suicide attempt than non-PMD patients. Some demographic and clinical parameters are relevant factors for suicide attempt in PMD patients.

102,Thoughts of self-harm and associated risk factors among postpartum women in Canada,"Background: The prevalence of thoughts of self-harm during the postpartum period is not well documented in Canada. To estimate the prevalence of thoughts of self-harm among postpartum women in Canada, this study explored prevalence by socio-demographic characteristics and examined the associations between thoughts of self-harm and aspects of maternal mental health. Methods: This study used data from the 2018/2019 Survey on Maternal Health which surveyed women living in the 10 provinces anywhere between 6–13 months postpartum. Participants were asked to report experiencing thoughts of self-harm, rate their mental health, and participate in the abbreviated Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations. Results: Of the 6,558 respondents who agreed to share their data, 10.4% reported thoughts of self-harm since the birth of their child. Of these women, 37.0% reported low mental health, 54.2% had moderate levels of symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) and 37.1% had symptoms of GAD. Women who experienced low mental health, moderate levels of symptoms of PPD and/or GAD were more likely to report thoughts of self-harm. Limitations: As thoughts of self-harm and aspects of mental health are self-reported, there is the potential for social desirability bias and underreporting. The cross-sectional survey design did not allow the reporting of thoughts of self-harm at different time points. Discussion: The high proportion of postpartum women in Canada reporting thoughts of self-harm and strong associations with aspects of maternal mental health highlight the need for effective supports during postpartum.

103,Risk of bipolar disorder in patients with endometriosis: A nationwide population-based cohort study,"Background: Women with endometriosis (EM) have increased vulnerability to certain psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, as well as bipolar disorder (BD). This study investigates the risk of BD development in EM patients. Also, the impact of EM treatment on the risk of developing BD is examined. Methods: A total of 17,832 EM patients and 17,832 non-EM controls matched by age, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were included between 2000–2012 and followed to the end of 2013. Participants newly diagnosed as BD by board-certified psychiatrist were defined as incidents. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the BD incidence rate between two studied groups. Results: EM patients were associated with an increased risk of BD development compared with non-EM controls after adjusting for age, CCI score, and different treatment options (1.04 versus 0.56 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.75–3.12). Also, there was no significant difference in the risk estimate between different hormonal or surgical treatment groups, suggesting a limited impact of EM treatment on the risk of BD development. Limitations: This study deals with the duration of hormonal treatment, whether operated or not, which reduces the chances of showing the effect of individual EM treatment on the risk of BD development. Conclusion: This study shows that EM patients are associated with an increased risk of BD development. Further studies would be needed to elucidate the mechanism linking the EM and BD.

104,Risky cyber behaviors in adolescents with depression: A case control study,"Objective: This study aimed to compare adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy adolescents with regard to cyberbullying, cyber victimization, internet addiction, and digital game addiction. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in Selçuk University Hospital. The study sample consisted of 34 adolescents with MDD and 39 controls without any psychopathology. A socio-demographic data form, the Cyber bullying Scale (CBS), Cyber Victimization Scale (CVS), Cyber bullying Sensibility Scale (CBSS), Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), Digital Game Dependence Scale (DGA-7), and Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale-Refurbished (RCADS) were administered to all participants. Results: CBS, CVS, IAS and DGAS-7 scores of the MDD group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The significant differences persisted even after controlling for confounding factors such as age, gender, socio-economic level, and parental educational levels with MANCOVA. A strong positive correlation existed between CBS and CVS scores, and higher IAS scores were associated with higher CBS scores in the MDD group. CBSS scores negatively correlated with DGAS-7 scores in the MDD group. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, conclusions about causality remain speculative. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the importance of assessing problems related to the online environment in the presence of depression in adolescents. Our results suggested that evaluating the use of technology with a view to the potential for cyber bullying and cyber victimization as well as internet addiction and addiction to digital games may be necessary as a holistic approach in the follow-up of adolescent depression.

105,Progesterone levels predict reductions in behavioral avoidance following cognitive restructuring in women with spider phobia,"Background: Ovarian hormones have been implicated as a potential source of variability in the effectiveness of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders in women. Additionally, preclinical studies in healthy women indicate that ovarian hormones are related to cognitive modes of emotion regulation, like cognitive restructuring. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a relationship exists between endogenous ovarian hormones and the outcomes of cognitive restructuring in clinically anxious women. Methods: Ninety women with spider phobia received training in cognitive restructuring or a control task and provided a blood sample for the measurement of serum estradiol and progesterone levels. Behavioral avoidance, using a behavioral approach task with a live spider, and self-reported fear of spiders were measured at baseline and 1-week post-treatment. Results: The results indicated that heightened levels of progesterone, but not estradiol, at the time of cognitive restructuring predicted greater post-treatment reductions in behavioral avoidance, but not self-reported fear, amongst women who received cognitive restructuring but not those in the control group. Limitations: As menstrual cycle phase was not assessed; the present study provides information regarding how the benefits of cognitive therapy are predicted by between-person individual differences in absolute hormone levels, but does not examine the relationship between within-person fluctuations in hormone levels and outcomes. Conclusions: These results suggest the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders in women may differ depending on endogenous levels of progesterone, and raise the possibility that progesterone could be a useful pharmacological adjunct to cognitive therapy.

106,Associations of plasma androgens with suicidality among men and women: A 9-year longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Testosterone has been implicated in suicidality in cross-sectional studies. Stress that coincides with a suicide attempt may alter androgen levels, so prospective studies are needed to exclude reverse causation. We aimed to examine the associations of plasma androgens with concurrent and future suicidality, and if present, whether these associations were mediated by a behavioral trait like reactive aggression. Methods: Baseline plasma levels of total testosterone, 5α−dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione were determined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate with a radioimmunoassay. Suicidality was assessed using the Suicidal Ideation Scale at baseline and after 2-, 4-, 6-, and 9-year follow-up. Men and women were analyzed separately, and potential confounders were considered. Results: Participants ( N = 2861; 66.3% women) had a mean age of 42.0 years (range 18–65) and almost half (46.9%) fulfilled criteria for a major depressive or anxiety disorder. At baseline 13.2% of men and 11.2% of women reported current suicidal ideation. In participants who were non-suicidal at baseline, slightly more men than women reported suicidal ideation during follow-up (14.7% vs. 12.5%), whereas the reverse pattern was observed for suicide attempts (3.6% vs. 4.2%). None of the associations between androgens and current and future suicidality were significant. Limitations: Androgens were determined once, which may have been insufficient to predict suicidality over longer periods. Discussion: The lack of associations between plasma levels of androgens determined by ‘gold-standard’ laboratory methods with suicidality do not support previous cross-sectional and smaller studies in adult men and women with values within the physiological range.

107,"The uterine-chemokine-brain axis: Menstrual cycle-associated symptoms (MCAS) are in part mediated by CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8 and CXCL10","Objective: To examine associations between chemokines and menstrual cycle associated symptoms (MCAS). Methods: Forty-one women completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) rating scale during 28 consecutive days of the menstrual cycle. MCAS is diagnosed when the total daily DRSP score during the menstrual cycle is &gt; 0.666 percentile. We assayed plasma CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8, CXCL10, EGF, IGF-1, and PAI-1 at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle. Results: CCL2, CCL5, CCL11 and EGF are significantly higher in women with MCAS than in those without. Increased CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL8, CCL11 and CCL5 levels are significantly associated with DRSP scores while CCL2 is the most significant predictor explaining 39.6% of the variance. The sum of the neurotoxic chemokines CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 is significantly associated with the DRSP score and depression, physiosomatic, breast-craving and anxiety symptoms. The impact of chemokines on MCAS symptoms differ between consecutive weeks of the menstrual cycle with CCL2 being the most important predictor of increased DRSP levels during the first two weeks, and CXCL10 or a combination of CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 being the best predictors during week 3 and 4, respectively. Discussion: The novel case definition “MCAS” is externally validated by increased levels of uterus-associated chemokines and EGF. Those chemokines are involved in MCAS and are regulated by sex hormones and modulate endometrium functions and brain neuro-immune responses, which may underpin MCAS symptoms. As such, uterine-related chemokines may link the uterus with brain functions via a putative uterine-chemokine-brain axis.

However, the concern about mental health could have been deeper. First, there is robust evidence that cigarette smoking are likely to be a causal risk factor for severe mental illness, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder. Accordingly, why Pham and colleagues where the first to be concerned by harmful mental health consequences of e-cigarette users? Indeed, the epidemic began in the late 2000s. Second, their findings must be added to a too long list of accumulating evidence of devastating harms of e-cigarette. Not to account the recent epidemic of vape-related lung illnesses in the US which have led to tens of deaths, the toxicity of vaping by-products cannot be denied.

109,Remission and recurrence in bipolar disorder: The data from Health Outcomes and Patient Evaluations in Bipolar Disorder (HOPE-BD) study,"Background: The HOPE-BD was a naturalistic study established to follow individuals in Canada seeking treatment for bipolar disorder (BD). The study aimed to examine the course of BD and describe how clinical and sociodemographic factors are associated with outcomes. Methods: Individuals with BD had their clinical data recorded at enrolment and were naturalistically treated. Participant were followed for up to four years, and visits occurred at least once every three months. We investigated the longitudinal outcomes with logistic, Cox, and quantile regressions. Results: Among the 354 participants, 57.3% had BD type I. Depression as first episode, younger ages at onset and older ages of the first professional help predicted longer delays in correct diagnosis. Among the symptomatic patients at baseline, the median time to remission was 10.9 months. Comorbid alcohol use disorder and the severity of baseline depressive symptoms predicted longer times to remission. Among the euthymic participants, the median time to recurrence was 14.5 months. History of anxiety disorder and younger ages at onset predicted shorter times to recurrence. Baseline depression scores predicted recurrence in euthymic patients. Limitations: We did not investigate the predictors of each polarity. Our findings may not apply to individuals followed in non-specialised outpatient services. Conclusion: Our study reinforces the necessity of early diagnosis and interventions, as well as the importance of treating depressive symptoms and comorbidities.

110,Sex differences in psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Sex differences between psychotic depression (PD) and non-psychotic depression (NPD) have received little systematic study. This study was conducted to investigate sex difference in patients with psychotic and non-psychotic major depressive disorder in a Chinese Han population. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1718 first-episode and drug-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder were recruited. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. All subjects were rated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: The prevalence of PD in female patients (10.97%) was higher than that in male patients (7.99%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that female patients were older compared with male patients in NPD group, but there were no significant differences in demographic and clinical variables between female and male PD patients. Further, there were no sex differences in the scores of HAMD, HAMA and positive symptom subscale of PANSS in both PD and NPD groups. Two-way ANOVA showed that PD patients had significantly higher scores on the HAMD, HAMA and positive symptom subscale of PANSS than non-PD patients. However, there were no significant effects of sex and sex* subtypes. Limitations: The main limitations are cross-sectional design and inability to control selection bias. Conclusions: Our findings show significant differences in clinical profiles between PD and NPD patients; however, no sex difference has been observed in the either PD or NPD patients.

111,Personalized prediction of depression in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Depressive disturbances in Parkinson's disease (dPD) have been identified as the most important determinant of quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Prediction models to triage patients at risk of depression early in the disease course are needed for prognosis and stratification of participants in clinical trials. Methods: One machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the logistic regression technique were applied for the prediction of clinically significant depression (defined as The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS-15] ≥ 5) using a prospective cohort study of 312 drug-naïve patients with newly diagnosed PD during 2-year follow-up from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Established models were assessed with out-of-sample validation and the whole sample was divided into training and testing samples by the ratio of 7:3. Results: Both XGBoost model and logistic regression model achieved good discrimination and calibration. 2 PD-specific factors (age at onset, duration) and 4 nonspecific factors (baseline GDS-15 score, State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] score, Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire [RBDSQ] score, and history of depression) were identified as important predictors by two models. Limitations: Access to several variables was limited by database. Conclusions: In this longitudinal study, we developed promising tools to provide personalized estimates of depression in early PD and studied the relative contribution of PD-specific and nonspecific predictors, constituting a substantial addition to the current understanding of dPD.

112,"The mediating effect of psychological distress on cognitive function and physical frailty among the elderly: Evidence from rural Shandong, China","Background: Few studies have explored the underlying mechanism between physical frailty and cognitive function. The aim of this study is to explore the mediating role of psychological distress (PD) for the association between cognitive function and physical frailty among the elderly in rural China. Methods: A total of 3,242 rural older adults were included in the analysis. Logistic regression and Bootstrap analyses were employed to explore the association between cognitive function, PD and frailty, and the mediating role of PD. Results: This study found that the prevalence of frailty and cognitive impairment among the elderly in rural China was 18.0%, 22.4%. After adjusted for controlling variables, cognitive function was significantly associated with high level of PD, and elderly with higher level of PD had a higher probability of suffering from frailty. PD played a partially mediating effect in cognitive function and frailty and the mediating effect of PD can explain the 11.0% of the total effect of cognitive function on frailty. Limitations: The data were cross-sectional, thus the causal relationship between variables could not be determined. The main variables in this study were measured by self-report information, which might result in recall bias. Conclusions: This study provide evidence that the effect of cognitive function on physical frailty was partially mediated by PD among the elderly in rural China. Primary health care should strengthen the screening of PD characterized by depression and anxiety, and strive to improve the physical and psychological well-being of rural elderly in China.

113,Psychiatric comorbidities in bipolar disorders: An examination of the prevalence and chronology of onset according to sex and bipolar subtype,"Objectives: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. However, few studies systematically examine which disorders are more likely to occur pre- or post-BD onset. We examine the prevalence and Age At Onset (AAO) of psychiatric conditions in adults with BD. Methods: A structured clinical interview was used to assess lifetime history and AAO of alcohol and cannabis misuse, suicide attempts, anxiety and eating disorders in a French sample of euthymic patients with BD ( n = 739). Regression analyses were used to test for statistically significant associations between rates and AAO of comorbidities in BD groups stratified by sex or subtype. Results: Prevalence of alcohol and cannabis misuse was associated with male sex and BD-I subtype; whilst most anxiety and eating disorders were associated with female sex. The AAO of most comorbid conditions preceded that of BD, except for panic disorder, agoraphobia and alcohol misuse. Few variations were observed in AAO of comorbidities according to groups. Limitations: All assessments were retrospective, so estimates of prevalence rates and especially exact AAO of some comorbidities are at risk of recall bias. Conclusions: Sex and BD subtype are associated with different rates of comorbid disorders. However, there were minimal between group differences in median AAO of comorbidities. By describing the chronological sequence of comorbidities in BD we were able to demonstrate that a minority of comorbidities typically occurred post-onset of BD. This is noteworthy as these disorders might be amenable to interventions aimed at early secondary prevention.

114,Regulation of negative emotions through positive reappraisal and distancing in high-trait-anxious women,"Background: Positive reappraisal and distancing are two distinct cognitive reappraisal strategies for emotion regulation. Critically however, research examining the impact of elevated trait anxiety on cognitive reappraisal has often conflated these strategies. Thus, the present study investigated whether high-trait-anxious (HTA) women can effectively utilize positive reappraisal and distancing to regulate emotional responses to negative stimuli. Methods: Twenty-six HTA women and twenty-seven low-trait-anxious (LTA) women were investigated in a self-generated reappraisal paradigm. Subjective measures of emotional regulation and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were instructed to passively view neutral or negative pictures, or to reinterpret negative pictures in a positive way (positive reappraisal) or a detached and unemotional way (distancing). Results: HTA women, as compared to LTA women, reported smaller reductions in negative affect after positive reappraisal and smaller reductions in emotional arousal after distancing. Though ERP data did not reveal corresponding differences in the centro-parietal late positive potential during emotion regulation, data did reveal HTA women exhibited enhanced recruitment of cognitive control during positive reappraisal and greater preparatory processing before engaging in distancing. Limitations: Future research should examine the generalizability of the present results in clinical anxiety individuals, male sample and other reappraisal strategies. Conclusions: Overall, HTA women appeared to recruit more cortical resources, suggestive of compensatory mechanisms, to achieve a similar performance as LTA women when engaging in positive reappraisal and distancing strategies to regulate negative emotions. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that HTA women are characterized by the inefficient implementation of positive reappraisal and distancing strategies.

115,Cortisol levels in chronic fatigue syndrome and atypical depression measured using hair and saliva specimens,"Background: Several diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDE) overlap with those of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Furthermore, atypical MDE (A-MDE), a subtype of MDE characterised by profound fatigue and which has frequently been linked with CFS, exhibits similar low cortisol levels to CFS. However, this result has been only found in specimens designed for measuring acute cortisol levels. In this study, we measure cortisol levels in subjects with CFS and in subjects with A-MDE, without psychiatric comorbidity, using both hair and saliva specimens, to gain a measure of both short and long-term cortisol levels in these two conditions. Methods: Hair cortisol concentration, representing the cortisol concentration of the previous three months, and salivary cortisol, measured at six time-points across one day and including the cortisol awakening response (CAR), post-awakening delta cortisol and the total daily output, were assessed in an age and gender matched group of 34 controls, 15 subjects with A-MDE and 17 with CFS. Results: CFS (mean 92.2 nmol/l.h, s.d. 33.2 nmol/l.h) and A-MDE (mean 89.1 nmol/l.h, s.d. 22.6 nmol/l.h) subjects both showed lower cortisol total daily output in saliva (AUCg) in comparison to healthy controls (mean 125.5 nmol/l.h, s.d. 40.6 nmol/l.h). However, hair cortisol concentration was not lower than that of controls in either patient group. CFS and A-MDE did not differ from one another on any cortisol measures. CFS subjects reported fewer daily hassles and less severe psychic anxiety symptoms in comparison to A-MDE subjects (all p &lt; 0.05). However, they did not differ in the severity of somatic anxiety symptoms. There was also no difference in the presence of overlapping symptoms such as fatigability and concentration/memory problems between A-MDE and CFS subjects. Conclusion: Low levels of cortisol found using short-term measures of daily output may be transient, since cortisol levels were normal when a long-term measure (hair) was studied. This might be explained by a potential cortisol rhythm alteration. Although these disorders have their distinctive depressive and somatic features, they may from part of a wider group of Somatic Symptom Disorders (SSD), given the findings of the same pattern of cortisol secretion in both disorders and increased frequency of overlapping clinical features.

116,An evaluation of suicidal risk in bipolar patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: While bipolar disorder (BD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and individually have a higher risk of suicide compared to the general population, few studies have examined the impact of comorbid PTSD on suicidal ideation in patients with BD. Methods: We analyzed baseline data from the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for bipolar disorder study (Bipolar CHOICE), a 6-month, pharmacological comparative effectiveness trial of individuals with BD. Bipolar CHOICE enrolled 482 individuals. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis assessed whether comorbid PTSD was associated with increased suicidal ideation as assessed by the Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale (CHRT) total and factor scores, while controlling for common correlates of suicidal ideation in this population such as a current major depressive episode, comorbid anxiety disorders, severity of illness and previous suicide attempts. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, diagnosis of comorbid PTSD was a significant predictor of the CHRT total score (β = 2.59, p = .03). Comorbid PTSD was also a significant predictor of the CHRT propensity factor (β = 2.32, adjusted p = .04), but was not a significant predictor of the active suicidal thoughts factor. Additionally, all participants with comorbid PTSD ( N = 58) endorsed current suicidal ideation ( p = .005) and were more likely to have had a previous suicide attempt ( p &lt; .001) compared to those without PTSD. Limitations: Generalizability beyond outpatient settings is limited, mixed affective states were not assessed, and analyses were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Patients have an increased risk of suicidal ideation when PTSD is comorbid with BD.

117,Outcome of depressive mood disorder among adolescent outpatients in an eight-year follow-up,"Objectives: This study investigated the eight-year course and outcomes of depressive mood disorders and the key outcome predictors among adolescent outpatients. Methods: Depressive adolescent outpatients ( N = 148) in a naturalistic clinical setting were assessed at baseline, six months, 12 months and eight years using diagnostic and self-report instruments. Baseline predictors covered selected sociodemographic, clinical and treatment-related characteristics. The outcomes were time to recovery, recurrence, time spent being ill and longitudinal latent profiles of depressive symptoms. Results: The recovery rate from any depressive mood disorder was 73% at two years, 91% at five years and 94% by the end of the eight-year follow-up. Two thirds (67%) of the subjects presented at least one recurrence and 57% of them were depressed for 25% or more of the follow-up period. At the eight-year follow-up, 36% had a mood disorder, 48% suffered from anxiety and 26% had a personality disorder. Less severe depression at baseline predicted a shorter time to recovery, whereas recurrence was predicted by a younger age. A latent profile with initially moderate-level depressive symptoms but a poor distal outcome was associated with being female and borderline personality disorder. Limitations: The female preponderance in the sample warrants caution when interpreting sex differences in the findings. Conclusions: Although the depression outcome for some adolescents making the transition to young adulthood is promising, many of them experience long, even chronic episodes, and recurrences are common. Personality-disorder characteristics appeared to be significant outcome predictors in this adolescent population.

118,Self-guided online cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia: A naturalistic evaluation in patients with potential psychiatric comorbidities,"Background: Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide, and regularly co-occurs with anxiety and depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the gold standard treatment for insomnia (CBT-I), however demand for treatment providers drastically exceeds supply. Internet-delivered programs for insomnia (iCBT-I) improve treatment access. However the effects of unguided iCBT-I for individuals with comorbidities within a naturalistic setting remains unexplored. We developed a novel unguided iCBT-I program and evaluated its impact on insomnia, psychological distress, and wellbeing when accessed by the public. Methods: 317 participants experiencing insomnia for over 3 months enrolled in the program. The program consisted of 4 lessons delivered online with automated web support. Insomnia symptoms, psychological distress, and general wellbeing were assessed at lesson 1 and 4. Intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to examine effects on insomnia, distress, and wellbeing. Results: Participants experienced large ( g = 1.11) and significant reductions in insomnia, moderate ( g = 0.55) and significant reductions in distress, and small ( g = 0.37) but significant improvements in wellbeing. 65% of participants who reported pre-treatment insomnia severity at clinical levels remitted following treatment. Limitations: To examine the program in a naturalistic setting, we did not employ a control group or follow participants beyond the completion of treatment. Conclusions: Unguided iCBT-I is effective for individuals in the community who experience insomnia and are likely experiencing comorbid mental health problems. These effects in the absence of guided contact strengthen the utility of unguided iCBT-I as a scalable and cost-effective method of disseminating treatments for this disorder.

119,"Self-disgust, loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults: An eye-tracking study","Background: Self-disgust has been associated with loneliness and mental health difficulties in clinical and non-clinical populations, but there is limited research on the role of self-disgust in loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults. Methods: In Study 1 ( N = 102; M age = 68.4 years, SD = 10.9, 68% females) we used a cross-sectional survey to explore the association between loneliness, self-disgust and mental health outcomes. In Study 2 ( N = 80; M age = 68.8 years, SD = 11.4, 57% females) we used eye-tracking to investigate attentional vigilance, maintenance and avoidance in individuals with high (vs. low) self-disgust. Results: In study 1 we found that self-disgust mediated the associations of loneliness with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and in study 2 it was demonstrated that older adults with high (vs. low) self-disgust displayed attentional avoidance to their own faces, compared to the faces of unknown others, a process that may perpetuate loneliness. Limitations: The cross-sectional design used in Study 1 limits our potential to make causal inferences. Additionally, both studies included a wide age range of older adults. Conclusions: Our findings are novel and highlight the importance of self-disgust experiences in the context of loneliness and mental health outcomes in older adults. Implications for practice and interventions against loneliness in this age group are discussed.

120,Clinical expression and treatment response among children with comorbid obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Background: Paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is highly comorbid with other psychological disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Preliminary evidence suggests that youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD may experience greater impairments than children with other comorbidities; however, there is limited research examining the clinical expression and treatment response of these youth. Methods: Youth (7 to 17 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD and comorbid ADHD ( n = 40) were compared a sample of age and gender matched youth with OCD and other comorbidity (without ADHD, n = 40). The study investigated symptoms, severity, functioning, comorbidity, family accommodation, in addition to parental psychopathology and rearing styles. Treatment response was investigated at post-treatment and six-month follow-up. Results: Youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD had fewer sexual obsessions, higher rates of comorbidity, poorer executive functioning and higher family impairment. Families of comorbid youth engaged in significantly more accommodation and reported more negative rearing. Finally, comorbid youth were significantly less likely to be responders or remitters at post-treatment. Limitations and Conclusions: Limitations include the cross-sectional design, relatively small clinical sample, and lack of an experimental control group of youth with ADHD without OCD. Current approaches to treatment may be improved for youth with comorbid OCD and ADHD by addressing cooccurring anxiety, behavioural difficulties, and maladaptive family accommodation and rearing. Moreover, given pronounced deficits in executive function, these youth may require a stronger initial dose of CBT to achieve an adequate response.

121,Psychometric properties of the Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) in suicide attempters and community controls of rural China,"Background: Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) were developed to measure four types of strain comprising value strain, deprivation strain, aspiration strain, and coping strain. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of 40-item PSS in suicide attempters and community controls of rural China. Methods: Data of this study came from the investigation of 132 suicide attempters and their paired community controls matched with the same sex, age (±3 years) and residence in five counties in rural Shandong, China. The Chinese version of PSS, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and the Self-esteem Scale (SES) were administered and reliability test and validity test of the PSS were conducted. Results: Cronbach's α and Guttman Spilt-Half coefficient of PSS was 0.942 and 0.842 for suicide attempters, and 0.950 and 0.874 for community controls. For both suicide attempters and community controls, the Exploratory Factor Analysis indicated a one-factor structure of each strain scale, which accorded with the original factor structure proposed by the authors. The scores of the total PSS and four subscales were positively correlated with the scores of CES-D and TAI; and negatively correlated with the score of SES, which indicated a good performance in convergent validity. Limitations: This study was limited to its generalizability to the Chinese urban population. Conclusions: The Chinese version of the 40-item PSS has satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity in Chinese rural suicide attempters and community controls.

122,Insomnia in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A Swedish population-based cohort study,"Background: The association between specific psychiatric disorders and insomnia is well established, but the prevalence of insomnia in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. This population-based study examined the prevalence of insomnia in patients with OCD compared to unaffected individuals from the general population and to their unaffected full siblings, and evaluated the contribution of psychiatric comorbidities to this association. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with OCD (31,856) were identified from a cohort of 13,017,902 individuals living in Sweden anytime during 1973 and 2013. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the odds of insomnia in individuals with OCD, compared to the general population and their unaffected full siblings. Sensitivity analyses were performed in subgroups from which all individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions were excluded, one at a time. Results: Individuals with OCD had almost 7-fold increased odds of receiving an insomnia diagnosis or being dispensed a drug with specific indication for insomnia, compared to unaffected individuals from the general population (42.2% vs. 11.0%, respectively; OR = 6.92 [95% CI, 6.76-7.08]). Familiar factors shared with siblings and comorbid conditions did not fully explain this association, but when individuals with comorbid depression and anxiety disorders were excluded, the odds of insomnia were significantly reduced (OR = 4.97 [95% CI, 4.81-5.14] and OR = 4.51 [95% CI, 4.33-4.69], respectively). Limitations: Due to the intrinsic coverage issues of the registers, results may not be generalizable to milder forms of the disorder and to individuals who do not seek help. Conclusions: Insomnia should be systematically evaluated and managed in individuals with OCD, particularly in those with comorbid anxiety and depression.

123,Pharmacological management of depression: Japanese expert consensus,"Background: Clinically relevant issues in the real-world treatment of depression have not always been captured by conventional treatment guidelines. Methods: Certified psychiatrists of the Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology were asked to evaluate treatment options regarding 23 clinical situations in the treatment of depression using a 9-point Likert scale (1 = “disagree” and 9 = “agree”). According to the responses of 114 experts, the options were categorized into first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Results: First-line antidepressants varied depending on predominant symptoms: escitalopram (mean ± standard deviation score, 7.8 ± 1.7) and sertraline (7.3 ± 1.7) were likely selected for anxiety; duloxetine (7.6 ± 1.9) and venlafaxine (7.2 ± 2.1) for loss of interest; mirtazapine for insomnia (8.2 ± 1.6), loss of appetite (7.9 ± 1.9), agitation and severe irritation (7.4 ± 2.0), and suicidal ideation (7.5 ± 1.9). While first-line treatment was switched to either an SNRI (7.7 ± 1.9) or mirtazapine (7.4 ± 2.0) in the case of non-response to an SSRI, switching to mirtazapine (7.1 ± 2.2) was recommended in the case of non-response to an SNRI, and vice versa (switching to an SNRI (7.0 ± 2.0) in the case of non-response to mirtazapine). Augmentation with aripiprazole was considered the first-line treatment for partial response to an SSRI (7.1 ± 2.3) or SNRI (7.0 ± 2.5). Limitations: The evidence level of expert consensus is considered low. All included experts were Japanese. Conclusions: Recommendations made by experts in the field are useful and can supplement guidelines and informed decision making in real-world clinical practice. We suggest that pharmacological strategies for depression be flexible and that each patient's situational needs as well as the pharmacotherapeutic profile of medications be considered.

124,The course of panic disorder during the peripartum period and the risk for adverse child development: A prospective-longitudinal study,"Background: Panic disorders during pregnancy and after delivery may have detrimental effects for mother and child, but no firm conclusions regarding the course and outcomes of peripartum panic disorders can be drawn from previous studies. Methods: N = 306 women were repeatedly interviewed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women. Social support and partnership quality, gestational outcomes, duration of breastfeeding, regulatory disorders, maternal bonding and parenting style were assessed via medical and maternal reports. Standardized observations of neuropsychological development, infant temperament and attachment were conducted 4 and 16 months after delivery. Results: Women reported heterogenous courses of panic disorders, and panic disorders/panic attacks were commonly observed during the early stages of pregnancy. Women with peripartum panic disorders presented with a worse psychosocial situation (e.g., lower social support). Clear behavioral differences (temperament, attachment) in infants of women with panic disorders as compared to women with no anxiety and depressive disorder could not be detected in this study, but differences concerning gestational outcomes, duration of breastfeeding, maternal parenting, and bonding as well as regulatory problems in infants were identified. Limitations: This prospective-longitudinal multi-wave study is restricted by the relative small sizes of the particular groups that limit the power to detect group differences. Conclusions: Heterogenous courses and outcomes of perinatal panic disorders require intensive monitoring of affected mother-infant-dyads who may benefit from early targeted interventions to prevent an escalation of dyadic problems.

125,Perceived parental support in childhood and adolescence as a tool for mental health screening in students: A longitudinal study in the i-Share cohort,"Background: Negative events in childhood are associated with increased risk of mental health problems, and evaluation could help identify students at high risk of mental health disorder. However, childhood adversity measures are difficult to implement in routine care. Perceived parental support in childhood and adolescence may be more easily assessed, as it is a rather neutral and non-intrusive question. Methods: We retrieved students’ health data collected from the French i-Share cohort, in a longitudinal population-based study including 4463 students of 18–24 years of age. Students in this cohort completed a self-reported questionnaire about major psychiatric problems at one-year follow-up. Results: Among 4463 participants, 26% reported a major mental health problem—including suicidal behavior (17%), major depression (7%), and severe generalized anxiety disorder (15%). Adjusted logistic regression revealed that a lower level of perceived parental support was significantly associated with higher risk of any mental health problem. Compared to students who reported extremely strong perceived parental support, students who perceived no support had a nearly 4-fold higher risk of mental health problems (aOR 3.80, CI 2.81–5.13). Lower levels of perceived parental support were dose-dependently associated with higher incidences of suicidal behavior, major depression, and severe generalized anxiety disorder. Limitations: Study limitations included a moderate follow-up response rate, and retrospective self-report questionnaires. Conclusion: Perceived parental support was strongly associated with the incidence of mental health problems among college students. If validated, these results suggest that health professionals should consider using this simple marker to improve mental health risk assessment and screening.

126,The learning effects and curves during high beta down-training neurofeedback for patients with major depressive disorder,"Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed increased beta activity in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety symptoms. Negative emotions and high beta activity could be decreased by a high beta down-training neurofeedback (NFB) protocol. The present study utilized three objective parameters—trainability, independence, and interpretability—to validate the effects of high beta down-training sessions. Methods: EEG data were collected from 23 patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety symptoms during high beta down-training sessions. Participants received five weeks of training, two sessions per week, to down-train high beta amplitude (20–32 Hz) at EEG sites P3 and P4. Three efficacy parameters were examined by comparing pre-training and post-training EEG. Results: The trainability index revealed the learning curves of reduced high beta activity at P3 and P4, confirming training effects across and within sessions. The independence index revealed only beta band activity decreased. The interpretability index revealed the decreased high beta activity was positively correlated with decreased severity of depression, especially for cognitive depression. Limitations: With only ten sessions in this study, it is unknown whether the NFB training caused extended and stable learning effects. Additionally, combining high beta down-training protocol with enhancing another target band could better ensure the desired changes in brain activity. Finally, the effect of medication on EEG cannot be excluded in present study. Conclusions: The trainability, independence and interpretability of the high beta down-training NFB protocol were confirmed, supporting the protocol's use in future research and clinical applications.

Chronotype was determined using item-5 from the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Univariate analyses and regression models were used to compare evening and non-evening chronotype in BD and chronotype association with clinical variables. Results: Overall, 205 (27%) of BD patients reported an evening chronotype. Evening chronotype was higher in a matched sub-sample of BD patients ( n = 150) than in controls (24% and 5% respectively, OR = 5.4, p &lt; 0.01). Compared to those with non-evening chronotypes, BD patients with an evening chronotype were younger, had an earlier age of onset of BD, and had more prior depressive and manic episodes, higher rates of rapid cycling, past suicide attempts, more comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. Multivariate regression showed age, prior suicide attempts, and co-occurring substance use disorder were associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 0.97 to1.59). Hypertension, migraine, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea were significantly associated with evening chronotype (OR range of 1.56 to 2.0). Limitation: Limitations include a cross-sectional study design that precludes establishing causality. Analyses did not control for medication use. Younger participant age may prevent evaluation of associations with late-life illnesses. Conclusions: Evening chronotype may be a discrete clinical subphenotype in BD and circadian dysfunction a shared pathophysiological mechanism between psychopathology and medical morbidity.

128,First-year French medical students consume antidepressants and anxiolytics while second-years consume non-medical drugs,"Background: : First year exams are a major source of stress amongst first-year medical students. Objective: : To explore antidepressant and anxiolytic consumption and addictive behavior of medical students before and after exams. Methods: : Medical students of the 35 French medical schools were recruited through mailing lists and social networks between December 2016 and May 2017 and completed online Internet anonymized questionnaires. Results: : Overall, 4345 medical students were included (3051 first year vs. 1294 second year). In multivariate analyses, compared to those in the first year of medicine, second year students were found to have lower anxiolytic (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 0.56, p = 0.01) and antidepressant consumption (aOR = 0.21, p &lt; 0.0001) but higher psychiatric follow-up (aOR = 1.95, p &lt; 0.0001) after adjustment for age, gender and relationship status. Whilst second year students reported slightly higher quality of life (especially for mental health), they also reported more daily tobacco smoking (aOR = 1.78, p &lt; 0.0001), more cannabis use disorders (aOR = 2.37, p &lt; 0.0001), hazardous drinking (aOR = 3.61, p &lt; 0.0001), and alcohol dependence (aOR = 3.66, p &lt; 0.0001). Second year medical students reported fewer difficulties relating to studying in comparison to first year students (aOR = 0.60, p &lt; 0.0001) yet they reported a higher rate of recreational drugs use with a variety of reasons including self-treatment of anxiety; disinhibition and to copy their peers (all p &lt; 0.05). Limits: : These results should be confirmed by longitudinal studies. Conclusion: : First year medical students who are faced with challenges relating to studying consume more antidepressants and anxiolytics, whilst second year students have a higher consumption of recreational drugs for a range of reasons. This suggests that the first two years at medical school are an important contributor to adverse mental health and therefore present a window of opportunity for preventative intervention.

129,"Risk factors for suicidal ideation in a large, registry-based sample of adult long-term childhood cancer survivors","Introduction: Long-term childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk for physical and psychosocial late effects. Previous research has attested to increased rates of suicidal ideation (SI) in CCS, an especially dangerous indicator of distress. However, little was known about risk factors of SI among CCS which go beyond illness- and treatment related variables. Methods: A registry-based sample of 916 adult long-term CCS ( M age = 34.58 years [SD = 5.53], M age at diagnosis = 6.15 years [ SD = 4.28]) underwent medical assessments and filled out questionnaires. We conducted a linear regression analysis on SI, testing predictors of different areas: sociodemographic, social, physical health and health behavior, and psychological distress symptoms. Results: SI was reported by 73 (8.0%) CCS and previous suicide attempts were reported by 26 (2.8%) CCS. SI was most closely related to social and psychological factors, i.e. to concurrent distress symptoms (depression, anxiety, social phobia), previous suicide attempts, current loneliness, and the present living situation. Limitations: SI and previous suicide attempts were assessed using short self-report instruments. The cross-sectional study design does not allow for causal inferences. Conclusions: Long-term CCS are a previously understudied, vulnerable group. Decades after having survived cancer, a considerable percentage is affected by (recurrent) SI. CCS’ risk for SI is likely shaped by individual medical and psychological history, and by the current social environment and psychological comorbidities. There is a need for more interdisciplinary research and for screening efforts which take account of these factors. Interventions reducing CCS’ risk of suicide should foster social integration and counteract current stressors.

130,Couples becoming parents: Trajectories for psychological distress and buffering effects of social support,"Background: Becoming a parent is a time of both joy and stress. Associations between exposure to postnatal depression and negative child outcomes underscore the importance of understanding trajectories and correlates of perinatal depression and anxiety. Methods: In a study of 438 expectant couples (from the UK, USA and Netherlands) tracked across four time-points (third trimester, 4, 14 and 24 months), we used dyadic latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) of self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression (CES-D, GHQ, STAI) to investigate the affective impact of becoming a parent. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses of anxious-depressive symptoms revealed a single latent factor with measurement invariance across time and parent. Dyadic LGCM intercepts showed greater prenatal problems in mothers compared with fathers. LGCM slopes revealed stable maternal problems but worsening paternal problems. Both intercepts and slopes showed significant within-couple associations. Controlling for prenatal salivary cortisol levels and perinatal couple relationship quality, support from friends attenuated mothers’ psychological distress and support from family reduced fathers’ psychological distress across the transition to parenthood. Limitations: Our sample was low risk (i.e., predominantly well-educated and affluent and no history of serious mental illness), limiting the generalizability of findings. In addition, the inverse association between psychological distress and social support may, in part, reflect the use of self-report for both measures. Conclusions: The international dyadic longitudinal design strengthens conclusions regarding variation in trajectories of psychological distress in both mothers and fathers. Crucially, social support appears pivotal in enabling new parents to flourish.

131,Association between traumatic spinal cord injury and affective and other psychiatric disorders–A nationwide cohort study and effects of rehabilitation therapies,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) and the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders, and the role of the rehabilitation therapies. Methods: In this population-based, retrospective cohort study, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to analyze the patients who were newly diagnosed with TSCI between 2000 and 2015 were included, with a 1:3 ratio by age, sex, and index year matched in the non-TSCI comparison group, for the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders. Results: In total, 5375 out of 16,151 patients with TSCI developed psychiatric disorders, and 1467 out of 48,543 patients in the non-TSCI group developed psychiatric disorders (2930.88 vs 2823.29 per 100,000 persons/year). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the TSCI cohort had a significantly higher risk of psychiatric disorders (log-rank, p &lt; 0.001). Fine and Gray's survival analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.977 (95% CI: 1.914–2.042, p &lt; 0.001). Rehabilitation therapies, including physical and occupational therapies, within 90 days after the injury, was associated with a lowered risk of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, in the TSCI cohort (adjusted HR = 0.702 [95% CI: 0.661–0.746, p &lt; 0.001]). In the subgroups with low, medium, and high intensity, rehabilitation therapies were associated with a lowered risk of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: TSCI was associated with the risk of affective and other psychiatric disorders, and rehabilitation therapies were associated with a lowered risk of these in the TSCI cohort.

132,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of postpartum depression,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and gravely disabling health concern. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved treatment for major depression and may be a valuable tool in the treatment of PPD. The treatment effect of rTMS is rapid, generally well tolerated, without systemic effects, and without medication exposure to a fetus and/or breastfed infant. Methods: Six women with PPD received 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over a 4 week period. Psychiatric rating scales (BDI, EPDS, STATI), cognitive assessments (MMSE, Trails B, List Generation) and breastfeeding practices were surveyed at baseline and post rTMS treatment. BDI and EPDS were obtained weekly, as well as 3 months and 6 months post study conclusion. Results: Average BDI, EPDS, and STAI scores declined over the 4-week duration of rTMS treatment. Of the six patients, four achieved remission as assessed by EPDS and one achieved remission and two responded as assessed by BDI. Mean BDI and EPDS scores at 3 and 6 months follow-up remained below levels at study entry. No evidence of cognitive changes or breastfeeding disruptions. Limitations: This was an exploratory study with small sample size with no sham control arm. Daily administration of rTMS provides potential for confounding of behavioral activation in the otherwise often isolative postpartum period. Conclusions: rTMS was safe and well tolerated among participants with evidence of sustained improvements in depression and anxiety scores. This study supports rTMS as a promising non-pharmacologic treatment modality for perinatal depression.

133,The speed of progression towards obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Background: There is current interest in the elaboration of early intervention programs for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To this end, it is important to investigate the speed of progression from subthreshold symptoms to diagnosable OCD. In this study, we have retrospectively investigated the speed of progression towards full-blown OCD and sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with a faster transition. Methods: Patients enrolled in the Brazilian Research Consortium on Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders ( N = 954) were interviewed with a comprehensive assessment battery that included the interval (in years) between the onset of subthreshold OCD symptoms and the onset of full-blown OCD. Results: It took a median of 7 years (interquartile range: 2–13 years) for subthreshold symptoms to convert to diagnosable OCD. Faster OCD onset was associated with lower age at the time of assessment, male gender, being in new romantic states as precipitants for compulsions, greater severity of sexual/religious symptoms and lower severity of hoarding and YBOCS compulsions severity scores, greater rates of generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia without panic disorder, and negative family history for OCD. Limitations: The retrospective design of this study allowed for susceptibility to memory bias about age at onset of OCD symptoms. We were unable to capture progressions taking less than 12 months. Conclusions: We could identify a specific phenotype that was more likely to escalate rapidly to clinical levels within this large clinical sample. This phenomenon may be particularly relevant in the context of selecting individuals for early intervention initiatives in situations when resources are scarce.

134,Accelerated magnetic seizure therapy (aMST) for treatment of major depressive disorder: A pilot study,"Background: Magnetic Seizure therapy (MST) is an emerging treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) that is associated with fewer cognitive side effects compared to electroconvulsive therapy. The present pilot study sought to investigate whether daily MST treatments were associated to antidepressant effect and assess cognitive side effects associated with an accelerated MST (aMST) treatment schedule. Methods: Fifteen MDD patients underwent a six-day course of MST treatment to the vertex following assessment of symptom severity and neuropsychological testing. The primary outcome was severity on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-item (HRSD-17). Patient also underwent neuropsychological assessment with the RBANS and Stroop Colour-Word test. Results: There were no instances of delirium or disturbance of consciousness following aMST sessions. Patients showed significant decreases on indices of depression and anxiety symptoms, with 9 (60%) patients showing a clinical response and 7 (47%) patients experiencing remission. Significant improvements were reported in RBANS total score, as well as indices of immediate memory and delayed memory. No changes at follow-up were reported for visuospatial/constructional, language, and attention RBANS indices, nor for Stroop Colour/Word performance. Limitations: The results should be interpreted with caution as they are part of a non-randomized, open-label pilot study. Further, the short duration of the study does not provide longitudinal follow-up to determine whether treatment response lasts a meaningful duration of time. Conclusions: aMST well tolerated without significant evidence of cognitive side effects and rapid improvement in symptoms. Further research is required to fully characterize these changes and replicate them in independent samples.

135,Everyday life experiences and mental health among conflict-affected forced migrants: A meta-analysis,"Background: There are a growing number of forced migrants worldwide. Early detection of poor adjustment and interventions to facilitate positive adaptation within these communities is a critical global public health priority. A growing literature points to challenges within the post-migration context as key determents of poor mental health. Aims: The current meta-analysis evaluated the association between daily stressors and poor mental health among these populations. Method: A systematic search in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified relevant studies from inception until the end of 2018. Effect sizes (correlation coefficients) were pooled using Fisher's Z transformation and reported with 95% confidence intervals. Moderator and mediator analyses were conducted. The protocol is available in PROSPERO [CRD42018081207]. Results: Analysis of 59 eligible studies ( n = 17,763) revealed that daily stressors were associated with higher psychiatric symptoms ( Z r = 0.126–0.199, 95% CI = 0.084–0.168, 0.151–0.247, p &lt; 0.001) and general distress ( Z r = 0.542, 95% CI = 0.332–0.752, p &lt; 0.001). Stronger effect sizes were observed for mixed daily stressors relative to subjective, interpersonal, and material daily stressors, and for general distress relative to posttraumatic stress symptoms and general well-being. Effect sizes were also stronger for children and adolescents relative to adults. Daily stressors fully mediated the associations of prior trauma with post-migration anxiety, depressive, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides a synthesis of existing research on the role of unfavorable everyday life experiences and their associations with poor mental health among conflict-affected forced migrants. Routine assessment and intervention to reduce daily stressors can prevent and reduce psychiatric morbidity in these populations.

136,"Prevalence of depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders, in Quebec, Canada","Background: The prevalence of mood disorders was estimated at 5.4% according to the latest Canadian survey. It has been suggested to use administrative data and self-reported data to optimize the estimation for mental health care in the population. Using administrative data, algorithms (combination of codes from the International Classification of Diseases) had been previously developed to identify the population with mood and anxiety disorders. However, the specific prevalence of each component of mood disorders (depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders) are still unknown in Quebec, Canada. Objective: To 1) identify the population diagnosed respectively with depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders in administrative data, and 2) provide annual prevalence estimates of each component. Method: Data were extracted from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System and the entire population of Quebec (2000–2017) was included in this study (8.3 million; 2017). The prevalence of depressive, bipolar and adjustment disorders were estimated using specific algorithms. Results: The annual prevalence of depressive disorders was 3.7% in 2000–2001; it decreased to 2.8% in 2016–2017. In comparison, the prevalence of bipolar disorders was 0.8% in 2000–2001, decreasing to 0.6% in 2016–2017, and the prevalence of adjustment disorders was 1.3% in 2000–2001 and increased to 1.6% in 2016–2017. Conclusion: Using specific algorithms, we observed that the trend of adjustment disorders is increasing while trends of depressive and bipolar disorders are decreasing. Further studies should assess if the related burden of care respectively follows the same trends as policy makers’ allocations of resources may need to be adapted.

137,Mothers’ emotions after pediatric burn injury: Longitudinal associations with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms 18 months postburn,"Background: Various emotions are implicated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Longitudinal studies examining temporal associations between emotions and posttraumatic stress may reveal who is at risk of chronic psychological problems. This study examined the longitudinal relationships of mothers’ trauma-related emotions with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms after pediatric burn injury. Methods: Data from two cohort studies were used ( n = 296). Mothers reported the intensity of burn-related emotions within the first month (T1) and 12 months postburn (T2). The Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-D; depression subscale) were administered at T1 and 18 months postburn (T3). Results: Based on two exploratory factor analyses, emotion variables were combined into acute and long-term basic emotions (fear, sadness, horror, anger) and self-conscious emotions (guilt, shame). The path model showed a positive relationship between acute and long-term basic emotions. Higher long-term basic emotions were related to persistence of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Acute self-conscious emotions showed associations with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms at T1 and were longitudinally related to depressive, but not posttraumatic stress, symptoms. Limitations: The posttraumatic stress measure was not based on DSM-5 PTSD criteria and results require replication using these criteria. Conclusions: This study suggests that mothers’ acute self-conscious and long-term basic emotions in relation to their child's burn injury are involved in the development of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Clinically, assessing and monitoring parents’ early posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms and burn-related emotions may be useful to identify parents at risk.

138,Association of poorer dietary quality and higher dietary inflammation with greater symptom severity in depressed individuals with appetite loss,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of years lived with disability; however, little is known about its etiology to inform treatment. For a subset of MDD patients, appetite change and/or bodily inflammation may play a role in exacerbating symptoms. The goal of this study is to examine whether, relative to healthy comparisons (HC), MDD individuals with increased versus decreased appetite symptoms show a differential relationship between diet quality and inflammation. Methods: Unmedicated current MDD ( n = 61) varying in appetite change (decrease (MDD-DE): n = 39; increase (MDD-IN): n = 22) and HC ( n = 42) completed 24-hour dietary recall and state depression/anxiety measures. Healthy eating and dietary inflammatory indices were calculated from dietary reports. Blood samples measured five inflammation-related biomarkers. Analyses investigated between- and within-group differences in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), inflammation-related blood biomarkers, and symptom severity. Results: While both MDD-DE and MDD-IN exhibited lower HEI scores than HC, only MDD-IN showed higher plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels than HC. In contrast, MDD-DE exhibited higher DII scores than MDD-IN and HC. Within MDD-DE, greater symptom severity was associated with lower HEI and higher DII. Limitations: Modest sample sizes and the cross-sectional study design limited power to detect within-MDD effects. Conclusions: Although MDD, regardless of appetite change, is linked to poorer dietary quality, depression severity was related to dietary characteristics only in subjects who reported appetite loss. Thus, increasing the quality of dietary intake could be a treatment target for some individuals with depression.

139,Purpose in life is a robust protective factor of reported cognitive decline among late middle-aged adults: The Emory Healthy Aging Study,"Background: Cognitive abilities tend to decline in advanced age. A novel protective factor of cognitive decline in advanced age is purpose-in-life (PiL), a trait-like tendency to derive life meanings and purpose. However, whether PiL protects against cognitive decline in late-middle-age is unclear. Hence, we examined the association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline, one of the earliest detectable cognitive symptoms before the onset of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we used a machine learning approach to investigate whether PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered with the known protective and risk factors for cognition. Methods: PiL was assessed with a 10-item questionnaire and perceived cognitive decline with the Cognitive Function Instrument among 5,441 Emory Healthy Aging Study participants, whose mean age was 63 and 51% were employed. Association between PiL and perceived cognitive decline was examined with linear regression adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Elastic Net was performed to identify the most robust predictors of cognitive decline. Results: Greater PiL was associated with less perceived cognitive decline after adjusting for the relevant factors. Furthermore, Elastic Net modeling suggested that PiL is a robust predictor of cognitive decline when considered simultaneously with known protective (education, exercise, enrichment activities) and risk factors for cognition (depression, anxiety, diagnosed medical, mental health problems, smoking, alcohol use, family history of dementia, and others). Limitation: This is a cross-sectional study. Conclusions: PiL is a robust protective factor of perceived cognitive decline observed as early as middle age. Thus, interventions to enhance PiL merit further investigation.

140,Alexithymia as a possible specifier of adverse outcomes: Clinical correlates in euthymic unipolar individuals,"Background: Alexithymia is a disabling condition frequently linked to major depressive disorder (MDD) and able to enhance symptoms severity and suicide risk. This study aimed to clarify whether patients with and without alexithymia may differ concerning illness presentation and clinical course, which is a major gap in the scientific literature. Methods: The present sample included 381 euthymic outpatients with MDD recruited at the Department of Neuroscience (DINOGMI), University of Genoa. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and additional rating scales (Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Intent Score Scale (ISS) were administered to all participants. Results: Alexithymic patients were more likely to have lower educational level (11.6 ± 3.2 vs. 12.4 ± 3.4, p ≤ .05), have used previous psychiatric drugs (85.7% vs. 72.8%, p = .001), use current antidepressants (84.7% vs. 69.4%, p = &lt;.001), and have higher cardiological comorbid disorders (10.7% vs. 5.0%, p = ≤ .05). After multivariate analyses, alexithymia was associated with lower educational level (OR = 0.928, p = .05), and higher current antidepressants use (OR 2.302, p = .01); difficulties in identifying feelings were associated with lower educational level ( p = ≤ .005), higher psychiatric comorbidity ( p = ≤ .001), and previous psychiatric medications ( p = .01). Furthermore, having a lower educational level remained the only factor associated with both difficulties in communicating feelings ( p = ≤ .001) and thoughts oriented to external context ( p = ≤.005). Limitations: The study is limited by the small sample size and its cross-sectional nature. Conclusions: Alexithymia appears a useful specifier of adverse outcomes, associated with distinct socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Its identification would allow to provide a more personalized care.

141,Efficacy of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder reporting childhood or recent trauma,"Background: This analysis investigates the efficacy of vortioxetine in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who report childhood or recent trauma. Methods: Patient-level data were analyzed from 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled short-term studies investigating the efficacy of vortioxetine (5–20 mg/day) versus placebo in patients (18–75 years old) with DSM-IV-TR– defined MDD. Changes from baseline to week 8 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were examined at the individual study level and as in meta-analysis. A long-term relapse prevention study of 5 and 10 mg of vortioxetine was also analyzed. Traumatic events history was recorded at baseline. Results: Sixty-one percent of subjects (1113/1811) reported trauma history in the short-term studies. A significant effect vs. placebo was observed for vortioxetine on MADRS (10 mg, –2.2, P = .025; 20 mg, –4.4, P &lt; .001), HAM-A (20 mg, –1.60, P = .012), CGI-I (5 mg, –0.3, P = .028; 10 mg, –0.3, P = .013; 20 mg, –0.50, P = .009), and SDS (20 mg, –2.3, P = .007) in patients with any trauma (childhood and/or recent). In the relapse prevention study, 51% (198/392) of subjects reported a history of trauma. Subjects with any trauma (childhood and/or recent) randomized to placebo were significantly more likely to relapse than subjects treated with vortioxetine (hazard ratio 2.8, P = .0019). Limitations: An exploratory analysis. Discussion: Vortioxetine showed significant short- and long-term efficacy on depressive and anxiety symptoms and overall functioning in this large subpopulation of MDD patients with a history of trauma. A significantly lower risk of relapse was also observed with vortioxetine.

142,Socio-demographic and psychiatric risk factors in incident and persistent depression: An analysis in the occupational cohort of ELSA-Brasil,"Background: Depression is a main source of disability worldwide. Identifying risk factors associated with incident and persistent episodes could inform clinical practice and hence mitigate their burden. However, previous research has focused on populations from developed countries. Thus, we evaluated sociodemographic risk factors and psychiatric comorbidities associated with incident and persistent depression in a large Brazilian occupational cohort. Methods: We examined baseline (2008–2010, n = 15,105) and follow-up (2012–2014) data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Based on the presence of depression diagnosis at two timepoints, we diagnosed persistent and incident depression. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to explore risk factors associated with incident and persistent depression. As gender is associated with the exposure and outcome variables, analyses stratified by gender were also conducted. Results: Presence of any anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and female gender were significant ( p &lt; 0.001) risk factors for depression incidence (odds ratios of 2.59, 3.6, and 1.82, respectively) and persistence (odds ratios of 6.94, 14.37, and 2.85, respectively) in multiple models, whereas having university degree decreased the odds of depression incidence (0.74) and persistence (0.45). In stratified analyses, the effects of low education were only evident in women. Limitations: Brief depressive episodes could not be measured by our assessments. Conclusion: In this occupational cohort, female gender, low education and psychiatric comorbidities were associated with unfavorable depression courses. Interventions targeting comorbidities could prevent depression incidence and persistence.

143,The programming role of maternal antenatal inflammation on infants’ early neurodevelopment: A review of human studies,"Background: Maternal inflammation during pregnancy is a frequently proposed mechanism underlying the link between maternal antenatal physical (e.g. infections, immune disease, obesity) and/or psychological (e.g. depression, anxiety) conditions and child outcomes. However, the extent to which maternal inflammation is directly associated with offspring's early development and health in humans remains largely unknown. Methods: In this review, empirical findings on the prospective association between maternal prenatal levels of inflammatory markers and infants’ neurodevelopmental outcomes are summarized. Fifteen studies were included with sample sizes ranging from 36 to 6016 mother-infant dyads and average overall quality score 9.53 (range 6–12). Results: Findings concerning the link between maternal antenatal inflammation and, respectively, infants’ health and birth outcomes, stress reactivity or cognitive development are mixed. However, it is noteworthy that all higher quality studies (scores &gt; 10) reviewed here do find evidence of an association between levels of inflammation, mostly as indexed by Interleukin-6 (IL-6), in healthy women across the whole gestation and offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes, including structural and functional brain alterations. Limitations: The correlational nature of the findings and conspicuous methodological heterogeneity across studies make drawing strong conclusions premature. Conclusions: Findings, albeit preliminary, are consistent with animal studies and speak in favor of a role of maternal antenatal inflammation in shaping fetal development with possible long-term effects.

144,Patient interest in mental health mobile app interventions: Demographic and symptom-level differences,"Background: Mobile app interventions for mental health conditions (MH apps) are an accessible and effective but underutilized treatment option. Learning which patients are most interested in MH apps is important for informing stakeholders where to position these treatments within the healthcare landscape. This study examined the relationship between patient characteristics and interest in MH apps. Methods: A demographically-balanced sample of 400 patients diagnosed with depression, anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder were identified from VA corporate data warehouse records. These individuals were mailed an information packet explaining the study and the study survey for those who opted to participate. The survey contained questions on demographics, symptom severity and interest in MH apps. 149 participants returned completed surveys. Results: Level of interest in MH apps was consistent across race, sex and education level. Patients reporting no interest in MH apps had less severe symptoms and were older than patients reporting some or high interest. Limitations: Participants were Veterans in one geographic region; our sample size was not large enough to evaluate more fine-grained demographic differences; replication would be required to better understand generalizability of findings. Conclusions: Findings suggest interest in MH apps may be more similar across demographic groups than previously thought. This stands in juxtaposition to interest in clinic-based services, for which men and minorities have traditionally reported less interest and show lower utilization. Findings also counter prevailing notions that MH apps will be best received by less symptomatic patients. Implications for integrating MH apps into care are discussed.

145,Reverse translation of major depressive disorder symptoms: A framework for the behavioural phenotyping of putative biomarkers,"Background: Reverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is complex because Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogenous condition. This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant bio-behavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptoms. Methods: This systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of MDD and anti-depressant treatment response including the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in laboratory rodents. Results: The resulting battery of tests includes passive coping, anxiety-like behaviours, sleep, caloric intake, cognition, psychomotor functions, hedonic reactivity and aversive learning. These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD, providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be interpreted. Limitations: Certain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents, and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevance. Conclusions: Using this reverse translation approach, it is possible to clarify the functional significance of a putative biomarker in rodents and hence translate its contribution to specific clinical symptoms, or clusters of symptoms.

146,"The programming role of maternal antenatal inflammation on infants’ early neurodevelopment: A review of human studies: Special Section on “Translational and Neuroscience Studies in Affective Disorders” Section Editor, Maria Nobile MD, PhD","Background: Maternal inflammation during pregnancy is a frequently proposed mechanism underlying the link between maternal antenatal physical (e.g. infections, immune disease, obesity) and/or psychological (e.g. depression, anxiety) conditions and child outcomes. However, the extent to which maternal inflammation is directly associated with offspring's early development and health in humans remains largely unknown. Methods: In this review, empirical findings on the prospective association between maternal prenatal levels of inflammatory markers and infants’ neurodevelopmental outcomes are summarized. Fifteen studies were included with sample sizes ranging from 36 to 6016 mother-infant dyads and average overall quality score 9.53 (range 6–12). Results: Findings concerning the link between maternal antenatal inflammation and, respectively, infants’ health and birth outcomes, stress reactivity or cognitive development are mixed. However, it is noteworthy that all higher quality studies (scores &gt; 10) reviewed here do find evidence of an association between levels of inflammation, mostly as indexed by Interleukin-6 (IL-6), in healthy women across the whole gestation and offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes, including structural and functional brain alterations. Limitations: The correlational nature of the findings and conspicuous methodological heterogeneity across studies make drawing strong conclusions premature. Conclusions: Findings, albeit preliminary, are consistent with animal studies and speak in favor of a role of maternal antenatal inflammation in shaping fetal development with possible long-term effects.

147,Differences in the immune-inflammatory profiles of unipolar and bipolar depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD) both share increased immune-inflammatory activation. However, there are unclear patterns of differences in peripheral immune profiles between them. Methods: We examined such differences in 245 MDD and 59 BD patients, recruited in the same center, who were in an acute depressive episode of moderate severity. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models were used to compare levels of plasma biomarkers between groups and to predict dichotomous classification. Results: Interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, IL-12 and IL-10 were significantly higher in MDD than in BD, whereas IL-6, sTNFR2, IL-18, IL-33, ST2 (IL1R Like 1) and KLOTHO were significantly higher in BD than in MDD. Moreover, logistic regression analyses correctly classified BD and MDD patients with 98.1% accuracy, using a combination of IL-6, IL-8, ST2, sTNFR2 (directly associated with BD) and IL-12 and TNF-α (directly associated with MDD). Patients with MDD with melancholic features showed higher IL-1β levels than those without melancholia. The sTNFR1 / sTNFR2 ratio significantly predicted MDD and state and trait anxiety and negative affect. Results remained significant after covariate adjustment, including drug use. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Lack of control comparison group. Differences in exposure to medications among participants. Conclusions: Differences in immune profiles between BD and MDD patients exist, especially for the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS): increased IL-10 is the primary immune-regulatory mechanism in MDD, while increased sTNFR2 and KLOTHO are the primary regulatory mechanisms in BD.

148,Search trends preceding increases in suicide: A cross-correlation study of monthly Google search volume and suicide rate using transfer function models,"Background: Various associations between monthly Google search volumes (MGSVs) and monthly suicide rates (MSRs) have been reported. However, these studies often analyzed a limited number of search terms using suboptimal statistical methods. While controlling for spurious associations, this study examined a wide array of suicide-related search terms to elucidate if their MGSVs correlated with future MSRs. Methods: MGSVs of 111 candidate suicide-related terms were calculated by averaging 10 time-series data per term obtained from Google Trends. Box-Jenkins transfer function modeling was applied to time-series data of MGSV and MSR among the total, male, and female populations of the United States between 2004 and 2017. Cross-correlation coefficients between MGSVs and MSRs were calculated at lags -3, -2, and -1. Sensitivity analysis identified cross-correlations whose direction and significance ( p &lt; 0.05) persisted in two other time spans: 126 and 84 months. Results: Eighty-nine terms were analyzed. MGSVs of 31 terms significantly correlated with MSRs in the total, male, or female population. In the sensitivity analysis, three terms stably exhibited significant positive correlation: “ generalized anxiety disorder ” (total; lag -3), “ anxiety disorder ” (total and male; lag -3), and “ laid off ” (total, male, and female; lag -2). The term sleep problem (total and female; lag -1) consistently showed significant negative correlations. Limitations: Sex- or age-specific search-volume data, lags of less than a month, and potential confounding factors of MGSV and MSR were not explored. Conclusions: trends in MGSV of four terms tend to precede changes in MSR. These terms may enable more accurate forecasting of future suicides.

149,The predictive performance of the Bipolarity Index in a Dutch epidemiological sample manuscript,"Background: No instrument exists that can predict the incidence of bipolar disorders (BD). The Bipolarity index (BI), originally developed to improve diagnostic confidence for a lifetime diagnosis of BD, may predict incident BD. Aim: To assess the predictive performance of the BI for incident BD in persons with a lifetime depression. Methods: The BI score was composed from different questionnaires and interviews in n = 1857 subjects without BD and with a lifetime unipolar depressive disorder from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a longitudinal cohort study. The incidence of DSM-IV defined BD I or II as a criterion diagnosis was established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years of follow-up. Cox regression analyses calculated whether the BI predicts incident BD during 9-years of follow-up. The area Under the Curve (AUC) was determined. At the optimal cut-off score, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated. Results: Over the course of 9 years, bipolar conversion occurred in n = 46 subjects (2.5%). Each point increase in BI score significantly predicted incident BD (HR[95%CI]= 1.047[1.018–1.076], p = 0.001). The AUC was 0.61 (95%CI: 0.54–0.68). At the optimal cut-off of 30, sensitivity was 67%, specificity 52%, PPV 3% and NPV 98%. Limitations: Not all items of the BI were fully covered; mean age of the sample of 42. Conclusion: The BI score predicts bipolar conversion over 9 years in those with a lifetime depression. However, given the modest performance metrics, the BI cannot guide clinical decision making yet.

150,Mental health diagnoses and early removal of long-acting reversible contraception,"Background: Having a mental health diagnosis is associated with contraceptive non-adherence and user-related contraceptive failures of short-acting methods. There is a lack of research on the relationship between mental health diagnoses and early discontinuation of highly effective long-acting reversible (LARC) methods such as the intrauterine device (IUD) and subdermal implant (SDI). Methods: Using a Primary Care and Obstetrics and Gynecology Patient Data Registry, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between any mental health diagnosis (any anxiety disorder or depression) and early LARC removal (&lt; 1 year post-insertion) among 385 reproductive-aged (14–50 years) women in 2008–16. Adjusted logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Almost 10% ( n = 37) of the sample had an early LARC removal, of which 62.2% were hormonal IUD and 37.8% were SDI. Women with a mental health diagnosis had a higher prevalence of early LARC removal (13.6% vs. 8.0%, p = =.090). Although non-significant, there was a trend in adjusted analyses indicating twice the odds of early removal for women with a mental health diagnosis versus no diagnosis (OR = =2.04, 95% CI = =0.97–4.27). Limitations: This study is limited by a small sample size and availability of variables from a reportable medical record database. Pregnancy intentions and side effects of method use could not be accounted for which may have impacted timing of removal. Conclusions: Understanding why women choose early LARC removal can inform counseling to help women make informed choices about their contraceptive method that meets their reproductive needs.

151,Sedentary behavior and depression among community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years: Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing,"Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) may be a risk factor for depression in middle- and old age adults. The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between SB and depression in a large national sample of Irish people aged 50 and older taking into account a wide range of previously identified influential factors. Methods: Data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing survey were analyzed (wave 1: 2009–2011, wave 2: 2012–2013). Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Total weekday SB and control variables were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted to assess the associations. Results: The final sample consisted of 6903 individuals aged ≥ 50 years (63.6 ± 9.2 years; 52.1% female). After full adjustment for age, gender, social class, current smoking, physical activity, mobility, pain, cognition, chronic physical conditions, disability, anxiety, loneliness, and social network, the association between SB and depression was not statistically significant (OR = 1.06; 95%CI = 0.60–1.89). Mediation analysis showed that the association is explained by social network (mediated percentage 23.1%), physical activity (20.3%), loneliness (13.2%), chronic physical conditions (11.1%), and disability (7.9%). Cross-sectional analysis showed that SB is significantly associated with depression even after full adjustment. Limitations: SB was self-reported. Conclusions: Factors closely linked with SB such as social isolation, loneliness, physical inactivity, chronic physical conditions, and disability may play a major role in depression among middle-aged and older people. Lifestyle interventions focusing on reductions in depression in this population need to consider these factors.

152,A randomized clinical trial investigating perceived burdensomeness as a mediator of brief intervention effects on posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and impairing condition that often involves difficulties with interpersonal functioning. Targeting interpersonal difficulties may be a promising alternative approach to reducing PTSD symptoms, particularly given the relatively low rates of treatment engagement and efficacy for first-line treatments for PTSD. Recent research has identified perceived burdensomeness (i.e., feelings of being a burden on others) and thwarted belongingness (i.e., feeling isolated and as if one does not belong) as two specific interpersonal factors related to increased PTSD symptoms. Thus, the current study tested whether a brief, computerized intervention would reduce PTSD symptoms via reductions in perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, vs. a repeated contact control condition. Method: Hypotheses were tested among 250 trauma-exposed participants who were randomized to receive one of two active computerized interventions designed to target interpersonal factors (i.e., perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness) or anxiety sensitivity, or participate in a repeated contact control condition, as part of a larger randomized clinical trial. Participants were then followed over six-months. Results: Results indicated a direct effect of the active interventions on PTSD symptoms at month-one, that was not detected at months three or six. However, there was a significant indirect effect of condition at all-time points, such that reductions in perceived burdensomeness mediated condition effects on PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Findings identify perceived burdensomeness as a potential etiological factor in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms, and suggest that targeting perceived burdensomeness may be an effective approach to reducing PTSD symptoms.

153,Intimate partner violence and maternal mental health ten years after a first birth: An Australian prospective cohort study of first-time mothers,"Background: We aimed to assess the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and maternal mental health ten years after a first birth Methods: 1507 first-time mothers completed questionnaires at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postpartum and 4 and ten years post the index birth. Exposure to IPV was assessed using the Composite Abuse Scale at 1, 4 and ten years. Standardised measures of depressive (CES-D), anxiety (BAI) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL-C) were completed at ten-year follow-up. Results: One in three (34%) women experienced IPV between the birth of their first child and their child turning 10. For the one in six women (18.6%) who experienced IPV in the year prior to ten-year follow-up, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 38.9% compared with 14.2% for women who never reported IPV (adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–4.5). Prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 28.1% compared with 8.5% (AdjOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0–5.9); and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms was 41.9% compared with 11.3% (AdjOR 4.9, 95% CI 3.0–7.9). Limitations: Mental health symptoms and exposure to IPV were assessed by self-report and may be subject to misclassification bias as a result of non-disclosure. Conclusions: The high prevalence of mental health symptoms among women exposed to IPV in the ten years after giving birth coupled with the extent of post-traumatic stress symptoms and co-morbid mental health symptoms reinforce the need to provide appropriate care and referral pathways to women in the decade after having a baby. Recognition of the context of IPV and nature of mental health concerns is needed in tailoring responses.

154,Affective temperaments in caregiver of patients with bipolar disorder and their relation to caregiver burden,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is impose a severe burden on caregivers. The aspects of the burden should be evaluated from broad perspective, because caregivers contribute greatly to the treatment process. Affective temperaments are widely distributed in the population, in their mild forms can provide adaptive properties. The aim of this study was to assess the affective temperaments among caregiver of patients with BD and to evaluate the impact of affective temperaments on the burden. Methods: The study sample included 101 caregivers of patients diagnosed with BD type I according to DSM-5 and 107 healthy volunteers. The Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego self-report questionnaire (TEMPS-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were administered to both groups, and the Burden Assessment Scale (BAS) was administered to caregivers. Results: The hyperthymic and depressive temperament scores were higher in the caregivers than in the controls, and hyperthymic and depressive temperaments were predictor factors for caregiver. Irritable temperament also adversely affected the caregiver burden, but hyperthymic temperament was not related to development of burden. The mean BAS score was 43.2 ± 11 for the caregivers. The caregiver HDRS and HARS scores and the number of manic episodes were related to the level of burden. Limitation: Cross-sectional study Conclusion: Affective temperaments may be related to being a caregiver and to the caregiver burden. Hyperthymic and depressive temperaments may indicate predisposition for being a caregiver. Irritable temperament adversely affects burden, whereas hyperthymic temperament could protect the caregiver from burden.

155,Latent structure and factor invariance of somatic symptoms in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15),"Background: Somatic symptoms are highly prevalent in primary care although insufficiently understood. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) is a valuable screening test but it has not yet been possible to unequivocally demonstrate its latent structure and measurement invariance. Methods: A total of 1,255 patients from 28 primary care centres suffering symptoms of anxiety, depression or somatisation participated in a clinical trial. They completed the PHQ-15 at baseline and 374 retook it at three months. Exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) was used to compare three models: 1) a single global factor for somatisation, 2) four specific correlated factors, and 3) a bifactor model integrating the first two models. Results: A multi-group invariance analysis of the best-fit model was performed: the bifactor model (χ² = 25.17, df = 23, p = 0.34, RMSEA = 0.009, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 0.999). Strict invariance was good for both gender (RMSEA = 0.046, CFI = 0.973, TLI = 0.963) and age (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.964, TLI = 0.962). Configural and metric invariance were confirmed for moment of assessment, but scalar invariance was not. Limitations: The two main limitations were the sample (primary care patients with emotional disorders), which was not representative of the general population, and the utilisation of ESEM (vs. confirmatory factor analysis), which did not allow a second-order factor model to be tested. Conclusions: PHQ-15 showed a bifactor structure, providing both a single global measure of somatisation and specific measures of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary and fatigue factors. Its factor invariance with regard to both gender and age was confirmed.

156,Modulation of the inflammatory response benefits treatment-resistant bipolar depression: A randomized clinical trial,"Objective: The goal of this study was to reduce treatment resistance and enhance antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBDD) by modulating inflammatory activation. Methods: Forty-seven TRBDD patients completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled two-arm study using celecoxib (CBX), a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in combination with escitalopram (ESC). The Hamilton Depression (17-Item) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scales were used to quantify symptom severity. Self-rating instruments included BDI, BAI and QLES-Q questioner. An adverse events inventory was used, and the possibility of bleeding diathesis was monitored. Complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined. Comparison of mood scores between the CBX and PBO groups were conducted using a mixed ANOVA and an Independent Sample Student t -test. Results: The CBX adjunctive treatment produced significantly more responders and remitters than the PBO arm. Compared to the PBO group ( n = 20), the CBX group ( n = 27) experienced lower depression severity through the entire course of the study, showing significant decrease in depression and anxiety scores as early as week 1. Except for initial mild nausea, no adverse events were reported and study medications were well tolerated. Conclusions: Modulation of the inflammatory response through targeted inhibition of the enzyme COX-2 by means of CBX reduces TRBDD and augments and accelerates treatment response in an efficacious and safe manner. Future studies should replicate these findings and additionally investigate whether prolonged administration of CBX is required to maintain remission by adding a discontinuation phase to the study design.

157,Socio-demographic and clinical risk factors of treatment-resistant depression: A Danish population-based cohort study,"Background: Knowledge of risk factors of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes to understand the underlying mechanisms and to identify patients at risk. However, there is still a lack of studies on how different risk factors associate with TRD. The objective of this study was to determine the independent association of several socio-demographic and clinical risk factors with TRD. Methods: 194.074 patients with a first-time hospital contact for depression identified in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) from 1996 through 2014 were followed for TRD for 12 months after diagnosis. Socio-demographic and clinical risk factors were identified in nation-wide registries. Data were analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazard Regression and Fine-Gray model for competing mortality risk. Results: Indicators of disease severity (recurrent depression (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.17 (1.14–1.20)), severity of depression (aHR 2.01 (1.95–2.08)), admission to a psychiatric ward (aHR 2.03 (1.96, 2.10)) were strong risk factors. Aged 65–84 (aHR 1.96 (1.83–2.10)), lost labor market affiliation ((aHR 1.12 (1.08, 1.16)), cohabiting (aHR 1.27 (1.23, 1.30)), comorbid anxiety (aHR 1.18 (1.10–1.27)), insomnia (aHR 1.27 (1.06–1.51)), migraine (aHR 1.42 (1.16–1.73)) and use of psychotropic drugs was also associated with higher rates of TRD. Limitations: Information on drug use during hospitalization was not available. Information on rating scales could have provided a more precise assessment of symptom severity and treatment response. Conclusions: Besides indicators of disease severity, other important risk factors associated with TRD are age, lost labor market affiliation, cohabiting with a partner as well as anxiety, insomnia, migraine and the use of psychotropic medications.

158,"The role of self-compassion in the relationship between attachment, depression, and quality of life","Background: Self-compassion may be shaped by early attachment experiences, and has been linked to mental health and well-being. This study examined the role of two distinct features of self-compassion, self-warmth and self-coldness, in the relationship between attachment insecurity and depression as well as quality of life in a general population sample in Germany. Methods: Participants ( N = 2,253; 53.4% female, M age 50 years) completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Adult Attachment Scale (AAS), Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Mediation analysis was used to examine whether insecure attachment predicted increased symptoms of depression and decreased quality of life through decreased self-warmth and increased self-coldness. Results: Attachment-related anxiety and avoidance had a significant direct effect on depressive symptoms and significant indirect effect via self-warmth and self-coldness. The indirect effect via self-warmth appears to be of negligible magnitude. Attachment-related anxiety and avoidance had a significant direct effect on quality of life, and significant indirect effect via self-coldness. The indirect effect via self-warmth was not statistically significant, speaking against self-warmth as a relevant mediator. Limitations: Causal conclusions cannot be drawn based on cross-sectional research design. All measures were based on participant self-report. Conclusions: This study contributes to a more differentiated understanding of how attachment insecurity and self-compassion may contribute to affective disorders. Findings suggest that self-coldness may be particularly relevant in affective disorders and when addressing relational struggles, with both theoretical and clinical implications for psychotherapy and future research.

159,Connectivity between the anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex links early symptom improvement to treatment response,"Background: Early improvement (EI) following treatment with antidepressants is a widely reported predictor to the treatment response. This study aimed to identify the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and its related clinical features that link the treatment response at the time of EI. Methods: This study included 23 first-episode treatment-naive patients with MDD. After 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment, these patients received 3.0 Tesla resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and were subgrouped into an EI group ( N = 13) and a non-EI group ( N = 10). Using the anterior insula (rAI) as a seed region, this study identified the rs-FC that were associated with both EI and the treatment response at week 12, and further tested the associations of the identified rs-FC with either the clinical features or the early symptom improvement. Results: Rs-FC between rAI and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was associated with EI ( t ₂₁ = −6.091, p = 0.022 after FDR correction for multiple comparisons). This rs-FC was also associated with an interaction between EI and the treatment response at the week 12 ( t ₂₁ = −5.361, p = 6.37e-5). Moreover, among the clinical features, this rs-FC was associated with the early symptom improvement in the insomnia, somatic symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, and these early symptom improvements were associated with the treatment response. Conclusion: Rs-FC between the rAI and the left dlPFC played a crucial role in the early antidepressant effect, which linked the treatment response. The early treatment effect relating to rAI may represent an early symptom improvement in self-perceptual anxiety, somatic symptoms and insomnia.

160,Bisexual individuals are at greater risk of poor mental health than lesbians and gay men: The mediating role of sexual identity stress at multiple levels,"Background: Although earlier studies have indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals are at greater risk of psychiatric symptoms than heterosexual individuals, limited attention has been paid to the mental health disparities within LGB populations, especially in non-Western societies. This study examined the disparities in depression, anxiety, and mental well-being between gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals and investigated how the disparities are explained by the greater sexual identity stress experienced by bisexual individuals compared to their gay and lesbian counterparts. Methods: The study sample included 931 cisgender LGB individuals in Hong Kong, with 70.1% identifying as gay/lesbian and 29.9% identifying as bisexual. They completed a self-report questionnaire on sexual identity stress and mental health. Results: Bisexual individuals showed higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than lesbians and gay men. Structural equation modeling showed that, compared with lesbians and gay men, bisexual individuals were more likely to report identity uncertainty, conceal their sexual orientation, and have a weaker sense of connection to the LGBT community, which were in turn associated with greater affective symptoms and poorer mental well-being. Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data does not allow conclusions on causal relationships among variables. Conclusions: Given the greater vulnerability of bisexual individuals to common mental health problems, evidence-based psychological interventions that strategically target their identity stress at multiple levels should be developed and made available to those in need. Social and psychoeducational interventions are also necessary to transform the monosexist culture and eradicate binegativity in the LGBT and wider communities.

161,The comorbidity of mental and physical disorders with self-reported chronic back or neck pain: Results from the China Mental Health Survey,"Background: To investigate mental and physical health comorbidity with chronic back or neck pain in the Chinese population, and assess the level of disability associated with chronic back or neck pain. Methods: Data were derived from a large-scale and nationally representative community survey of adult respondents on mental health disorders in China ( n = 28,140). Chronic back or neck pain, other chronic pain conditions and chronic physical conditions were assessed by self-report. Mental disorders were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Role disability during the past 30 days was assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS-II). Results: The 12-month prevalence of chronic back or neck pain was 10.8%. Most of respondents with chronic back or neck pain (71.2%) reported at least one other comorbid condition, including other chronic pain conditions (53.4%), chronic physical conditions (37.9%), and mental disorders (23.9%). It was found by logistic regression that mood disorders (OR = 3.7, 95%CI:2.8–4.8) showed stronger association with chronic back or neck pain than anxiety disorders and substance disorders. Most common chronic pains and physical conditions were significantly associated with chronic back or neck pain. Chronic back or neck pain was associated with role disability after controlling for demographics and for comorbidities. Physical and mental comorbidities explained 0.7% of the association between chronic back or neck pain and role disability. Conclusions: Chronic back or neck pain and physical-mental comorbidity is very common in China and chronic back or neck pain may increase the likelihood of other physical and mental diseases. This presents a great challenge for both clinical treatment and public health education. We believe that further study needs to be conducted to improve the diagnostic and management skills for comorbidity conditions.

162,Electronic cigarette use and mental health: A Canadian population-based study,"Background: To examine the association between electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use and adverse mental health status. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the 2015 and 2016 Canadian Community Health Survey ( n = 53,050). Sampling weights and associated bootstrap procedures were used to account for survey design effects. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to examine the association between e-cigarette use and the following mental health outcomes: depressive symptom ratings (using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9), self-reported professionally diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, perceived mental health, suicidal thoughts/attempts, and binge drinking. Results: The overall prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.6–3.1). 11.5% (95% CI: 10.4–12.7) of smokers reported also using e-cigarettes. Dual users had the highest prevalence of adverse mental health status. The association between e-cigarette use and mental health was found to be modified by smoking status and sex in most of the logistic models. E-cigarettes had less than multiplicative effects among smokers. Female e-cigarette users tended to have higher odds of adverse mental health than male users. Overall, in the multivariable modeling, e-cigarette use was consistently associated with poor mental health among non-smokers and women, a finding that persisted after adjustment for additional covariates. Conclusions: These results indicate that e-cigarette use is associated with adverse mental health status, particularly among the non-smoking general population and women. Limitations: The study relied on respondent self-report, and the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to clarify the direction of this association.

163,"Temporal stability of symptoms of affective disorders, cognitive vulnerability and personality over time","Background: Signs and symptoms of psychopathology can be chronic but are generally regarded as less stable over time than markers of cognitive vulnerability and personality. Some findings suggest that these differences in temporal stability are modest in size but a rigorous examination across concepts is lacking. The current study investigated the temporal stability of affective symptoms, cognitive vulnerability markers and personality traits at various assessments over nine years. Methods: Participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were assessed at baseline and reassessed after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years. They were grouped on the basis of waves of depression and anxiety CIDI-diagnoses into stable healthy ( n = 768), stable patients ( n = 352) and unstable patients ( n = 821). We determined temporal stability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and consistency indices of latent state-trait analyses (LST). Results: Temporal stability was moderate to high for symptoms (range ICC's 0.54–0.73; range consistency 0.64–0.74), cognitive vulnerability (range ICC's 0.53–0.76; range consistency 0.60–0.74) and personality (range ICC's 0.57–0.80; range consistency.60 -0.75). Consistency indices for all measures were on average a bit lower in the unstable group (ICC = 0.54) compared to the stable groups (ICC = 0.61). Overall stability was similarly high after 2, 4, 6 and 9 years. Conclusion: The 9-year stability over time of symptoms of affective disorders and that of indices of cognitive vulnerability and personality are remarkably similar and relatively high.

164,White matter connectivity differences between treatment responders and non-responders in patients with panic disorder,"Background: Panic disorder (PD) is a prevalent and highly disabling mental condition. However, less is known about relationships between biomarkers that may together predict a better response to pharmacological treatment. The objective of the present study was to compare the brain white matter (WM) connectivity between treatment-responsive patients with panic disorder (RPD) and non-responsive patients with panic disorder (NRPD) after 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Methods: Sixty-four patients with PD were enrolled in this study (RPD, n = 37; NRPD, n = 27). All patients were examined by using magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered at baseline of the study. Fractional anisotropy (FA) data were compared using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: TBSS results showed that the FA values of the patients with NRPD were significantly higher than of those with RPD in the WM regions such as the precentral gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, posterior parts of the corpus callosum, and precuneus. Symptom severity scales, such as ASI-R scores, showed significant positive correlations of the FA values with the fronto-temporal WM regions in NRPD. Conclusions: These results suggest that structural changes to areas such as the fronto-limbic regions and the posterior part of default mode network, could influence medication response in PD. Further studies with a larger number of patients should be performed to confirm our findings.

165,Sedentary behavior relates to mental distress of pregnant women differently across trimesters: An observational study in China,"Background: The independent effect of sedentary behavior (SB) on maternal mental health is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the different relationships of SB with maternal distress in pregnant women across the three trimesters, controlling for the confounding factors including physical activity (PA), diet and gestational weight gain. Methods: Survey data were collected from 1272 participants in different trimesters of pregnancy. The data were divided into three data sets based on trimester, and regression analysis was conducted on each data set. Both the linear and quadratic relationships between SB and mental distress were estimated. Results: There was no significant association between SB and any mental distress symptoms in the first trimester. In the second trimester, SB was positively associated with higher mental overall distress symptoms (β = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001), including depress and anxiety. There is an inverted-U shaped curvilinear relationship between SB and mental distress in the third trimester, as SB-squared is significantly associated with mental overall distress (GSI: β = -0.65, P = 0.002, depression: β = -0.53, P = 0.014, anxiety: β = -0.46, P = 0.031). Limitations: The data were collected from only one city in China, which may limit the generalizability of the findings for all Chinese women. This was an observational study and causality cannot be established. Conclusion: This study found that the relationship between SB and maternal mental distress depends on trimesters. The stage of pregnancy should be considered when designing interventions for pregnant women to change SB to reduce mental distress.

In the original article, a sentence in the acknowledgement was incorrect. The corrected expression is: “Dr. Yoder, Dr. Weathers, Mr. Bernick, and Ms. Akiyama have no conflicts of interest to declare.” (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-05830-003). Background: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) is a widely used self-report measure of PTSD. The reliability/precision and validity of the updated PCL version for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (PCL-5) have only been evaluated in limited populations. This study aimed to examine the factor structure, reliability/precision, and validity of the PCL-5 as assessed by convergent and discriminant relationships with related constructs among Japanese individuals who experienced various traumatic events. Methods: We conducted an online survey of Japanese adults using the PCL-5 and other assessments for PTSD, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric comorbidities, and functionality. A total of 3090 individuals who met a probable diagnosis of PTSD and another 1837 who had experienced traumatic events but did not meet the probable PTSD diagnosis answered the questionnaires. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the best fit with a 7-factor model. This factor structure was temporally stable across 2 time points for 4 months. The total and subscale scores showed good internal consistency and modest test-retest reliability. The convergent and discriminant relationships of the PCL-5 total score with related constructs were demonstrated. Limitations: This study did not use the gold standard interview to assess the diagnostic status of PTSD. Also, the sampled population was younger and had lower incomes in comparison to the census data. Conclusions: Our results support the utility of the PCL-5 for assessing PTSD symptoms in Asian populations.

3,Face pareidolia in the brain: Impact of gender and orientation,"Research on face sensitivity is of particular relevance during the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic leading to social isolation, but also calling for intact interaction and sharing. Humans possess high sensitivity even to a coarse face scheme, seeing faces in non-face images where real faces do not exist. The advantage of non-face images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Here by implementing a novel set of Face-n-Thing images, we examined (i) how face tuning alters with changing display orientation, and (ii) whether it is affected by observers’ gender. Young females and males were presented with a set of Face-n-Thing images either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180˚ in the image plane. Face impression was substantially impeded by display inversion. Furthermore, whereas with upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face inversion effect in general. Moreover, the findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions related to the current pandemic (such as depression and anxiety), most of which are gender/sex-specific.

4,"The 10-year course of mental health, quality of life, and exile life functioning in traumatized refugees from treatment start","Refugee patients with severe traumatic experiences may need mental health treatment, but treatment results vary, and there is scarcity of studies demonstrating refugees’ long-term health and well-being after treatment. In a 10-year naturalistic and longitudinal study, 54 multi-origin traumatized adult refugee patients, with a background of war and persecution, and with a mean stay in Norway of 10.5 years, were recruited as they entered psychological treatment in mental health specialist services. The participants were interviewed face-to-face with multiple methods at admittance, and at varying points in time during and after psychotherapy. The aim was to study the participants’ trajectories of symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, four aspects of quality of life, and two aspects of exile life functioning. Linear mixed effects analyses included all symptoms and quality of life measures obtained at different times and intervals for the participants. Changes in exile life functioning was investigated by exact McNemar tests. Participants responded to the quantitative assessments up to eight times. Length of therapy varied, with a mean of 61.3 sessions ( SD = 74.5). The participants improved significantly in symptoms, quality of life, and exile life functioning. Improvement in symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression yielded small effect sizes ( r = .05 to .13), while improvement in quality of psychological and physical health yielded medium effect sizes ( r = .38 and .32). Thus, long-time improvement after psychological therapy in these severely traumatized and mostly chronified refugee patients, was more notable in quality of life and exile life functioning than in symptom reduction. The results imply that major symptom reduction may not be attainable, and may not be the most important indication of long-term improvement among refugees with long-standing trauma-related suffering. Other indications of beneficial effects should be applied as well.

5,Psychological responses during the COVID-19 outbreak among university students in Bangladesh,"Mental health problems in students are considered a public health challenge. We assessed the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) with the DASS-21, as well as associated factors, among university students in Bangladesh early in the COVID-19 outbreak. We hypothesized high levels of DAS and their associations with previously reported factors (e.g., poor sleep, lack of exercise, heavy internet use) and those linked to disadvantage (e.g., low monthly family income). We also enquired about participants’ satisfaction with their pursuit of their academic studies while living under COVID-19 restrictions. An internetbased survey was conducted during the month of April 2020, involving 3,122 Bangladeshi university students aged 18 to 29 years (59.5% males; mean age 21.4 ± 2 years). Prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and stress were, respectively, 76.1%, 71.5% and 70.1% for at least mild symptoms, 62.9%, 63.6% and 58.6% for at least moderate symptoms, 35.2%, 40.3%, and 37.7% for at least severe symptoms and 19.7%, 27.5% and 16.5% for at least very severe symptoms. The present estimates of DAS were more prevalent than in previous pre-COVID-19 studies among Bangladeshi university students. Regression analyses with DASS-21-score as a dependent variable revealed associations with factors mostly as hypothesized. The largest effect size on DAS symptoms was related to students’ satisfaction with their academic studies during the pandemic. As this survey used cross-sectional and self-reported methods, causality cannot be inferred.

6,Five-year post-disaster mental changes: Mothers and children living in low-dose contaminated Fukushima regions,"It has been almost 10 years since the accident at Tokyo Electric Power Co., Inc.’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March 2011. This study elucidates changes in the mental states of mothers and children residing in low-dose radiation contaminated regions within Fukushima Prefecture over a five-year period after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. From 2011 to 2015, questionnaire surveys assessing psychological symptoms, including posttraumatic stress disorder-related responses, depressive responses, and stress responses, and radiation protection behaviors were conducted with 18,741 mothers of children aged four, 18, and 42 months. Mothers’ and children’s psychological symptoms and mothers’ radiation protection behaviors were highest in 2011, immediately following the nuclear accident, but decreased over time. However, even in 2015, psychological symptoms and radiation protection behaviors were higher for children and mothers within Fukushima Prefecture than for those in a control group living in regions outside the area, which were minimally affected by the accident. The results suggest that the psychological effects in mothers and children living in low-dose radiation contaminated areas continued for at least five years after the accident. Furthermore, psychological effects in children born after the incident were likely to have been triggered by the parental behavior of mothers who were negatively affected by anxiety and stress. This finding raises concerns regarding the accident’s longlasting psychological effects in mothers and children living in low-contamination regions.

7,"Depression, anxiety symptoms, insomnia, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic period among individuals living with disabilities in Ethiopia, 2020","Background: People with disabilities face multiple barriers that prevent them from accessing care and essential information related to the COVID-19 pandemic that poses additional stress and psychopathology. Therefore, the investigation of psychopathologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and emergency response is critical. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 scale, insomnia severity index-7, and brief resilient coping scale were administered to participants. The collected data was then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical procedures were employed to describe the various psychopathologies. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value &lt;0.05 was declared as statistically significant. Results: A significant proportion of individuals living with disability had psychopathologies; 46.2% for depression symptoms, 48.1% for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and 71% for insomnia symptoms. Nearly 45.7% of participants were low resilient copers to their psychopathology. Depression was significantly higher in divorced/widowed/separated (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.28–8.92, P-value = 0.006), non-educated (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.90, Pvalue = 0.001), and unemployed (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.11, P-value = 0.005) as well as a daily laborer (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.20, 4.89, P-value = 0.014) subjects. Generalized anxiety disorder was also significantly higher in young age (&lt;40 years) (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.98, P-value = 0.02), single (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.3, P-value = 0.011), widowed/ divorced/separated (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.78, P-value = 0.032), preparatory school completed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.46, P-value = 0.001), daily laborer (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.23, P-value = 0.003), and unemployed (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.78, P-value = 0.005) participants. Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, P-value = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), unemployed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.03, P-value = 0.001), blind (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.42, 6.35, P-value = 0.001), and deaf (AOR = 10.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 35.33, P-value = 0.002) participants. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent among individuals with a disability during the COVID-19 period. Multiple sociodemographic and disability-related factors were associated with this high psychopathology. Attention has to be given by the government and other stakeholders to intervene in psychopathology and its associated factors.

8,Developing and validating the Psychosocial Burden among people Seeking Abortion Scale (PB-SAS),"While there is a large body of research demonstrating that having an abortion is not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, less research has examined which factors may contribute to elevated levels of mental health symptoms at the time of abortion seeking. This study aims to develop and validate a new tool to measure dimensions of psychosocial burden experienced by people seeking abortion in the United States. To develop scale items, we reviewed the literature including existing measures of stress and anxiety and conducted interviews with experts in abortion care and with patients seeking abortion. Thirty-five items were administered to 784 people seeking abortion at four facilities located in three U.S. states. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce items and identify key domains of psychosocial burden. We assessed the predictive validity of the overall scale and each sub-scale, by assessing their associations with validated measures of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression using multivariable linear regression models. Factor analyses revealed a 12-item factor solution measuring psychosocial burden seeking abortion, with four subdomains: structural challenges, pregnancy decision-making, lack of autonomy, and others’ reactions to the pregnancy. The alpha reliability coefficients were acceptable for the overall scale (α = 0.83) and each subscale (ranging from α = 0.82–0.85). In adjusted analyses, the overall scale was significantly associated with stress, anxiety and depression; each subscale was also significantly associated with each mental health outcome. This new scale offers a practical tool for providers and researchers to empirically document the factors associated with people’s psychological well-being at the time of seeking an abortion. Findings suggest that the same restrictions that claim to protect people from mental health harm may be increasing people’s psychosocial burden and contributing to adverse psychological outcomes at the time of seeking abortion.

9,The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) applied to Ethiopian cancer patients,"Psychological distress is a common problem associated with cancer. The main objective of the present study was to test the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a sample of Ethiopian cancer patients and to compare the results with those obtained from a sample in Germany. Data were collected from 256 cancer patients who visited the University of Gondar Hospital between January 2019 and June 2019 using the HADS, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory MFI-20. The reliability of the HADS was good, with Cronbach’s α coefficients of 0.86 (anxiety), 0.85 (depression), and 0.91 (total scale). The Ethiopian cancer patients were more anxious (M = 7.9) and more depressed (M = 9.3) than the German patients (M = 6.8 for anxiety and M = 5.5 for depression). Only a weak level of measurement invariance was detected between the Ethiopian and the German sample. In the Ethiopian sample, anxiety and depression were associated with tumor stage (high levels in stage 4) and treatment (high levels for patients not receiving surgery and chemotherapy). Both anxiety and depression were significantly associated with all of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and MFI-20 scales. The HADS proved to be applicable for use with Ethiopian cancer patients. The high level of anxiety and depression present in that group indicates a need for psychosocial care.

10,Medical education in times of COVID-19: German students’ expectations—A cross-sectional study,"Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of medical students, medical faculties have faced the challenge of adapting instruction to digital platforms. Although medical students are willing to support pandemic response efforts, how the crisis will affect their medical training remains uncertain. Thus, in this study, we investigated the teaching- and learning-related stressors and expectations of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to undergraduate medical students at medical faculties in Germany. Students answered questions about COVID-19 and teaching (on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (""not at all"") to 6 (""completely"")) and completed mental well-being measurements, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Perceived Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive data analysis, a t-test and Pearson correlations were performed to process the data. Results: Medical students felt well-informed about COVID-19 in general ( M = 5.64, SD = 1.28) and in the medical context ( M = 5.14, SD = 1.34) but significantly less informed about the pandemic in the academic context, M = 2.47, SD = 1.49, t (371) = 31.98, p &lt; .001. Their distress levels were high (STAI: M = 45.12, SD = 4.73) and significantly correlated with the academic context ( r p = .164, p &lt; .01) but not their private lives. Concerning how they were taught, they most often expected online lectures (91.7%) and live broadcasts (67.2%) and less often expected innovative digital teaching strategies, including serious games (17.3%) and virtual-reality exercises (16.7%). Discussion: Medical students seem to be aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for academic and healthcare contexts. They also seem to think that their teachers will enhance their digital competencies during the pandemic. Therefore, faculties of medicine need to rapidly and adequately digitalise their approaches to teaching.

11,Predictors of maternal parenting self-efficacy for infants and toddlers: A Jordanian study,"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the predictors of maternal parenting self-efficacy when the children concerned are in the early years of life. Method: A descriptive-analytical research study was carried out among 213 women who were in the early months of the postpartum period and attending healthcare facilities in Irbid, Jordan. The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and the Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy (PMP S-E) tool were used to collect the data. Results: A significant correlation was found between the scores in self-efficacy and the quality of marriage relations (B = 3.56, P = 001), family income (B = 1.97, P = .05), employment (B = 4.027, P = .027), education (B = 2.48, P = .004), and living with extended family (B = 5.28, P = .02). Conclusion: The findings of this study show that MPSE is significantly associated with various predictors. These predictors are the mother's education, income, whether she lives with extended family, her quality of marriage, and her employment. Maternal anxiety was found not to be a predictor for MPSE and this may explain other factors such as social support and living with extended family. Implication: It is essential for nurses to understand maternal parenting self-efficacy, therefore, including the concept of maternal parenting self-efficacy in nursing curricula can help raise awareness of this important concept. Understanding maternal parenting self-efficacy is necessary for nurses to evaluate the mothers' parenting self-efficacy.

12,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist, rosiglitazone, ameliorates neurofunctional and neuroinflammatory abnormalities in a rat model of Gulf War Illness","Background: Gulf War (GW) Illness (GWI) is a debilitating condition with a complex constellation of immune, endocrine and neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. We studied a novel model of GWI based on 3 known common GW exposures (GWE): (i) intranasal lipopolysaccharide, to which personnel were exposed during desert sand storms; (ii) pyridostigmine bromide, used as prophylaxis against chemical warfare; and (iii) chronic unpredictable stress, an inescapable element of war. We used this model to evaluate prophylactic treatment with the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (ROSI). Methods: Rats were subjected to the three GWE for 33 days. In series 1 and 2, male and female GWE-rats were compared to naïve rats. In series 3, male rats with GWE were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with ROSI (GWE-ROSI) or vehicle. After the 33-day exposures, three neurofunctional domains were evaluated: cognition (novel object recognition), anxiety-like behaviors (elevated plus maze, open field) and depression-like behaviors (coat state, sucrose preference, splash test, tail suspension and forced swim). Brains were analyzed for astrocytic and microglial activation and neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1, tumor necrosis factor and translocator protein). Neurofunctional data from rats with similar exposures were pooled into 3 groups: naïve, GWE and GWE-ROSI. Results: Compared to naïve rats, GWE-rats showed significant abnormalities in the three neurofunctional domains, along with significant neuroinflammation in amygdala and hippocampus. There were no differences between males and females with GWE. GWE-ROSI rats showed significant attenuation of neuroinflammation and of some of the neurofunctional abnormalities. Conclusion: This novel GWI model recapitulates critical neurofunctional abnormalities reported by Veterans with GWI. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with ROSI was beneficial in this model.

13,"Antidepressive effect of an inward rectifier K &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker peptide, tertiapin-RQ","Renal outer medullary K + channel, ROMK (Kir1.1, kcnj1) is expressed in the kidney and brain, but its role in the central nervous system remains unknown. Recent studies suggested an involvement of the ROMK channel in mental diseases. Tertiapin (TPN) is a European honey bee venom peptide and is reported to selectively block the ROMK channel. Here, we have chemically synthesized a series of mutated TPN peptides, including TPN-I8R and -M13Q (TPN-RQ), reported previously, and examined their blocking activity on the ROMK channel. Among 71 peptides tested, TPN-RQ was found to block the ROMK channel most effectively. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed the essential roles of two disulfide bonds and the circular structure for the blockade activity. To examine the central role, we injected TPN-RQ intracerebroventricularly and examined the effects on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. TPN-RQ showed an antidepressive effect in tail-suspension and forced swim tests. The injection of TPN-RQ also enhanced the anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and light/dark box tests and impaired spontaneous motor activities in balance beam and wheel running tests. Administration of TPM-RQ suppressed the anti-c-Fos immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, without affecting immunoreactivity in antidepressant- related nuclei, e.g. the dorsal raphe nucleus and locus coeruleus. TPN-RQ may exert its antidepressive effects through a different mechanism from current drugs.

14,The psychological states of people after Wuhan eased the lockdown,"It has been two months since Wuhan eased the lockdown and the people of Wuhan have been under great pressure during COVID-19. The psychological status among healthcare workers and residents were barely know due to the lack of research after Wuhan eased of the lockdown. The purpose of this study was to assess people’s mental health and the changes after Wuhan eased the lockdown. A cross-sectional online study among citizens in Wuhan was conducted. Among 1417 participants, 387(27.0%) were frontline healthcare workers and 1035(73.0%) were residents from the general public. Their COVID-19 psychological status was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Results show that 16.1%,22.3% and 17.2% healthcare workers and 21.2%, 16.7% and 17.2% general public had symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD ranging from moderate to severe. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between healthcare workers and the general public. The decreased income and the frequent social media exposure are the risk factors for general public. Compared to the early COVID-19 epidemic period, the proportion of anxiety and depression among both the general public and health workers decreased after Wuhan eased the lockdown.

15,"Rapid assessment of psychological and epidemiological correlates of COVID-19 concern, financial strain, and health-related behavior change in a large online sample","COVID-19 emerged in November 2019 leading to a global pandemic that has not only resulted in widespread medical complications and loss of life, but has also impacted global economies and transformed daily life. The current rapid response study in a convenience online sample quickly recruited 2,065 participants across the United States, Canada, and Europe in late March and early April 2020. Cross-sectional findings indicated elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to historical norms, which were positively associated with COVID-19 concern more strongly than epidemiological data signifying risk (e.g., world and country confirmed cases). Employment loss was positively associated with greater depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern, and depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern were significantly associated with more stringent self-quarantine behavior. The rapid collection of data during the early phase of this pandemic is limited by under-representation of non-White and middle age and older adults. Nevertheless, these findings have implications for interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection.

16,Vitiligo and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting skin disease which is often accompanied by mental distress. There are numerous studies dedicated to local and global prevalence of depression in patients with vitiligo but anxiety has not been recognized as a major mental problem within named population. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety among patients with vitiligo from different countries and to compare it with patients suffering from eczema, psoriasis, and acne. Methods: In November 2019, we conducted a systematic search for observational studies that examined the prevalence of anxiety in vitiligo patients. Fifteen studies comprising 1176 patients with vitiligo were included to our systematic review. Results: The general prevalence of anxiety among vitiligo patients was equal to 35.8%. Statistically significant difference in anxiety rates was found among female and male patients (47.32% vs 42.4%) ( P = 0.03), but the clinical relevance of this issue remains arguable. In addition, the pooled odds ratio among vitiligo and non-vitiligo patients did not indicate a statistical significance among patients coming from different continents. Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of anxiety among vitiligo patients worldwide was comparable to other severe skin disorders. This finding accentuates the necessity of anxiety awareness in management of patients with skin diseases.

17,Diurnal variation of motor activity in adult ADHD patients analyzed with methods from graph theory,"Attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by age-inappropriate levels of motor activity, impulsivity and attention. The aim of the present study was to study diurnal variation of motor activity in adult ADHD patients, compared to healthy controls and clinical controls with mood and anxiety disorders. Wrist-worn actigraphs were used to record motor activity in a sample of 81 patients and 30 healthy controls. Time series from registrations in the morning and evening were analyzed using measures of variability, complexity and a newly developed method, the similarity algorithm, based on transforming time series into graphs. In healthy controls the evening registrations showed higher variability and lower complexity compared to morning registrations, however this was evident only in the female controls. In the two patient groups the same measures were not significantly different, with one exception, the graph measure bridges. This was the measure that most clearly separated morning and evening registrations and was significantly different both in healthy controls and in patients with a diagnosis of ADHD. These findings suggest that actigraph registrations, combined with mathematical methods based on graph theory, may be used to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the diurnal regulation of motor activity.

18,"Comparative analysis of clinical, physiological, temperamental and personality characteristics of elderly subjects and young subjects with asthma","Background: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease of a complex etiology in which genetic, environmental and personality variables are important factors determining the development of complicated strategies related to coping with stress and temperament traits. Our thesis is that coping styles in asthmatic patients are modified by the environment (chronic inflammation and stress) which affects individual temperament traits in the course of time. Thus, patient age is one of factors which determine the clinical image of asthma and its natural history. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the variables describing stress coping styles and temperament in young (18 to 35 years old) and elderly asthmatics (aged ≥ 60 years). Material and methods: A total of 200 patients, 104 elderly and 96 young asthmatics were enrolled in the study. Apart from medical examination, the following tests were performed in all subjects: the Formal Characteristics of Behavior- Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI), Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale. Results: Elderly patients with asthma exhibited higher intensity of anxiety as a trait, a higher level of depression and experienced dyspnea, as well as higher levels of stress coping strategies such as Avoidance-Oriented Coping (AOC), Distraction Seeking (DS) and Social Diversion (SD) compared to young asthmatics. In elderly patients, Perseverance and Sensory Sensitivity traits have been observed to decline with the duration and development of asthma at later life stages as opposed to young asthmatics, in whom these temperament characteristics are elevated. Conclusions: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease of a complex etiopathogenesis that has a complex interplay with mental health. The present study confirms a relationship between age and stress coping strategies as well as temperament traits.

19,"The Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Reliability, validity, and relation to coping behavior","COVID-19 is spreading worldwide, causing various social problems. The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to ascertain FCV-19S effects on assessment of Japanese people’s coping behavior. After back-translation of the scale, 450 Japanese participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing platform. These participants responded to the Japanese FCV-19S, the Japanese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the Japanese versions of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD), which assesses coping behaviors such as stockpiling and health monitoring, reasons for coping behaviors, and socio-demographic variables. Results indicated the factor structure of the Japanese FCV-19S as including seven items and one factor that were equivalent to those of the original FCV-19S. The scale showed adequate internal reliability (α = .87; ω = .92) and concurrent validity, as indicated by significantly positive correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety, r = .56; depression, r = .29) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD; perceived infectability, r = .32; germ aversion, r = .29). Additionally, the FCV-19S not only directly increased all coping behaviors (β = .21 - .36); it also indirectly increased stockpiling through conformity reason (indirect effect, β = .04; total effect, β = .31). These results suggest that the Japanese FCV-19S psychometric scale has equal reliability and validity to those of the original FCV-19S. These findings will contribute further to the investigation of various difficulties arising from fear about COVID-19 in Japan.

20,"Psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality, and wellbeing in New Zealand during the COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study","New Zealand’s early response to the novel coronavirus pandemic included a strict lockdown which eliminated community transmission of COVID-19. However, this success was not without cost, both economic and social. In our study, we examined the psychological wellbeing of New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown when restrictions reduced social contact, limited recreation opportunities, and resulted in job losses and financial insecurity. We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders in April 2020. The survey contained three standardised measures–the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the GAD-7, and the Well-Being Index (WHO-5)–as well as questions designed specifically to measure family violence, suicidal ideation, and alcohol consumption. It also included items assessing positive aspects of the lockdown. Thirty percent of respondents reported moderate to severe psychological distress (K10), 16% moderate to high levels of anxiety, and 39% low wellbeing; well above baseline measures. Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18–34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting ‘silver linings’, which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealand’s lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing.

21,"The anxious addictive narcissist: The relationship between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, anxiety symptoms and Facebook addiction","Vulnerable narcissism and grandiose narcissism share the core of the narcissistic self but are considered as separate forms of this personality trait. While previous research mainly focused on the mechanisms that connect grandiose narcissism and addictive use of the social platform Facebook, it remained unclear why individuals with enhanced levels of vulnerable narcissism are at risk to develop Facebook Addiction (FA). The present study investigated the links between vulnerable and grandiose narcissism, anxiety symptoms, and FA. In a sample of 327 Facebook users (age: M ( SD ) = 23.67(3.96), range: 18-56), both forms of narcissism were positively related to anxiety symptoms and FA. Moreover, the association between both forms of narcissism and FA was partly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Results enter new territory by revealing hidden similarities between vulnerable and grandiose narcissists, emphasizing that similar mechanisms might explain their enhanced risk to develop addictive tendencies of Facebook use. These findings should be considered when assessing individuals at risk for FA and when developing (therapeutic) intervention programs to deal with problematic use of social platforms.

22,"Latent structure of secondary traumatic stress, its precursors, and effects on people working with refugees","The study aims to examine the latent structure of secondary traumatic stress (STS), its precursors, and the psychological effects of it on the population of service providers working with refugees passing through the Balkan route. A total of 270 service providers (57% female) of different professional backgrounds working directly with refugees took part in the study. Participants were assessed for STS using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, the extent of secondary exposure to trauma (i.e., clients’ traumatic experiences from the countries of origin and travel that were communicated to them directly), depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Comparisons of several confirmatory factor analyses following prominent PTSD conceptualizations showed that the model with three relatively distinct but highly correlated factors–intrusion, avoidance, and the blend of negative alterations in cognitions, mood, and reactivity (NACMR), had the best fit. STS has been shown to be positively correlated both with the amount of different traumatic experiences that were communicated to them as well as with the specific content of those experiences. Path analysis showed that the amount of secondary exposure to the clients’ traumatic experiences during travel, but not in the country of origin, had exclusive relationships with all three factors of STS. NACMR demonstrated direct effects on anxiety and depression symptoms, while intrusions exhibited a direct effect on anxiety-related symptomatology only. The avoidance factor did not have any independent direct effects on anxiety or depression. Finally, the effects of STS factors on quality of life were fully mediated by an increase of depression-related symptomatology. Results provide evidence on the latent structure of the STS which partially deviates from the prominent models of PTSD thus questioning the isomorphism of two constructs on the empirical level. Additionally, findings provide insights on the cascade of events that make professionals working with traumatized people especially vulnerable to STS and broader psychological distress.

23,"Variations of stress levels, burnout, and resilience throughout the academic year in first-year medical students","Medical student wellness is of great concern in the health care field. A growing number of studies point to increases in suicide, depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and burnout related to physician lifestyles. Mental health issues commencing in medical school have been suggested to have a significant impact on future physician lifestyle and burnout. Tracking the mental health of medical students at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences (UTCOMLS) with standardized indices will help elucidate triggers of poor mental health. Anonymous surveys were developed and distributed to preclinical medical students at five strategic time points throughout the 2018 2019 academic year. Surveys collected basic demographic information as well as inventories measuring perceived stress, burnout, resilience, and mindfulness. 172 M1s (83 males and 89 females) were included in the study and average response rate for the first 4 (out of 5) surveys averaged 74.8%. M1 males and females had on average increased personal burnout over time with females consistently scoring higher. Both males and females had an increase in stress from August to each subsequent month (p&lt;0.05). Females reported a higher level of perceived stress than males in the beginning and middle of the academic year (p&lt;0.05). Both males and females report a gradual decrease in resiliency throughout the academic year. These surveys demonstrated over half of males and females in medical school reported higher perceived stress scores than their gender-matched peers in the general United States population. Our study strengthens documented trends in resiliency, perceived stress, and burnout amongst medical students. More study in designing targeted approaches to ameliorate these findings in the medical student population is warranted.

25,Relationship quality and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown,"Catastrophes are known to have an impact on relationships as well as on mental health. This study evaluated differences in several mental health and well-being measures according to relationship quality during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures. A cross-sectional online survey was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in Austria. Relationship quality was measured with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI), and mental health measures included quality of life (WHOQOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). ANOVAs with Bonferroni-corrected posthoc tests and Chisquared tests were applied. In all mental health scales, individuals with good relationship quality (n = 543) scored better than individuals with poor relationship quality (n = 190) or without relationship (n = 272). The odds ratios (OR) between the poor and good relationship quality groups were 3.5 for the PHQ-9, 3.4 for the GAD-7, and 2.0 for the ISI. Additionally, individuals without no relationship scored better on all scales than individuals with poor relationship quality (all p-values &lt; .05). Relationship quality was related to mental health during COVID-19. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased according to relationship quality from 13% up to 35%. Relationship per se was not associated with better mental health, but the quality of the relationship was essential. Compared to no relationship, a good relationship quality was a protective factor whereas a poor relationship quality was a risk factor.

26,Acquisition of handwriting in children with and without dysgraphia: A computational approach,"Handwriting is a complex skill to acquire and it requires years of training to be mastered. Children presenting dysgraphia exhibit difficulties automatizing their handwriting. This can bring anxiety and can negatively impact education. 280 children were recruited in schools and specialized clinics to perform the Concise Evaluation Scale for Children’s Handwriting (BHK) on digital tablets. Within this dataset, we identified children with dysgraphia. Twelve digital features describing handwriting through different aspects (static, kinematic, pressure and tilt) were extracted and used to create linear models to investigate handwriting acquisition throughout education. K-means clustering was performed to define a new classification of dysgraphia. Linear models show that three features only (two kinematic and one static) showed a significant association to predict change of handwriting quality in control children. Most kinematic and statics features interacted with age. Results suggest that children with dysgraphia do not simply differ from ones without dysgraphia by quantitative differences on the BHK scale but present a different development in terms of static, kinematic, pressure and tilt features. The K-means clustering yielded 3 clusters (Ci). Children in C1 presented mild dysgraphia usually not detected in schools whereas children in C2 and C3 exhibited severe dysgraphia. Notably, C2 contained individuals displaying abnormalities in term of kinematics and pressure whilst C3 regrouped children showing mainly tilt problems. The current results open new opportunities for automatic detection of children with dysgraphia in classroom. We also believe that the training of pressure and tilt may open new therapeutic opportunities through serious games.

27,Metacognitive beliefs and their relationship with anxiety and depression in physical illnesses: A systematic review,"Anxiety and depression are common among patients with chronic physical illnesses and have a significant impact on morbidity, quality of life, and health service utilisation. Psychological treatment of anxiety and depression has small to moderate efficacy in this group and is not commonly based on a model of causal mechanisms. A novel approach to understanding and improving mental health outcomes in physical illnesses is needed. One approach may be to explore the role of metacognitive beliefs which are reliably associated with anxiety and depression in individuals with mental health difficulties. The current systematic review aimed to evaluate the contribution of metacognitive beliefs to anxiety and depression across physical illnesses. Systematic searches were conducted on Web of Science, PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL of studies published between 1997 and January 2019. 13 eligible studies were identified that in sum comprised 2851 participants. Metacognitive beliefs were found to have reliable, moderate, positive and significant associations with anxiety and depression symptoms across a range of physical illnesses. There appeared to be commonality and some specificity in the relationships. Negative metacognitive beliefs concerned with uncontrollability and danger of worry were associated with both anxiety and depression across all physical illnesses assessed, whilst more specific associations emerged for individual medical conditions where positive beliefs about worry, cognitive confidence and cognitive self-consciousness were unique correlates. Negative metacognitive beliefs of uncontrollability and danger significantly and positively predicted symptoms of anxiety and depression after controlling for factors including age, gender, disease factors and cognition (illness perceptions and intolerance of uncertainty). The results suggest that the metacognitive model of psychological disorder is applicable to psychological symptoms of anxiety and depression across a range of chronic medical conditions, implying that metacognitive therapy might be helpful in improving outcomes in multiple morbidities that involve poor mental and medical health.

28,The incidence of chronic pain following Cesarean section and associated risk factors: A cohort of women followed up for three months,"Background: Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is one of the post-surgical complications of a Cesarean section. Despite the high rates of Cesarean section worldwide, the incidence of CPSP and the risk factors for this condition remain relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to calculate the incidence of CPSP in women submitted to Cesarean section and to analyze the associated risk factors. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort of 621 women undergoing Cesarean section was recruited preoperatively. Potential presurgical (sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle-related characteristics) and post-surgical risk factors (the presence and intensity of pain) risk factors were analyzed. Pain was measured at 24 hours and 7, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. Following discharge from hospital, data were collected by telephone. The outcome measure was self-reported pain three months after a Cesarean section. The risk factors for chronic pain were analyzed using the log-binomial regression model (a generalized linear model). Results: A total of 462 women were successfully contacted 90 days following surgery. The incidence of CPSP was 25.5% (95%CI: 21.8–29.7). Risk factors included presurgical anxiety (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01–1.05), smoking (adjusted RR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.27–3.88) and severe pain in the early postoperative period (adjusted RR 2.79; 95%CI: 1.29–6.00). Conclusion: One in four women submitted to Cesarean section may develop CPSP; however, the risk factors identified here are modifiable and preventable. Preventive strategies directed towards controlling anxiety, reducing smoking during pregnancy and managing pain soon after hospital discharge are recommended.

29,Impact of dynamic greenspace exposure on symptomatology in individuals with schizophrenia,"There are currently many tools available for capturing and defining the context of one’s environment. Digital phenotyping, the use of technology and sensors to capture moment-to-moment behavior, has shown potential in quantifying the lived experience of mental illness and in the identification of individualized targets related to recovery. Environmental data suggests that greenspace may have a restorative capacity on mental health. In this paper, we explore the relationship of greenspace derived from geolocation with self-reported symptomatology from individuals with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls. Individuals with schizophrenia had less exposure to greenspace than controls, but their exposure demonstrated a dosage effect: high greenspace environments were associated with lower symptoms for anxiety (Cohen’s d = -0.70), depression (d = -0.97), and psychosis (d = -0.94), whereas effect sizes for healthy controls were all negligible or small (d &lt; 0.38). The notion that greenspace may have a more pronounced effect on individuals with mental illness presents both potential areas for recovery as well as implications for health care policy, especially in cities with a broad range of greenspace environments.

The external bidimensional factor of familiarity with digital tools, which is not usually explained by the TAM, was included, and evaluated. Following a four-stage scale development technique, a seven-dimensional 25-item survey was developed, which includes two external correlated variables: familiarity with high-tech digital tools and familiarity with traditional digital tools, two mediator variables—computer anxiety, and perceived barriers, and three response variables, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use. The initial version of the survey was administered on 250 undergraduate students. Next, for another sample of 206 students, latent dimensions of the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis. The structure of the survey was validated in two other subsequent stages with one sample of 262 responses of undergraduates and one of 310 responses of master’s students from two different universities. All students who agreed to participate in research attended blended learning. The validity, reliability and invariance of the instrument were established by psychometric analyses. Collected data indicated that the survey has an adequate multifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across degree levels. The scale is recommended for use in higher education studies targeting the promotion of blended learning and reduction of negative attitudes of learners toward digital instruments, supporting university professors to select their own efficient way to teach.

32,"Relationships between radiation risk perception and health anxiety, and contribution of mindfulness to alleviating psychological distress after the Fukushima accident: Cross-sectional study using a path model","One of biggest public health impacts of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident is psychosocial. Anxiety about radiation is still present, and radiation risk perception, particularly with regard to genetic effects, is known to affect mental health. However, roles of other risk factors such as health anxiety and of mindfulness remain to be proved. Here, we examined how radiation risk perception (genetic effects) mediates in health anxiety and psychological distress, and how mindfulness influences those variables. Seven years after the accident, we commissioned a self-reported online survey with 832 participants, 416 each from Fukushima and Tokyo, and modeled the relationship between those variables using Structural Equation Modeling. Health anxiety had a much stronger influence on psychological distress than radiation risk perception. Mindfulness was significantly correlated with both health anxiety and psychological distress, but not with radiation risk perception. The total effects on psychological distress were −0.38 by mindfulness and +0.38 by health anxiety. These results suggest the potential application of mindfulness-based interventions to alleviate health anxiety and psychological distress rather than therapy focused on radiation anxiety. The results underline the effectiveness of community support efforts in Fukushima and highlight the importance of enhancing mindfulness during the chronic phase following a disaster.

This study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the WEB scale using gender-neutral questions, Experience of Battering Scale (Chinese) (EBS-C), to assess the psychological vulnerability of victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). The study adopted a range of methods, including translation and back translation, expert reviews, cognitive debriefing, and test-retest reliability assessment. The EBS-C was validated in a purposive convenience sample of 718 Chinese-speaking participants (male = 362; female = 356) aged 18–24 (mean age = 21.4) in Hong Kong. The results of CFA showed a good model fit: CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .03. The EBS-C was also found to be significantly associated with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2; r = .13–.17, p &lt; .01), depression (BDI-II: r = .15, p &lt; .01), anxiety (GAD-7: r = .17, p &lt; .01), interpersonal support (ISEL-12: r = -.27, p &lt; .01), relationship satisfaction (RAS: r = -.36, p &lt; .01), and self-esteem (RSES: r = -.22, p &lt; .01). The study demonstrated the EBS-C to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing the psychological vulnerability of IPV victims. It is thus useful for identifying the risks such individuals face by assessing their experience of fear, danger, and disempowerment in the intimate relationship relative to abusive incident-based measures alone. The EBS-C will also be useful for developing effective treatments to address the psychological vulnerability resulting from IPV and will facilitate cross-cultural comparative research aimed at enriching our knowledge of IPV victimization.

34,Threat of COVID-19 and emotional state during quarantine: Positive and negative affect as mediators in a cross-sectional study of the Spanish population,"Aims: The objective of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of exceptionally stressful situations, such as the current health risk, on the cognitive and emotive state of the individual, that is, perceived threat and emotional state on affect and mood. Method: This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. Results: The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. Conclusions: A negative affective balance increases both one’s perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.

A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. The overall mean SCL90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group ( p &lt; 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified (all p &lt; 0.05). The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.

36,Mental health problems and social media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak,"Huge citizens expose to social media during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China. We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged≥18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%- 83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31–2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52–2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with “infodemic” while combating during public health emergency.

37,The neural influence of autobiographical memory related to the parent-child relationship on psychological health in adulthood,"The recollection of childhood memories is affected by the subjects involved, such as father and mother, and by the context. This study aimed to clarify the neural influence of autobiographical memory related to the parent-child relationship on psychological health in adulthood. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment using a childhood memory recollection task, in which they appraised the emotion a parent would have provided in a given situation. Whole-brain univariate and psychophysiological interaction analyses were performed. Neuroimaging results indicated notable involvement of the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in autobiographical memory related to the parent-child relationship, and their activities were closely associated with the level of depression and self-esteem, respectively. The functional connectivity results indicated increased connectivity between the caudal anterior cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus for the father-positive condition compared to the motherpositive condition and there was a positive correlation between the strength of connectivity between the two regions and the anxiety level. Our findings suggest the processing of negative affect and the personalness of autobiographical memories are distinctly engaged depending on the parent in question and the situational valence.

38,The effects of modifying mental imagery in adolescent social anxiety,"Background: The identification of negative self-imagery as a maintenance factor in adult social anxiety has led to enhanced treatments for this population. Whilst intrusive negative imagery is commonly reported by socially anxious adolescents, no studies have demonstrated that it plays a causal role in maintaining symptoms. To assess this possibility, we undertook an experimental study manipulating social self-imagery in high socially anxious adolescents. Methods: High socially anxious adolescents undertook two conversations under different conditions. During one conversation they held a negative social self-image in mind, and in the other they held a benign social self-image in mind. Self-report, conversation partner report and independent assessor ratings were taken. Results: When participants held a negative self-image in mind, they reported feeling more anxious, and believed they looked more anxious and performed more poorly. Furthermore, they overestimated how anxious they looked compared to conversation partner ratings. As well as distorting participants’ perception of their anxious appearance, holding a negative image in mind also had observable effects on the interaction. Participants were rated as looking more anxious and performing less well by their conversation partner when they held such images in mind, and the conversation was rated more critically by conversation partners and independent observers. Finally, a preliminary mediation analysis suggested that the detrimental effect of negative imagery on the social interaction may be partly due to the spontaneous use of avoidant safety behaviours. Conclusions: The findings provide support for a causal role of negative self-imagery in adolescent social anxiety and point to the potential clinical value of techniques targeting imagery to treat the disorder.

39,Artificial neural networks for predicting social comparison effects among female Instagram users,"Systematic exposure to social media causes social comparisons, especially among women who compare their image to others; they are particularly vulnerable to mood decrease, self-objectification, body concerns, and lower perception of themselves. This study first investigates the possible links between life satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and the intensity of Instagram use with a social comparison model. In the study, 974 women age 18–49 who were Instagram users voluntarily participated, completing a questionnaire. The results suggest associations between the analyzed psychological data and social comparison types. Then, artificial neural networks models were implemented to predict the type of such comparison (positive, negative, equal) based on the aforementioned psychological traits. The models were able to properly predict between 71% and 82% of cases. As human behavior analysis has been a subject of study in various fields of science, this paper contributes towards understanding the role of artificial intelligence methods for analyzing behavioral data in psychology.

40,Technology anxiety and resistance to change behavioral study of a wearable cardiac warming system using an extended TAM for older adults,"With advances in technology, wireless and sensor technologies represent a method for continuously recording people's biomedical signals, which may enhance the diagnosis and treatment of users' everyday health conditions. These technologies mostly target older adults. In this study, we examine a smart clothing system targeting clinically high-risk patients, including older adults with cardiovascular disease (31 outpatients) and older adults in general (81 participants), to obtain an understanding of the patients' perception of using wearable healthcare technologies. Given that technology anxiety has been shown to affect users' resistance to using new technology and that perceived ubiquity is considered a characteristic of wearable devices and other mobile wireless technologies, we included three external variables: i.e., technology anxiety, perceived ubiquity, and resistance to change, in addition to the traditional components of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The results of the hypothesized model showed that among older adults in general, technology anxiety had a negative effect on the perceived ease of use and perceived ubiquity. The perceived ubiquity construct affects both user groups' perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of wearing smart clothes. Most relationships among the original constructs of the TAM were validated in older adults in general. Interestingly, we found that perceived usefulness had an indirect effect on behavioral intention through attitude. These results further confirm the validity of the extended TAM in determining older users' technology acceptance behavior.

1,Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on heart rate variability,"Introduction: Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17 March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. Methods: 95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37 ± 11 years, 176 ± 8 cm, 71 ± 12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0–10 visual analogic scale (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an improved well-being (WB +, increase &gt; 2 in VAS score) and those who did not (WB-) during CFN. Results: Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB + and 76 WB-. There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB + (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD was correlated to VAS. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated wellbeing. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress, change on physical activity. . .) beyond the scope of the present study. However, these results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in this population.

2,Perceived learning difficulty associates with depressive symptoms and substance use among students of higher educational institutions in North Western Ethiopia: A cross sectional study,"Background: The potential role of perceived learning difficulty on depressive symptoms and substance use in the context of student population was seldom studied. This study aimed to investigate the association of perceived learning difficulty with depressive symptoms and substance use among university students in northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 710 pre-engineering students. A locally validated version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms at a cut off 5–9 indicating mild depressive symptoms and at a cut off 10 for major depressive symptoms. Perceived difficulty in school work was assessed by items dealing about difficulties in areas of course work. The response alternatives of these items were 0 = not at all, 1 = not so much, 2 = quite much, 3 = very much. The types of substances that students had used in their life and in the last three months were assessed. Negative binomial regression and multinomial regressions were employed to investigate the predictors of number of substance use and depressive symptoms respectively. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 71.4% (Mild: 30% and Major 41.4%). About 24.6% of participants had the experience of using at least one substance. Increment in perceived difficulties in learning score was associated with more use of substances (aRRR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.06), mild level depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.56 and major depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.26). Every increment in anxiety score was associated with increased risk of mild level of depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.17) and major depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.37). Being male (aRRR = 5.54, 95% CI: 3.28, 9.36), urban residence (aRRR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.72) and increment in number of life threatening events (aRRR = 1.143, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.22) were associated with increased risk of substance use. Conclusion: Perceived difficulties in learning independently predicted increased depressive symptoms as well as substance use among participants.

3,KICK OUT PD: Feasibility and quality of life in the pilot karate intervention to change kinematic outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease,"Background: Multiple exercise modalities and mindfulness activities are beneficial in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Karate is a martial art that combines aerobic and large-amplitude movements, balance and core training, and mindfulness, suggesting a potential benefit for individuals with PD from multiple perspectives. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of community-based Shotokan karate classes involving physical activity and mindfulness among individuals with mild- to moderate-stage PD, and to explore the effects of karate on objective and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: We conducted a 10-week, unblinded trial of twice weekly, PD-specific karate classes. Feasibility was assessed by: dropout rates, adherence via attendance records, adverse effects and falls, and continued participation six months post-intervention. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention assessments of disease-related quality of life (Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-8, PDQ-8), falls, and post-intervention assessment of change in overall wellbeing (Patient Global Impression of Change, PGIC), with exploratory measures of mobility using the Timed Up and Go (TUG), mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and cognition using digit span forward and backward and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Results: Of 19 enrolled participants, 15 completed the study (79%). Among completers, mean adherence was 87% during the ten weeks of intervention, and 53% maintained karate participation six months later and endorsed sustained improvement, respectively. No adverse effects or change in fall frequency were detected. Among completers, 53% were women, and mean PD duration was 6 years (range 2–20). Quality of life improved to a clinically significant degree (PDQ-8: mean 25.3 (standard deviation (SD) 20.8) versus 19.3 (SD 19.6), p = 0.01, effect size 0.83). On the PGIC, 87% endorsed feeling moderately or considerably better. Mobility did not change significantly (TUG: 9.6 seconds (SD 2.23) versus 9.0 seconds (SD 1.89), p = 0.12, effect size 0.43), nor were there changes in overall physical activity, mood, or cognition (p = 0.35–0.92). Conclusions: In a small, 10-week, unblinded trial of community-based karate classes for individuals with mild and moderate PD, high adherence was noted. Quality of life and wellbeing improved significantly, without changes in exploratory outcomes of mobility or neuropsychological outcomes. The study was underpowered, particularly for the exploratory outcomes. Controlled and longitudinal investigation is warranted to confirm our pilot findings and explore the longterm effects and sustainability of karate in PD.

4,Impact of three commonly used blood sampling techniques on the welfare of laboratory mice: Taking the animal’s perspective,"Laboratory mice are the most frequently used animals in biomedical research. In accordance with guidelines for humane handling, several blood sampling techniques have been established. While the effects of these procedures on blood quality and histological alterations at the sampling site are well studied, their impact on the animals’ welfare has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, our study aimed to compare three commonly used blood sampling techniques regarding their effects on different indicators of animal welfare, including physiological and behavioural response stress parameters, including pain measures, home-cage behaviour and nest-building as well as exploratory activity and neophobia. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a single blood collection from either the vena facialis , the retrobulbar sinus or the tail vessel, or were allocated to the respective control treatment. While all blood sampling techniques led to an acute increase in plasma corticosterone levels, the response was strongest in animals that underwent sampling from the vena facialis and the retrobulbar sinus. Similar results were observed when the time-course of adrenocortical activity was monitored via corticosterone metabolites from faecal samples. Blood collection from the vena facialis and the retrobulbar sinus also decreased exploration of novel stimuli, resulted in decreased nest-building activity and induced higher scores in the Mouse Grimace Scale. Moreover, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviour were strongly affected after facial vein bleeding. Interestingly, tail vessel bleeding only induced little alterations in the assessed physiological and behavioural parameters. Importantly, the observed effects in all treatment groups were no longer detectable after 24 hours, indicating only short-term impacts. Thus, by also taking the animal’s perspective and comprehensively assessing the severity of the particular sampling procedures, the results of our study contribute to Refinement within the 3R concept and allow researchers to objectively select the most appropriate and welfare-friendly blood sampling technique for a given experiment.

5,"Are dogs with congenital hearing and/or vision impairments so different from sensory normal dogs? A survey of demographics, morphology, health, behaviour, communication, and activities","The births of domestic dogs with pigment deletion and associated congenital hearing and/or vision impairments are increasing, as a result of mutations of certain genes expressing popular coat colour patterns (Merle, piebald, Irish spotting). The future of these dogs is often pessimistic (early euthanasia or placement in rescues/fosters, lack of interactions and activities for adults). These pessimistic scenarios result from popular assumptions predicting that dogs with congenital hearing/vision impairments exhibit severe Merle-related health troubles (cardiac, skeletal, neurological), impairment-related behavioural troubles (aggressiveness, anxiety), and poor capacities to communicate, to be trained, and to be engaged in leisure or work activities. However, there is no direct scientific testing, and hence no evidence or refutation, of these assumptions. We therefore addressed an online questionnaire to owners of 223 congenitally sensory impaired (23 vision impaired, 63 hearing impaired, 137 hearing and vision impaired) and 217 sensory normal dogs from various countries. The sensory normal cohort was matched in age, lifetime with owner, breed and sex with the sensory impaired cohort, and was used as a baseline. The questionnaire assessed demographics, morphology, sensory impairments, health and behavioural troubles, activities, and dogowner communication. Most hearing and/or vision impaired dogs exhibited abnormal pigment deletion in their coat and irises. Vision impaired dogs additionally exhibited ophthalmic abnormalities typically related to Merle. The results are opposed to all above-listed assumptions, except for neurological troubles, which were more frequently reported in sensory impaired dogs. However, we suggest that this finding could be partially accounted for by a lack of diagnosis of breed-related drug sensitivity and impairment-related compulsive behaviours. Results about communication and activities are particularly optimistic. The need for future studies of numerous dogs from various breeds tested for Merle, piebald and medical-drug-resistance genes, and the beneficial effects that present and future research may have on the future of sensory impaired dogs, are discussed.

6,A cross-sectional study of psychological wellbeing of Indian adults during the Covid-19 lockdown: Different strokes for different folks,"The psychological impacts of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among LGBT adults and persons known to be at higher risk of the complications of Covid-19 (such as persons with comorbidities or a history of mental illness) is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n = 282 and in-depth interviews, n = 14) to investigate whether the psychological influence of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among LGBT adults (β = 2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), the high-risk group (persons with comorbidities) (β = 2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with a history of depression/ loneliness (β = 3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Persons belonging to the LGBT group reported a greater usage of pornography than the heterosexuals (β = 2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36) during the lockdown. Qualitative findings suggested that LGBT adults likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health-related decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis.

7,The relationship between psychological health and social support: Evidence from physicians in China,"Background: The psychological health (PH) of doctors affects the quality of medical service and is related to the safety of patients. The serious problems with the doctor-patient relationship in China can lead to long-term imbalances in doctor PH, and the poor PH status of doctors has raised scholars’ concern. Current research mainly focuses on how factors such as social support and the impact of the residential environment correlate with individual PH. We continue this direction of research to see how the mechanism of social support impacts physician PH, also investigating the moderating effect of demographic indicators on physician PH. Methods: Based on a survey of 399 physicians, a descriptive analysis of measured data was done using SPSS 19.0. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the correlations between PH and the social support rating scale (SSRS) and the demographic variables. KMO and Bartlett methods were used to examine the correlations between PH and SDS (a scale to measure depression) and between PH and SAS (a scale to measure anxiety). The method of factor analysis was used for multicollinearity tests, and multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the demographic factors correlated with PH and SSRS. Two-way interactions in moderated multiple regression were used to test the moderating effect of education level and title on SSRS, SDS, and SAS. Results: Our results indicate that the level of PH is influenced by the age, education, and title of a doctor. A physician’s title is significantly and positively correlated with PH, but age and education are significantly negatively related. Age, education, and title also affect the level of SSRS in physicians. SSRS is positively correlated with age, education, and title, and SSRS positively influences PH. Education and title had significant effects on the moderating influences of SSRS, SDS, SAS, and PH. Conclusion: The factors directly affecting PH include SSRS, age, and title, while education was found to be an indirect influencing factor. To meet goals expressed in Chinese government policy related to these issues, we suggest strengthening the guidance of the media, introducing laws and regulations on doctor-patient risk management and control, reforming the review mechanism of hospital job titles, improving the education level of doctors, building a comprehensive evaluation system of “practice performance + doctor-patient satisfaction”, and strengthening doctor-patient empathy. Through such measures, the level of PH in physicians will improve.

A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed with the aim to evaluate psychiatric emergencies from March 14 to May 1, 2020, coinciding with the start of the emergency state and the lockdown until the attenuation of the confinement. Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak. A significant lower mean discharge/emergency ratio (M=42.17, SD= 26.94 in 2020 vs. M=63.43, SD= 17.64 in 2019) and a higher referral to Internal Medicine/emergency ratio (M=20.55, SD= 22.16 in 2020 vs. M=3.32, SD= 6.63 in 2019) was observed. The results suggest important changes in psychiatric emergencies during the most critical period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain.

2,Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the covid-19 pandemic in south korea,"South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate reported by previous studies conducted in South Korea prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.

3,Mental health of pregnant women during the covid-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"Several studies have reported the susceptibility of pregnant women to emotional instability and stress. Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect. It is important for institutions dedicated to perinatal health care to count on empirical information to optimize the provision of their services.

4,Adding stress to the stressed: Senior high school students’ mental health amidst the covid-19 nationwide lockdown in greece,"The two-year preparation for the National university entrance exams in Greece is one of the most trying periods in a young person's life, physically and emotionally. The present study reports the results from 442 last year senior high school students who completed an online survey (16-30 April 2020) concerning the lockdown impact on their mental health. Overall, the rate of positive screen for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11) significantly increased from 48.5% to 63.8% and of those scoring within severe depression range (PHQ-9 ≥20) from 10% to 27%; for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) increased from 23.8% to 49.5% and of those scoring within severe anxiety range (GAD-7≥17) from 3.8% to 20.5%. After taking sex and baseline (one month prior to the lockdown) levels of depression and anxiety into account, the level of lockdown experienced distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels in time of home confinement, accounting for about 30% of variance in symptoms severity scores. Although our results may be subject to sampling and recall bias, the unexpectedly high rates of anxiety and depression warrant an urgent call to action aiming at mitigating and managing mental health risks of senior high school students in future waves of pandemic.

Family (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.8-0.91) and friend (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94) support were protective factors. This suggests the need to focus on students during epidemics, especially those living with someone hospitalized with COVID-19.

6,"Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and ptsd symptoms in perinatal women during the covid-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and women who recently gave birth are vulnerable to COVID-19-related psychosocial stresses. METHODS: We assessed COVID-19-related health worries and grief, and current mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD) in 1,123 U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21 to August 17, 2020) through a cross-sectional study design. RESULTS: Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although causation cannot be inferred, COVID-19-related health worries and grief experiences may increase the likelihood of mental health symptoms among those without pre-existing mental health concerns. Providers should develop strategies for addressing health-related worry and grief within their practice.

7,The solitary confinement of incarcerated American youth during COVID-19,"In spring 2020, various states of emergency, stay-at-home orders, and school closures were enacted due to COVID-19. Since then, American juvenile correctional facilities (JCFs) have faced a complex situation that requires consideration of staff and youth safety and physical health, the need for social distancing, and the high prevalence of youth with mental disorders. Even for people in the community during COVID-19, social isolation can be a traumatic experience that can result in loneliness, depression, anxiety, and make it more difficult to deal with stress. The psychological effects of solitary confinement for incarcerated youth are even more dramatic and may include depression, anger, obsessive thoughts, paranoia and psychosis, and suicide. JCF staffing concerns provide another hurdle in the provision of emotional support to incarcerated and isolated youth during COVID-19. Similar to front-line medical staff and staff that work in other residential settings, JCF workers are at significant risk for experiencing burnout, fear and anxiety of contracting and spreading the virus.To understand JCF policies and practices during COVID-19 and chart a path forward, survey research is needed concerning approaches to, (a) ensuring youth and staff physical health, (b) providing youth with social and emotional support, (c) delivering educational services, and (d) providing COVID-19 related information to youth, staff, and families. Interview research would also provide in-depth insight into youth and staff views and experiences during the crisis.

8,The psychological impact of quarantine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"This article is a systematic review of psychological impact of quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on these studies, a great amount of psychologic symptoms or problems developed during the quarantine period, including anxiety (228/649, 35.1%), depression (110/649, 16.9%), loneliness (37/649, 5.7%) and despair (6/649, 0.9%). The review examined the factors influencing the development of psychologic symptoms. Two studies showed that the mental health status of COVID-19 patients and people under medical observation differed across gender, age, marital status, education, occupational status, monthly income per capita, and place of residence. However, according to another study, no significant associations between age, gender, marital status, and education level with psychological problems in patients quarantined in hospital and at home. The main source of the problems seems to be the small isolation space and the surrounding environment, but the stress may also be related to concerns about delayed work or infecting family members. Professional psychological care and the access to reliable information are essential for minimizing the mental health problems during quarantine.

9,Fear and agony of the pandemic leading to stress and mental illness: An emerging crisis in the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"The outbreak of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), later named as a pandemic affecting nearly 210 countries and territories has led to negative emotions of fear and agony in the general population and healthcare staff professionals. The healthcare regulators and the governments have imposed emergencies and lockdowns in their countries which has led to an adverse effect on the mental health of people ultimately leading to a rise in anxiety, depression, and associated mental illness. The fear and uncertainty increased by the COVID-19 crisis are putting extreme pressure on our finite resources. This report aims to synthesis the dilemma of mental illness as a result of pandemic and initiates suggestions to help the general public, healthcare professionals, and workers mitigate the negative emotions to improve the mental wellbeing in this detached period of isolation.

10,Distinguishing burnout from depression: An exploratory qualitative study,"Whether depression and burnout are synonymous or not has been a longstanding debate. Many studies have examined for similarities and differences, but findings have overall been inconclusive, with most studies being quantitative in design. We therefore undertook a qualitative study in which participants who self-identified as having experienced both burnout and depression were asked how they distinguished between the two conditions. Thematic qualitative analysis was undertaken and while a fifth of the sample stated that their burnout and depression experiences were indistinguishable or were very similar, we also identified 11 key themes of difference. The most prevalent themes captured differences in the perceived cause of each condition, in experiencing hopelessness as against helplessness, and impacts on levels of functioning, sadness, anger, anxiety and emotional lability. We also identified differences in suicidal ideation between the two conditions. While some differences identified could be dimensional and suggest that burnout is simply synonymous with or a developmental phase of depression, the several categorical symptom differences nominated by participants suggest that most sufferers who have experienced both conditions perceive them as distinct. Such ‘lived experience’ reports are therefore intrinsically informative and should shape further quantitative analyses.

11,Association between anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs and suicidal thoughts or behaviors in a population-based cohort of students,"Aims: To investigate the association between the use of anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs and suicidal thoughts and/or behavior (STB) in students. Methods: 12,112 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire in the i-Share cohort between April 2013 and March 2017 were included. STB were defined at inclusion as suicidal thoughts over the previous year and/or a lifetime suicide attempt. The use of prescribed anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs over the previous 3 months was measured at baseline and follow-up time points (in 2,919 students). Psychiatric disorders were assessed through validated scales. Multivariate logistic regression models were run using disease risk score. Results: At inclusion, 25.2% of students had STB and 10.3% used anxiolytics/hypnotics. STB at baseline were associated with a more frequent use of anxiolytics/hypnotics in the previous 3 months, after adjustment for covariates including anxiety, depression, sleep, impulsivity, and substance use. The use of anxiolytics/hypnotics at baseline was not associated with the occurrence, persistence or remission of STB one year later. STB at baseline were associated with a new anxiolytic/hypnotic treatment one year later. Conclusions: Anxiolytic/hypnotic drug use was associated with STB in students independently of many risk factors of suicide and most psychiatric disorders that require such treatment, which raises drug safety concerns.

12,Differential-diagnostic confusion and non-specificity of affective symptoms and anxiety: An empirical study of first-admission patients,"In everyday clinical work, psychiatrists encounter patients who present with symptoms spanning several diagnostic categories, e.g., showing signs of a psychosis, depression, and anxiety. This raises the critical question of which symptoms hold precedence over other and, by extension, which diagnosis is the right diagnosis. ICD-10 and DSM-5 do not provide unambiguous answers to this question and therefore psychiatry remains exposed to diagnostic disagreement with consequences for treatment and research. We explored symptom distribution in a sample of 98 first-admission psychiatric patients. We extracted and categorized singular symptoms into symptom domains: anxiety, mania, delusions, hallucinations, first-rank symptoms, and negative symptoms. Most symptoms were seen in most disorders. We found symptoms of depression and anxiety in almost all patients. Thus, just counting symptoms do not seem to be a valid way to make diagnoses. We elaborately discuss these issues in the context of the differential-diagnosis between schizophrenia and depression. Finally, we suggest that a combination of a criteria- and Gestalt-based approach to diagnosing mental disorders may contribute to counteract some of the current differential-diagnostic confusion.

13,A prospective study of intensive in-patient treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Multimodal in-patient treatment incorporating intensive cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and medication management is a promising alternative for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who do not respond to standard out-patient treatment. We prospectively examined the short-term outcome and predictors of outcome of intensive in-patient treatment in a largely pharmacotherapy-resistant OCD sample. Fifty eight consecutive patients, admitted for treatment of OCD were evaluated at admission, at discharge and 2 months post-discharge for psychiatric diagnosis, personality disorders, obsessive beliefs, insight into obsessions and severity of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and anxiety symptoms. All patients received comprehensive treatment consisting of a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive CBT. The mean Y-BOCS score was 29.38( ± 5.72) at admission, which reduced to 16.62( ± 7.91) at discharge and 16.75(± 8.85) at follow-up. Thirty five participants (60.3%) met the prespecified criteria for response and 19 (32.8%) for remission. There was a significant reduction in Y-BOCS scores at discharge [43.67 (23.81)%] and post-discharge follow-up [2.18 (29.32)%] as compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.01). Baseline Browns Assessment of Beleifs Scale score (insight) was the only variable that statistically differentiated responders and non-responders. In-patient treatment is an effective treatment for medication resistant, severe and chronic OCD. Poor insight is a potential predictor of non-response to in-patient treatment.

14,High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis,"To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression ( p = .005) and anxiety ( p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.

15,"Cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S during exposure therapy in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder—Secretion patterns and prediction of treatment response","The cortisol response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during exposure with response prevention (ERP), a stressful but very effective psychotherapeutic treatment, has shown contradictory findings in three prior studies with low sample sizes. In a larger cohort of 51 patients with OCD we repeatedly measured subjective units of distress (SUD) and the adrenocortical stress hormones cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in saliva during the very first session of ERP and on the day before. Expectedly, SUD were increased on the ERP day before the session and further rose during ERP, but salivary cortisol and DHEA were statistically indistinguishable from the comparison condition. Interestingly, DHEA-S was significantly elevated throughout the ERP versus the comparison day, but did not further increase in acute response to ERP. According to an explorative analysis in a subsample, hormone levels on the comparison or the ERP day did not predict anti-OCD treatment response one month later. These results corroborate our prior findings of cortisol non-response despite considerable subjective stress in ERP. The role of DHEA-S in anticipatory anxiety and the effects of augmentative cortisol therapy in ERP need further study.

16,"Ptsd and obesity in U.S. military veterans: Prevalence, health burden, and suicidality","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obesity are prevalent among U.S. military veterans, though less is known about the mental and physical health burden and suicidality of co-occurring PTSD and obesity in this population. A nationally representative sample of the U.S. veterans was used to assess PTSD and obesity prevalence, co-occurrence and relationships with mental and physical health measures. A total of 16.4% of veterans screened positive for current PTSD, 32.7% for obesity, and 5.8% for co-occurring PTSD and obesity. Relative to obesity-only veterans, veterans with co-occurring PTSD and obesity had elevated likelihoods of mental and physical health concerns (most notably major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders), suicidality, and migraine headaches, and higher body mass indices. Relative to veterans with PTSD alone, individuals with comorbid PTSD and obesity had elevated likelihoods of suicidal ideation, nicotine dependence, mental health treatment, migraine headaches, diabetes, hypertension, and insomnia. A significant minority of U.S. veterans has co-occurring PTSD and obesity, which is associated with substantial mental and physical health burden, including elevated suicidality. Results underscore the importance of integrative assessment, monitoring, and treatment approaches for PTSD and obesity in this population.

Methods: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. Results: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR = 1.89, 95%CI = 1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR = 0.24, 95%CI = 0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.05-0.22; and ≥75 years: OR = 0.08,95% CI = 0.03-0.24),annual income (&lt;£15,000: reference; £25,000-&lt;£40,000: OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31-0.93; £40,000-&lt;£60,000: OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.22-0.69; and ≥£60,000: OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR = 2.35, 95%CI = 1.61-3.46).

19,Psychometric assessment of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in an obstetric population,"The prevalence and negative effects of perinatal depression are well known. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a common screening tool for perinatal depression and it is recommended for use by several professional organizations. The current study tested competing EPDS factor structures and assessed EPDS change from intake to 6-week follow-up, and identified demographic correlates in an outpatient obstetric sample. Using a retrospective observational study design, medical records were coded for demographic, mental health, and EPDS patient data (n = 524). Confirmatory factor analysis, t-tests, and ANOVA were utilized. Findings included: (1) a 3-factor model (i.e. anxiety, depression, anhedonia) of the EPDS displayed the best fit to the current data; (2) small declines in all 3 subscales of the EPDS from intake to 6-week follow-up appointments and; (3) demographic correlates of EPDS subscales included history of depression, history of anxiety, race, and pregnancy status (i.e. first child or not). The 3-factor structure can be used in clinical practice to assess perinatal depression in a nuanced fashion. Given that history of depression and anxiety are risk factors for perinatal depression, a thorough assessment of these items in clinical practice is needed.

Participants (NN = 123) were consecutively recruited from the Brain and Mind Centre in New South Wales, Australia. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach's alpha. Item-total correlations were evaluated by Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. The convergent validity of the DASS-21 was examined by measuring its associations with quality of life and other measures of depression and anxiety. Factorial validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. The DASS-21 demonstrated good internal consistency, adequate convergent validity, and all items exhibited satisfactory item-total correlations. Considering fit indices and factor loadings, the confirmatory factor analysis results provided support for the original 3-factor oblique model consisting of depression, anxiety, and stress factors. The model fit could be further improved with some modifications. Overall, the results indicate that the DASS-21 is a viable self-report screening measure for depression, anxiety, and stress in individuals with ASD and without intellectual disability.

21,Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures.

24,"Impact of the group intervention ""Accept Voices©"" for the management of auditory hallucinations","Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of a third wave CBT group intervention for the management of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. Method: 38 patients with schizophrenia presenting with auditory hallucinations, followed in mental health services, participated in six sessions of a group based on acceptance and engagement therapy (ACT). The study followed a repeated single case experimental design (type A-B-A) based on the principle of a control phase followed by an intervention phase and a follow-up phase of similar duration. The various measurements were administered during the control phase, at pre-/post-group and six weeks after the last group session. Results: The results show a significant decrease in auditory hallucinations, as measured by the PSYRATS scale, during the treatment and follow-up phase, compared to the control phase. In addition, the participants saw significant reductions in depressive and anxious symptomatology (assessed with CDSS and SEAS), and increases in coping and acceptance in regards to voices (assessed using a study scale and VAAS). The level of Malevolence beliefs about voices (measured with BAVQ-R) also decreased significantly. Conclusions: A brief group intervention based acceptance show promise in the reduction of the intensity of auditory hallucinations, depression and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia, while improving their acceptance.

25,The psychometric properties of 30-day versions of the DSM-5 dimensional severity scales for social anxiety disorder and panic disorder,"Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the DSM-5 dimensional severity scales for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD) using a past 30 day timeframe. Methods: Data were from a sample of 1,052 Australian community dwelling adults (aged 18 years or older) recruited using online advertisements. Respondents completed the DSM-5 severity scales for SAD and PD as well as a range of additional widely used self-administered scales for SAD and PD in the past 30 days prior to the survey. Results: Both scales exhibited high internal consistency (alpha&gt; = 0.94) and a strong general factor that justified unidimensional item response analysis (OmegaH = 0.96). There was no evidence of significant local dependence amongst item pairs after accounting for the single factor. Similarly, there was no evidence for meaningful differential item functioning of the scales across sex, age, education level, and residential location. There was high convergent validity (0.71-0.85) amongst conceptually related scale and moderate to high correlations (0.54-0.80) between conceptually unrelated scales. Conclusions: These findings provide support for the use of past month versions of the DSM-5 severity scales for SAD and PD by researchers and clinicians to inform and supplement diagnostic decisions.

26,Assessing high risk of suicide amongst physicians and nurses in treatment,"Little is known about the suicidal behaviour of health professionals admitted to specialised programmes. This study aims to describe the factors associated with high risk of suicide (HRS) of physicians and nurses in treatment at the Galatea Care Programme. We conducted a retrospective naturalistic study with data from 1,214 electronic medical records of physicians and nurses working in Catalonia and in treatment at the Galatea Clinic during 2017 and 2018. HRS was registered in the medical record according to the screening criteria of the Catalonia Risk Suicide Code; 62.4% ( n = 757) were physicians and 37.6% ( n = 457) were nurses. HRS was identified in 5% physicians and 5.2% nurses. Patients who were in a relationship or were not on a sick leave were less likely to have HRS, whereas those with affective disorders were more likely to have HRS compared with those with anxiety disorders or substance use disorders. Patients with HRS were more likely to have concurrent mental disorders. Specialised treatment programmes for health professionals should regularly screen for suicide risk, especially amongst those having affective disorders, comorbid mental disorders or when their working and interpersonal life areas are impaired.

27,Abnormal night sleep duration and inappropriate sleep initiation time are associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in Chinese rural adults: The Henan Rural Cohort,"Sleep problems have been demonstrated to cause mental symptoms, such as anxiety. However, research on the association of the night sleep duration and sleep initiation time on anxiety symptoms in rural China is still lacking. The current study, therefore, explored the independent and combined association of the night sleep duration and sleep initiation time on anxiety symptoms. This study included 28, 054 participants from the Henan Rural Cohort. Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Anxiety was assessed by the two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Multivariable logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline with anxiety symptoms as a dependent variable were fitted. Among the participants in this study, 11, 209 (39.96%) were males, and 16,845 (60.04%) were females, 1574 (5.61%) had anxiety symptoms. Both shorter and longer night sleep duration were significantly related to elevated prevalence of anxiety symptoms. Extreme sleep initiation time was also significantly associated with elevated anxiety symptoms. Additionally, night sleep duration and sleep initiation time had a combined effect on the prevalent anxiety symptoms. In conclusion, there was a dose-response association of night sleep duration and sleep initiation time with anxiety among Chinese rural population. Moreover, they might jointly increase the odds of prevalent anxiety.

28,Development of the short version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,"The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has been widely used to measure the state and trait components of anxiety. We sought to develop a short, yet reliable and valid form of these scales for use in circumstances where the full‐form is not feasible. We abbreviated the scales using item response theory analyses to retain the items that could discriminate the best among participants. One sample ( N = 922) completed the state scale, a second sample ( N = 2227) completed the trait scale, while a third sample (N = 250) completed the short forms. Our participants completed the Hungarian version of STAI alongside other measures to observe external validity. We calculated cut-off scores for the state (&gt;9.5,) and trait (&gt;13.5) scales. A total of 19.5% and 20.1% of the respondents reached the cut-off scores. The five-item short forms of STAI had sound psychometric properties that are comparable to those obtained on the full-form. The external validity of the scales is also demonstrated. We report detailed descriptive statistics that could be used in further studies as standards. The short scales are reliable measures that could be used in clinical screening and behavioural research; especially where practical considerations preclude the use of a longer questionnaire.

29,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for major depression: A naturalistic observational study in an Australian private hospital,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective and evidence-based treatment for major depression, which is now as a mainstream treatment in clinical practice. However, there is limited data concerning its use in Australian private psychiatric hospital settings. This retrospective study examined routinely collected data of 153 inpatients, who received 20 rTMS treatments over four weeks. Primary outcomes measures were the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). At post-treatment, response and remission rates were 54% and 28%, respectively, for the HAMD-17; and 53% response and 16% remission rates, for the DASS-21 Depression subscale, respectively. Although no gender differences were observed, younger patients demonstrated more improvements during acute rTMS but the effect was not significant after accounting for pre-treatment symptom severity. The findings of this naturalistic study suggest that an acute course of rTMS provided in private clinical settings resulted in similar response and remission rates to longer rTMS courses. Shorter rTMS courses appear to have satisfactory efficacy in treating major depression, in clinically diverse and real-world practice.

30,Eating disorders in the age of COVID-19,"Comments on an article by P.M.M. Carvalho et al. (see record 2020-22694-001). Carvalho et al. discussed the broad psychological effects of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) including loneliness, worsening anxiety, distress and insomnia. Psychosocial stressors stemming from COVID-19 pandemic and resultant stay-at-home orders, may exacerbate ED-related triggers and present a challenging environment for individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder. Appropriately managing EDs is crucial to mitigate the potential long-term impacts on individuals with these disorders. For example, individuals with EDs have greater suicidal risk under normal conditions, and additional COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors could further increase that risk. Thus, in order to minimize the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on EDs, we encourage HCPs to continue to provide mental health resources to ED patients up to 6 months postisolation, including virtual group therapy sessions and live meal support through the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Further, it is recommended that HCPs encourage ED patients to plan meals and purchase 'safe' food items with a long shelf-life in bulk, when available in store.

33,University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece,"The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.

34,Associations between subclinical inflammatory markers and OCD: A retrospective study,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted, intrusive and disturbing thoughts or images that cause anxiety and repetitive behaviours or mental acts to relieve these thoughts or images. Considering controversial aetiology of OCD and growing evidence for the role of inflammation in OCD, the aim of this study was to examine the association between OCD and subclinical inflammatory markers, namely neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR) in adult patients and to investigate the association between antidepressant medications and NLR, PLR. Electronic medical records(EMR) of 24,635 patients aged 18-64 were reviewed and after exclusion of comorbid psychiatric and medical diagnosis 135 EMR of OCD patients were included into final analyses and compared with the healthy control group (n = 133). Blood cell counts were noted to calculate NLR and PLR. Medications of patients were gathered from all patients to calculate fluoxetine-equivalent-dose(FED) to examine the effects of antidepressants on NLR and PLR. NLR and PLR were significantly higher in OCD. Contrary to the correlation of FED with NLR, PLR was found to not correlate with FED. Hence, PLR would be considered as a robust biomarker to medication effect contrary to NLR. OCD was significantly predicted by both NLR and PLR in logistic regression analyzes.

35,"Relationships between stroke, depression, generalized anxiety disorder and physical disability: Some evidence from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health","The objective of this study is to evaluate associations between stroke, depression, anxiety and physical disability. The sample of 19,159 participants aged ≥30 was obtained from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health. Depression or anxiety was defined as major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) within the past 12 months. The history of anxiety was defined as GAD at any time point during the respondent's lifetime. Physical disability was assessed by the past 14-day disability in daily-living activities. For statistical analysis, two logistic regression models (crude and adjusted models) were presented. The results showed that subjects with stroke had greater likelihoods of MDD-GAD comorbidity and GAD only compared those without stroke. People with GAD only had higher likelihood of physical disability than those with neither of the two conditions. Among participants with stroke, lifetime GAD was associated with a greater likelihood of MDD. In conclusion, individuals with stroke may be vulnerable to comorbid depression-anxiety as well as anxiety only. Additionally, subjects with anxiety were more likely to have physical disability. The history of anxiety increased the risk for developing post-stroke depression.

36,Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown among students and workers of a Spanish university,"The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the university community during the first weeks of confinement. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts &amp; Humanities and Social Sciences &amp; Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering &amp; Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC = 0.88), while the original cut score of ≥ 9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores. Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.

38,A traumatic life experience in childhood increases the risk of a psychiatric disorder in the offspring,"A traumatic life experience in childhood is a fundamental risk factor of numerous psychiatric disorders. Recently, studies try to evaluate the mental health consequences on victims’ offspring, but few psychiatric disorders were examined, and whether these results apply to the general population remains unknown. In this study, we use the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large representative sample of American population, in order to estimate the impact on the offspring of a traumatic experience in parents. Besides, we use a well-known risk factor for offspring's psychiatric disorder: a familial history of a psychiatric disorder, in order to compare and assess the importance of parental traumatism as a risk factor for the offspring. Our results show that the five psychiatric disorders studied, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, mood disorder, antisocial personality disorder and anxiety disorder, are more prevalent in the offspring, when at least one parent report a traumatic life event in his own childhood. Moreover, the magnitude of this risk factor is close to the magnitude of having a parental history of psychiatric disorder.

39,Decrease of well-being and increase of online media use: Cohort trends in German university freshmen between 2016 and 2019,"Research from the U.S. described a decrease of subjective well-being and an increase of online media use in young adults today. The present study investigated whether similar trends occur in Germany. Data of overall 1985 university freshmen (four cohorts: 2016: N = 658, 2017: N = 333, 2018: N = 562, 2019: N = 432) were collected by online surveys in the years 2016 to 2019. The comparison of the four cohorts revealed a significant increase of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, as well as of the use of social platforms from 2016 to 2019. In contrast, positive mental health (PMH) significantly decreased over the years. No significant changes of the gaming behavior were found. A slight significant positive relationship occurred between the negative variables of well-being and online media use. The association between PMH and online media use was significantly negative. Thus, cohort trends found in the U.S. can at least rudimentarily be replicated in Germany. Young adults in 2019 seem to have lower levels of well-being and to engage in more use of social platforms than older cohorts.

40,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an increasingly popular treatment for major depression and anxiety disorder, but has shown inconsistent efficacy for bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general efficacy of MBCT for BD. Methods: Ten studies were identified that fulfilled the current inclusion criteria, including three controlled and seven uncontrolled studies. The effects of MBCT on depression, anxiety, mania, stress, mindfulness ability, and emotional regulation were assessed by comparing psychometric scale scores within groups (pre- vs. post-intervention) across trials as well as between groups (control vs. MBCT) across controlled trials. Results: Within-group comparison revealed a reduction in symptoms of depression ( g = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.09−0.64, P = 0.009) and anxiety ( g = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.16−0.75, P = 0.002) following treatment compared to baseline. Stress symptoms were also significantly reduced ( g = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.09−0.69, P = 0.01), mindfulness ability (g = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.39−0.87, P &lt; 0.00001) and emotion regulation ( g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.14−1.10, P = 0.01) were significantly improved compared to baseline. However, symptoms of mania were not alleviated ( g = −0.26, 95%CI = −1.43−0.91, P = 0.66). Subgroup analysis indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety were still significantly improved at 3 months post-intervention ( g = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.13−0.80, P = 0.006 and g = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.21−0.94, P = 0.002, respectively) but not at 12 months ( g = 0.04, 95%CI = −0.29−0.37, P = 0.82 and g = 0.17, 95%CI = −0.16−0.50, P = 0.31). In between-groups analysis of controlled studies, MBCT significantly reduced depressive symptoms ( g = 0.3, 95%CI = -0.05−0.65, P = 0.09) but not anxiety symptoms ( g = 0.51, 95%CI = −0.20−1.22, P = 0.16). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears effective for alleviation of depression and anxiety among BD patients, possibly by improving emotional regulation and mindfulness abilities. However, efficacy appears time-limited and inconsistent, necessitating additional larger-scale studies and the development of post-intervention programs for sustained efficacy.

41,Preliminary evaluation of the utility of parental ratings in a Child Network,"Introduction: : Children in the US have a high incidence of psychiatric disorders, but the symptoms of these illnesses are often poorly recognized and treated. We thus created a Child Network for parents of children aged 2-12 to rate their child on a weekly basis on a secure website so that longitudinal ratings could be easily visualized. Methods: : After giving informed consent, parents filled out: a one-time questionnaire and a 97 item Child Checklist; and then rated the severity of depression, anxiety, ADHD, oppositional behavior, and mania each week. The new Checklist ratings were correlated with the 23 previous validated in adults (the M-3), and symptom burden was compared with diagnoses received in the community. Results: : The 23 item M-3 ratings were highly correlated with the more extensive Child Checklist. Symptom severity also corresponded to diagnoses received in the community. An example of the longitudinal weekly ratings of a child with a dysphoric mania is also presented. Conclusions: : The convergence of scores on the adult and child portions of the Child Checklist and the ease of visualization of symptoms and response to treatment suggest the utility of the ratings in the Child Network.

42,Death anxiety and attitude to death in patients with schizophrenia and depression,"Attitude to death and death anxiety in patients with severe psychiatric disorders have been studied rarely so far, although this is an existential perspective for each human being and clinically seems to be changed in patients with depression and schizophrenia. Patients with depression (mean age 46.30 ± 13.39; 12 women, 8 men) and schizophrenia (mean age 38.95 ± 1285; 9 women, 11 men), as well as healthy controls, were included in the study. Death anxiety and attitude to death were assessed using the newly developed and currently validated BOFRETTA scale. Attitude to death was significantly worse in the group of patients with schizophrenia, especially in those with prominent negative symptoms. Concerning death anxiety, patients with schizophrenia and also those with depression exhibited higher mean values compared with healthy controls in the same age range. These results suggest that there are specific similarities and differences concerning attitude to death and death anxiety in patients with psychotic and affective disorders. It can be concluded that existential aspects such as death and meaningful life should also be considered within the treatment of patients with severe mental disorders.

Methods: An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results: Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks.

44,The psychiatric impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak,"Patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV (new coronavirus disease) may experience fear of the consequences of being infected with a potentially fatal new virus, and those in quarantine might experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. Furthermore, infection symptoms, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, could lead to anxiety worsening and mental distress. The psychosocial response to an infectious event of this magnitude is complex. Maunder et al. concluded that patients and staff's emotional and behavioral reactions have been understood as a normal and adaptive response to stress during an overwhelming event. Studies have also highlighted that the least amount of damage should be ensured when using psychotropic medicine, which will mainly decrease the harmful effects of any interaction with 2019-nCoV and its treatments.

45,Postpartum stress and infant outcome: A review of current literature,"Postpartum stress has been shown to have an association with infant growth, nutrition, bonding, temperament and ultimately childhood mental wellbeing. When persistent, recurring or chronic, it can negatively impact infant outcome, including the subscales of mental wellbeing such as growth, development, feeding, attachment and sleep. This study aims to define the physical and functional effect of postpartum stress on measures of infant mental wellbeing. A systematic review of English language articles published between 1995 and 2019 on PubMed, Medline and Psych base databases was carried out. Search terms used included postpartum, stress, infant, growth, development, nutrition, attachment and sleep. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed with eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria of human studies, mothers diagnosed with depressive and anxiety symptoms postpartum with infant correlates were used. All animal studies and studies with women already on medication were excluded. A total of 74 articles were reviewed and summarized into postpartum stress associations with infant growth, development, nutrition, sleep and maternal fetal attachment. Postpartum stress is negatively associated with poor developmental trajectories and linear growth deficits, causing stunting in growth; poor language and cognitive development; poor gross and fine motor movement, and infant sleep. An inverse relationship exists with breast feeding and postpartum depression. More importantly, breastfeeding efficacy is important for sustaining positive infant feeding outcome. Increased maternal age during postpartum depression has been linked, as a contributing factor, to decreased maternal fetal attachment/bonding. A ripple effect exists from the association between postpartum stress and poor infant sleep. There is strong evidence that correlates PPS to infant outcome, mediated through many external factors. More research needs to be conducted to delineate and potentially mitigate the impact of modifiable factors. Not all articles in the literature were reviewed.

47,The moderating effect of FKBP5 and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on the day-level association between drinking to cope motivation and negative affect,"Daily levels of drinking to cope (DTC) have been found to be related to negative outcomes such as increased negative affect, and these effects vary across person. We examined whether daily-level effects of DTC motivation were related to two genetic polymorphisms (rs1360780 in the FKBP5 gene and 5-HTTLPR in SLC6A4 ) thought to be associated with maladaptive drinking and stress-reactivity. We also examined whether these associations changed during the transition from college to post-college life. Participants ( N = 839, 55% women) completed an Internet-based 30-day daily diary during college and again five years later in which they reported their previous night's drinking and drinking motivation, and their current day's negative affect. Saliva was collected at wave 1 to provide DNA for genotyping. The within-person association between nighttime DTC motivation and next-day anxiety and depression was stronger (more positive) for FKBP5 rs1360780 T-allele carriers, compared C/C-allele individuals. We also found that 5-HTTLPR L’/S’ subjects (but not S’/S’ homozygotes), compared to L’/L’ homozygotes, showed stronger positive associations between DTC and anxiety. Results for FKBP5 T-allele carriers are discussed in terms of past findings indicating that such individuals tend to demonstrate increased attention toward stressors, thus possibly intensifying the deleterious effects of DTC-motivated drinking.

48,A comparison of the dimensionality of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the DSM-5 Anxious-Distress Specifier Interview,"The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) is one of the most widely used measures for assessing anxiety in research settings. However, it has been criticized for its inclusion of items that assess depressive symptoms. The DSM-5 Anxious Distress Specifier Interview (DADSI), developed as one assessment tool for measuring anxiety among depressed patients, demonstrates similar validity when compared with the HAM-A. However, its underlying factor structure has never been explored. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to compare the underlying factor structures of the HAM-A and the DADSI among clinically depressed (n = 576) and non-depressed (n = 146) patient samples. While two- and three-factor structures of the HAM-A fit similarly well among patients with a current major depressive episode, the three-factor structure—with anxiety and depressive symptoms forming separate factors—fit best among patients without a current major depressive episode. The DADSI was best represented by a single-factor model in both groups. The DADSI showed stronger associations with anxiety and somatic symptoms than with depressive symptoms of the HAM-A. These findings add to the characterization of the DADSI, and further highlight an important consideration for the use of HAM-A as a measure of anxiety in outcome studies.

50,Addressing the need for forensic psychological evaluations of asylum seekers: The potential role of the general practitioner,"Asylum seekers who have survived torture and other abuses may experience a wide range of psychological symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. During the asylum process, attorneys might refer their clients to clinicians who document these psychological sequelae of human rights violations. However, the need for forensic psychological evaluations exceeds the number of mental health clinicians available to provide these assessments. It has been suggested that primary care physicians, professionals who already play essential roles in the identification and treatment of mental health issues, may be able to conduct these evaluations. Yet, there is little empirical knowledge of what prior training and clinical experiences support mental health and non-mental health professionals who engage in this work, and what is needed to prepare general practitioners to provide forensic psychological evaluations to asylum seekers. This pilot study found non-mental health practitioners with experience in psychological forensic evaluations reached a level of confidence in conducting evaluations of asylum seekers comparable to general mental health practitioners. The study also identified clinicians’ perceptions of training that supports them in their forensic psychological evaluations, their professional development needs, and the potential for general practitioners to leverage their current skill sets in this work.

51,The many faces of heterogeneity in psychiatric diagnostics: A response to Allsopp et al,"Comments on an article by K. Allsopp et al. (see record 2019-51754-004). Allsopp et al. complements this increasingly vast critical literature surrounding the DSM-5. On the one hand, it broadens existing critiques by exposing various forms of heterogeneity both within and across diagnostic criteria for a number of commonly diagnosed mental disorders. In so doing, the authors reveal at least one major potential source of heterogeneity within what should be discrete and homogeneous psychiatric categories. In this regard, we would add that, variation in the criteria brought to bear on different clinical accounts should not be regarded as being worrisome as such, especially as the authors seem to admit that there might be a perfectly valid reason why, e.g., the perspective of observers is attributed more weight in the case of psychosis than in reports about anxiety. However, such variation becomes spurious if not sufficiently grounded in clinical experience and rigorous empirical research (as in criteria about the severity of experienced trauma in PTSD), or if not formulated and defended in a sufficiently explicit way.

Methods: 49 BPD patients and 33 healthy control subjects were studied. Plasma levels of TBARS, nitrites, and the antioxidant enzymes CAT, GPx and SOD were measured. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained to investigate levels of intracellular components of the inflammatory/oxidative pathway including the IκBα, NFκB, iNOS, COX2, Keap1, NQO1, and HO1. Western Blot and ELISA were used to measure protein expression. Patients were assessed for different clinical dimensions of BPD with scales for depression, anxiety, impulsivity and functioning. Results: A significant decrease of IκBα levels and a significant increase of inflammatory factors, including NFκB, COX2 and iNOS levels were found in patients. On the other hand, a significant decrease was observed for all antioxidant enzymes in patients with BPD, except for HO1. The inflammatory factor NFκB showed a significant positive correlation with impulsivity scores. Conclusions: Patients with BPD presented an increased activation of several components of the inflammatory pathways, as well as an inhibition of the antioxidant path. These alterations appear partially correlated with the impulsivity scores in these patients.

53,The &lt;i&gt;NR3C1&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is a potential surrogate biomarker for risk and diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder which occurs after a traumatic event. The NR3C1 gene codes for the Glucocorticoid Receptor, which participate in the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and is altered in PTSD patients. To evaluate whether the NR3C1 gene expression in peripheral blood could be useful as a diagnosis biomarker, a total of 32 PTSD patients and 59 healthy controls were analyzed with quantitative RT-PCR. Also, to assess if NR3C1 dysregulation is associated with hypocortisolism in PTSD patients, serum cortisol was quantified by ELISA in a subset of these samples. Significant NR3C1 over-expression was found in PTSD patients compared with controls, and this was higher in patients with acute PTSD. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NR3C1 gene expression was 0.797. The sensibility and specificity of NRC1 gene expression to diagnose PTSD was 62.5% and 89.8%, respectively. We also found that an up-regulation of NR3C1 increased the risk for being diagnosed with PTSD (OR = 12.8, 95%, CI 4-41.4). Finally, the NR3C1 gene expression was inversely related with serum cortisol in PTSD patients. The present results suggest that NR3C1 gene expression could be a promising biomarker for PTSD diagnosis and estimate the risk for disease development.

54,Suicidality in relation to depressive symptoms and psychological distress in adults aged 30 to 101 years in a population-based study in Finland,"Background: Screening for suicidality has importance in terms of public health. We investigated which specific items of psychological distress best predicted suicidality in a population-based sample. Methods: A random sample of adults aged 30–101 years, being representative of the general population living in Finland, attended a health examination survey (Health 2011). We analyzed ( n = 4373) the total scores on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), as well as alcohol use, depressive and anxiety disorders as assessed with the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) among the participants. We assigned the participants having suicidality on the basis of the self-harm item on the BDI-13, and analyzed which of the items of the GHQ-12 were significant predictors of suicidality. Results: After adjusting for background variables, five items of the GHQ-12 remained as significant predictors for suicidality: items 11, 9, 4, 6, and 5 in this descending order. Limitations: The definition of suicidality was based on only a single item of the BDI-13. Conclusions: Certain items of the GHQ-12 demonstrated strong associations with suicidality, and the GHQ-12 or a brief version of it might be used as a screening instrument for suicidality.

55,Online writing about positive life experiences reduces depression and perceived stress reactivity in socially inhibited individuals,"Therapeutic writing can enhance psychological and physical health. Recent studies have suggested that these kinds of interventions can be effective when delivered online. The present study investigated whether positive emotional writing online can influence psychological and physical health in individuals reporting high levels of negative affectivity, who are most likely to benefit from psychological intervention ( N = 72, M age = 28.5, SD age = 8.7), and further, to investigate the potential moderating role of social inhibition. Participants completed self-report measures of physical symptoms, perceived stress, perceived stress reactivity, depression and generalised anxiety, before completing either i) positive emotional writing, or ii) a non-emotive control writing task on an online portal, for 20 min per day over three consecutive days. State anxiety was measured immediately after each writing session, and self-report questionnaires were again administered four weeks post-writing. Socially inhibited individuals exhibited significant reductions in depression and perceived stress reactivity four weeks following positive emotional writing, relative to writing about a neutral topic. The present study supports the efficacy of online therapeutic writing in individuals who, due to their socially inhibited nature, are most likely to benefit from online interventions which avoid interaction with a therapist or other clients.

56,"Childhood maltreatment, anxiety disorders and outcome in borderline personality disorder","Introduction: Anxiety disorders are a frequent in borderline personality disorder (BPD) and are associated with more severe symptomatology and poorer functional outcomes. Their presence in BPD is also believed to be the consequence of early life adversities. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between comorbid anxiety disorders, childhood maltreatment and severity of BPD. Methods: 388 BPD outpatients were assessed for lifetime anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment. Severity of BPD was measured by the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, history of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, psychotic symptoms, comorbid substance use disorder, other comorbid disorders, level of depression, hopelessness, impulsivity and trait anger. We used logistic regressions to test the association between childhood maltreatment and anxiety disorders and the effect of those factors on severity indicators Results: More than half of the participants suffered from two or more anxiety disorders. The most common comorbidity was social phobia. Childhood maltreatment was associated with an increased number of anxiety disorders. Both anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment had, independently from one another, an effect on severity indicators. Anxiety disorders were significantly associated with the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, suicide attempts and psychotic symptoms. Anxiety disorders had an impact on the level of depression and hopelessness, whereas childhood maltreatment impacted impulsivity and anger trait. Conclusion: Our results show the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders in BPD, as well as their impact on severity. Anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment should be considered by healthcare professionals to ensure optimal care. Furthermore, interventions targeting those issues need to be developed.

57,Specific or transdiagnostic? The occurrence of emotions and their association with distress in the daily life of patients with borderline personality disorder compared to clinical and healthy controls,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by more frequent and more intense negative emotions and less frequent positive emotions in daily life than healthy controls (HC) experience, but there is limited empirical evidence regarding whether this is a transdiagnostic or disorder-specific finding and which specific emotions are especially distressing in BPD. We assessed participants’ current emotions and distress every 15 min over a 24-h period using e-diaries to investigate the frequency, intensity, and the associated distress of specific emotions. To test the disorder specificity, we used multilevel modeling to compare 43 female patients with BPD, 28 patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 28 HC. Patients with BPD exhibited anger more frequently than any of the clinical or healthy control groups, demonstrating specificity. The quality of anger accounted for additional distress beyond the pure emotional intensity. In patients with BPD, joy was associated with reduced distress, which was not the case in HC or PTSD. However, the majority of the comparisons (anxiety, sadness, shame, disgust, jealousy, guilt, interest) revealed transdiagnostic patterns. The distress-enhancing or distress-reducing effects of anger and joy might represent an important part of affective dysregulation in BPD.

58,"Association of problematic smartphone use with poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis","To quantitatively assess the association of problematic smartphone use (PSU) with poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety, we reviewed current evidence from observational studies and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. The EBSCO PsycARTICLES, EMBASE, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched, and 14 studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. We calculated odds risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using random-effect or fixed-effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and chi2 statistics. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on country, adjusted variables, the methods of statistical analysis, outcome measures and publication year. We found significantly increased risks of poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in people with PSU. Our findings highlight the necessity of managing the PSU. However, further studies are required to confirm the results due to the high heterogeneity and methodological limitations.

59,The effect of Clinical Practice Guidelines on prescribing practice in mental health: A systematic review,"Clinical Practice Guidelines are succinct evidence-based recommendations and in psychiatry, exist to advise on psychotropic prescribing to effectively treat mental health conditions whilst minimising medication adverse effects. Implementation of psychiatric guidelines have, in the past, demonstrated little and transient impact on clinical practice. How effective prescribing guidelines are in aligning practice with evidence currently is unknown and this systematic review aimed to investigate said efficacy. Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL up to September 2019 and articles were selected by two reviewers independently with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The review identified 18 eligible articles pertaining to the following conditions: depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar affective disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and opiate addiction with depression guidelines being the most frequently evaluated. Seven studies revealed guidelines effected no change in psychotropic prescribing. The remaining studies illustrated that even when practice was changed, the effect was generally small, emphasising the need to change guideline development and implementation, taking into account obstacles or opportunities specific to psychotropic pharmacotherapy.

60,"Comparison of burnout, anxiety and depressive syndromes in hospital psychiatrists and other physicians: Results from the ESTEM study","Aims: To compare prevalence and risk factors for burnout, anxiety and depression among hospital psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists. Method: Regional online survey of psychiatric and non-psychiatric hospital physicians was performed including: a job-stress scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), a stressful work relationships list and a six items scale about work-related psychosocial risk factors (PRFs). The client-related burnout scale of the CBI has been changed to an interpersonal burnout scale. Cases were defined by a score of 8+ for the HADS-A/HADS-D and 50+ for the three CBI subscales. Results: 285 psychiatrists and 326 non-psychiatrists participated. The prevalence of depression, personal burnout and work-related burnout did not differ between physicians. Anxiety was lower in psychiatrists and interpersonal burnout was higher in senior psychiatrists. Multivariate analysis showed two main PRFs, common to both groups of physicians: “work intensity and time” was associated with four of the five syndromes and “emotional demands” with the three burnout syndromes. Interpersonal burnout was associated with stressful relationships with leaders, but not with patients. Conclusion: Reducing the workload, improving the management of emotions and increasing managerial skills are important approaches for prevention.

5,"Using network analysis to examine links between individual depressive symptoms, inflammatory markers, and covariates","Background Studies investigating the link between depressive symptoms and inflammation have yielded inconsistent results, which may be due to two factors. First, studies differed regarding the specific inflammatory markers studied and covariates accounted for. Second, specific depressive symptoms may be differentially related to inflammation. We address both challenges using network psychometrics. Methods We estimated seven regularized Mixed Graphical Models in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data ( N = 2321) to explore shared variances among (1) depression severity, modeled via depression sum-score, nine DSM-5 symptoms, or 28 individual depressive symptoms; (2) inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α ); (3) before and after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol, and chronic diseases. Results The depression sum-score was related to both IL-6 and CRP before, and only to IL-6 after covariate adjustment. When modeling the DSM-5 symptoms and CRP in a conceptual replication of Jokela et al ., CRP was associated with ‘sleep problems’, ‘energy level’, and ‘weight/appetite changes’; only the first two links survived covariate adjustment. In a conservative model with all 38 variables, symptoms and markers were unrelated. Following recent psychometric work, we re-estimated the full model without regularization: the depressive symptoms ‘insomnia’, ‘hypersomnia’, and ‘aches and pain’ showed unique positive relations to all inflammatory markers. Conclusions We found evidence for differential relations between markers, depressive symptoms, and covariates. Associations between symptoms and markers were attenuated after covariate adjustment; BMI and sex consistently showed strong relations with inflammatory markers.",2477439314.0, Journal Article,2020
6,"A randomised clinical trial to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of an early phase, online, guided augmentation of outpatient care for adults with anorexia nervosa","Background Outpatient interventions for adult anorexia nervosa typically have a modest impact on weight and eating disorder symptomatology. This study examined whether adding a brief online intervention focused on enhancing motivation to change and the development of a recovery identity (RecoveryMANTRA) would improve outcomes in adults with anorexia nervosa. Methods Participants with anorexia nervosa ( n = 187) were recruited from 22 eating disorder outpatient services throughout the UK. They were randomised to receiving RecoveryMANTRA in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) ( n = 99; experimental group) or TAU only ( n = 88; control group). Outcomes were measured at end-of-intervention (6 weeks), 6 and 12 months. Results Adherence rates to RecoveryMANTRA were 83% for the online guidance sessions and 77% for the use of self-help materials (workbook and/or short video clips). Group differences in body mass index at 6 weeks (primary outcome) were not significant. Group differences in eating disorder symptoms, psychological wellbeing and work and social adjustment (at 6 weeks and at follow-up) were not significant, except for a trend-level greater reduction in anxiety at 6 weeks in the RecoveryMANTRA group ( p = 0.06). However, the RecoveryMANTRA group had significantly higher levels of confidence in own ability to change ( p = 0.02) and alliance with the therapist at the outpatient service ( p = 0.005) compared to the control group at 6 weeks. Conclusions Augmenting outpatient treatment for adult anorexia nervosa with a focus on recovery and motivation produced short-term reductions in anxiety and increased confidence to change and therapeutic alliance.",2469712678.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
7,Virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is currently being used to treat social anxiety disorder (SAD); however, VRET's magnitude of efficacy, duration of efficacy, and impact on treatment discontinuation are still unclear. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that investigated the efficacy of VRET for SAD. The search strategy and analysis method are registered at PROSPERO (#CRD42019121097). Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies that targeted patients with SAD or related phobias; (2) studies where VRET was conducted for at least three sessions; (3) studies that included at least 10 participants. The primary outcome was social anxiety evaluation score change. Hedges' g and its 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effect models. The secondary outcome was the risk ratio for treatment discontinuation. Results Twenty-two studies ( n = 703) met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The efficacy of VRET for SAD was significant and continued over a long-term follow-up period: Hedges' g for effect size at post-intervention, −0.86 (−1.04 to −0.68); three months post-intervention, −1.03 (−1.35 to −0.72); 6 months post-intervention, −1.14 (−1.39 to −0.89); and 12 months post-intervention, −0.74 (−1.05 to −0.43). When compared to in vivo exposure, the efficacy of VRET was similar at post-intervention but became inferior at later follow-up points. Participant dropout rates showed no significant difference compared to in vivo exposure. Conclusion VRET is an acceptable treatment for SAD patients that has significant, long-lasting efficacy, although it is possible that during long-term follow-up, VRET efficacy lessens as compared to in vivo exposure.",2469711502.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
8,Explaining why childhood abuse is a risk factor for poorer clinical course in bipolar disorder: a path analysis of 923 people with bipolar I disorder,"Background Childhood abuse is a risk factor for poorer illness course in bipolar disorder, but the reasons why are unclear. Trait-like features such as affective instability and impulsivity could be part of the explanation. We aimed to examine whether childhood abuse was associated with clinical features of bipolar disorder, and whether associations were mediated by affective instability or impulsivity. Methods We analysed data from 923 people with bipolar I disorder recruited by the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Adjusted associations between childhood abuse, affective instability and impulsivity and eight clinical variables were analysed. A path analysis examined the direct and indirect links between childhood abuse and clinical features with affective instability and impulsivity as mediators. Results Affective instability significantly mediated the association between childhood abuse and earlier age of onset [effect estimate ( θ )/standard error (SE): 2.49], number of depressive ( θ /SE: 2.08) and manic episodes/illness year ( θ /SE: 1.32), anxiety disorders ( θ /SE: 1.98) and rapid cycling ( θ /SE: 2.25). Impulsivity significantly mediated the association between childhood abuse and manic episodes/illness year ( θ /SE: 1.79), anxiety disorders ( θ /SE: 1.59), rapid cycling ( θ /SE: 1.809), suicidal behaviour ( θ /SE: 2.12) and substance misuse ( θ /SE: 3.09). Measures of path analysis fit indicated an excellent fit to the data. Conclusions Affective instability and impulsivity are likely part of the mechanism of why childhood abuse increases risk of poorer clinical course in bipolar disorder, with each showing some selectivity in pathways. They are potential novel targets for intervention to improve outcome in bipolar disorder.",2456753190.0, Journal Article,2020
9,Depressed mood and anxiety as risk factors for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Psychosocial factors have been implicated as both a cause and consequence of hypertension in the general population but are less understood in relation to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). The aims of this review were to (1) synthesize the existing literature examining associations between depression and/or anxiety in pregnancy and HDP and (2) assess if depression and/or anxiety in early pregnancy was a risk factor for HDP. Methods A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO was conducted from inception to March 2020 using terms related to ‘pregnancy’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depression’, and ‘hypertensive disorders’. English-language cohort and case-control studies were included if they reported: (a) the presence or absence of clinically significant symptoms of depression/anxiety, or a medical record diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder in pregnancy; (b) diagnosis of HDP; and/or (c) data comparing the depressed/anxious group to the non-depressed/anxious group on HDP. Data related to depression/anxiety, HDP, study characteristics, and aspects related to study quality were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses of estimated pooled relative risks (RRs) were conducted for depression/anxiety in pregnancy and HDP. Results In total, 6291 citations were retrieved, and 44 studies were included across 61.2 million pregnancies. Depression and/or anxiety were associated with HDP [RR = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–1.54]. Conclusions When measurement of anxiety or depression preceded diagnosis of hypertension, the association remained (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.07–1.50). Women experiencing depression or anxiety in pregnancy have an increased prevalence of HDP compared to their non-depressed or non-anxious counterparts.",2450747226.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
10,Predictors of depressive symptom trajectories in a prospective follow-up of late adolescents,"Background Group-based trajectory modeling holds promise for the study of prognostic indicators in the mood disorders because the courses that the individuals with these disorders follow are so highly variable. However, trajectory analyses of major depressive disorder have so far not included some of the more robust predictors of mood disorder outcome, nor have they described interactions between these predictors. Methods A group of 186 individuals aged 15–20 years with past or current depressive symptoms, who had recently begun taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressant, underwent extensive baseline evaluations and were then followed for up to 2 years. Trajectory analyses used weekly ratings of depressive symptoms and the resulting groups were compared by the risk factors of sex, psychiatric comorbidity, negative emotionality, and childhood adversity. Results A three-group solution provided the best statistical fit to the 2-year symptom trajectory. Negative emotionality and childhood adversity, though correlated, independently predicted membership in higher-morbidity groups. Female sex and comorbidity with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were also significantly more likely in the trajectory groups with higher symptom levels. However, the presence of GAD, rather than female sex, was the most important determinant of group membership. Negative emotionality was predictive of group membership only among women. Conclusions Trajectory analyses indicated that week-to-week variations in depressive symptoms across individuals could best be condensed into low, remitting and persistent symptom patterns. Female sex, anxiety symptoms, negative emotionality and childhood adversity were each independently associated with trajectories of higher morbidity but negative emotionality may be prognostically important only among women.",2450742124.0, Journal Article,2020
11,The role of childhood generalized anxiety in the internalizing cluster,"Background Anxiety, depression and somatization (the internalizing cluster) are highly comorbid, prevalent and associated with significant individual and societal costs. Although prior studies have examined their natural course, there has been a little investigation into how symptoms unfold at the individual level. We examined the intraindividual (within-person) temporal patterning of symptom development and the impact of risk factors (sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators, bullying victimization, child maltreatment) on symptom means and trajectories (between-person), comparing youth and parent reports. Method Over a 7-year interval from age 11 to 17, children ( n = 669; 54% girls; 79% White) and parents (89% mothers) reported on symptoms of anxiety and depression from age 11 and somatization from age 13. Autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals were used to uncouple within- and between-person sources of variance. Results According to self-reports, generalized anxiety consistently predicted depression, while anxiety and depression consistently predicted somatization. Anxiety also had an indirect effect on somatization via depression. According to parent reports, there were several bidirectional effects between anxiety and depression and between depression and somatization. Experiences of abuse were consistent risk factors for self-reported internalizing symptoms, and across informants, girls had higher symptom means and rising trajectories compared to boys. Conclusion Generalized anxiety plays an important role in adolescent depressive and somatic symptoms. Primary prevention of anxiety may be warranted to curb symptom continuity and the development of comorbidity. Research is needed to determine whether self-reports of anxiety should be prioritized over parent reports and continued efforts are needed to reduce bullying and child maltreatment.",2450740592.0, Journal Article,2020
12,Profiles of psychosocial and clinical functioning in adolescence and risk for later depression and other outcomes,"Background Most studies examining predictors of the onset of depression focus on variable centered regression methods that focus on the effects of multiple predictors. In contrast, person-centered approaches develop profiles of factors and these profiles can be examined as predictors of onset. Here, we developed profiles of adolescent psychosocial and clinical functioning among adolescents without a history of major depression. Methods Data come from a subsample of participants from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project who completed self-report measures of functioning in adolescence and completed diagnostic and self-report measures at follow-up assessments up to approximately 15 years after baseline. Results We identified four profiles of psychosocial and clinical functioning: Thriving; Average Functioning; Externalizing Vulnerability and Family Stress and Internalizing Vulnerability at the baseline assessment of participants without a history of depression at the initial assessment in mid-adolescence. Classes differed in the likelihood of onset and course of depressive disorders, experience of later anxiety and substance use disorders, and psychosocial functioning in adulthood. Moreover, the predictive utility of these classes was maintained when controlling for multiple other established risk factors for depressive disorders. Conclusions This work highlights the utility of examining multiple factors simultaneously to understand risk for depression.",2447195979.0, Journal Article,2020
13,Effect of behavior therapy for Tourette's disorder on psychiatric symptoms and functioning in adults,"Background Although behavior therapy reduces tic severity, it is unknown whether it improves co-occurring psychiatric symptoms and functional outcomes for adults with Tourette's disorder (TD). This information is essential for effective treatment planning. This study examined the effects of behavior therapy on psychiatric symptoms and functional outcomes in older adolescents and adults with TD. Method A total of 122 individuals with TD or a chronic tic disorder participated in a clinical trial comparing behavior therapy to psychoeducation and supportive therapy. At baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up visits, participants completed assessments of tic severity, co-occurring symptoms (inattention, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, anger, anxiety, depression, obsessions, and compulsions), and psychosocial functioning. We compared changes in tic severity, psychiatric symptoms, and functional outcomes using repeated measure and one-way analysis of variance. Results At posttreatment, participants receiving behavior therapy reported greater reductions in obsessions compared to participants in supportive therapy ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.04, p = 0.04). Across treatments, a positive treatment response on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale was associated with a reduced disruption in family life ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.05, p = 0.02) and improved functioning in a parental role ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.37, p = 0.02). Participants who responded positively to eight sessions of behavior therapy had an improvement in tic severity ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001), inattention ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.48, p &lt; 0.02), and functioning ( \(\eta _p^2 \) = 0.39–0.42, p &lt; 0.03–0.04) at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion Behavior therapy has a therapeutic benefit for co-occurring obsessive symptoms in the short-term, and reduces tic severity and disability in adults with TD over time. Additional treatments may be necessary to address co-occurring symptoms and improve functional outcomes.",2447195473.0, Journal Article,2020
14,Social context and the real-world consequences of social anxiety,"Background Social anxiety lies on a continuum, and young adults with elevated symptoms are at risk for developing a range of psychiatric disorders. Yet relatively little is known about the factors that govern the hour-by-hour experience and expression of social anxiety in the real world. Methods Here we used smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to intensively sample emotional experience across different social contexts in the daily lives of 228 young adults selectively recruited to represent a broad spectrum of social anxiety symptoms. Results Leveraging data from over 11 000 real-world assessments, our results highlight the central role of close friends, family members, and romantic partners. The presence of such close companions was associated with enhanced mood, yet socially anxious individuals had fewer confidants and spent less time with the close companions that they do have. Although higher levels of social anxiety were associated with a general worsening of mood, socially anxious individuals appear to derive larger benefits – lower levels of negative affect, anxiety, and depression – from their close companions. In contrast, variation in social anxiety was unrelated to the amount of time spent with strangers, co-workers, and acquaintances; and we uncovered no evidence of emotional hypersensitivity to these less-familiar individuals. Conclusions These findings provide a framework for understanding the deleterious consequences of social anxiety in emerging adulthood and set the stage for developing improved intervention strategies.",2447195242.0, Journal Article,2020
15,Comorbidity of substance misuse with anxiety-related and depressive disorders: a genetically informative population study of 3 million individuals in Sweden,"Background Causes of the comorbidity of substance misuse with anxiety-related and depressive disorders (anxiety/depression) remain poorly known. We estimated associations of substance misuse and anxiety/depression in the general population and tested them while accounting for genetic and shared environmental factors. Methods We studied individuals born in Sweden 1968–1997 ( n = 2 996 398) with follow-up in nationwide register data for 1997–2013. To account for familial effects, stratified analyses were conducted within siblings and twin pairs. Substance misuse was defined as ICD-10 alcohol or drug use disorder or an alcohol/drug-related criminal conviction. Three dimensions of ICD-10 anxiety and depressive disorders and a substance misuse dimension were identified through exploratory factor analysis. Results Substance misuse was associated with a 4.5-fold (95% CI 4.50–4.58) elevated risk of lifetime generalized anxiety/depression, 4.7-fold (95% CI 4.63–4.82) elevated risk of panic disorder and agora/social phobia, and 2.9-fold elevated risk of phobias/OCD (95% CI 2.82–3.02) as compared to those without substance misuse. The associations were attenuated in within-family analyses but we found elevated risks in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for substance misuse as well as significant non-shared environmental correlations. The association between anxiety/depression and substance misuse was mainly driven by generalized anxiety/depression, whereas other anxiety/depression dimensions had minor or no independent associations with substance misuse. Conclusions Substance misuse and anxiety/depression are associated at the population level, and these associations are partially explained by familial liabilities. Our findings indicate a common genetic etiology but are also compatible with a potential partially causal relationship between substance misuse and anxiety/depression.",2430597046.0, Journal Article,2020

This study examines the course of disability in patients with chronic, recurrent and remitting MDD compared to healthy controls and identifies predictors of disability in remitting MDD. Methods We included 914 participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). DSM-IV MDD and WHO DAS II disability were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4 and 6 years. Six-year total and domain-specific disability were analysed and compared in participants with chronic ( n = 57), recurrent ( n = 120), remitting ( n = 127) MDD and in healthy controls ( n = 430). Predictors of residual disability were identified using linear regression analysis. Results At baseline, most disability was found in chronic MDD, followed by recurrent MDD, remitting MDD and healthy controls. Across diagnostic groups, most disability was found in household activities, interpersonal functioning, participation in society and cognition. A chronic course was associated with chronic disability. Symptom remission was associated with a decrease in disability, but some disability remained. In remitting MDD, higher residual disability was predicted by older age, more severe avoidance symptoms, higher disability at baseline and late symptom remission. Severity of residual disability correlated with the severity of residual depressive symptoms. Conclusions Symptomatic remission is a prerequisite for improvements in disability. However, disability persists despite symptom remission. Therefore, treatment of MDD should include an explicit focus on disability, especially on the more complex domains. To this end, treatments should promote behavioural activation and address subthreshold depressive symptoms in patients with remitted MDD.",2430596467.0, Journal Article,2020
17,Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in middle age: genetic and environmental architecture and stability of symptoms over 15 to 20 years,"Background Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology factors explain much of the covariance among psychiatric conditions, especially at the level of genetic risk. However, few studies have examined internalizing and externalizing factors in middle-aged samples, especially their ability to predict later symptoms across midlife. The goals of the current study were (i) to quantify the genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in individuals in their early 40s, and (ii) examine the extent to which these genetic and environmental influences predict self-reported measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms 15–20 years later. Method 1484 male twins completed diagnostic interviews of psychopathology at mean age 41 and self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, substance use, and related variables at up to two time-points in late middle age (mean ages 56 and 62). Results Structural equation modeling of the diagnostic interviews confirmed that internalizing and externalizing factors accounted for most of the genetic variance in individual disorders, with substantial genetic ( r a = 0.70) and environmental ( r e = 0.77) correlations between the factors. Internalizing psychopathology at age 41 was correlated with latent factors capturing anxiety, depression, and/or post-traumatic stress symptoms at ages 56 ( r = 0.51) and 62 ( r = 0.43). Externalizing psychopathology at age 41 was correlated r = 0.67 with a latent factor capturing aggression, tobacco use, and alcohol use at age 56. Stability of both factors was driven by genetic influences. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the considerable stability of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms across middle age, especially their genetic influences. Diagnostic interviews effectively predict self-reported symptoms and behaviors 15–20 years later.",2427208515.0, Journal Article,2020
18,Attenuated vagally-mediated heart rate variability at rest and in response to postural maneuvers in patients with generalized anxiety disorder,"Background Altered heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic nervous system function, has been reported in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but the results have been mixed. Thus, the present study, using a large sample size and better methodology, aims to examine whether GAD is associated with impaired HRV, both at rest and in response to posture challenges. Methods In total, 1832 participants were recruited in this study, consisting of 682 patients with GAD (including 326 drug- and comorbidity-free GAD patients) and 1150 healthy controls. Short-term HRV was measured during the supine-standing-supine test (5-min per position). Propensity score matching (PSM), a relatively novel method, was used to control for potential confounders. Results After PSM algorithm, drug- and comorbidity-free GAD patients had reductions in resting (baseline) high-frequency power (HF), an index for parasympathetic modulation, and increases in the low-frequency/HF ratio (LF/HF), an index for sympathovagal balance as compared to matched controls. Furthermore, the responses of HF and LF/HF to posture changes were all attenuated when compared with matched controls. Effect sizes, given by Cohen's d , for resting HF and HF reactivity were 0.42 and 0.36–0.42, respectively. Conclusions GAD is associated with altered sympathovagal balance, characterized by attenuation in both resting vagal modulation and vagal reactivity, with an almost medium effect size (Cohen's d ≈ 0.4), regardless of medication use or comorbidity status.",2427208194.0, Journal Article,2020
19,The protective effect of neighbourhood social cohesion on adolescent mental health following stressful life events,"Background Exposure to stressful life events is an established risk factor for the development of adolescent mental disorder. Growing evidence also suggests that neighbourhood social environments, including strong social cohesion, could have a protective effect on mental health. However, little is known about how neighbourhood social cohesion may buffer against the effects of stressful life events on adolescent mental health. Our aim was to assess whether neighbourhood social cohesion modifies the association between stressful life events and adolescent mental health outcomes. Methods Data were drawn from a nationally-representative prospective sample of Canadian adolescents, including 5183 adolescents aged 12/13 years at T1 and 14/15 years at T2. Caregivers reported neighbourhood social cohesion at T1, and exposure to stressful life events between T1 and T2. Symptoms of mental health and behaviour problems were self-reported by adolescents at T1 and T2. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether the relationship between stressful life events and outcomes was modified by neighbourhood social cohesion. Results Associations between stressful life events and adolescent outcomes were statistically significantly lower in neighbourhoods with greater social cohesion for: depression/anxiety (high cohesion OR = 0.98 v. low cohesion OR = 3.11), suicidal ideation (OR high = 1.30 v. OR low = 5.25), aggression/conduct disorder (OR high = 1.09 v. OR low = 4.27), and property offence (OR high = 1.21 v. OR low = 4.21). Conclusions Greater neighbourhood social cohesion appeared to buffer the effects of stressful life events on several domains of adolescent mental health. This potentially presents a target for public health intervention to improve adolescent mental health and behavioural outcomes.",2416826629.0, Journal Article,2020
20,Risk and protective factors for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses,"Background A multitude of risk/protective factors for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders have been proposed. We conducted an umbrella review to summarize the evidence of the associations between risk/protective factors and each of the following disorders: specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and to assess the strength of this evidence whilst controlling for several biases. Methods Publication databases were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining associations between potential risk/protective factors and each of the disorders investigated. The evidence of the association between each factor and disorder was graded into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant according to a standardized classification based on: number of cases (&gt;1000), random-effects p -values, 95% prediction intervals, confidence interval of the largest study, heterogeneity between studies, study effects, and excess of significance. Results Nineteen systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included, corresponding to 216 individual studies covering 427 potential risk/protective factors. Only one factor association (early physical trauma as a risk factor for social anxiety disorder, OR 2.59, 95% CI 2.17–3.1) met all the criteria for convincing evidence. When excluding the requirement for more than 1000 cases, five factor associations met the other criteria for convincing evidence and 22 met the remaining criteria for highly suggestive evidence. Conclusions Although the amount and quality of the evidence for most risk/protective factors for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders is limited, a number of factors significantly increase the risk for these disorders, may have potential prognostic ability and inform prevention.",2416826596.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
21,Longitudinal brain changes in MDD during emotional encoding: effects of presence and persistence of symptomatology,"Background The importance of the hippocampus and amygdala for disrupted emotional memory formation in depression is well-recognized, but it remains unclear whether functional abnormalities are state-dependent and whether they are affected by the persistence of depressive symptoms. Methods Thirty-nine patients with major depressive disorder and 28 healthy controls were included from the longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sub-study of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Participants performed an emotional word-encoding and -recognition task during fMRI at baseline and 2-year follow-up measurement. At baseline, all patients were in a depressed state. We investigated state-dependency by relating changes in brain activation over time to changes in symptom severity. Furthermore, the effect of time spent with depressive symptoms in the 2-year interval was investigated. Results Symptom change was linearly associated with higher activation over time of the left anterior hippocampus extending to the amygdala during positive and negative word-encoding. Especially during positive word encoding, this effect was driven by symptomatic improvement. There was no effect of time spent with depression in the 2-year interval on change in brain activation. Results were independent of medication- and psychotherapy-use. Conclusion Using a longitudinal within-subjects design, we showed that hippocampal–amygdalar activation during emotional memory formation is related to depressive symptom severity but not persistence (i.e. time spent with depression or ‘load’), suggesting functional activation patterns in depression are not subject to functional ‘scarring’ although this hypothesis awaits future replication.",2416826096.0, Journal Article,2020
22,Sexual orientation and mental health over the life course in a birth cohort,"Background Sexual minority individuals consistently report higher rates of mental disorder than heterosexuals. However, much of the research has methodological limitations related to the classification of sexuality, the use of cross-sectional data and problematic sampling procedures such as using convenience samples. Methods We used longitudinal data from a birth cohort enrolled in the Christchurch Health and Development Study ( n = 1040). Latent class analysis was used to classify participants sexuality based on self-report data of sexual behaviour, attraction, identity and fantasy, gathered over five assessments between the ages of 18 and 35 years. Mental health and substance use outcome data were gathered at four assessments between the ages of 21 and 35 years. Potential covariate variables were collected during childhood. Results The latent class analysis identified four groups interpreted as: ‘heterosexual’ 82%, ‘mostly heterosexual’ 12.6%, ‘bisexual’ 3.5% and ‘gay/lesbian’ 1.9%. In the sexual minority groups, women outnumbered men by at least 2:1. Pooled rates for mental health disorders of depression, anxiety disorders, suicidal ideation, cannabis abuse and total disorders, after adjustment for childhood covariate variables, were significantly higher in the sexual minority groups ( p &lt; 0.01). The strength of association between sexuality group and mental health outcomes did not differ according to sex. Fluidity in sexuality reports appeared unrelated to risk of mental health outcomes. Conclusions Over the life course, membership of a sexual minority group is clearly associated with mental health problems of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation regardless of the age when same-sex attraction, behaviour, identity or fantasy is expressed.",2416825931.0, Journal Article,2020
23,Developmental joint trajectories of anxiety-depressive trait and trait-aggression: implications for co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing problems,"Background In youth, anxiety-depressive traits (ADT) and trait-aggression (TA) are important risk factors of exhibiting maladaptive behaviors in adulthood (i.e. violence and substance use). However, the developmental co-occurrence of these traits in youth remains unknown. We thus sought to investigate the developmental trajectories of ADT and TA within a data-driven approach. The aim was two-fold: (i) to examine the developmental trajectories of ADT and TA in youth from ages 10 to 16, and (ii) to investigate both childhood predictors and problematic outcomes of the identified joint trajectories. Method The sample comprised 1354 children provided from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) Consortium. Group-based trajectory modeling was first employed to identify individual trajectory models of ADT and TA independently (from ages 10 to 16). Then, joint trajectory models were built on the found trajectories. Last, logistic regressions were used to evaluate the childhood characteristics and negative outcomes of the joint trajectory groups. Results Our results showed five trajectory groups with varying levels of ADT and TA. A significant co-occurrence between ADT and TA was found in three of the trajectory groups. Notably, higher levels of childhood psychopathology and more severe/frequent childhood abuse were found in the groups with moderate to high ADT and high TA. The groups with higher ADT and high TA were also more likely to exhibit violence and substance use. Conclusions This study exposes the importance of assessing ADT and TA simultaneously and early in childhood to prevent and manage the risk of problematic behaviors in adolescence.",2416825443.0, Journal Article,2020
24,Functional connectivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and its subtypes,"Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder with significant morbidity whose pathophysiology is not fully understood. Neuroimaging studies have characterized OCD in terms of elevated striatal and prefrontal reactivity to emotion provocation. This neural model may be informed by investigation of functional connectivity in OCD, identifying alterations in how sensory information is integrated into frontostriatal regions. Methods The current study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare neural activity and connectivity in 31 OCD patients (12 washing and 19 checking subtypes) and 17 healthy volunteers in an emotion provocation paradigm using visual stimuli. Results OCD status was associated with hyper-activation of the posterior cingulate (PCg) in response to emotion provocation. Additionally, OCD patients demonstrated elevated PCg functional connectivity with the visual cortices and frontostriatal regions. Exploratory analyses suggested that stimulus-provoked activity and connectivity was elevated for checking subtypes in motor cortices, and elevated in washing subtypes in the anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions The PCg's role in moderating connectivity between the visual cortex and frontolimbic regions is muted in OCD, consistent with the PCg's suggested role in regulating attention towards emotional stimuli. Exploratory analyses suggest distinct PCg connectivity profiles in OCD subtypes, with checking linked to motor activation, but washing linked to a network supporting emotional salience. The study was not powered to fully investigate the effects of medication, patients often endorsed secondary symptom subtypes that muddied washing/checking distinctions, and the emotion provocation paradigm was of limited intensity compared to life stressors.",2406448565.0, Journal Article,2020
25,Sleep problems and associations with psychopathology and cognition in young people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS),"Background Young people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Sleep problems may play a role in this risk but their prevalence, nature and links to psychopathology and cognitive function remain undescribed in this population. Method Sleep problems, psychopathology, developmental coordination and cognitive function were assessed in 140 young people with 22q11.2DS (mean age = 10.1, s.d. = 2.46) and 65 unaffected sibling controls (mean age = 10.8, s.d. SD = 2.26). Primary carers completed questionnaires screening for the children's developmental coordination and autism spectrum disorder. Results Sleep problems were identified in 60% of young people with 22q11.2DS compared to 23% of sibling controls (OR 5.00, p &lt; 0.001). Two patterns best-described sleep problems in 22q11.2DS: restless sleep and insomnia. Restless sleep was linked to increased ADHD symptoms (OR 1.16, p &lt; 0.001) and impaired executive function (OR 0.975, p = 0.013). Both patterns were associated with elevated symptoms of anxiety disorder (restless sleep: OR 1.10, p = 0.006 and insomnia: OR 1.07, p = 0.045) and developmental coordination disorder (OR 0.968, p = 0.0023, and OR 0.955, p = 0.009). The insomnia pattern was also linked to elevated conduct disorder symptoms (OR 1.53, p = 0.020). Conclusions Clinicians and carers should be aware that sleep problems are common in 22q11.2DS and index psychiatric risk, cognitive deficits and motor coordination problems. Future studies should explore the physiology of sleep and the links with the neurodevelopment in these young people.",2406448411.0, Journal Article,2020
26,Prevalence of comorbid mental and physical illnesses and risks for self-harm and premature death among primary care patients diagnosed with fatigue syndromes,"Background Fatigue syndromes (FSs) affect large numbers of individuals, yet evidence from epidemiological studies on adverse outcomes, such as premature death, is limited. Methods Cohort study involving 385 general practices in England that contributed to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) with linked inpatient Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) cause of death information. A total of 10 477 patients aged 15 years and above, diagnosed with a FS during 2000–2014, were individually matched with up to 20 comparator patients without a history of having a FS. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated to compare the FS and comparison cohorts on clinical characteristics. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent adverse outcomes were estimated from stratified Cox regression models. Results Among patients diagnosed with FSs, we found elevated baseline prevalence of: any psychiatric illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.72–1.82), anxiety disorders (PR 1.92; 1.85–1.99), depression (PR 1.89; 1.83–1.96), psychotropic prescriptions (PR 1.68; 1.64–1.72) and comorbid physical illness (PR 1.28; 1.23–1.32). We found no significant differences in risks for: all-cause mortality (HR 0.99; 0.91–1.09), natural death (HR 0.99; 0.90–1.09), unnatural death (HR 1.00; 0.59–1.72) or suicide (HR 1.68; 0.78–3.63). We did, however, observe a significantly elevated non-fatal self-harm risk: HR 1.83; 1.56–2.15. Conclusions The absence of elevated premature mortality risk is reassuring. The raised prevalence of mental illness and increased non-fatal self-harm risk indicate a need for enhanced assessment and management of psychopathology associated with fatigue syndromes.",2406448368.0, Journal Article,2020
27,"Observed psychopathology in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia","Background Children of parents with mood and psychotic disorders are at elevated risk for a range of behavioral and emotional problems. However, as the usual reporter of psychopathology in children is the parent, reports of early problems in children of parents with mood and psychotic disorders may be biased by the parents' own experience of mental illness and their mental state. Methods Independent observers rated psychopathology using the Test Observation Form in 378 children and youth between the ages of 4 and 24 (mean = 11.01, s.d . = 4.40) who had a parent with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or no history of mood and psychotic disorders. Results Observed attentional problems were elevated in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (effect sizes ranging between 0.31 and 0.56). Oppositional behavior and language/thought problems showed variable degrees of elevation (effect sizes 0.17 to 0.57) across the three high-risk groups, with the greatest difficulties observed in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. Observed anxiety was increased in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (effect sizes 0.19 and 0.25 respectively) but not in offspring of parents with schizophrenia. Conclusions Our results suggest that externalizing problems and cognitive and language difficulties may represent a general manifestation of familial risk for mood and psychotic disorders, while anxiety may be a specific marker of liability for mood disorders. Observer assessment may improve early identification of risk and selection of youth who may benefit from targeted prevention.",2396107628.0, Journal Article,2020
28,Dimensions of anxiety in Major depressive disorder and their use in predicting antidepressant treatment outcome: an iSPOT-D report,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) commonly co-occurs with clinically significant levels of anxiety. However, anxiety symptoms are varied and have been inconsistently associated with clinical, functional, and antidepressant treatment outcomes. We aimed to identify and characterise dimensions of anxiety in people with MDD and their use in predicting antidepressant treatment outcome. Method 1008 adults with a current diagnosis of single-episode or recurrent, nonpsychotic, MDD were assessed at baseline on clinical features and cognitive/physiological functioning. Participants were then randomised to one of three commonly prescribed antidepressants and reassessed at 8 weeks regarding symptom change, as well as remission and response, on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression (HRSD 17 ) and the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR 16 ). Exploratory factor analysis was used on items from scales assessing anxiety symptoms, and resulting factors were assessed against clinical features and cognitive/physiological functioning. Factors were also assessed on their ability to predict treatment outcome. Results Three factors emerged relating to stress, cognitive anxiety, and somatic anxiety. All factors showed high internal consistency, minimal cross-loadings, and unique clinical and functional profiles. Furthermore, only higher somatic anxiety was associated with poorer QIDS-SR 16 remission, even after adjusting for covariates and multiple comparisons. Conclusions Anxiety symptoms in people with MDD can be separated onto distinct factors that differentially respond to treatment outcome. Furthermore, these factors do not align with subscales of established measures of anxiety. Future research should consider cognitive and somatic symptoms of anxiety separately when assessing anxiety in MDD and their use in predicting treatment outcome.",2396107281.0, Journal Article,2020
29,A mechanistic model for individualised treatment of anxiety disorders based on predictive neural biomarkers,"Increased amygdala responsiveness is the hallmark of fear and a characteristic across patients with anxiety disorders. The amygdala is embedded in a complex regulatory circuit. Multiple different mechanisms may elevate amygdala responsiveness and lead to the occurrence of an anxiety disorder. While top-down control by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) downregulates amygdala responses, the locus coeruleus (LC) drives up amygdala activation via noradrenergic projections. This indicates that the same fearful phenotype may result from different neural mechanisms. We propose a mechanistic model that defines three different neural biomarkers causing amygdala hyper-responsiveness in patients with anxiety disorders: (a) inherent amygdala hypersensitivity, (b) low prefrontal control and (c) high LC drive. First-line treatment for anxiety disorders is exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy, which strengthens PFC recruitment during emotion regulation and thus targets low-prefrontal control. A treatment response rate around 50% (Loerinc et al., 2015, Clinical Psychological Reviews , 42 , 72–82) might indicate heterogeneity of underlying neurobiological mechanisms among patients, presumably leading to high variation in treatment benefit. Transforming insights from cognitive neuroscience into applicable clinical heuristics to categorise patients based on their underlying biomarker may support individualised treatment selection in psychiatry. We review literature on the three anxiety-related mechanisms and present a mechanistic model that may serve as a rational for pathology-based diagnostic and biomarker-guided treatment selection in psychiatry.",2391802277.0, Journal Article,2020
30,The Dunn Worry Questionnaire and the Paranoia Worries Questionnaire: new assessments of worry,"Background The cognitive process of worry, which keeps negative thoughts in mind and elaborates the content, contributes to the occurrence of many mental health disorders. Our principal aim was to develop a straightforward measure of general problematic worry suitable for research and clinical treatment. Our secondary aim was to develop a measure of problematic worry specifically concerning paranoid fears. Methods An item pool concerning worry in the past month was evaluated in 250 non-clinical individuals and 50 patients with psychosis in a worry treatment trial. Exploratory factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) informed the selection of scale items. IRT analyses were repeated with the scales administered to 273 non-clinical individuals, 79 patients with psychosis and 93 patients with social anxiety disorder. Other clinical measures were administered to assess concurrent validity. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 75 participants. Sensitivity to change was assessed with 43 patients with psychosis. Results A 10-item general worry scale (Dunn Worry Questionnaire; DWQ) and a five-item paranoia worry scale (Paranoia Worries Questionnaire; PWQ) were developed. All items were highly discriminative (DWQ a = 1.98–5.03; PWQ a = 4.10–10.7), indicating small increases in latent worry lead to a high probability of item endorsement. The DWQ was highly informative across a wide range of the worry distribution, whilst the PWQ had greatest precision at clinical levels of paranoia worry. The scales demonstrated excellent internal reliability, test-retest reliability, concurrent validity and sensitivity to change. Conclusions The new measures of general problematic worry and worry about paranoid fears have excellent psychometric properties.",2391801932.0, Journal Article,2020
31,Associations between negative life experiences and the mental health of trans and gender diverse young people in Australia: findings from Trans Pathways,"Background Trans and gender diverse (TGD) young people worldwide experience high rates of poor mental health; however, these rates were unknown in Australia. In addition, how negative life events affect the mental health of TGD young people has been largely unexplored. Methods This paper reports on novel mental health findings of Trans Pathways, the largest study ever conducted in Australia with trans (transgender) and gender diverse young people ( N = 859; aged 14–25 years). The study was an anonymous online cross-sectional survey undertaken in 2016. Logistic and linear regression models were used to test associations between mental health outcomes and negative life experiences. Results TGD young people in Australia experience high levels of mental distress, including self-harming (79.7%), suicidal thoughts (82.4%), and attempting suicide (48.1%). Three in four participants had been diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety (74.6% and 72.2%, respectively). Many TGD young people had been exposed to negative experiences such as peer rejection (89.0%), precarious accommodation (22.0%), bullying (74.0%), and discrimination (68.9%). Most poor mental health outcomes were associated with negative experiences. The strongest associations were found for precarious accommodation and issues within educational settings. For example, participants with a prior suicide attempt were almost six times more likely to have experienced issues with accommodation, including homelessness. Conclusions The current results highlight the urgent need for better mental health care and provide insight into areas for targeted mental health interventions. These findings are pertinent for clinicians working with trans young people and wider society.",2391801897.0, Journal Article,2020
32,Shared genetic etiology between anxiety disorders and psychiatric and related intermediate phenotypes,"Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019 2019 Cambridge University Press Background Psychiatric disorders and related intermediate phenotypes are highly heritable and have a complex, overlapping polygenic architecture. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of anxiety disorders identified genetic variants that are significant on a genome-wide. The current study investigated the genetic etiological overlaps between anxiety disorders and frequently cooccurring psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes. Methods Using case–control and factor score models, we investigated the genetic correlations of anxiety disorders with eight psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes [the volumes of seven subcortical brain regions, childhood cognition, general cognitive ability and personality traits (subjective well-being, loneliness, neuroticism and extraversion)] from large-scale GWASs ( n = 7556–298 420) by linkage disequilibrium score regression. Results Among psychiatric disorders, the risk of anxiety disorders was positively genetically correlated with the risks of major depressive disorder (MDD) ( r g ± standard error = 0.83 ± 0.16, p = 1.97 × 10 −7 ), schizophrenia (SCZ) (0.28 ± 0.09, p = 1.10 × 10 −3 ) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (0.34 ± 0.13, p = 8.40 × 10 −3 ). Among intermediate phenotypes, significant genetic correlations existed between the risk of anxiety disorders and neuroticism (0.81 ± 0.17, p = 1.30 × 10 −6 ), subjective well-being (−0.73 ± 0.18, p = 4.89 × 10 −5 ), general cognitive ability (−0.23 ± 0.08, p = 4.70 × 10 −3 ) and putamen volume (−0.50 ± 0.18, p = 5.00 × 10 −3 ). No other significant genetic correlations between anxiety disorders and psychiatric or intermediate phenotypes were observed ( p &gt; 0.05). The case–control model yielded stronger genetic effect sizes than the factor score model. Conclusions Our findings suggest that common genetic variants underlying the risk of anxiety disorders contribute to elevated risks of MDD, SCZ, ADHD and neuroticism and reduced quality of life, putamen volume and cognitive performance. We suggest that the comorbidity of anxiety disorders is partly explained by common genetic variants.",2382042758.0, Journal Article,2020
33,Integrating mental health and disaster preparedness in intervention: a randomized controlled trial with earthquake and flood-affected communities in Haiti,"Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019 2019 Cambridge University Press http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Background Given the frequency of natural hazards in Haiti, disaster risk reduction is crucial. However, evidence suggests that many people exposed to prior disasters do not engage in disaster preparedness, even when they receive training and have adequate resources. This may be partially explained by a link between mental health symptoms and preparedness; however, these components are typically not integrated in intervention. Methods The current study assesses effectiveness of an integrated mental health and disaster preparedness intervention. This group-based model was tested in three earthquake-exposed and flood-prone communities ( N = 480), across three time points, using a randomized controlled trial design. The 3-day community-based intervention was culturally-adapted, facilitated by trained Haitian lay mental health workers, and focused on enhancing disaster preparedness, reducing mental health symptoms, and fostering community cohesion. Results Consistent with hypotheses, the intervention increased disaster preparedness, reduced symptoms associated with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and functional impairment, and increased peer-based help-giving and help-seeking. Mediation models indicated support for the underlying theoretical model, such that the effect of the intervention on preparedness was mediated by mental health, and that effects on mental health were likewise mediated by preparedness. Conclusions The community-based mental health-integrated disaster preparedness intervention is effective in improving mental health and preparedness among community members in Haiti vulnerable to natural hazards. This brief intervention has the potential to be scaled up for use with other communities vulnerable to earthquakes, seasonal flooding, and other natural hazards.",2336942835.0," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
34,Factors associated with satisfaction of inpatient psychiatric care: a cross country comparison,"Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019 2019 Cambridge University Press Background Patient satisfaction is a key indicator of inpatient care quality and is associated with clinical outcomes following admission. Different patient characteristics have been inconsistently linked with satisfaction. This study aims to overcome previous limitations by assessing which patient characteristics are associated with satisfaction within a large study of psychiatric inpatients conducted across five European countries. Methods All patients with a diagnosis of psychotic (F2), affective (F3) or anxiety/somataform (F4) disorder admitted to 57 psychiatric inpatient units in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK were included. Data were collected from medical records and face-to-face interviews, with patients approached within 2 days of admission. Satisfaction with inpatient care was measured on the Client Assessment of Treatment Scale. Results Higher satisfaction scores were associated with being older, employed, living with others, having a close friend, less severe illness and a first admission. In contrast, higher education levels, comorbid personality disorder and involuntary admission were associated with lower levels of satisfaction. Although the same patient characteristics predicted satisfaction within the five countries, there were significant differences in overall satisfaction scores across countries. Compared to other countries, patients in the UK were significantly less satisfied with their inpatient care. Conclusions Having a better understanding of patient satisfaction may enable services to improve the quality of care provided as well as clinical outcomes for all patients. Across countries, the same patient characteristics predict satisfaction, suggesting that similar analytical frameworks can and should be used when assessing satisfaction both nationally and internationally.",2336941980.0, Journal Article,2020
35,Translating a rodent measure of negative bias into humans: the impact of induced anxiety and unmedicated mood and anxiety disorders,"Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019 2019 Cambridge University Press http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Background Mood and anxiety disorders are ubiquitous but current treatment options are ineffective for many sufferers. Moreover, a number of promising pre-clinical interventions have failed to translate into clinical efficacy in humans. Improved treatments are unlikely without better animal–human translational pipelines. Here, we translate a rodent measure of negative affective bias into humans, exploring its relationship with (1) pathological mood and anxiety symptoms and (2) transient induced anxiety. Methods Adult participants (age = 29 ± 11) who met criteria for mood or anxiety disorder symptomatology according to a face-to-face neuropsychiatric interview were included in the symptomatic group. Study 1 included N = 77 (47 = asymptomatic [female = 21]; 30 = symptomatic [female = 25]), study 2 included N = 47 asymptomatic participants (25 = female). Outcome measures were choice ratios, reaction times and parameters recovered from a computational model of reaction time – the drift diffusion model (DDM) – from a two-alternative-forced-choice task in which ambiguous and unambiguous auditory stimuli were paired with high and low rewards. Results Both groups showed over 93% accuracy on unambiguous tones indicating intact discrimination, but symptomatic individuals demonstrated increased negative affective bias on ambiguous tones [proportion high reward = 0.42 ( s.d. = 0.14)] relative to asymptomatic individuals [0.53 ( s.d. = 0.17)] as well as a significantly reduced DDM drift rate. No significant effects were observed for the within-subjects anxiety-induction. Conclusions Humans with pathological anxiety symptoms directly mimic rodents undergoing anxiogenic manipulation. The lack of sensitivity to transient anxiety suggests the paradigm might be more sensitive to clinically relevant symptoms. Our results establish a direct translational pipeline (and candidate therapeutics screen) from negative affective bias in rodents to pathological mood and anxiety symptoms in humans.",2336941934.0, Journal Article,2020
36,Can psychological features predict antidepressant response to rTMS? A Discovery–Replication approach,"Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019 2019 Cambridge University Press Background Few studies focused on the relationship between psychological measures, major depressive disorder (MDD) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) response. This study investigated several psychological measures as potential predictors for rTMS treatment response. Additionally, this study employed two approaches to evaluate the robustness of our findings by implementing immediate replication and full-sample exploration with strict p -thresholding. Methods This study is an open-label, multi-site study with a total of 196 MDD patients. The sample was subdivided in a Discovery (60% of total sample, n = 119) and Replication sample (40% of total sample, n = 77). Patients were treated with right low frequency (1 Hz) or left high frequency (10 Hz) rTMS at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Clinical variables [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness Five-Factor Inventory, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, and BDI subscales] were obtained at baseline, post-treatment, and at follow-up. Predictors were analyzed in terms of statistical association, robustness (independent replication), as well as for their clinical relevance [positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)]. Results Univariate analyses revealed that non-responders had higher baseline anhedonia scores. Anhedonia scores at baseline correlated negatively with total BDI percentage change over time. This finding was replicated. However, anhedonia scores showed to be marginally predictive of rTMS response, and neither PPV nor NPV reached the levels of clinical relevance. Conclusions This study suggests that non-responders to rTMS treatment have higher baseline anhedonia scores. However, anhedonia was only marginally predictive of rTMS response. Since all other psychological measures did not show predictive value, it is concluded that psychological measures cannot be used as clinically relevant predictors to rTMS response in MDD.",2336939952.0, Journal Article,2020
37,Levels of early-childhood behavioral inhibition predict distinct neurodevelopmental pathways to pediatric anxiety,"Background Anxiety symptoms gradually emerge during childhood and adolescence. Individual differences in behavioral inhibition (BI), an early-childhood temperament, may shape developmental paths through which these symptoms arise. Cross-sectional research suggests that level of early-childhood BI moderates associations between later anxiety symptoms and threat-related amygdala–prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuitry function. However, no study has characterized these associations longitudinally. Here, we tested whether level of early-childhood BI predicts distinct evolving associations between amygdala–PFC function and anxiety symptoms across development. Methods Eighty-seven children previously assessed for BI level in early childhood provided data at ages 10 and/or 13 years, consisting of assessments of anxiety and an fMRI-based dot-probe task (including threat, happy, and neutral stimuli). Using linear-mixed-effects models, we investigated longitudinal changes in associations between anxiety symptoms and threat-related amygdala–PFC connectivity, as a function of early-childhood BI. Results In children with a history of high early-childhood BI, anxiety symptoms became, with age, more negatively associated with right amygdala–left dorsolateral-PFC connectivity when attention was to be maintained on threat. In contrast, with age, low-BI children showed an increasingly positive anxiety–connectivity association during the same task condition. Behaviorally, at age 10, anxiety symptoms did not relate to fluctuations in attention bias (attention bias variability, ABV) in either group; by age 13, low-BI children showed a negative anxiety–ABV association, whereas high-BI children showed a positive anxiety–ABV association. Conclusions Early-childhood BI levels predict distinct neurodevelopmental pathways to pediatric anxiety symptoms. These pathways involve distinct relations among brain function, behavior, and anxiety symptoms, which may inform diagnosis and treatment.",2333551774.0, Journal Article,2020
