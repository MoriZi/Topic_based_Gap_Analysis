6,"Nausea caused by anxiety, spiral into a destructive pattern of being unable to eat, feeling shitty, then feeling sick to my stomach, then feeling anxious and shitty, and so on.","How do I break out of this when i keep throwing up? My parents refuse to take me to therapy or get me SSRIs. I see the school psychologist every two weeks/every week and he helps a lot, but it's not enough. He's a real therapist with a PhD and years of experience, but he is part of the school after all and a free service. 

I have tried to get my parents to understand. I've had the school psychologists talk to them but they refuse to listen. They think it's all a load of garbage and they also think I exaggerate things to the psychologist and am essentially a weak person who ""can't get their shit together"". I don't think they could even begin to understand what my anxiety is like. I'm pretty sure I have OCD, and I used to have obsessions that weren't really grounded in reality. Now my obsessions are based off of things that anybody would find anxiety inducing, they're just crippling and much more intense than they are for most. Sometimes I lie in bed, unable to eat, unable to function, because the anxiety about something in my life is crippling. I haven't felt like this in months, until today. I'm not sure why everything is piling up and becoming unbearable. Maybe it's because school is starting soon and a lot of stressful things are coming my way. I talked to my therapist yesterday (by sneaking out of the house and going to the school) and I still feel like shit. Since I have OCD and often seek reassurance, he usually tries to expose me to my fears, just a little bit. Well, as of right now, I feel like the world is collapsing and if I try to eat anything I'll throw it back up and my stomach hurts incredibly. I'm supposed to go to work soon but I really don't want to. ",79,2017-08-11 18:27:07 EDT-0400

8,Dear Anxiety... let me go.,"31 years weve been together, its time to let me go. 

I want to see tomorrow. I want to see next year. I already know how you feel, i want to feel something else. Stop taking my breath away, Stop making me think that this is all there is to life. Stop making me feel like im drowning. I want to see the sun shine, i want to see my kids grow. I want to know what life is like without you. Because with you, its shit. Im sick of crying when I shouldnt.  im sick of not being able to cry when I should. 
Stop making me feel like asking for help just increases the burden of who I am. Stop making me think that there isnt an end to this. Stop making me think that this is the end. Let me go. Because I cant keep fighting just to stay behind the rest..

18,"I was diagnosed today, I'm ready to fight this illness!","Hey guys, 

I went to my first counselling session today after not admitting I had a problem for many many years. 

It was just an initial consultation with a diagnosed of moderate to severe depression and anxiety. Anxiety being the more prominent of the two and the one my counsellor has agreed to make a priority. 

I have my first real session on Friday and I'm ready to to sort this out once for all. I will no longer live with this dehibilatating condition  

I'm posting this for anyone who hasn't taken that step into acknowledgement and the action of seeking professional help. If I can do this, anyone can. You don't have to live like this, you can be helped. 

You are not weak, you are not a bad person. 

Take that step like I have, the actually act of seeking help has really given me hope for the future. 

You are not alone x",24,2017-08-14 18:07:00 EDT-0400
19,I can‚Äôt go one day without thinking about nuclear war.,"I don‚Äôt want to talk about politics in an anxiety subreddit, but I can‚Äôt think straight anymore. Everyday the tension between the US and North Korea seems to be getting worse and worse. I can‚Äôt help but to go on news websites and check how the situation is unfolding, and it‚Äôs not looking good. 

I try to calm myself down by watching some videos on YouTube, it does help me for a while, but then some Late Night Show shit gets recommended to me. I can‚Äôt help but click it. They‚Äôre on the topic about North Korea and their threats and it boggles me that they joke around this much about the possibility of a war, making remarks such as, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna die.‚Äù Then the audience laughs their asses off, it really fucks me up.

All this anxiety is making me unmotivated to do anything I like, knowing that I‚Äôll think about nuclear war, even though war has nothing to do with the activity I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm a sophomore in high school so I‚Äôve never really experienced anything like this before. I know I can‚Äôt do anything about it, it‚Äôs not in my control, but I just want answers, are we fucked?

22,Does anyone else's anxiety mess up your speech?,"I've had this whole issue with speaking and writing from childhood. It stems from my parents divorce. My siblings and I always had to ask our mom what's okay to say/not to say, how to respond to xyz. This was because she didn't want our dad to know anything. If we slipped up, we were punished badly to say the least. That eventually effected my writing. I struggle to write academic papers because I need constant approval. I need to make sure I am on the right track. I am slowly breaking out of it. I ask my husband after I finish a page to see if it's good. 

The problem now is my speech. I broke out of stumbling across words pretty young. The only thing is I rehearse what I have to say to make sure I don't sound dumb. But now I'm just a mess. I mispronounce things or use the wrong words (in both English and Spanish). I say incomplete sentences or say random gibberish. My accent is also coming out. I am constantly thinking about *not* mispronouncing things and I end up doing it! I don't know what to do. I don't feel comfortable talking to my husband or sister anymore. They always tell me to shake it off it's okay. But I feel like I can't. ",9,2017-08-13 00:36:55 EDT-0400

25,My therapist of 4 years just passed away... I want to celebrate him. He helped me through my worst years.,"This isn't a post about being anxious due to my clinical psychologist dying. It is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. 

My therapist's name was Louis. When I met him, nearly 4 years ago, I was at a bad place in my life. I had been suffering from the effects of Anxiety Disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my GP monthly for over a year, when I asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.

After delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)

I was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.

Louis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)

As I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.

Don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.

Basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. 

Now, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:

To be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. 

Louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.

Now...

Today, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed ""Obituary Louis..."" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. 

The feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. 

I cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.

I decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... ""Louis was a blessing in my life.""

I exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, ""You can't park here..."". I turn with flowers in hand, ""My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect."" 

We argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, ""Fine! I will move my car!"" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.

I ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. 

I drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, ""I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job."" 

The attendant told me, ""I am feeling really bad about this..."" I told him ""I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. 

Louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.

Thank you Louis. 
I love you!

27,Does anyone else get randomly anxious even when they're calm and have no negative thoughts?,"So I'm a little nervous about going to a ball game tomorrow. Travel/out of state/big crowd/spending the night with others. I've been cleaning all day so my mind hasn't been on that or anything else even. I've been pretty relaxed, calm, and just focused on cleaning. I just had to take one of my meds because out of nowhere I had the chest tightness, then my mind started getting nervous. Etc etc. it just randomly hit me. But it started when I was already quite calm and not thinking of anything. I don't know why that keeps seeming to happen. Even when I have nothing to be anxious about. At all. ",25,2017-06-17 06:59:06 EDT-0400
28,Was admitted to a psychiatric ward yesterday,"Yesterday I was at a restaurant with my husband, my sisters-in-law and some friends for a birthday party. It was very hot at the table so I went for some fresh air. A few minutes later, as I sat alone, I was hit smack dab in the gut by feelings of guilt and hopelessness. Lately I've been feeling very unenthusiastic about life in general, not really excited about the prospect of a potential sixty more years in a dull repetitive cycle that only leads to death. A feeling that says it wouldn't be so horrible if I didn't exist. 

Normally I can win over these thoughts. Remind myself how loved I am by my family and friends, that I'm safe and secure and have a lot to be grateful for. But it was like my brain switched into autopilot and I felt myself walking to the closest bridge to jump. Luckily I didn't find it, but I did pass the emergency room on my walk so I took that as a sign. A few tearful hours later, I was voluntarily admitted to the nearest psychiatric ward for monitoring. Got to talk to someone, was given a room and a sleeping pill and then woke up feeling very raw. 

I got breakfast, played some cards with the other patients and got to see a psychiatrist. His evaluation was that I seemed to have all my wits about me, and that I'm not any harm to myself. So I'm getting picked up in about half an hour. 

The ton of supportive messages I've received moves me to tears. I can't believe how close I was. I just need to stay strong and never give in. I do want to live, but it's hard and I feel weak and incapable of handling life on my own. 

Thanks for reading. ",36,2017-06-18 14:38:15 EDT-0400
29,Today I challenged my anxiety by using public transport and visiting somewhere I've never been before on my own.,"I'm really proud of myself and I thought I'd share it with you guys :) so here goes


Even the thought of going somewhere unfamiliar on my own causes me to get panicky, never mind traveling via public transport, until today.

I wanted to visit a cemetery, as I have family members who are buried there. I'd never been to the cemetery before so it would be a first. I started my adventure with catching the train, I had caught this train many times, but this time was my first time catching it alone. That was easy enough and I noticed I was a lot less scared than I thought I would be. I arrived at my first location, from there I had to catch a bus. I hate busses as they give me so much anxiety (I'm always worried I'd get the wrong bus or get off at the wrong bus stop or something) waiting for the bus I managed to strike a conversation with an older man, he confirmed that I was waiting for the correct bus to get to the cemetery.

Soon enough the bus pulled in, I asked the driver if they go to the cemetery, he confirmed so I payed the driver and sat down nervously. I then got off at my stop and walked the rest to the cemetery.

I walked up a path and turned a corner and there it was. It felt amazing to see it and know that I've travelled all on my own, albeit it not being far, and that I had challenged my anxiety and I had conquered it :)

30,Anyone else feels like your brain just doesn't work when there is more than one person around?,"I feel absolutely fine in 2 person conversation, but when there more than 2 people around I always switch to my weird mode, all my ideas dissapear and all I can do is smile and say things like ""yeah, sure, good, I see,..""

I'm 20 and I have always been like this, I just can't function in classes, pubs, or any places with more people around me

31,Anyone else chew the inside of your mouth?,"Whenever I'm anxious (all the time) I often bite and chew the insides of my cheeks and lips. The inside of my mouth feels like raw hamburger, I need to stop but its so damn hard. 
Its a subconscious thing, often times I don't realize I'm even doing it. My dentist said its one of the worst he's seen and if I don't stop it could lead to gum disease, and rarely mouth cancer. Pretty sure parts of my mouth is just scar tissue at this point and will never be normal again. 

Anyone else bite their lips, chew their cheeks, teeth grinding, nail biting or something simular? What do you do to stop or help reduce this behavior? 

Im beginning to think its less of an anxiety thing and more in the realm of OCD. Its a subconscious compulsory behavior I have whenever I'm anxious, so I'm not so sure.",66,2017-06-21 07:12:24 EDT-0400

I was with my normal group last night and I realized how mean they are to me and they kept making suicide jokes. They knew I was suicidal less than a month ago as well. It feels horrible saying I don't like them and I feel nervous around them. I don't know what to do anymore I don't want to be around them, but then they just show up at my house.

34,"""You're Too Sensitive""","DAE think this is an asshole-ish thing to tell or hear from somebody, whether from your parents or otherwise? My mom does it all too frequently when I get even remotely upset about something she might say or what's going on but yet, she has a volatile temper and gets upset easily at certain moments herself. Some obvious projection here and I really don't know how to deal with it anymore. I have mild-to-severe anxiety along with multiple other ""disorders"" that could be diagnosed or not and I've been sick of my current living circumstances for a long time.

Contrary to my cognitive thinking, I got a call yesterday asking me to interview this morning. After throwing up a few times and hyperventilating before the interview, I did my interview. I actually did it, I didn't completely shut down or have a panic attack during the interview. Let me repeat that, I DID IT! If I can do it, then so can you! I know it's hard, it is very uncomfortable, and easier to say than to do, but this feeling right now is amazing and I want all of you to experience this feeling.

40,This one if for you warriors here,"Hey. I want to tell you how strong you are. You've found yourself on a rather bumpy road, with a car you no longer no as well as before. It's not doing you a favor right now. But it's rolling. Sometimes stopping for days, to rest and figure things out. Sometimes hitting a bump and almost falling over. But actually, nothing can topple this car. And even though the bumps and potholes are annoying, scary, hopeless and seemingly endless - it's not. In the end, all is well and all is well. And if all is not well, then it's not the end. 

You and your car will find your way. Over, across, below, straight through like a meteor, you will overcome. And suddenly you'll find yourself on a more tranquil road. Is it the same road as before or did you build a new one with your determination. Maybe it's not important. 

Stop trusting the thought saying ""It feels like I'm going backwards, falling down, it feels like the ground is crumbling beneath my feet."" It is far from the truth. Look below you, is the ground shaking? 

Warrior, you are moving forward. Without knowing, you are learning. Learning what? Something. Learning new ways to live. Ways not to live. Learning to be brave, to reach out, to be kinder to yourself. 

Find something you like, and stick to it. It might mean sacrificing old habits, and it definitely means sacrificing comfort. For me that thing is yoga. I hope and anticipate that I can bring the power and tranquility off the mat in the future.

I like talking about random shit with friends.

I like watching Rick and Morty.

I like sex. Passionate, breathing out loud, sex.

I like cooking, drawing, and teaching.

I don't like myself. I don't like the future. I don't like being in a place far away from home with no one to talk to. All alone. But I'm getting there, with practice, trial and error.

Thank you. Keep bumping.",10,2017-06-15 23:36:09 EDT-0400
41,Anyone else Think Everyone is too angry?,"I mean, not to ramble on too much, it just seems as though everyone everywhere is so quick tempered, short with people, and angry all the time. The most minor of inconveniences sets people off into fits of red rage. I just think this anger is what contributes to at least my anxiety as well as a few others. I am positively terrified of being yelled at, threatened, and just having anger towards me in any foreseeable way, and so, with that, I tend to shut myself out due to this fear. 

I am 18, I am growing up in a time where we are very unhappy, very anti-social, and quickly angered. It's clear that this isn't only unhealthy for those with anxiety, but society as a whole and no one can, or simply refuses to, pinpoint why. I've heard stories from my parents, I've read books about times before I was alive and I know there was a time when we weren't like this.

I just wanted to post this here to give my thoughts, why it bothers me and how it affects my anxiety, and see if any of you share my thoughts and opinions.

44,I took a huge step forward this weekend with my social anxiety...it was incredible,"I went out clubbing with friends and this time, I decided to just say to hell with it...I spent all night talking to whoever I wanted to talk to, dancing with whoever I wanted to dance with, and it was amazing. Normally I would be so shy when it comes to approaching people I don't know, but...nobody shot me down for approaching them and whatever fear I might've had about it basically went away all in one night.

45,Tried to go two salons today and i failed. I felt so anxious and ignored by them that i just left the place in tears.Has anyone been in similar situation?,"I went to two salons to try and get a haircut.  I failed. The first one i went into, the hairdressers did not even notice me, i think one looked at me but they were too busy talking with each other while doing another person's hair. Then the two customers looked at me weird.  I sat down for like 5 minutes, then i got up and left. i felt too nervous.  

Then i tried to go to another salon to see if i would get better people. Someone did say hi to me. Then that was it. Another worker came looking at me weird asking if i had an appointment. i said no i was a walk in.  She told me that after the stylist is done she would do my hair.      

I was feeling on edge and nearly crying. The stylists were looking at me in bad way and the other ones were too busy chatting with each other to pay attention to me. I felt so ignored. So i left that place because i was breaking down in tears. i felt so ugly and how they looked at me, i felt it conformed it. I am just going back to my regular stylist that knows me,  rather than try a new one.

 I can't believe i am crying over this maybe it just my hormones going crazy, i really hope  i don't sound crazy to you people.  i just have bad anxiety (agoraphobia) and very low self esteem.",6,2017-06-17 23:17:37 EDT-0400

47,How to deal with a parent that gets angry about anxiety?,"My father is a pretty angry dude. Short tempered, and when he does get angry, he is ENGRAGED. I'm talking screaming, insults, etc. Yesterday was a really bad day for my anxiety. We were set to go somewhere in about an hour and I started crying as a result of a panic attack. I truly was terrified in the moment. He came in, told me to ""shut the f* up, grow up, and get over it"" and told me that ""it's always the same shit and it's ridiculous"". I'm 18 so this obviously stings coming from my dad. Aside from having pretty severe anxiety, I otherwise do what I'm told, don't break any rules, don't drink/smoke, etc. When we arrived at said event (something I was dreading) I tried doing something I had to do but was afraid of once, succeeded, and then was told I had to do it again because it didn't develop correctly. Full blown panic, and I couldn't do it. My dad came storming into the room (with 5 people/doctors/assistants) and told me that if I didn't do it he was done with me. He snatched my phone out of my hand (with which I was using music to calm myself) in front of everybody. I was embarrassed enough already.

I couldn't do it so we left and in the elevator he told me not to talk to him anymore, and that he was stripping me of all of my privileges and was no longer going to take me to my college orientation weekend next week. Instead of fighting him back I just listened, and in the car on the way home I gave him a sincere apology twice to which the first he said ""Shut up and stop talking"" and to the second no response. I just went to my room and didn't talk to him for the rest of the day.


He snapped at me again this morning, telling me once again to shut up and it's always the same shit.


His reaction to my anxiety makes me even more anxious as I then worry about getting noticeably anxious and getting him angry. When I tell my mom she just sides with him and tells me ""Everyone's entitled to react how they want and I'm responsible for whether or not I let it affect me"". My mom and dad both came from abusive fathers and my mom always reminds me ""well we used to get beat so at least he's not beating you"". As if that justifies anything. Oh. 

I normally have a very good relationship with my dad when he's not angry with me, he does a lot for me but I just can't take this temper anymore. It makes me feel like absolute shit and like I'm a fuck up or that something's wrong with me and my parents don't want me around.

56,How do I come to terms with working for the rest of my life?,"Here's my story. I apologize that it's long but thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it and offer me advice.


When I was younger, I suffered from crippling social anxiety to the point that I couldn't even interact with cashiers in stores. In high school I ended up in a very toxic relationship where I became desperate to better myself in order to save it. In the process, I put myself into countless situations where I was out of my comfort zone and after around 7 years, I managed to mostly overcome my social anxiety. I'm at the point now where I have realized that I am just an introvert and being around people for too long makes me feel exhausted and depressed but I like myself now so I don't feel anxiety anymore over what they might think of me. It's more just like I run out of steam and want to go home and sleep.


What I really enjoy doing is learning. I have lots of hobbies and things that I want to learn to do. I like sports, crafting, reading, etc. When I have spare time, I never get bored but I never feel like I have enough time to do the things I want to do. I have lots of projects and goals in mind which I have been slowly working away at anytime I'm off work but this is part of what is causing my anxiety.


I graduated university last year with an engineering degree and was fortunate enough to find a job only 3 months after graduation. Most people would have been thrilled but for me this is when the anxiety started up again. All through university, I felt okay and only had minor worries when I thought about my growing student debt but figured it would all be okay once I graduated and got a job. In reality, in the days leading up to the start of my job, I felt like I was slowly being strangled and it got harder and harder to sleep at night.


Once I actually started working, it seemed okay at first. Things were new and exciting and I had a nice office in a tall building downtown, but it didn't take long for the anxiety to come back. My job itself is okay. The pay is good for someone just out of school but still doesn't go far in the city I'm in. One thing that stresses me out a lot is that I have received very little training so far; I just get thrown into things and expected to figure them out. It's okay but I don't feel like I'm becoming a very good engineer this way. I feel like I'm just fumbling around in the dark and barely finding my way.


Somehow I just can't come to terms with the idea of working for the rest of my life. Right now I'm in a position where my contract needs to be renewed each year and a big part of me is hoping it doesn't get renewed. But on the other hand, I have about $30k in student debt to pay off so I have to keep working. Almost my entire paycheque goes to paying this off but it will still take about 2 years of working. This makes me feel so hopeless and depressed. It is already such a struggle to come in to work each day and it feels like I'm fighting such a battle just to get back to neutral. I really don't want to leave the city I'm in but the housing market is so messed up that buying a place anytime in the next 5 years will likely be impossible for me.


I was recently sick for a week and I was in so much pain, all I could do was lay in bed and stare at the ceiling but I felt so much relief knowing that I didn't have to go in to work. I felt so happy but as soon as my condition started improving, the anxiety came back full force.


I work slightly longer days in order to have a 3-day weekend every other week. Even on these longer weekends, I spend most of the time just wanting to do activities that won't make time feel like it's passing too quickly. I try to have a fighting spirit and just do the things I want to do anyway but then I end up feeling really depressed after once I realize how much time has gone by and now it's closer to work.


I'm trying to plan a trip for the summer to give myself some motivation to go to work but no matter how I were to plan it, 1 week off, 2 weeks off, 1 month off (I get 3 weeks vacation per year but I saved 2 weeks from last year so they could roll over), coming back to work afterwards is inevitable. There is that hopeless feeling of impending doom. Time flies when you're having fun and then the thing you've been planning for months is over.


I also have this horrible feeling that, time is wasting and I'm not spending enough of it with my parents and siblings. I keep getting irrational thoughts and feel really freaked out that I'm not gonna get to spend enough time with them. Just writing this is making me feel so panicked.


I've never wanted to be rich, my goal has always been to make enough that my family can live comfortably. I've been trying to think of jobs I can work towards where I can work 3 days a week or work from home some days. I have always wanted to have kids one day and to be at home to raise them until they're old enough to go to school. I feel like I chose the wrong degree and, although I would be happy to go back to school and pursue another path, it's just not financially feasible at this point and who's to say I wouldn't just end up back here.


I constantly tell myself that I'm acting so spoiled. I am fortunate that I am in a position to even pay my loans off. People I went to school with, smarter than me with higher GPAs, are still struggling to find jobs. I am lucky to be educated and living in a good city. I have a nice office. I have friends and family who love me. I have things in life that I enjoy and bring me happiness. For months now, during my commute to work, I repeat these things in my head over and over again and remind myself how spoiled I'm acting and how I should be happy/thankful. But still, it doesn't seem to help and every morning, it is such a struggle just to get out of bed. The thing that gives me the extra push each day is that I come from a poor family and my parents have worked so hard to support me that I have to succeed. I feel so miserable and hopeless though that I don't know what to do. I'm not sure how to change my mindset. This thought process isn't working so what should I be telling myself. Should I seek help from a therapist? I feel like my life is rushing past me and it terrifies me.

Even just writing that out was a bit therapeutic. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance if you have any advice.",54,2017-01-10 20:51:14 EST-0500

58,I'm probably gonna lose my job.,"I started a new job before Christmas and I've already had four sick days because of my depression and anxiety. But then when I call in sick, I feel even worse mentally because I get anxious and panic that I'm gonna lose my job and I feel anxious to go in the next day because I know people will be annoyed with me because I was needed. My manager was very angry on the phone today when I called in... all I ever do is let people down and I'm just ruining my life because I can never handle a job. Everytime I get one I lose it or quit because I can't cope. I'm just fed up of trying. I'm fed up of being a failure. I'm fed up of waking up in the morning and feeling like I can't get out of bed and face the world. I'm just so fed up. ",46,2017-01-09 21:30:00 EST-0500
59,"last night, I think I accidentally took a 2nd sSRI pill for the day, and it was a really disturbing experience","I really needed to get this off my chest, but I want to preface this that Lexapro really helped change my life around (along with therapy), so I don't want to discourage others from avoiding SSRIs, but not keeping good track of my pills must've led me to having a second pill last night.  I think taking the pill on an empty stomach and without much water contributed to it as well.

It was really disturbing.  I take 20mg pills.  Besides having a bizarre dream, I woke up in my bed, and it felt like my face was being dissolved away by acid and numb.  I had to keep feeling it to assure myself that my face was still there.  At times, I couldn't help but chuckle out loud to myself or smile really wide.  My thoughts were looping and repeating very strongly.  

This morning I woke up, and felt more or less back to normal, but I'm finding myself more irritable and emotional than usual.  It was so bizarre.

This is mostly a reminder to myself to use the pill box I purchased awhile ago rather than just taking pills straight from the bottle.  I just felt like I needed to get this out there somewhere, somehow.  

UPDATE 02/02/17:  If you're like me, you obsessively search forums like this one, so I thought I'd post what happened since then.  It took me awhile to find a psychiatrist that was accepting patients, but I finally saw one yesterday.  In regards to the strange symptoms I had as a result of taking the 2nd pill by accident, she said that ""since 20mg is already the max dose of Lexapro, taking 40mg could produce psychotic symptoms.""  In other words, my symptoms were normal.  She decided to switch me to Effexor 37.5mg since I still have panic attacks every 6 months or so and general high worry while on the max dosage of Lexparo.  She also said that Lexapro's beneficial effects could disappear after a couple years as your body builds resistance to it, but that if I was off Lexapro for say 10 years, the Lexapro could be beneficial again.  I'll be picking up the Effexor prescription today.",64,2017-01-08 18:41:10 EST-0500
60,"Recently started a new job: some days I feel very confident I will succeed here, but other days I think I'm going to fail miserably.","I started at a new company in a sales position in an industry I'm completely new to. It's base salary plus commission. The salary is not super high, but it can get me by until I start making commission (that's what I'm really after). 

On the days I feel confident, I look at all the seasoned employees and think to myself ""I'm 1000x smarter than these guys, I just need the industry knowledge, and I can be where they're at no problem"" Now these guys are all making over $100k per year, some over 500k. These type of days are very motivating. 

The other days, I'm afraid I'll fail for one reason or another. Whether it's that I get really unlucky and am unable to grow my customer base quick enough (unfortunately sales job are 80% skill, 20% luck imo). Or that I end up being disliked by my coworkers so much that I get let go. I already don't fit in well with the general personality type of everyone at work. I'm more of an intellectual, and I use logic, extensive knowledge,  and a convincing voice to sell products. It works very well but it clashes with others because they suggest I'm over thinking things. Which is probably true, but nonetheless, my method has proven successful time and time again. Also, I like to ask a lot of questions when I'm learning something new, and I'm noticing that people are getting a little annoyed with that. I think it's mainly because everyone is always stressed out from what I can see. This is because sales is quite stressful. 

Either way, I'm to the point where I almost want to say something to my boss. I want to tell him my concerns in such a way where he sees that I want to combat my non-confident side and strengthen my confident side. Anyone have advice on this? It's causing me so much anxiety that I literally have nightmares about it that cause me to wake up in the middle of the night. I need help with this. 

TL;DR Started a new job, having anxiety about failing, having even more anxiety about my coworkers not liking me, almost wanna tell my boss, please help. 

EDIT: First of all, this is my first time getting a decent amount of upvotes (I know 80 isn't a lot, but it's my record so far). But more importantly, thank you all so much for your advice. I'm starting to realize that it's pretty normal to feel the way I do about my new job. I think it's just a matter of getting assimilated and comfortable. Also I'm sorry for not responding to everyone's comments. I've been very anxious about other things and have been neglecting lots of things.  I am feeling a lot better just by reading what you guys have to say, and please if anyone has input, please keep it coming. I will make an effort to respond to everyone.

69,"I made a playlist to cope with my anxiety, and wanted to share it with you guys too (link in post)","As a little backstory:

I'm a female in my higher 20's, and a little more than a year ago I was diagnosed with stress-related panic disorder, after having suffered several panic and anxiety attacks for about a year prior to this (at its worst, I had several a day). That was also when I started my CBT. What was the hardest, though, was that around the same time, my sister-in-law, whom I'm very close with, tried to commit suicide from depression. She was the one that taught me to listen to the actual lyrics of the songs, rather than just ""plain listening"", and ever since I've loved music even more.

To deal with this, and my anxiety and stress, I began to make a playlist, partly for my own sake and partly for hers, with songs that would tell me (us) that it's okay, just breathe, things will get better even if it sucks now, just be who you are, nothing is wrong with you (I've tried to find lists like this before, but not found what I was looking for, as most other lists I've found are more.. cheerful). I shared it with her, and she's contributed to some of the songs, and likes it a lot. I've also shared it with a few close friends, including my best friend who is going through an incredibly tough time as well, and both she and I listen to this list daily now, to unwind and calm down when we're in stressful situations and/or having anxiety/panic attacks. This list has been building the past year, and I find it helping me more and more, and the past weeks I've wanted to share it with you here (due to my anxiety it's taken me this long, though). Some are songs I've found people mentioning here, and some are songs I've found by myself, or on google.

If a song in this list can help anyone here even a fragment of how much it's been helping me cope through the past year, that's more than I could ever ask for.

So I've been dealing with IBS for the better part of 5 years and spent quite a lot of that completely by myself (other than the people in my house and my dog). I had only recently tried to be more social as that was what I'd constantly heard from my therapist and my family. The more I try to become social, the more I feel like I should just be alone. I'm always a little much, giving too much attention to people and pushing them away or just feeling the urge to leave, myself.

92,"Notice that in this moment, you are basically alright","You know how there is often this sense of fear at the back of your mind? That no matter how well things are going, there is a small voice that says: ""Watch out, bad things are happening! Never let your guard down!""

That voice is what kept our ancestors alive. Our brains have a preprogrammed tendency to pay attention to the negative, to danger and trouble, and that is in part what fuels our anxiety.

The good news is that underneath our experience there is also an underlying sense of OK-ness, alrightness. While you may be stressed out or upset, there is a foundation of awareness that runs deeper than any temporary fear, like a quiet sea bed hundred feet below a howling storm.

In fact, take a close look at this moment, right now. You are probably alright: No one is attacking you, you are not falling or drowning, there is no immediate crisis. Your experience might be far from perfect, and it might include unpleasant thoughts or emotions, but right this moment at least, you are basically okay.

There are of course times when you are not okay. Sometimes you are in real danger, your body is hurting, someone is mistreating you or your mind is in full panic mode.  But I bet that during any given day, you can find a half a dozen or a dozen moments where you can honestly say, ""Yeah, right now I'm okay"". 

Notice and savor those experiences! You are not trying to convince yourself of anything or trying to cover of your suffering under a thin varnish of ""positive thinking"". You are simply becoming aware of the fact that you are not under threat, in danger or harmed. Experiencing this over time, again and again, will gradually change your brain an help you become calmer and stronger.

93,Had a severe panic attack since years 2 days ago.. Because of a mean PE teacher.,"I've had generalized anxiety disorder since I was 8 years old and still struggle with it now, at 17. I've always been bad at sports and PE has been a source of anxiety to me for years. For the last 3 years or so I've always had very kind and understanding teachers, so it's not been as much of a problem for me anymore. But this year I have the worst PE teacher there currently is at my school.

I actually don't have to participate in PE anymore since last year because of health and anxiety issues, and my previous teacher was fine with this. My new teacher however, demanded a confirmation from my school counselor, and I was planning on getting that next week because I have an appointment with her then anyways.

At the beginning of class last friday, I asked my teacher if I had to help with anything or if I could leave and make homework. She turned towards me and told me I had to participate because she hadn't received a confirmation from my counselor yet. I explained the above to her, that I'd hand it in next week, but she said I still had to participate.

This gave me a massive surge of anxiety, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I walked with my class to the running track but felt a panic attack coming up and I asked my teacher ""Could I please go to my counselor, I have anxiety disorder and feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, and I have clear instructions that I have to go to her if I'm feeling like this."" She turned to me (I was already in tears and hyperventilating), and told me I was irritating her and she's very disappointed in me for not participating. This, of course, made my panic attack even worse. My friend saw what was happening and tried to help me, but my teacher barked at her that she had to go back to the rest of the class.

She let me leave after telling me again how disappointed she was in me, and the lady at the front office and my counselor were baffled when I told them what happened.

I'm just so angry about how heartlessly she handled the situation. Normally when I ask a teacher I want to go see my counselor, it's expected of them that they'll let me go without me even having to explain myself. I'm in the school's special care program and everything. And even if that wasn't the case, why the f*ck would any adult in their right mind not let a panicking student go get help for themselves.

*TL;DR - Asshole PE teacher didn't allow me to go to my school's counselor when I got a panic attack in class, and told me she was irritated by me, making the situation even worse.*",15,2017-10-01 17:34:56 EDT-0400
94,I found a trick that works WONDERS for my anxiety,"Have you ever heard of occum's razor? Here's the Wikipedia page on it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor

But basically it's just logic that states that the simplest explanation should always be assumed to be true first, and things should only be comemore complicated than the simplest explanation if the evidence presents itself.

I realized this when I was thinking about why I spend money one of my friends. I thought... Oh god, it must be because I don't feel like I deserve love and so I spend money to make up for it and as an apology for who I am oh no!! But then I remembered occum's razor and I thought what could the simplest explanation be?

Turns out I'm just bad with money, and this girl happens to be a great excuse to spend some. Treats for her and treats for me, guilt free! Haha, I felt so much better after realizing that this is the more likely reason. 

So sometimes, when you're starting to internally panic, see what the simpler explanation could be. I'm learning that the more likely explanations are also usually the ones that don't warrent panic or high levels of anxiety.",5,2017-10-02 03:23:50 EDT-0400
95,No one tells you how scary success is.,"I've been unemployed for several months and really struggled with it. I went on countless interviews and faced so much rejection.

At it's root, it's just therapeutic; it's like talking to someone but not having to worry about the feedback.  I'm going to try to do it everyday, or as needed, and I would love to hear what you all do to cope and feel secure about your worries.",11,2017-10-01 12:41:41 EDT-0400

However, in my groups of friends and acquaintances, I'm one of the most talkative, outgoing, and funny people (my opinion) in the group and it makes me feel genuinely happy.

What does this mean? I understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can I learn from this? 

Edit: thanks for the responses. A lot of people are saying things like ""well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety"", or ""you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself"" but that's not what I'm getting at. I don't just become a ""normal"" member of the conversation when I'm comfortable - rather I tend to dominate it. I enjoy it a *lot*.

Even using that term, ""mental illness,"" feels so wrong.
Mental illnesses are for people who ACTUALLY have problems and ACTUALLY can't function properly. My ADHD and anxiety (and by extension depression) are just me coming up with excuses for not concentrating, freaking out unnecessarily, and being sad a lot. I don't deserve to use that term. 

That's how the illnesses win. 

They tell you there isn't really a problem, that you're making this stuff up. They tell you that if you try to get help, to confront it, other people will tell you the same thing. 
> 
""You just want the attention."" ""You just want the drug prescription."" ""You just want an excuse for your failure.""

No. No. That's not it, I swear. Trust me, please. 

But the people, they don't believe you. They shame you into believing it's a figment of your imagination. They get mad at you for disrespecting the people who *actually* have the disease. And when you try to prove it, by showing them your mess, they scoff. Get over it, they say. Everybody has problems.

At least, that's what you're told will happen. Otherwise, you'd be able to control the illnesses, keep them at bay. Nothing to hold you back. The illnesses don't want that. They need you to be gullible, so you'll let them stay and grow stronger. 
> 
""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""

Your mental illnesses know you better than anyone. They know what makes you tick. They know just how to mess with your mind. Don't Let Them.

I went to get groceries after already having quite a bit of anxiety today. It was incredibly busy, and I couldn't find tofu for the life of me so I had to do a couple of rounds around the whole store, and I think people noticed. Once I got to the checkout I looked under my cart and realized something had broken, there was a huge puddle of grape seed oil where my cart was. I apologized profusely to the cashier and the person cleaning it up (I still have no idea how it happened). They had to close the checkout and people were staring. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Thankfully the cashier was so nice, and I think she could tell how bad I felt. I feel like crying, and am so dizzy I dk how to drive home.

132,Do others here suffer from never finishing things?,"I ask as I wondered years ago if I was a form of Bipolar, with a side of Anxiety for bad luck, as I would have a mass of ideas, spend money on it and then... never get anywhere.

Now I'm relatively stable (150mg Sertraline p/day - not Bipolar, we think!) I'm getting all these ideas (again) and I never finish them, or intend to, but just don't.

I don't know if it's the anxiety of not being good enough (could talk about that for a while; my upbringing was a slight problem there) or that things snowball, in that if I don't finish my first project, I feel guilt about it and then I get anxious and can't work on it, which gives me more guilt and more anxiety... you get the idea.

Shout out to the family members who help you feel safe and cozy at home or from afar.

137,When you get anxiety about anxiety which causes more anxiety.,"I suffer from GAD and OCD, I've been off my meds for over a year now. I was bounced around from medication to medication from the time I was 18 until now (I'm currently 23). I started on Zoloft and found that it worked well but the excessive weight gain and lack of libido weren't helping an 18 year old function normally. I was also prescribed .25mg of Xanax for panic attacks. I switched doctors due to mine not practicing anymore and this new doctor refused to prescribe Zoloft and made me go see a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist prescribed me Luvox. It worked for the most part but I still had 0 libido. This actually helped lead to the ending of a 5 year relationship. We hadn't had sex in over 2 years and neither of us were happy. I stopped taking my medications after the break up because I was determined to make life work without medication. I took up going to therapy. Hated it. It didn't help with crap. All I did was sit there and talk about my week. I'm currently dating someone new and going back to school full time for the first time since 2011. I'm really starting to struggle with my anxiety again. I'm having more and more panic attacks, I'm getting nauseous every time I eat and sometimes even thinking about eating makes me nauseous, and I'm finding that some of my compulsions are coming back. Long story short I don't want to have to go back on medications that cause me to have 0 libido. I'm dating a man in the military and only get to see him once every other month if I'm lucky and I'm not having problems performing now. I don't want to have problems later on either. Help! I'm already 60 pounds heavier than I was when I wasn't on meds and I'm finally getting aroused again!

I have hours of audio downloaded at any given time, to ensure I never have to endure a quiet moment over the course of the day. I check every morning before leaving.

As far as I can remember I was always afraid of playing video games especially action games/shooter games and worst of all multiplayer games.



I am one of the guys who was excited to buy games but never in playing them. I liked watching my friends and siblings play the games. But I could never make myself play games.



Now after experiencing mental health issues for 8 years (and becoming aware of difficulties prior to that) I feel like my fear of playing video games (multiplayer ones) is kind of related to my severe social and overall anxieties.



Does anyone else has same experience?



I am sure here are many gamers on the sub. What were your experiences like?

159,"One month from today, I'm meeting the guy i've talked to online every day for 8 years.","And I'm **freaking out.** The thought of the whole thing makes me feel like I'm going to vomit. 

I met this guy in a chatroom when I was 15 years old. He was some 18 year old guy from India I never expected to connect so deeply with. Fast forward 8 years and he's got an awesome job here in the States and we finally have the opportunity to meet up in Denver, CO (someplace both of us have been dying to visit) and vacation for a week. 

My anxiety has *always* gotten in the way of any relationship I've had of any kind, and this one has been no exception. What seems like the smallest things have given me the most anxiety throughout our 8 years of talking, from telling him my name, sending him a picture, talking on the phone, and skyping. The crazy thing is we had plans for me to fly out to where he lives in San Francisco back in March... and I cancelled a few weeks beforehand. I still feel absolutely horrible for doing that to him, but inspite of all of it, he still finds a way to be incredibly patient with me.  

Now here we are, a month out from the first vacation I've had in years, my first time visiting a city I've been dying to see, and meeting one of my closest friends in person for the first time and for some reason, all I want to do is cry. Every detail has me questioning if this is going to be a disaster. **What if I miss my flight? What if the airport loses my luggage? What do I do when I see him for the first time? Should I hug him? What if he doesnt think I look as good as my pictures? What if we have nothing to talk about? We have one whole week together, what the hell are we gonna do in all that time? What if we have a horrible time and we never speak to each other again afterwards? What if we *really* end up liking each other? Does that mean we're going to start a relationship?**

I'm so tired of letting my anxiety run the way I live. I just wish I could embrace and enjoy the excitement of all of this, but my mind always finds a way to distort it into something that's going to end terribly...",24,2017-09-15 01:10:27 EDT-0400

There is no evidence that September 23rd will be the Apocalypse, and there is honestly no reason to let that fear ruin your life.

Being on call all the time meant getting off my meds because I couldn't wake up enough to safely drive in the middle of the night. Around May I lost my job due to budget cuts and I was the most recently hired. I've been unemployed since then. My anxiety has been debilitating. I want to branch out and do something new, but I'm terrified of everything. I just don't want to work in a hospital again for a while, I was really unhappy. I already feel like a loser because I don't have a job and I'm really stressed about finances. I went to a job interview yesterday I was SO excited about and it ended up being a MLM scam pretty much. 

I need a job, I need help in general. Do any of you have advice? I haven't gotten out of bed since the interview yesterday. I haven't eaten in 2 days. I can't stop self-loathing and it's interfering with my relationship. I feel so worthless. ",37,2017-09-20 02:28:44 EDT-0400
166,The media is profiting off people like us,"Ok I had to make this post.

The media, nowadays, lives off fear and clickbait. The scarier the headline, the more clicks that will come about. The more clicks, more money! When you read a headline, breathe in, and out.

And we are the targets. The ones who legitimately have health issues surrounding world events. 

I was spurred on to make this post due to a headline I read a few minutes ago relating to North Korea (eugh). So for those of you who don't want to hear about it, stop reading now.

The headline wrote 'Trump vows to destroy North Korea'. My heart skipped several beats, I was debilitated, scared and on the floor. Then I looked further into it, I watched Trumps speech to the UN and discovered the level of lying that this website had displayed. His quote was saying how if North Korea attacked the USA or it's allies, he would destroy it. 

They are totally different things!! One implies Trump is about to launch a full on attack onto the country, one simply reinforces what America's been saying for years, if NK attacks SK, America will defend SK.

No one at work would even understand if I went home because I just got back, and it amps my anxiety even more knowing what they would think if I left and went to the doctor. They might think I'm just skipping work for fun.

I'm so tired of this. I can't quit valium because I'm constantly needing the SOS. I left sertraline because I was sure I didn't need it but this thing just keeps coming back. And the worst part is that I can't afford professional CBT therapy which my insurance doesn't cover it.

Two weeks ago I applied for my dream job, with a great salary, as it was one of the few to actually put the salary in the posting.  I immediately was called in for an interview the next day - all great signs.

The interview went ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  Every single list you find on google for good interview signs I could check off.  Double the allotted time.  Interviewer was smiling and laughing.  Hit every question out of the park, definitely qualified, talked about non-job related stuff/personal stuff.  Told me they'd get back to me by mid-next week, etc. etc.

Took them almost two weeks to get back to me, and it was just an informal ""Thank you for your time, we have moved on to other candidates""

174,Time Anxiety,"I don't know if anyone else feels like this but I've been struggling with this since I was like 12/13 years old (I'm 20 now).

I basically always feel like time is slipping away from me. For example, if I have a free day, from the moment I get up I already feel like the day is already over. I know it doesn't make any sense but I feel like time goes by too quickly, the next day comes too quickly and I'll have to face people again.

Other example, and this started when I was around 13. Before going to sleep I always had this restless feeling, like tomorrow is going to be here too quickly. I wanted to draw out my days so I went to bed pretty late (for a 13 year old..) and I would put alarms in the middle of the night just to get a little more time for myself before going to school again. I still do that more often than not. 

I don't know how to explain exactly but it's awful. Like right now it's 9PM and I have to get up early tomorrow and I now I'll have to get to bed at a reasonable time. And that's what makes me anxious. I just want to have more hours of today before having to go to sleep. Even if I still have 3 hours left, my mind just wants more. Do I make sense ??

I used to be so scared to take a shower and I had to take a shot or something with alcohol to do simple things like take a shower. I made it a goal of mine to do it without any substance. 

I did it! It was kinda scary but it's these baby steps that help the most. For the past month I've been struggling with derealization and it's been so scary. The best way to get over it is to just face the fact that it won't change. Face your fear. Experience the feeling and don't run from it. 

I'm still scared some days but it's getting better the more I allow myself to feel these feelings. 

Good luck to you all. We can fight this. We can be Normal again. 

Edit: WOW!!! THANKS SO MUCH EVERYONE! I am in tears because of the feedback and support. ",53,2017-03-13 07:55:15 EDT-0400
178,My new anti-anxiety trick: Shower Orange,"So, you might have heard about the new ""Shower Orange"" fad. Basically, it's just eating an orange in the shower. You can look up r/ShowerOrange but it's mostly just people talking about it or taking photos. 

Aaaaanyway, I tried it a couple of days ago, and now it's part of my ""anti-anxiety arsenal"". Hear me out: 

* For me, the most obvious benefit is that it's like a fast, effective meditation, and a great way to anchor myself after or during an anxiety attack. Your senses are all focused while you eat the orange: smell and taste, obviously, but also the contrast between hot water and cold orange, the texture of the peel, the bright colour against the white shower walls, etc. You're 100% in the moment, focused on your task. 

* You can be as aggressive as you want, or as slow and gentle as you want. Ripping an orange apart is surprisingly satisfying. Offloading your frustrations on the orange is a non-violent way to let it go. 

* You don't have to worry about *anything*. The juice will be washed away by the water, and you can just let the peels fall in the shower and pick them up afterwards. 

* Oranges are healthy! That sounds obvious, but getting some fiber, water and vitamins in your body is helpful when you're in a bad place. Showers are healthy too. Again, that sounds obvious, but have you ever been so paralyzed by anxiety that you haven't had a shower in days? The whole thing is very refreshing, and a good way to boost your energy. 

So, yeah! I was skeptical before trying it, and just thought it would be cool. But it turned out to be really helpful for me. Give it a try! =) ",92,2017-03-09 17:27:49 EST-0500

182,How to explain to normal people that knowing my feelings are irrational doesn't stop me from having those feelings?,"This has honestly been one of the most difficult things for me to explain to ""normal"" people. I'm aware that the thoughts and feelings that are spawned by my anxiety and myriad of mental problems are irrational, silly, make me feel worse over nothing, etc. Consciously, rationally, I KNOW that I don't have anything to fear about making a simple phone call, or going to the store, or checking my e-mail. I also tend to compare myself a lot to other people, and I get very down and envious about the fact that I'm not ""as good"", with my well-meaning friends always telling me ""you don't need to be as good, it's not a race, go at your own pace, your work is still appreciated, etc etc"". *I know* logically this is all true. But knowing this doesn't magically make those thoughts go away. No matter how hard I try to articulate this, they just cannot seem to understand and it's endlessly frustrating.

Any advice? Mainly with trying to explain this concept to people, but I guess also with dealing with this knowing/feeling disconnect in the first place.",26,2017-03-11 03:29:00 EST-0500
183,"Today, I am kicking anxieties ass","6 years ago I had my first panic attack, which quickly spiralled into a panic disorder with minor agoraphobia. It was difficult to do simple things like drive, do the groceries, eat out at a restaurant etc. 

All of those issues led to me being very detached from friends, family, relationships because I always felt like I was burden to be around.

I've been going to therapy for 5 years and I've had periods where my panic disorder was really under control and periods when it would flair up. At the beginning of last year it was the worst I've ever experienced, triggered by an issue in my marriage. 

I decided to take up surfing in June last year, because I figured learning something new and challenging myself could help me overcome part of my disorder.

Fast forward to today, I just got off a 13 hour flight from Sydney to LA, with an 18 hour stop over and then off to Costa Rica for 2 weeks to surf. On my own. 

For the first time in along time I feel in control and I feel proud of who I am as person.

I couldn't be happier that I got on that plane. My anxiety levels were high, I was stressed, nervous, emotional, but I fucking did it. I hope that today is the day I start taking back full control of my life and fuck-off-anxiety.


EDIT: finally touched down in Costa Rica! Haven't felt this excited in years!!! Now, to try and get barreled!!

185,Too afraid to see a therapist out of fear that i might be making it up,"I've always had a lot of anxiety issues, most prominent during my childhood and until my early teens (I'm 18 now).  I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, so that makes this a bit harder.  I'm concerned this is pretty silly and light-weight compared to what a lot of people on this sub go through, but I thought I should try posting anyway.  So if it is silly...please be nice ;^;

Basically, there's a bunch of complex problems that are probably rooted in anxiety that I think would be worth seeing a professional about.  A really good friend of mine, who has personal experience with this sort of thing, has urged me to look into it.  I've been making slow steps towards the on-campus counseling my school offers, but the thing holding me back the most is the fear that my problem is going to turn out to be made up somehow or else unforgivably stupid.  I'm afraid I'll go in, give the run-down of the problems, and then find out I've gone and made a terrific fool of myself and that it's all stuff I've made up by overthinking (something I do pretty much chronically), something that wasn't worth the therapist's time or even a problem at all, or that it's something super-easily resolved and thus ridiculous that I made such a fuss out of it, and for years now no less.

I guess maybe if anyone can offer a push, or some experience they can share, that would be really cool.  I think the final step is just to make an appointment now, and I just need to be able to bridge this gap and do that. :'D

[[Basically, long story short, the problem is that I pretty much let my anxiety rule my actions, and I'm worry-obsessed that it's really messed me up at this point, because I can't really tell if it has or hasn't and it's driving me nuts, and the obsession itself is probably harming me more at this point than what I'm actually worrying about.  I would go more in-depth to try and explain it, but I tried in a previous iteration and it got...long-winded, and the problems themselves are (to my knowledge) mostly just sourced in anxiety rather than being anxiety directly.  And so I was too scared to go in-depth for fear it'd be too irrelevant or long.]]

Example, a certain meal I've eaten many times before in the past that has no anxiety triggers in it (no caffeine for example) but I ate it before an anxiety attack months ago. Now when I eat it I feel anxious but don't know why. 

I think a lot of my anxiety now is just fear of things that remind me of when I had severe anxiety. I feel like I've figured out my triggers and control them, but things that remind me of when I had more severe anxiety can themselves trigger anxiety. Sucks.",11,2017-03-09 16:54:40 EST-0500

220,I quit my job today.,"For the last three years I have endured a difficult workplace. I am 30 years old and have worked in a grocery store ever since my anxiety drove me out of university. Three years ago the store was bought by an aggressive, business-minded man with anger issues and no people skills. I stuck it out until now, watching my coworkers leave or be sacked for petty reasons, while also suffering from burn-out and overwork. The boss was aware of my anxiety conditions and used them to his own advantage, frightening or abusing me when he was in a bad mood. Today, whilst typically overworked with morning logistics, he chewed me out for some petty reason and I eventually hid in an equipment room and stabbed myself, then calmly went over the road to my doctor to be stitched up. My doctor was horrified and ordered me home for several days to recover from stress. My boss was not amused and a shit-fight ensued between my GP, a nurse, my friend, and my boss. The boss hassled me by phone untill I required sedation and only let up when my doctor threatened to call the police. 

As a result I have left my job due to 'medical issues' at my doctor's urgings and will be spending some time on a disability benefit to get my anxiety under control. I hope I have done the right thing. I fear unemployment more than anything, but I don't think I could ever begin to recover or control my anxiety in that enviroment.",15,2017-09-11 14:13:10 EDT-0400
221,Horror movie 'It' helped with my anxiety,"Went out to watch the new horror movie It over the weekend. Before leaving our apartment my boyfriend joked about taking my heart pills in case I got too scared. We both laughed about it and also seriously decided that I should take it. 
(I take concor to stop my heart from racing which helps with anxiety/panic attacks. I don't get them often but I carry the pills around with me just to feel safe. I think the anxiety etc; came from a few traumatic episodes one of them happened two years ago, a group of gangsters purposely hit me with their car after attacking my friends, I'm physically completely fine now, fractured three bones in my spine then but perfectly fine now physically) 
The movie was of course, terrifying. There were a few times that I definitely wouldn't have minded taking a pill because of the fear felt from the movie and my heart racing fast at the same time but I couldn't really differentiate between the two fears so I focused on the fear of the scary movie. I told myself it was just a film with actors, directors and special effects. Ironically the movie itself is about battling fear. I got over the fear of the movie and subsequently the fear of my heart racing as well. I felt accomplished and perfectly in control. I had a sense of trust in myself. Something I haven't felt in a long time. 
TLDR: Watching the scary movie 'It' helped me battle my fear of my heart racing through battling the fear of a scary movie and not giving in to taking pills or walking out / taking a break from the movie.",8,2017-09-11 13:39:14 EDT-0400

I'd say that if I mess up at work I almost need to leave because I get so anxious and afraid I'm getting fired and he just asked if I was a perfectionist... Either way, I of course couldn't stop crying. I've never talked to an actual medical professional about it. He referred me to their in-house counselor to talk to a few times, and she'll probably refer me to another therapist. I'm not too worried about that, I'm just glad I'm getting this to the forefront of my life. I've spent years crying alone and brushing it off, and being afraid to get prescribed something that will zombie-fy me. But I'm taking steps, which I guess counts for something.

245,Things I have learned about anxiety and how to recover from it,"__You are OK. You will be OK.__

__Preface__: None of the information below is new. My recovery was made possible by the words and work of other, more elegant writers and professionals who recommended the acceptance method. Primarily Dr Claire Weekes and ex-sufferer Paul David. If you would like to learn more, please look into their books - they are the Truth.

What separates the me of today and the me of years past? What separates the calm, happy, generally anxiety free me of today to the anxious, confused and utter scared me of the past? Understanding and time.

I have seen the absolute depths of anxiety, panic and fear. I have felt hopeless, scared and alone. I have hidden in the toilet stalls at work having panic attacks for no apparent reason. I have been so anxious that eating becomes impossible without gagging. I have experienced all of these things but when I think about them, I can't help but smile, for I see now the truth about anxiety.

When I suffered from anxiety, I tried desperately to figure out why I was feeling the way I did, figure out what was wrong with me and what I needed to do it make it all stop - to this day I cannot say exactly what was the catalyst of my high anxiety state but I do know for a fact that it simply does not matter. I had always been prone to worry, but I had never experienced anything like this before, not even close. I frantically trawled the internet for months trying to find my way out of this maze only to land on various anxiety forums where people would be comparing their war wounds, talking about the new medication that they had been prescribed or going over their myriad symptoms. Nothing was helping, all I could think about was my condition and how horrible I felt. I wanted the old me back. I was feeling more and more detached from reality, I felt like I was living in a dream, I was losing weight and I carried around an unfocused feeling of dread for most of the day until I would gradually start to relax and feel better once in the safety of my home in the evenings.

After living like this for a long time, I was lucky enough to come across a new resource on the internet which suggested an alternative approach to recovery from anxiety; __Acceptance__

I cannot stress enough how importance Acceptance was to my own recovery. If you want the capital T truth about anxiety recovery, Acceptance and the passage of time are your 100% guaranteed ways out. I promise you.

__We fear what we do not understand__

Why did my anxiety persist, even when there was no external stressor to cause me so much distress? I had a good career, a great family life, no financial issues - I had nothing to worry about. My anxiety persisted because I was terrified of how Anxiety was making me feel. I was afraid of being afraid. Every weird, unexplained sensation that I was experiencing I was reacting to in fear, trying desperately to make it stop, make it go away. I was fuelling the anxiety with more fear and more anxiety. Acceptance is the way out. But before you can accept, you must understanding. It is much, much easier to accept the awful way you feel if you first understand _why_ you feel the way you do.

I do not work in healthcare or medicine, but if you are currently suffering from high-anxiety, I strongly recommend you research as much as you can about whichever symptoms you are currently experiencing. You will soon learn that everything that you are currently experiencing is not only explainable by science, but expected. Let me repeat that, it is expected that you feel like the way you do in your current condition. Your body is doing exactly what it should be doing. Your body thinks it is under attack, your sustained level of high anxiety and stress has got your fight or flight system working in overdrive, your protective systems are going haywire. Your body is trying to protect you.

So what should you do? Acceptance. Give yourself permission to feel weird, detached. Give yourself permission to feel nauseous, sweaty, jittery or unreal. Your mind and body are completely and utterly spent and need time to heal. Do not fight and struggle. Do not try and make it all go away. Love yourself, let yourself feel like crap, let yourself heal. Live your life alongside anxiety, take it with you to the shops, to the movie theatre, wherever. Drop all the coping mechanisms which you have developed - no more checking in on Anxiety forums, repeating anxiety mantras, using safety behaviours.

This last point is critical. It is too easy (I know I did) to 'accept' in the wrong way. Acceptance is not sitting at home waiting for it all to go away and then getting impatient when you see no improvement. That path will just lead you back into the same cycle of trying to struggle your way out of Anxiety. To paraphrase from a post from another ex-suffer, true acceptance is in the book you are reading, in the movie you are laughing at, in the way the wind feels in your face when you are out for a jog. True acceptance is being OK with the fact that for now, you have anxiety, and getting on with life regardless.

That brings me to the other critical part for my anxiety recovery - Time. Even when you are on the right path to make a full recovery from anxiety, it will still take time. Trust me here, do not put a timescale on your recovery. Do not get impatient or discouraged. There __will__ be set-backs, expect them. There will be times when you think you are recovered and then you are thrown back into the Anxiety tailspin. The difference here is that you now know the Truth about anxiety and what action you should take to get back on track - utter, utter Acceptance. Each setback will be shorter and less impactful than the last. Eventually you will have an intimate understanding and acceptance of Anxiety and Fear that people who have not suffered from an Anxiety illness simply cannot possess. It will make you stronger.

----

When I discovered the acceptance method, my mind was so clouded and unfocused that it took me a while to truly start applying it. But eventually, normality started to return to my life, anxiety burned itself out and my mind and body healed. Now, with a clear mind, and a whole lot more understanding, it is so painfully obvious why I felt the way I did. You cannot extinguish a fire by pouring gasoline onto it. You cannot mend a broken arm by hitting it. You cannot calm an anxious mind by worrying.

When I saw the light at the end of the anxiety tunnel, I knew that I wanted to help at least one person to recover from Anxiety. Hopefully this post can do that. I would love to answer any questions.

Thank you.

__You are OK. You will be OK.__

I also can't drive. I finally sucked it up and called my college and debt collectors and let them yell at me for being irresponsible and I sent in 20 job applications to jobs I know are bad for my anxiety. I need the money and I really want to go back to school. Also I have my permit test scheduled for next week.

Thanks for the awesome commiseration and feedback. Jut FYI, i have had a battery of heart tests(EKGs, stress tests, sonagram, xray). Everything always comes up clean.

Like today in work I'll be alone for 3 hours with the closing shift.  The most I've ever been alone is two hours. I didn't view it as something scary.  I saw it as ""well if I can survive 3 hours,  what else can they throw at me?""

261,Does anyone else have a fear of the dentist?,"It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. I think it stems down to the fact I had a tooth removed when I was only 5. Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. Obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that I had to wait 3 hours when I got there. Then again at 7 I had another tooth taken out and it hurt so much I couldn't eat but when I got back to school the teacher forced me too. So now I hate the dentist I have this fear they will end up pulling all my teeth out, which I know is stupid but I can't help it. I'm 17 and havnt been since I was about 9, I desperately need to go because depression and anxiety resulted in me not brushing my teeth often enough and now they look terrible and I also need and would like braces. My main worry is one tooth which has a hole in it and the hole is turning black (tooth decay I'm guessing) I terrified they will just pull it out. Anxiety is really making all my fears worse and not to mention the thought of going into the office and lying down while someone prods around in my mouth, I have severe social anxiety so many situations like dentist and doctors appointments make me nervous enough as it is. I don't know what to do I'm going to ask my mum to book an appointment but I won't be able to stop panicking till it's all sorted.

264,Takes away all my anxiety in 20 minutes - a small advice,"It might not work for you but it works for me, so it MIGHT be worth a try if you haven't done before.

When you feel anxiety and (for example) start to get that ""want to escape-feeling"" when you are outside, force yourself to think about something that you will do later in the day that you love and always calms you down. For myself my ultimate relax is to watch twitch on my phone in my bed before sleeping, with my favorite streamer. When I start to feel panicky and think about this/assure myself that I will be able to do that later in the evening, my anxiety starts do disappear to totally be gone in 10-15 minutes.

You must have something that gives you the ultimate relax as well, especially things you do in the evening or before sleeping are perfect for this.

Might be worth giving a try. Cheers!",12,2017-02-20 07:34:00 EST-0500

I don't know why. When I was a kid, my mum just said I was being respectful, but in all honesty she just missed a lot of the signs of my anxiety. Actually, I've never called my parents 'mum' and 'dad' to their faces. I called them mummy and daddy when I was a kid, then when I was about 7/8 one of my 'friends' picked on me for it. So I stopped, but didn't move on to the more grown up variations. This could be a separate thing, I don't know.

285,my anxiety makes me feel like I'm going crazy,"My anxiety makes me feel like i'm going crazy sometimes. like seriously losing my mind. Especially when I'm alone for an extended period of unplanned time. I just turned 28 and feel totally ashamed that I don't feel in control a lot of the time... especially since I'm not in a relationship which was always incredibly soothing. Work feels like my anchor even though it sometimes gives me anxiety (retail) but being there I at least feel safe. My days off when I don't have plans I feel panicky and don't always know what to do with myself - sometimes I try to keep busy with errands or exercising, but can't help but feel like I'm just  trying to get through the day. There always seems to be too many options for what I could be doing and I find it difficult to prioritize - what do I want to do? What ""should"" I be doing? Is this ok to be doing right now?

Alright, so there‚Äôs this thing called energy that I didn‚Äôt even fucking know about lmao. But I‚Äôve just learned about it and I honestly think it might just change my life.
So, back to this energy nonsense.
Before, I was viewing my social anxiety on a physical level. I was reviewing all my actions and trying to make each of them fit into an acceptable ‚Äúcode‚Äù that I thought existed. Turns out, it doesn‚Äôt fucking exist. You can be doing things that a socially awkward person does physically, but be the most confident person in the world. 
There‚Äôs a sub physical thing within you called energy, and if your energy is correct, your physical actions are irrelevant.
I can‚Äôt explain how to channel this energy, but it fucking exists.
Remember a time when you were genuinely happy, if only for a second.
It could be a joke you laughed at, or a time where you bonded with someone. 
For me, it‚Äôs when I squint my eyes and smile that I feel this energy, and it courses through my body. I get instant confidence. It‚Äôs amazing.

292,"I tell Myself it's no big deal, and I know for certain it's no big deal, but it doesn't help at all.","I'm really bad at making myself feel better. I just spiral and spiral downward. The silliest things cause me so much anxiety. I know they are silly and wont have a major affect on my life, but it's just not registering in my brain or something. It's like I don't believe myself, and the whole ""it's no big deal!"" thinking is just a ruse, a trick that will be ignored, and my brain is like ""noooo I'm onto you! That won't work""

Hard to explain. I just wish my brain would be rational. I hate having little to no control over how I react and feel to anxiety triggering events, and then obsess over them for the rest of the day.

**Are any of you able to talk yourself out of an anxiety/obsessive thought spiral or at least help ease things a little?**

My thought process is like ""SHIT, why did I do that? Why did that happen? That could have been avoided. I could have avoided that, if only *this* and *this* happened I wouldn't have been there at that time, in that situation. What series of events led up to this? Why did I do that? I could have done something differently"" and then repeat those thoughts for the rest of the day, like a broken record I can't turn off. Do you think that sounds more like an OCD type of thing? It would suck to have anxiety problems, depression, AND OCD. I don't exhibit any other OCD-like features, though, I don't think.

**edit:** thanks for the good advice! I've been struggling lately but at some point today all my anxiety just vanished away for seemingly no reason. Anxiety is weird. I'm not complaining, though!

296,A server made me cry this morning,"I just have to let this out somewhere because my family are 3000 miles away and my husband is currently sleeping in the next room and I don't want to disturb him. 

Since emigrating, I've really struggled with going outside and human interactions in general. I don't like straying off too far by myself so stick with a mile patch around our apartment. Even then, I have to mentally prepare myself before I go. Most of the time, I am able to do my daily activities without incident and can hold conversations with cashiers and other folks in stores. 

Today we ran out of a few groceries so I nipped out. I then decided to treat myself to some breakfast and went to a cafe nearby. The place was really packed out so I was feeling a little out of sorts when I went to the front to be served. The interaction was just terrible. After taking half of my order, the server suddenly flipped and was really harsh with me and berated me for not raising my voice to satisfactory levels in front of the other customers. Bear in mind, I've been in there plenty of times at various points throughout the day and no one else serving me has had an issue with my volume or asked me to repeat myself. I initially tried smiling it off because her tone caught me completely off guard but she carried on and would not drop the subject. I just felt so humiliated and embarrassed. I quickly got what I wanted and ducked out. 

I just let the tears out in the elevator up to the apartment and sat on the sofa feeling thoroughly miserable. I also managed to give myself a nosebleed which didn't help matters. My tears weren't just from anxiety but shame too- I'm a grown woman and being reduced to a nervous wreck whenever things go awry, is embarrassing and exhausting. 

I felt like I was making progress but have been knocked back a fair bit and it's frustrating. I'll definitely be avoiding the cafe for now too. ",15,2017-11-13 22:15:19 EST-0500

298,Does anyone on here have trouble hearing others?,"I'm not sure what my issue is, but it's frustrating as hell. It's been a partial cause of my anxiety lately. Hopefully someone here can relate and share advice/experience.

There are moments where I just can't understand what a person is saying to me. It usually happens mid conversation when there's a lot of competing background noise. A few words will sound filtered or muffled all of a sudden, and I'll have to ask the person to repeat themselves - often times more than once. Sometimes I'll quickly fill in the blanks in the hopes that my response doesn't have me looking like a dipshit. I can say that both choices have backfired numerous times, and that sucks. Awkwardness sucks. It also sucks because nowadays I get sorta pissed off at the person trying to talk to me, and I don't think that's fair at all. I think ""raise your damn voice"" or ""quit mumbling."" Makes me feel old even though I am only 22. 

That's it.

299,"What am I supposed to do with my life? I feel like there's no time, like I'm wasting away","It's nearly 4:30 AM and I can't sleep. I can't relax at night because I feel like I should be doing *something* with my life, but I'm just sitting here, withering away. I can't enjoy playing video games anymore, or any leisure activity at all, because I have this background worry that I'm just wasting my time.

All I have during the day is my job. And then what? I come home and be useless all day? My job doesn't give me much purpose if any. What can I do besides watch TV or sit around?

Recently, the more time that went by, the more I felt as if I needed to do something *important*. But I don't know what that means. Does it mean I should have some kind of influence, that I should somehow leave my mark on the world? Why would that matter?

I sat down with myself recently and wrote out my thoughts on that, and I concluded that the only person I should care about in that regard is myself. I should focus on making myself happy. I should do things that I want to do and not think about whether or not that gets anyone's attention.

But I don't know what that is. If it makes me happy, should I just play video games all day? Well, I don't feel good playing games anymore. It makes me feel worse, again, like time is just slipping by. I just can't relax anymore. I'm constantly on edge. I can feel my heartbeat pounding. Sometimes I forget about it all and I calm down, but at night, when I'm alone with my thoughts, I can't relax.

There's just something missing, and I don't know what to look for or how to look for it. There *are* a few things that I do want to accomplish, but they all involve me being shut in my room. And I don't feel like I have time to do them anyway.

What do I do? How do I quit wasting time? I just don't have a purpose. I don't know how to find one. Or maybe that's not it, but it's the closest thing to what I'm trying to get at. I can't sleep anymore, it's driving me crazy.",14,2017-11-13 15:40:36 EST-0500

310,The worst part of having anxiety is that it makes it hard to make logical decisions.,"I live in a small town. I offered to help at the local butcher shop. The guy doesn't own the place, his dad does. His dad won't let him hire anyone but he really needs the help, so he offered for me to come in after hours and package meat in exchange for free meat which really helps since I spend 100-200 on meat per week. 

Now I'm terrified he's some under cover serial killer or something, and I can't tell if I have actual warning bells going off or if it's just my anxiety. Anxiety makes it impossible to trust your instincts since it's indistinguishable. 

I've talked to the guy quite a few times, and I've lived in this small town off and on my whole life. I even background checked him in this and nearby counties, and all I found out was that he doesn't like to wear his seatbelt and he used to have a drinking/driving problem. 

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I did go to work with the butcher last night, and as you can see from me typing this out I am alive! Everything went really well and I think I can learn a lot from him. This is exactly what I was talking about. What I was experiencing *felt* like a gut feeling, but it was just anxiety.

317,Realising How Far I've come,"Around 4 years ago, I went through the worst Anxiety I have ever been through. I didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought I was dying. 

I couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. I would convince myself that every lump I felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting.

I was prescribed Diazepam/Beta blockers and almost prescribed Citalopram but I only choose to take 2 Diazepam and that was it. During this time I told my mum that I wanted to be sectioned because I believed that I wasn't in control of myself and was unaware that it was my Anxiety causing me to think this way. Every appointment I attended was also through the help of my mum as I felt like I couldn't go to any of them alone.

I received two visits by mental-health specialists, 1 of them believed I should be on medication for life and that I would need to take medication to function and do normal things. The other told me that I should prove him wrong.

As time went on I began counselling and attended a group CBT class. At first I felt like nothing had changed and that I had wasted my time but looking back on it now, I feel like everything got put into perspective around that time when I realised that my Anxiety is just a part of me and that no matter what discomfort I go through it always ends up going away, I chose to feel the Anxiety and not let it affect me doing anything I wanted to do.

Within the past 2 and a half years I have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a Mathematics course. I now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and I'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. 

To cut a long story short, I have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. I'll probably delete this post in few hours but I hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change.

323,Finnaly defended myself at work. It went well and I feel much better.,"As many people know, bad managers make work worse and my manager is not an exception to this. I am not the only one who has had issues with my manager but I have never done anything about it. Our office is basically a small ""satellite"" office with its own managers who answer to a regional manager. We have no HR in our office because of our size, so any issues mainly go through our manager or to the regional manager.This seems like enough background.

On the job today we ran into an issue and it became apparent that our manager did not coordinate any access for us to do our job. These things happen, albeit more than they should, and we took care of the issue as best we could. Some people were not thrilled but the damage was mitigated. 

My manager sent an accusatory email claiming he told me to coordinate access. The problem with this is that A. This is not my job, it is his. B. He did not, prior to that point, state for us to get access. We would have gladly. C. He lied in the email with my regional manager on the email seemingly just to call me out and make him look better.

Apparently this was the last straw because rather than shrugging it off or absorbing it I got angry. I compiled my emails, and my text messages and got a conference call with the regional manager, my co-worker and another manager from a different department. We had a VERY pleasant conversation. It was the exact opposite of what I thought was going to happen. Granted the rambling on and repeating of saying ""sorry"" and ""thank you for listening"" happened exactly as much as I anticipated. At the end my regional manager correctly gathered that this was not a single time issue, rather an ongoing problem. He is setting me up with a meeting with HR to air any grievances and that retaliation will not happen.

Many people who don't deal with anxiety probably won't get how hard this was. I deffinantly don't have the worst anxiety, but I have a hard time dealing with things like this.

333,It can and will get better,"Hey friends, I just wanted to pop in and share some success.

This morning, for the first time in two weeks, I woke up calm and not full of panic. This is a big deal for me because I‚Äôve been having an intense period of anxiety lately and the mornings have been the hardest on me. Lately I‚Äôve had to jolt out of bed to pace my apartment until I felt like I wasn‚Äôt going to die. Followed by crying in the shower and hiding in bed until I could feel in control of myself.

I just wanted to let everyone know that while we can‚Äôt ‚Äúcure‚Äù anxiety from never coming back, we all can and eventually will have better times. Two weeks ago I felt like I was going to die. I couldn‚Äôt eat, sleep or honestly communicate my feelings to my friends or family. I felt so alone and weak I didn‚Äôt know what to do. But slowly by slowly I started to find the courage to do things that might help. A little exercise here, a little deep breathing there. I‚Äôve realized that a bunch of small steps towards feeling better does add up over time. And that‚Äôs coming from one of the most cynical and negative people.

I believe in each and every one of you. Whether you believe it or not, better times will come again. If you asked me a few weeks ago I would have told you I felt like not living. But now I woke up and felt like a normal person for once. I know it won‚Äôt last forever and the anxiety will eventually be back. But I keep telling myself that if I‚Äôve progressed once, that I can do it as many times as I need.

Hold on, take care of yourselves and fight. We are all so much stronger than we know. I bet most of you have had to endure so much more struggle than me over the years and you‚Äôre still standing today. We can do this. It might not always be pretty and we might not always find success but we are capable.

342,Does anybody else occasionally respond out loud to conversations they have in their head? Applies to actual past conversations as well as imagined ones.,"Sometimes when I have an interaction that stresses me out, but it goes well, I accidentally replay the conversation in my mind and I repeat, out loud, a thing that I said, usually the thing that was the ""coolest"".  So like if I ordered some food at McDonalds and the cashier was cute, and I said something that made her laugh, I'd play back the conversation and repeat out loud, maybe more than once, the thing that made her laugh.  It has a soothing effect but I don't do it on purpose.

As for future conversations, usually this involves imagining an interaction with someone I know who I dislike or who stresses me out, and I'm arguing with them in my head, and during the argument I imagine what they'd say and I respond to it out loud.  Usually it's something I wouldn't have the courage to say to their face.

Does anyone relate to these experiences?  Both of these only happen when I'm alone.  Personally I consider them a couple steps shy of full blown talking out loud to people who don't even exist, and it scares me.",7,2017-12-18 20:41:44 EST-0500

I  didn't feel 100%, but I felt more calm and less overwhelmed than before. It's weird how a simple thing like eating slowly can change things up.

354,I got up and went to work today.,"So this is my first time posting on here.  I haven't had any anxiety issues recently until  I had a severe anxiety attack three nights ago.  It was the first time I had physical symptoms manifest from it and it lasted about two hours.  It left me in a terrible state and I called in sick the past two days and even went to an emergency mental health clinic and was prescribed prozac.  I spent the past two days in bed being nervous about work.  The thought of going to work this morning made my heart race and I began to shake but I don't have anymore sick days.  However, I just made myself do it.  I thought to myself, what if I had to support children?  I know it probably isn't good to put pressure on yourself but I just forced myself to go.  I knew if I didn't do it now I might never do it. The drive was not the best but once I got to work I felt okay.  I'm still worried about how I will feel when I get home or tomorrow morning before work but I feel so proud that I got out of bed and did it today.

355,I bury my best friend tomorrow. I bumped into my ex with another guy. I can't deal with this. I feel sick.,"Tomorrow I bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. I'm heartbroken and I will be speaking at his funeral. I am happy with the speech but I am nervous, petrified to mess up. He was an incredible guy and I want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. 

my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how I have been doing and if I ever needed anything go to her. 

I went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover I was nursing from the night before. I felt okay but by the end of my session I was very tired. 

As I was walking back towards my flat I spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. I could have turned around but I didn't. I go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if I'm doing okay. I say no, not really and say I'll leave them to it and say goodbye. 

As I walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. She says she has done this to tell me that what's happening with her and him is not what it seems and she didn't want me to worry about something when it's not. She says they are not seeing each other and that he is just a work friend. That he is going through a hard time. 

We then get talking about how I'm feeling, how devestated I am, how I'm scared for Wednesday. She and a mutual friend went to a concert last week and she mentions they talked. She said she went on a rant about how much she cares about me, that I was her best friend, that she is worried for me. She says she's nearly messaged me just to see if I want to hang out. She has come to me since my best friends death to apologise and she says that she will leave me alone now and will wait for me to message. 

I do say I miss her but right now my head is all over the place. I'm considering my options about going home and starting again. That I'm not looking for anyone right now. I'm just tired, exhausted. She said I look like I haven't eaten well, that I'm really pale. She nearly went to the same club as me the night before but didn't and stays she's glad she didn't. 

She offers to cook me a meal or go for coffee. That she is always here for me. I ask again about them and she says they're not seeing other, that something could happen but it isn't. 

I accidentally saw her open diary just before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. This guy has a child. I recognise him from her xmas party. 

I'm really confused about why she chased after me. It's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. 

I do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. Seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. She works with him, did she like him when we were dating. 

I also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. And it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. I'm going through the hardest time of my life. I feel like I can't use her as a crutch.

I'm so confused, hurt, a mess. I bury my best friend tomorrow . I am absolutely terrified. I feel sick, like I'm going to mess up and ruin everything. 

The last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. I want things to be better. I want him back. I want her back. I feel terrible. ",25,2017-06-27 22:15:26 EDT-0400

362,"So, my coworker unexpectedly and very suddenly passed away last night","He was like my age, early 20's. I saw him every day and this does not feel real, and I've been disassociating since I found out which was like an hour ago.

Death/afterlife is my trigger. So I think I'm the only person at work who reacted as strongly as I did. My dad came and brought me xanax and even cut it in half for me so I won't fall asleep at my desk.

I didnt have a full on anxiety attack though, which is good I guess but I'm worried it will happen later on when I least expect it. Thats what happened when I had the worst attack of my life; my dog died and I cried a lot but then about a month later I had the attack. It was awful, my worst memory. And at that time I didnt think about it but I'm 100% certain it was because of his death.

I don't know what to do. All my coworkers are now coming up to me either saying ""man that sucks"" or something along those lines and some of them who saw my reaction are now asking if I'm okay. I don't want to talk about it but I think I have to.

The xanax is working. I'm calm. But I think I'm getting sleepy.

363,Self-help for panic attacks (my tips),"I'm going to copy here what I wrote to some person and maybe you people can find it useful. I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for years and I learned how to prevent them and how to help myself during and after the attack. So,  


**During a panic attack, what I'm doing:**  
- having a water besides me  
- going somewhere where I feel safe and where I'm alone  
- breathing, trying to calm myself down by repeating myself that I'm safe and that's everything's going to be okay  
- repeating that it's ""just"" a panic attack and that it'll go away after a few minutes  
- sometimes, if I'm home, lying on my bed with some relaxing music with closed eyes  
- taking the medication for anxiety as fast as I can (if you're taking them)  


**What I'm doing after the panic attack:**  
- drinking enough water  
- rest, rest, rest  
- writing about it and tell that to my doctor (if you have a doctor)  
- talking to someone about it  
- generally taking care of myself  


**What I'm doing to prevent the next panic attack:**  
- recognizing the triggers and early symptoms of it  
- after you recognized the early symptoms, trying to calm yourself down for prevention  
- drinking water and staying hydrated if you notice the symptoms  
- going somewhere safe until you feel good enough to go to the outside world  
- taking the medication for anxiety (if you're taking them) when you notice that the symptoms are getting worse and you can't calm yourself down mentally  
- remembering one thing:  
----> if you panic about the physical sensations and symptoms (usually they're the first one to appear), it's more likely that you'll get the panic attack. It's important to just recognize the sensations and trying to do something for your body to calm down after you calm down the mind. But the most important thing I've learned through my journey is learning to calm down your mind, because that's the real prevention. The only dangerous thing that can happen to you during the panic attack is being anxious, which can be scary to you and that's why I said (subjectively) dangerous. But prevention is really important; If I didn't know how to prevent the panic attacks, I would be on much more medications right now.  

Hope I helped someone, and if anyone has any questions about panic attacks, my PM is open.",11,2017-06-23 15:35:33 EDT-0400

What I mean by that is that I have a huge issue of desperately needing approval of people around me, and I am super paranoid that any tiny little thing that I did will cause someone I like (platonic or not) to dislike me and want nothing to do with me.

So I end up fixating on what I say to people, and when I am not interacting with people, I am paranoid that what I said made them hate me or something like that, not matter how ridiculous it is.
I do have a fair few diagnosed mental health issues and maybe some undiagnosed ones. But aside from medication and therapy, is there any good techniques to calm myself in the moment? This is really keeping me from just enjoying my time with people...

TLDR: I'm always obsessive about if I said something wrong to someone to cause them to hate me, even if there is no reason to think that way, and it keeps me from just enjoying my time with people.

371,my boyfriend is HIV positive and it's killing me with anxiety.,"I just need to start this off by saying: holy shit, please do not judge me.

I'm 19 years old, he is 20 (we're both guys).

I won't go too much into details, all I will say is that my boyfriend got diagnosed as HIV positive a little more than a month ago, and I took the test and resulted negative, will retake it in around 2 weeks?? (that's when our 3 month mark of no sex will be hit).

The thought of transmission, the thought of people being judgmental (specially my family) just makes me have a huge anxiety attack, which is something I despise. 

It frustrates me to much to not be able to relax and listen to what people tell me, and even though his doctor said that out of treatment a kiss is not considered a way to contract HIV unless there's a gum disease or something, I get very anxious after kissing him and everything goes to **shit**.

He's an amazing person, he's really great and even though he can't see that, I try and show him how important he is to me, but sometimes I can't seem to stand the idea of being anxious all the time about getting HIV (even when he's on his treatment) and it's been giving me serious anxiety lately.

I feel like I'm not making much sense but I really need at least opinions, what should I do????? Right now we're kind of *on hold* and we decided to not to anything until I take my test again and get my results, and then we'll see what happens.

I don't want to hurt him, oh lord I don't but I don't want to feel so scared all the time and it's something that I cannot control at all. One day I'll be feeling **AMAZING** and will rule the world and not care about this, and the next day I'll be having panic attacks and also be really scared for everything and just want to cry and regret everything.

I hope this makes sense: I will **never** regret being with him EVER, but I do regret that I didn't do something before. I love him, I love him so much oh my god but I'm dying in the inside right now. I feel again that my post doesn't make sense but hey, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

EDIT: the thought of breaking up with him physically exhausts me and destroys me but sometimes I think that it's the only way out of this horrifying loop of nights crying, anxiety attacks and such things.",42,2017-06-26 01:19:08 EDT-0400

379,The Donald's Got Me Down,"The night of the election, as the results came in, I had a severe panic attack and struggled to get out bed the next day (I ended up working from home the following day). I had to make an immediate appointment with my therapist to discuss how despondent I felt. 

In the weeks since, I've avoided news coverage and, thus, have felt better and have been more able to distance myself mentally from what's going on. However, after the inauguration and attending the women's march in Washington, I'm again feeling out of sorts. I know I need to again stop watching news--but for four years? I want to stay aware and active, but it may be at the expense of my mental health. 

I was walking around the grocery store today and just wanted to cry for everyone there. I'm truly disturbed by what is happening and I fear I don't have the right coping mechanisms for the next four years.


Editing to add: This isn't as political as it may seem. I think for a variety of reasons he triggers anxiety in a number of people. And if you are feeling anxious, it's very much a real thing. It's really about finding ways to cope (and vent).

1) No coffee and reduce caffeine in general

3) Ran..sometimes miles and miles, sometimes only for 20 minutes. 

Each of these things reduce the physical effects of anxiety. I still get my moments but I don't feel like falling into a hole whenever I am uneasy.

384,Do you feel like anxiety is stealing your intelligence?,"   I've been having some really bad recurring anxiety, mainly pertaining to the way that I perceive myself intellectually. I've been having a hard time remembering things, and when I'm reading, I feel like the words just don't register in my head. My eyes see and scan the words, but can't put any connections to them. They're just words that I can't string together to make coherent thoughts or judgements. 

 I have this self-talk when I'm reading that goes like this. *""I'm so worried I'm becoming less intelligent, can I understand this word? maybe it's from not getting enough sleep, what about this word? Maybe it's just because I don't understand the material, because I'm becoming a vegetable.""*

This self talk happens while I'm reading, or at work, and my anxiety will kick in and I can't perform the simplest tasks. If I had to say how much I think about my anxiety and my waning intelligence per day, it would probably be around 60% to 70%. And I fear that I can't gain this intelligence back. 

I know because my brain is occupied with the thoughts of anxiety, it can't process other information, like interpreting words that I'm reading or listening to customers at work. But I don't know how to shake the anxiety. 

Does anyone else feel they are somehow less cognitively adept because of anxiety? How does it manifest itself for you? I surely can't be the only person who feels like this, can I? ",47,2017-01-26 11:58:37 EST-0500

392,Anyone else feel really (Unreasonably) bad after making driving mistakes?,"I have always had anxiety related to driving since getting my license at 18 (22 now). Ironically, I drive a lot of miles for work because of the nature of my job and for the most part I have done well (no accidents over 5k miles). But this week I managed to fuck up and piss off other drivers by not being careful on two separate occasions. This morning I misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic and cut off cars. The cars behind me started honking and I felt really stupid and bad for essentially almost causing an accident. I don't know why I still feel bad about it, like I really feel like shit. I should have been more careful

I'm not sure if this is the right sub forum for this but, I know this isn't *normal* to feel bad for several days after doing something like this.

394,"Tips for those who feel anxiety creeping up on them - Similar to Mindfulness, but more specific.","I have struggled with anxiety for nearly all of my life. One thing I will say that I have learned is that my anxiety tends to start as an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach with no obvious trigger or real reason... It gets worse when I don't eat properly, don't get enough sleep, or am sedentary for too long. Now with all that being said, one of the most important things I have learned is that when that uneasy feeling comes up and you understand logically that there is nothing to be anxious about DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR MENTAL CAPACITY NOT TO ASSIGN REASONS TO THE FEELING. You have to be very in tune with yourself and your anxiety, but if you can recognize it when it creeps up and acknowledge the feeling without letting it overtake you mentally then that is a HUGE milestone towards developing a healthy understanding of yourself and your relationship with how you were made. 

As individuals with anxiety, we are wired for struggle, but we don't have to let anxiety overtake us! Now, I understand that anxiety is a spectrum. Some people have more difficulty staying in control than others when anxiety hits them and anxiety attacks can present themselves in many different ways. However, in my personal experience when I start to feel that nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach and my breath shortens and heart rate increases, I don't think ""Why am I feeling this way? What is wrong with me/my life?"" and try to find a source or reason to justify my feelings of anxiety. I simply notice the feeling and acknowledge it for what it is and then do something that I know helps me feel better! Getting some fresh air helps me return to a centered and grounded state. Going outside for a walk, doing yoga, or reading some books on mindfulness to realign myself with a healthy mental perspective is incredibly beneficial. It will be different for everyone, so you have to find what works for you! 

I hope this helps some other people who are struggling. These are just a few things that I wish I understood and could have used to help myself cope earlier in life. ",12,2017-01-23 23:00:07 EST-0500
395,Does anyone else feel like life is an endless struggle? [rant],"I have been anxious and depressed all month worrying about money. My job does not offer health insurance so I am on Obamacare...until that gets repealed. I get very little government assistance because I ""make too much money"" but I live in a big city so adjusting for my cost of living I barely make above minimum wage. And I am paying about 15% of my monthly income on insurance. 

And due to rising costs every year I have to keep changing my insurance which means changing my dentist and my GP. You know what's great for a person with anxiety? Make them get in touch with a bunch of hard to contact strangers praying they take your magical doctor card so you can pay a copay for the medication that helps you just barely function. And also be scared the entire time they aren't actually in your network and you will still get slapped with a big bill when you least expect it, just waiting in your mailbox when you come home from work ready to kill your mood. 

I work hard at my job. I asked for a raise a few months ago and my boss assured me he is ""working on it."" I asked for the bonus at the end of the year I was owed and he said he'd ""see what he can do."" And I haven't heard anything. I started last February so he might pull that ""you weren't here the whole year"" stuff. I am close to my anniversary at my job and I am scared so ask for a raise again but I am getting pissed off about it. I work for a small company and I love my coworkers but this struggle is hurting me. 

I looked at jobs last week in desperation. Just in case. It's miserable and it made me cry. I dare not jeopardize my job because it's probably the best I can do and that makes my heart hurt that I am so trapped. 

And if nothing else I was banking on getting a decent sized tax return. I filed today and...it's the smallest return I've ever had. 

And this is just about money and health insurance! It's an endless struggle. Why live? I have to believe it will get better...but...why? How? And I know I'm not the only one. And I know others have it even worse. I just honestly don't know why I am living through all of this. This is not a life.

398,how can i face my colleagues at work after this?,"I had a panic attack at work yesterday in front of my colleagues, and it was very embarrassing. I was in a meeting with my supervisor when she announced that staff who I frequently work with in my program will be meeting with me immediately after our meeting to discuss expectations of me and invite me to ask questions. I said ok, even though I was annoyed that I was given no notice and I didn't prepare for it, but I thought I could handle it. Wrong. Everyone came in and immediately my heart started pounding and I was terrified. I have a fear of failure and even though I knew these people weren't here to criticize me, I started experiencing the symptoms of a panic attack. 

They wrote up a document of expectations for me that I knew nothing about and discussed it with me, asking me questions about what I think and if I have anything to add. I felt like everyone banded together to attack me and my performance, even though they were there to clarify my responsibilities and who I go to for questions. Still, I felt nauseous, excused myself to catch my breath, and cautiously returned. When I returned, no one said anything about my obvious discomfort. I barely could comprehend what they were saying, I couldn't answer their questions, stumbled over my words. I felt weak, nauseous, terrified, couldn't catch my breath. And they all saw it. I could tell how uncomfortable and confused I made them, but I could barely contain my own discomfort and confusion. 

Afterwards everyone left except my supervisor and she was not pleased. She basically said I need to get my act together and work though my anxiety. I was holding back tears. I asked if I could work from home and she said yes, only if I promised to work, even though she knows that I am an honest and hardworking employee. When I got home I emailed her and told her that she needs to give me notice for situations like this so I can prepare and I asked if we could reschedule the meeting. She said ok. Now it's the weekend and I have to go back to work on Monday and somehow continue to work with the same folks who I imagine now think of me as some sensitive, fragile idiot who can't accept feedback. 

I don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed and angry. How do I move forward from this?

Anyone been here at my age?","The older I get, the worse I seem to be at, I don't know, functioning in general. I used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, I did well in school, had hobbies and interests - I was weird, but enough people liked me that I didn't think about it. After high school it was like the blinders were taken off and I started to see all these things about myself that I really, really hated. I started struggling a lot in social situations, I flunked out of a really good university, I couldn't hold a job, I gradually lost contact with my friends... I was a mess.

But I got back up. It was a little harder than before but I still had enough momentum to keep going. I moved back to my old school's city after a semester away, ready to do what I had to in order to re-enroll, but things got worse. I had a *lot* of anxiety already, and you know how people are - they pick up on that. I reconnected with my friends for a little while but then they all ghosted me because I was starting to act a little crazy. I got very depressed and almost did something irreparably bad to myself.

So back with mom and dad. Again. Starting at another school. Again. I got overwhelmed and started having panic attacks before classes and pulled out. I got a job and worked full time, but I was not good at it, my co-workers didn't like me much, and I was fired after a year. So I'm back in school yay. Except I'm only in two classes and still struggling. Everything is just... *so hard* and it's exhausting and frustrating and humiliating. I had high hopes for myself, but I don't see how to salvage any of that from what I've let myself become.

I think a big part of my problems is that I'm so used to trying and failing that I'm afraid that's the only outcome if I try again. I look at myself and think ""I've given up,"" because I have. I don't want to! But I don't know how to make life work for me anymore. I don't know how to connect with people. I go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound.

For the whole two months I was in absolute fear of going back to school. I tried to forget about it and enjoy what was left. I avoided looking at calendars. I avoided going out so I don't feel the spring come. But now the time has come.

I am autistic and honestly I don't really get to get along with people and due to my previous ignorant acts (I didn't know about social boundaries. I'm still learning and trying to act natural) I have made many enemies. I do not hate them but they hate me. You should've seen how they look at me. They don't bully me or anything, it's just the look and the atomsphere that is killing me. I haven't seen them over the what, five years and bam we ended up in same high school. You know what's even greater? Four of them, all nicely packed together, are now classmates with me!!! Da. Fuck. 

And you see my middle school was a nightmare. Being an austistic means you have to learn all the social things yourself. The younger self back then haven't learned much. I really tried to act natural and do the good deed but welp I fucked up bad. Cringey stuff. And here is the kick. A relationship went reeeaally bad and I ended up being sexually assaulted, many times, even during school, and was a famous slut!! I ain't even pretty or fit. So uhh you see the whole middle school became a trauma and is an awesome anxiety trigger. Everything related to it, even trival things are now my greatest fears. People, area, books, even certain foods. 

I thought I was finally out of it when we moved a little bit farther. But damn sweet goddamn heavens they are back, now in my same class!! Hohohoo I will see them every day and in a month or so mouths will start whispering. Wowie you say. And here I am, a week left, experiencing near death fear.

I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 15 and have been on medication for almost 2 years now.

Due to my anxiety I have been unable to find employment as between the ages of 20 and 22 I was completely house bound. The period after that however has been a long road of recovery and I am very much on the mend.

I have applied for somewhere between 150-200 jobs over the last 2 years and only been invited to 4 interviews during this period. 

I am delighted to share the news that I have now found employment which I am due to start on Monday 27th of February.

Since this news, the tension in my shoulders and neck I have had for longer than I can remember has gone away. For many years I have felt like I have had the whole world on my shoulders and I now no longer feel this way, I feel completely relieved and I am actually excited about what the future will bring.

I have not felt excited or good about anything for a good 9 years. 

I'm really glad things are starting to look up, after a very painful and tough period in my life.

I think it just shows with patience, and the right help you can over come your anxiety, or manage it which I am very fortunate to have done.

I've been fighting anxiety and panic for the past year. I had a panic attack 1 year ago February 2nd. I went to a 24 hour clinic and they told me I was dying from my heart rate and blood pressure. I rushed to the ER where they didn't bat an eye and told me it was a panic attack. That thought though stuck with me. I never had another panic attack but lived in constant fear of my heart until January 1st 2017. I tried taking an antidepressant and it sent me into a wild panic of rapid heart rate and hot flashes. I pulled through though and touched it out. A few weeks later, I had one after working out and thought I was having a heart attack. This is what got me me the most and scared me more than ever. I had another the following Saturday and convinced myself that I was fine, but still felt like I was dying. 

I went to a cardiologist twice and had echo and ekg done. All fine. 

I've been in fear of the slightest bit of exertion from fear of my heart rate now. 

The past year has stifled my music. I haven't written a note in a year. I've been more depressed than any point in my life and just overall terrified. 

Tonight, in a puddle of tears after battling off the flu for a week ( bad timing right) , my girlfriend came home and hugged me tight. I know this hurts her to see and she's seen it often as of late. I don't know how I'd handle seeing her the way I am. I told her that I'm not weak and I'm just crying because I'm fighting so hard. She told me ""I know. I'm just waiting on you to come back."" ...... This hit me so hard and it's so true. I'm a shell of myself and occasionally, I show up to fill the void. I'm still happy and myself, but compared to how I used to be, these rapid shifts aren't me. I was so carefree, daring, creative, and fearless. I'm afraid of losing who I was. I went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and for the first time in a year, I feel like I saw my own reflection. I know the battle isn't won, and I've got a long way to go, but something just snapped tonight. 

I understand what you're all going through. We're all in it together. Don't lose yourself because you're still in there. There is still spark. There's hope, happiness, and a face full of smiles that you probably forgot about. You may run to the bathroom at work to let out a few tears like I do, and that's ok. You may cry yourself to sleep at night or cry in the car. 

Let me just tell you this. You aren't weak. If you were weak, you wouldn't be fighting. I honestly don't know what inspired me to post this as I don't post here ever. This is obviously an alt, but I just wanted someone to hear if anyone. 

We're all going to get through this. There is an end and a light. You're fighting every day and while you lose the battle some days, you win some days too. Don't give up hope and don't lose yourself. Much love from someone like you. ",48,2017-03-02 11:18:06 EST-0500
429,Do you often feel like every time you make a mistake you have let the entire world down?,"And I am not saying that it **feels like** you let the entire world down ... 

I mean that it **LITERALLY DOES FEEL LIKE YOUR MISTAKES HAVE LET THE ENTIRE WORLD DOWN**. 

I mean, as if everytime I make a mistake, it is like I have caused the entire world to go into a nuclear war or some apocalyptic age!

And I am including even the tiniest or even the silliest of mistakes. Could be a simple miscalculation, could a spelling mistake in a text message or even pronouncing someone's name with another one.

If I had the opportunity to apologise to the entire world every time I made a mistake, I wouldn't be just apologising ... I would definitely be on my knees begging for mercy and begging them not to look at me like a failure or a screw-up and begging them to not judge me

And I am not exaggerating or trying to be funny here!

EDIT ... I have just changed a few spelling mistakes I found in this post and even those make are now making me feel like I deserve to jump off of a cliff or claw my eyes or a bash my head into a brick wall!!!

I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from.

I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it!!

EDIT 2 .. There is also a habit that I keep doing. For some reason, the more I notice that I made a mistake, the more I hold onto them. I know that my initial reason is never, ever, ever make that mistake again but for some reason, I keep holding onto it so much that it feels like I **BECOME** the mistake and because of that, I end up repeating the same mistake over and over again",13,2017-03-04 00:15:24 EST-0500
430,Turns Out My Anxiety Wasn't the Root Problem,"I have had terrible generalized anxiety disorder that seemed to be worsening in recent years, despite active efforts to treat it. It's been so distressing, bringing down my quality of life. I have been suffering from brain fog, rumination, fatigue. Every decision in the day was like I was parsing out whether I would have enough ""energy"" to do this or that thing, then I hated myself for lacking ""willpower.""

Fellow anxiety sufferers, make sure that you explore other answers to your anxiety. Two weeks ago, after almost a year trying to explain a seemingly unrelated medical problem, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune illness called Sjogren's Syndrome. 

Sjogren's patients often have anxiety and depression for years before they are diagnosed (if they ever are, because many manifestations of the illness look just like common medical complaints). I have probably had it for 20 years, and no one knew.

Shocker to discover that I actually WAS sick and fatigued, that things actually WERE harder for me than others. 

I'm a week and a half into treatment for the autoimmune illness, and suddenly I feel energetic and well for much more of the day. The heart pounding anxiety has gone down, too. 

I'm still seeking treatment for the anxiety, of course, but now so much make sense. ",106,2017-03-05 20:19:53 EST-0500
431,DAE suffer from anxiety regarding employment and jobs?,"I am diagnosed Social Anxiety with Depression. I have held few jobs in my life due to circumstances involving family, one of them being I had to help raise my sister's kid when she mentally checked out. I am trying to get back out and get more money coming in. My anxiety used to not be as bad. Now I am fighting the urge to get drunk while filling out job applications. One of the sources of this issue is that I am nearing 30 and have not held anything stable beyond a year. I have done a bunch of under-the-table work like cleaning, babysitting, some construction, but nothing illegal. however, I have not held stable income for more than a year. 

Another issue I am having is that nearly every previous job I have worked underwent management changes and lost my information because of it. I have forms to prove employment for some jobs. But others, I may be screwed on to prove. I am trying to polish up my resume but I fear it may not be good enough.

I'd find ways to stay up as long as I could, as the way I saw it, technically for me it wasn't the next day yet and by staying awake I'd prolong the inevitable. 

Now, 21 years old. And I still feel the same every night. This absolute dread before I go to bed:

A) What if I can't get to sleep?
B) What if I start thinking about life again, and start over worrying myself.
C) A common one I hate, what if I don't wake up tomorrow? (This one seriously scares me)
D) What if I oversleep, and my whole day goes to shit.

This made me stop. think, and out of the blue burst into tears. Worrying over stuff - other people, my health, my relationships, anything - is what my anxiety is all about. Hearing this meant so much to me, and for the last couple of days my anxiety has been quiet. I don't know when that happened last. Maybe it just lasts a few days, but it's really been a chance to breathe and prepare for the next round in the fight.

When it first started happening I thought I was going to die and then I felt like I was going insane. I felt like I was alone and I was the only person on the planet that it was happening to. Back then I didn't have a computer or a smart phone to jump on to and find out about it so I just thought I was alone. I finally met someone when I was 19 who got panic attacks too and I felt a weight lifted off of me, don't get me wrong I still got panic attacks but knowing that I wasn't alone was a huge relief. It wasn't until I was 27 that I finally found a friend who not only got panic attacks too but he had a phd in psychology so he could break things down for me. After being turned down by over 50 therapists and trying all sorts of medications I finally got seen by a therapist on my36th birthday. I can honestly say without my friend and my therapist I would have killed myself. I say all of this because I know how horrible it is to go through this alone with no one to talk to and I know how difficult it is for people who don't have this to understand. I want to offer myself to anyone out there who needs someone to listen someone to help for anyone who can't afford a therapist or has no social life. Message me and let's talk if you want we can even talk on the phone.

450,"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.","I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes ‚Äî whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology ‚Äî it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion ‚Äî something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer ‚Äî often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom ‚Äî it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",22,2017-11-22 18:18:00 EST-0500

464,I‚Äôm 20 but my life is over,"I turn 21 in January and as scary as it is to even say, i feel like that‚Äôs my last year. Everything has fell apart, not even recently, a while ago. 

I suffer from anxiety and depression and am on medication for both, and see a therapist often, but it‚Äôs not enough. I‚Äôve never had a job in my life because i physically can‚Äôt do it, no matter how hard i try or how pushed i feel to get one. I tried to go to college after school but that didn‚Äôt work so i dropped out, and ended up doug nothing for two years, and then after that time, i tried college again and i felt really good about it, for a month, and then i left again.

Now it‚Äôs a year after i left college, and nothing good has happened, literally nothing, my anxiety is worse than ever and i feel so hopeless about every single thing. The only calming thought i have now is that i won‚Äôt be alive for much longer so things will be okay, and i don‚Äôt mean that as a threat at all, it‚Äôs never even say it outloud, it‚Äôs just genuinely the only thing that can bring me back to myself.

My parents often tell me they‚Äôre proud of me but all that does is make me feel so much worse because i know it‚Äôs a lie. How can you be proud of me when i have done absolutely nothing with the last 3/4 years of my life? They think they‚Äôre supportive by telling me about jobs but it always turns into a fight because they both think they get how i‚Äôm feeling but obviously they don‚Äôt, it just feels like a jab at me whenever they mention it. They‚Äôve been separated since i‚Äôm 8 years old so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre ‚Äúganging up‚Äù on me, im just hearing it from two angles i guess.

I don‚Äôt even know what posting here will accomplish, i don‚Äôt know what anything i do will anymore, part of me feels like i‚Äôm wasting any money i do have on therapy because it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôll magically get better by speaking, I‚Äôve just grown to like my therapist at this point so i think i just go to get a chance to spend time with someone who isn‚Äôt in my family. 

I think i want to be locked up for a while, not in prison or anything, just somewhere away from my current life, i want to be someone else because i really just exist, im not living, most of the time i don‚Äôt even feel like i exist, i have to talk myself into even believing i‚Äôm alive and real.

Sorry for such a long post, i don‚Äôt expect anyone to read it, honestly, i just felt like i needed to get it out there, but i don‚Äôt think it will help, i just wanted to share. 

Edit: Im really overwhelmed and surprised with all the responses, i appreciate and have read them all, i won‚Äôt be able to respond to everyone simply because i don‚Äôt want to repeat myself over and over, but i am so grateful for everyone‚Äôs words.

465,Does anyone else frequently cringe at stuff that didn't actually happen in their lives but COULD HAVE happened?,"I've noticed that I tend to have this problem a lot. A lot of people tend to cringe strongly over embarrassing moments in their lives (example: cringing over that one time they looked stupid in front of their high school crush).

However, I noticed that I don't tend to have that problem, but I seem to make up for it by cringing over hypothetical scenarios in my life that NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED but COULD HAVE HAPPENED. For example:

*""WHAT IF I made an off-color joke that one time?""*

*""WHAT IF I said something stupid during this situation?""*

*""WHAT IF I ended up saying that thing that I almost said one time?""*

*""WHAT IF I did something stupid during my speech?""*

All the cringy HYPOTHETICAL scenarios just pile up and start eating me alive. And its stupid because none of these scenarios actually happened, but I'm still consumed by these thoughts. Shit sucks man.

469,A manga about a girl who suffers from communications disorder I thought was worth sharing,"this manga is called Komi-san wa Komyushou. It's about a girl, who everyone thinks she's perfect, when in reality, she has a problem simply talking to people, a lot like anxiety, such as walking into a store, only to leave immediately because she got scared, to having trouble to saying how she feels, to writing what she wants to say on paper, which, I sometimes do myself, back when I was in a technical school. couldn't talk to anyone normally unless i knew them for like a month in class. Later, she becomes friends with someone, who tries to help her make friends and socialize.


reading about it reminded me a bit of myself, especially the writing out instead of talking bit and being nervous around people, and also my friend, who is a bit like her as well.


I'm not trying to offend anyone, nor am I trying to make light of anyone's problems. I just figured it would be nice to share this, and see what people think about it.

Some urgent cares in the US will evaluate. I paid a total of $70 to get evaluated and get a prescription for 3 months, and I got referrals as well. Totally worth it.

Edit: I wanted to add that just because others have had negative experiences with medication does NOT mean you shouldn't try to see if it helps you. Please talk to your doctor about this opportunity. Medication is here to help you, not hinder. Give it a try; a majority of people find peace and success in medicine! If it doesn't work, then you move on to the next possible solution.

472,DAE feel like their anxiety isn't taken as seriously because it's so normalized,"In today's society anxiety is seen as such a normal thing to experience (and it is to a certain degree!) and I feel like it makes people normalize anxiety disorders way more. I get so much support from my friends and family but I still sometimes feel like they think having an anxiety disorder is the same thing as having ""normal anxiety"" but often. So when I'm not doing well at all mentally and I'm ""calling out for help"" nobody really takes me as seriously as I'd need at that moment.",8,2017-11-27 02:30:07 EST-0500
473,"Medication helps, therapy does too, but love? Love is the greatest thing to ever happen to me.","I‚Äôm 21 I‚Äôve had anxiety for a long time, and more recently diagnosed with OCD on top of it. I‚Äôve been in a psychiatric hospital, I‚Äôve been on so many medications I don‚Äôt even remember them all, and I‚Äôve been to more therapists than I can count. 

This isn‚Äôt a pity post. It‚Äôs a success post. Yea I‚Äôve found a medication combo that works, and a great therapist, but those don‚Äôt even come close to love. 7 months ago I met my girlfriend, and my life changed forever, and anxiety took a seat for once. She‚Äôs just, so supportive, I ask her all the time why she puts up with my mental problems, or just me in general. It causes fights, I hate that so much, but she still stays with me. She says every day she loves me. She is unimaginably supportive of me and everything in my life, whether good or bad. 

Today is thanksgiving and I‚Äôm anxious, as I‚Äôm sure most of you are. She‚Äôs a few states away for the weekend with family, and I was having a panic attack in the car on my way to dinner. Just the thought that she‚Äôs my girlfriend and loves me helped that anxiety go away. 

She‚Äôs single handily the best thing to ever happen to me and my anxiety. I don‚Äôt remember what it was like before we met and I honestly don‚Äôt want to. My life is good for once. I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm hopeful. These are all such new feelings to me. She doesn‚Äôt realize that her coming into my life and choosing me is the best gift I‚Äôve ever received in my life. 

The point of this post is to inspire hope. Hope that you reading this will find your special someone one day. Not just a girlfriend or boyfriend, but your soulmate. If they‚Äôre the right one, they‚Äôll give you more than any person or material possession can ever give you, the ability to fight this illness we unfortunately have. That person can make it stop, even if only in temporary moments. It‚Äôs the most amazing thing in the world. 

Good luck everyone. I hope you find your forever person. They give you the gift of hope, courage, and love. And love is one hell of an SSRI. ",14,2017-11-24 00:14:41 EST-0500

483,Tip for people who overthink,"So I'm a person that overthinks to the point where I get so anxious about what other people think of me, of what I look like, of my actions, and just everything that I sometimes start to have a panic attack because of it. It has stopped me from doing so many things and at one point someone said to me ""People are so much more critical of themselves that they dont even have time to think of anything stupid that you've done"".
So now when I feel like I've done something idiotic(Said something dumb, tripped, snotted, etc) or when I have to do something like public speaking I try to think ""If all I'm thinking about is myself and what I've done then other people are probably doing the same.""
Because I know that if anyone else did what I did I wouldnt even think twice about it. I would just go on about my day worrying about myself.
I've tried to keep this in mind and its really helped tone down my anxiety so if any of you are like me I hope this can help you as well.",34,2017-09-07 14:08:57 EDT-0400

So we are all going through similar things and the best thing we can do is encourage each other and be positive.

492,I BOUGHT FOOD TODAY,"A little over a week ago I (17 years old) moved away from home in the middle of nowhere, to go study at university.  I'm a full day's drive away from anywhere remotely familiar, not that I *can* drive, and all I took with me was... a couple books all my games games consoles (even ones I don't have the cables for) plushies clothes bedding my entire personal computer its accessories and two monitors, and a small, dwindling supply of food.

I have a tendency to over-pack.

Anyway, this is my first time being remotely independent so I, being who I am, decided to spend the entire orientation week in my room alone watching youtube and playing WoW, only leaving to attend mandatory events at the university a couple minutes' walk away.

As you might have guessed from the title, being alone in one's room for an indefinite period of time has an adverse effect on one's food supply.  I ran out of bread a couple days in and all I had left was cereal and pasta.  I ate the cereal in the mornings and, just to have some semblance of a ""varied diet"", mustered the courage to seek out the shared kitchen for ten minutes at a time to boil some pasta.

But on Saturday morning I ran out of milk.  I told myself ""ah, not to worry, I'll go buy some later today as I'm not busy at all"".  I didn't, of course.  Not only is Tesco nearly *twice* as far as the university (that's almost a *five minute* walk, people!), you also have to cross *several* roads to get there!  Coming from a place where you have to worry about maybe one car every five or ten minutes, this is a big issue for me.  So no shopping on Saturday.

Sunday came, and my breakfast options were limited.  But I had already considered this the day before, while I was coming up with excuses to not just buy milk.  You see, I had heard that some people eat cereal with water instead of milk!  And there's an endless supply of water (included in my rent) in the en-suite bathroom right next to me!

**DO NOT DO THIS.**  Holy shit it is like eating soggy chlorine.  It is NOT worth it.  I soldiered through maybe three or four spoonfulls before sneaking out to the kitchen to scrape it into the bin.  I could not wash that taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day.

Today, after skipping breakfast, I attended my first lecture at uni.  Having already been out, I hadn't made myself comfortable in my room so I was kind of ready to leave again.  I had done it once, I knew what I was doing, I vaguely understood the basics of crossing roads.  So after spending maybe thirty minutes reading and re-reading the Google Maps page for the nearby supermarket, I put on my jacket and went out into the rain.

And you know what?  Nothing happened.  I'm not dead.

Not only do I have more milk, I got a pizza, some bread, some fizzy water and some crisps.  But more than that, I feel fucking *invincible*.  The moral of the story is, it doesn't always take courage, bravery and initiative to do something you're afraid of doing.  Sometimes all it takes is the threat of eating another bowl of Tapwater Flakes.

Next household chores to conquer are doing the laundry and emptying the bin.  Wish me luck friends.  I hope this story motivates even one of you to go do that thing you need to do.",10,2017-09-04 16:45:55 EDT-0400

It was fucking awful

My voice was already raspy , yet I was somehow expected to carry the song. Everyone was laughing at us as. We heard from our friends in the crowd how much everyone was roasting us and it was terrible. It was fucking terrible and I feel terrible.

My friends don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal and told me ‚Äúnot to worry it‚Äôs whatever‚Äù. They even want to try again tomorrow.

I feel like I‚Äôm crazy but no one is acknowledging just how embarrassing it was for me and how truly crippling social anxiety is when you‚Äôre in front of a large audience while everyone is laughing at your failure.

I honestly want to kill my friends or myself at this point. Not actually but I‚Äôm just super pissed and disappointed and embarrassed. No one takes this serious but me and it‚Äôs annoying because everyone just brushes it off and actually shares it to others. 

It‚Äôs just even worse when my friend choked throughout the whole song and I basically had to do 80 percent of a song I barely knew ,  with my already raspy voice and my anxiety in general. It was just disaster. Pure disaster.

516,Told my grandmother about my anxiety,"I just wanna take a moment and share some good news. I'm a college student home for the holidays, and I began seeking treatment for my anxiety disorder while I was on campus. I didn't tell my parents because they never take any issue I have seriously and continually say I'm being dramatic or how my issue stresses them out and that I should stop. 
   A few days ago, my dad and I got into a huge argument over my hair. The argument ended with me feeling insulted and angry. I stormed off and called my grandmother to vent. As I was talking, I was getting angrier and angrier and it ended up inducing a panic attack. My whole body went numb and I kept telling my grandmother that I couldn't breathe in between gasping for air. When I calmed down, my grandmother said she doesn't like seeing me this upset and that she was worried about my health. After some back and forth about that, I decided to come clean about my disorder and my seeking therapy. I expected her to dismiss me like my parents, but surprisingly, she did the exact opposite. She said I shouldn't feel ashamed about it and that God answered her prayers by giving me the strength and knowledge to recognize the issue and get help for it (I'm not religious but the sentiment was really sweet). I couldn't stop crying out of sheer relief. It felt amazing to just say everything I was feeling without backlash. 

TL;DR: Family doesn't know about my anxiety disorder. An argument with my father triggered a panic attack in the middle of a phone conversation with my grandmother. I decided to tell my grandmother about my disorder and she was very accepting and supportive.",6,2017-12-26 07:07:05 EST-0500

522,Does your anxiety make it difficult/impossible to rationally see situations and nothing's just a little bad - it's always cataclymic,"Couldn't think how to title this. I've got other issues but I'm thinking this one may be tied to my anxiety/panic problems (or maybe it just exacerbates them?)

For example, I've noticed it most pointedly the past week while my cat's been sick. She's been to the doctor, I'm handling the practical stuff. But emotionally it's roller coaster. She seems to be feeling better (responding to meds and eating) and my mind's saying yeah, she's back. She seems a lil stiff and not eating as much as the previous days and my mind starts planning her funeral. (Rationally I can see she's not acting like a sick cat, you can tell when they're uncomfortable and have given up. Plus the vet hasn't done or said anything that seems like they think she's that sick. It's just my scared little mind that won't shut up and stop crying)

It's like anything (in general, not just currently with the cat), but any time something isn't perfect, it's the end of the world and I'm positive it'll never get better. So I seem to spend a lot of time worrying about how I'm gonna handle the worst-case scenario which my mind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows I've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. 

I'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? I've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so I'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because I deal with my issues/symptoms best when I understand better where they stem from.

523,I keep losing friends because I don‚Äôt have the confidence to maintain relationships.,[deleted],7,2017-12-23 18:52:05 EST-0500
524,Counseling was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made for myself.,"Counseling started out about my social anxiety, and led to me realizing my true potential as well as other problems in my life I was completely unaware of, such as the distance between me and my father. It also ultimately made me realize I don‚Äôt give myself enough credit for the things I‚Äôve done; like paying for college, paying rent/utilities, managing money, cooking, cleaning, car maintenance, etc. What makes me most proud of myself is making this decision early on in my life. I‚Äôm currently 21y/o, and I‚Äôll finish college with 2 degrees in a few years. I haven‚Äôt made any friends or acquaintances in 3 1/2 years of college, until recently after I received counseling for 10 months, and taking an anti-depressant (Zoloft). 

I have been out of a relationship (lasted for 1 year 7 months) for 4 years where I was mentally, emotionally, and psychologically abused and manipulated, lied to, cheated on. The relationship sucked my will power away, and completely got rid of all my social abilities; I had no idea how to talk to people I didn‚Äôt already know, and I sometimes didn‚Äôt know how to talk to people I did know, like my dad for instance. It also took away my ability to feel emotion. Six months ago, my grandmother was being rushed to the hospital for reasons I didn‚Äôt know of. I got a call from my sister crying her eyes out telling me about it, and hoping that grandma would be okay. After the call ended, I began crying not because of the situation my grandma was in, but because I didn‚Äôt feel worried, concerned, scared, sad, or feel anything for her; I cried because I felt no type of emotion about the fact that my grandma could die... She never wronged me, I was always happy whenever I saw her, and when I heard she‚Äôs being rushed to the hospital, I felt nothing... That depressed the he‚Äôll out of me. (Thankfully, she didn‚Äôt die, and is still very much alive!) The emotional numbness I developed in that relationship years ago was still hanging around, and I had no idea how to get rid of it. 

I had an addiction. Not to drugs or alcohol, but an addiction to thoughts. I was constantly rummaging in my head, thinking about how to be social: 
- I should say **‚Äùthis‚Äù**, but what if they say **‚Äùthat‚Äù** in response to **‚Äùthis‚Äù**? 
- What exact words should I say? 
- What phrases should I say? 
- What order should I speak them in? 
- Which way should I word the phrase?
- How do I approach them?
- How much eye contact should I make?
- What if what they start talking about goes against this long, thought out conversation I‚Äôve created in my head? 

This overthinking and compulsive thinking led to me altering my recollection of the past. I would talk to someone in my head about an event that may have happened between the two of us, and over time I would slowly alter the facts in my head so much that the truth about what happened was altered/falsified in my memory. While I was in my head so much, I changed the things in the past that I didn‚Äôt like.

I changed jobs every so often because working was a distraction from myself; it was a way for me to get outside of my head for a while. And when one job got so boring that I was in my head on the job, I went and found another job.

Rather than talking to people in the real world, I talked to them in my head. It occurred so much that, for example, studying a 3-page study guide took 8 hours because I would be reading aloud the study material, then start talking to someone in my head for an hour or so. And when taking the test or just doing anything else, I *sometimes* wasn‚Äôt able to remember specific information until I was talking to the specific person I was talking to when my brain I took in this information. **The most important thing I learned from this** is that out of all the people I talked to in my head, *I never talked to myself.* I told myself that I was talking to myself in my head, and that‚Äôs what I told other people, like my counselor. But I never actually did talk to me... I lived life after the relationship broken, and in despair because talking to people in my head was a way to numb the pain I felt; I never began the healing process until after a few months into counseling, 3 1/2 years after the relationship ended. Better late than never!

From my experience, I think the biggest thing to take away is that you need to find your voice. Find how you express yourself; find yourself. Express yourself TO yourself; voice yourself to yourself. Literally talk to yourself, your person. Talking to yourself will give you insight you had no idea existed:
- Alright *insert your name,* what‚Äôs going on with **blank?**
- How do feel about **blank**, *insert your name?*
- What‚Äôs holding you back?
- Are you doing anything to yourself that is holding yourself back from your full potential?
- How are you holding yourself back?
- What would make you stop holding yourself back?
- What are you scared of?
- What makes you sad?
- What makes you happy? Or...
- What *would* make you happy?

529,"After 26 years of suffering in silence, I decided to see a therapist. The appointment lasted 8 minutes...","Ok so about 12 weeks ago i finally went to the doctor about my mental health issues and he referred me to a therapist. 12 long weeks of waiting and I went today, well, it was very awkward when we went into the room and after a few questions she asked me why I was here and what's up, well I mentioned I suffered from GAD, social anxiety and depression, I also said that I believe i have MBS/TMS and that my right testicle and left elbow swell with stress and that's when things went worse, she said that's not a mental health issue and we won't discuss or treat it here.

My anxiety kicked in major here and I felt like the walls were collapsing in on me. I said, well if I treat my mental health issues, this might go away and she replied ""it's not a mental health issue. Do you want to continue or end the session?"". 

Well I wanted to continue but I felt like I was going to pass out so I stupidly said I'd leave it and I left like an idiot. 

I was in there for 8 minutes. It took me longer to park. Now i feel real dumb that I even messed my therapist session up. What the fuck...

Edit: I'm such‚Äã an idiot. It felt far to official for me, there was nothing relaxing about any of it. How any one can go these places to feel better is beyond me. I actually feel like killing my self over it. The worst bit is, I'm not even sure she was a therapist, she said when I went in that I won't see her again, she's just going to decide on treatment, being therapy or meds.

530,Does Anyone here suffer from 'Noise Anxiety'?,"Hi! I have anxiety about different things but one that is very strong for me is unwelcome noise.

I grew up in a very quiet neighborhood where I had no problems falling asleep as it was really quiet at night. At some point - can't pinpoint when or why, but about 14 - I became very sensitive to certain noise, especially at night. For example the noise of a saw or any construction noise would just drive me crazy. At night it was enough when I could hear faint buzzing of music or a TV at low volume. I am not able to sleep and become super anxious and agressive. If the noise does not stop I feel like I am about to explode. I will have to put earplugs in and do everything possible to not hear it anymore. Sometimes it's a cycle, because as I get more anxious I get more sensitive to noise and that makes me more anxious. Ideally I want to live somewhere very, very quiet and always be able to control what I hear.

However, I do not mind some other noises, even when they are very loud: storms, rain, trains driving by close, I don't care. I can fall asleep to that just fine.

It sounds so lame but noise from neighbours/outside has driven me into many a panic attack. Anyone else have this?",89,2017-03-15 22:52:42 EDT-0400

It's so odd and obviously very telling. As soon as I realize I'm doing it, I make a conscience effort to relax but I'd like to be able to stop altogether. Anyone else experience this and have any tips on not doing it?

I've also struggled with adhd all my life.  On top of that I'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low.  

Lately at work my anxiety has been getting worse.  I'm convinced that the people I work with think I'm a creepy loser and constantly talk about me behind my back and even text each other when I'm around.  I'll dwell on it for hours and get a feeling of a knot in my chest.  

I also have trouble in social situations.  I replay conversations in my head over and over again wondering if they found me strange.  Sometimes a memory of an embarrassing moment from years ago will just pop into my head and haunt me for a while.

I've seen a therapist 4 times now but I'm starting to think she isn't equipped to deal with my issues.  I think I may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach.  

I'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but I really don't know what to expect.  I'm so tired of my mind going nonstop all day.  I just want to stop obsessing over what people think of me.",8,2017-03-17 05:13:41 EDT-0400

My boyfriend, though he says he notices a big improvement, still finds my anxiety too much. Last night we were talking and he told me 'anxiety isn't an attractive quality. I wish you were more confident. You're going to get walked all over in life'. Today he broke up with me. 

I don't blame him for not wanting to be with someone like me, and I know that my anxiety has put him through a lot too. However, it doesn't help the pain I'm feeling. 

I don't know why I'm really posting this to be honest. I just needed to get this off my chest...

569,Anyone else here have terrible death anxiety?,"Or even existential anxiety for that matter? I hate the fact everything is going to come to an end one day, and as an atheist I will potentially never see my loved ones again. Not only does the concept of death scare the fuck out of me, but the process of dying. Knowingly fading into the abyss and leaving behind your one and only reality.

For a similar reason, I am terrified of the universe. As irrational as it sounds, I get extremely bad vertigo and panic if I look up into the sky or observe a picture of space. I'm deathly afraid something will wipe us out on a cosmic scale without us knowing. 

Hell, I'm even terrified of nature. It's very unforgiving. Predators brutally killing prey, natural disasters taking place as if we weren't meant to be here, just everything. People die horribly everyday. It's an unfortunate reality and nothing makes me depersonalize more than reminding myself that I'm a ton of chemical reactions!",29,2017-02-13 18:49:40 EST-0500

I got a few comments about how pale I looked and some people said ""wow, you're not wearing make-up!"" Yeah, no shit Sherlock! But anyways, I'm kinda feeling better about not wearing it.

572,As someone who doesn't suffer from Anxiety - reading what my girlfriend wrote has helped me understand more.,"**Depression.**

You don‚Äôt know what it is until you feel it pushing your shoulders to the ground. Walking feels aimless when all you‚Äôre trying to do is to keep your knees from giving in to the inevitable collapse. Just a few more steps, you‚Äôll say. Just a few more steps. Count to 10. Things seem simpler when you count to 10. Count again. 

**Anxiety.** 

It chases you wherever you go, tasing every thought that dares to enter your mind. Injects you with so much inner paranoia that even your own self-conscious becomes another voice you can‚Äôt trust. 

---
They often come hand in hand, and they create a classical symphony that sounds something along the lines of:

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this. You‚Äôre wasting your time. You‚Äôre wasting everyone‚Äôs time. You know you‚Äôre undeserving of everything you have; body mind and soul. All you ever do is cry. He‚Äôll leave you. Your mother will kick you out. Your dad is disappointed in you. Your baby sister is watching you, either setting herself up to follow in your miserable footsteps or reading you as the cautionary tale that you are. And you can‚Äôt even decide which one would be worse, now can you. You have no ambition. Nothing to get you out of bed in the morning. You‚Äôve failed at finding something to fail at. You‚Äôre alive. No one asked you if you wanted to be but here you are anyway, and now you‚Äôre left to deal with the shit that comes with it and no one understands, not your friends nor your parents your sisters your pets and all you ever do is cry, all you ever fucking do is weep. You're depressed about being depressed about being depressed about your crippling anxiety that kneads your soul from the inside out, from the outside in, from outside the walls of your barely-beating heart sending signals to your brain saying 'I need you to help me beat on', getting signals back saying 'I don‚Äôt care if you never beat again'‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Two peas in a fucking pod, those two. They play all day, tossing your sanity over your head from side to side. And I know you‚Äôre losing more and more of your energy with every passing day to jump up and catch it mid air.",4,2017-02-14 04:11:16 EST-0500
573,Does anyone get scared thinking about social situations with certain people,"I'm a 26 year old Asian male, quiet, enjoy my time in front of the computer, going to the gym, spending time with my girlfriend.

Have started seeing a therapist for my general anxiety (fears of failure, disappointment, embarassment) but have come to realise recently that I also get anxious at social situations, especially if I have to meet new people that are not necessarily 'my crowd'. A lot of the time this makes my crawl back into my shell because I'm scared of being judged. Due to this, I've been told that some people think I'm snobby and what not, which I definitely don't want to be.

When I do end up in social situations, I find it difficult conversing with other groups of people because a lot of the time I'll be quiet and somewhat uninterested in what they talk about (e.g. different sports or parties or just talking smack). I get scared if I get invited to these things and wind up not going because I think I'll just be awkward (A lot of the time I find it hard to keep eye contact because I'm shy and feel intimidated). After the salutations and introductions, I find it hard to talk about much. 

Often I'll go into panic mode and feel my heart rate shoot up just thinking about these situations without me actually being there. Does anyone else have a similar feeling? Should I try and find social groups that cater more to my personality? ",8,2017-02-12 07:29:14 EST-0500

Since I made the mistake of posting an image (included source) last week- which seemed to have received a lot of positive responses- It was deleted due to the posting rules. Below are the texts to an image I found a while ago, there was no specific source or reference for me to include, but I found it helpful

The text:

Tips to help with an anxiety attack:

1. Look around you
2. Find 5 things you can see
3. Find 4 things you can touch
4. Find 3 things you can hear
5. Find two things you can smell
6. And find one thing you can taste 

This is called grounding. It can help you when you feel like you have lost control of your surroundings.

I've lost jobs, homes, my physical health over and over again. I can't remember what it was like to not be mentally ill because I've been ill longer than well. And the work I do for myself has not just included getting myself out and about, it's about trying to create a voice in my head that is kind to me so that I don't just live in a world of hostile noise within my own skull.

There's a part of me now that sees those posts and thinks: That's not depression then, is it? If you can do something external that makes you feel better then you're just sad.

But I also think this makes me a bit of an arsehole because I am glad that people get better, and I have been told that my experience of chronic and enduring is different from most people's experiences because apparently for most people it is acute and episodic. So you know, I'm just bitter because I feel like I got the short straw. But I'm lucky in other ways so I might need to shut my face.

Also, there is hope of successful relationships.","I've suffered with bipolar disorder my entire life, but only began having major anxiety over the last two years. This is paralyzing anxiety. Full body tremors, inability to eat in public, decline of most personal relationships, poor work performance, etc. I have been dating my boyfriend for 3.5 years and he's never once judged me for being so unstable. He's caring, patient, and kind. 

Lately my anxiety is the worst it's ever been and my apartment had fallen into decline. I came home from work and my air conditioner wasn't working. Every time I tried to call my landlord I couldn't. The thought of someone coming into my ""sanctuary"" was too much. I was hysterical and just dealt with the heat. (I live in the south where it's currently in the high 80s temperature wide). A week had passed and I wouldn't let my boyfriend come over because it was so hot. On Thursday, it had been a week since my AC broke, I came home and my apartment was cool. I texted my boyfriend (the only other person with a key) and asked what happened. He taught himself to fix air conditioning units in 3 days, came over after work and fixed it before I got home. 

I was speechless. I cried for about an hour because I was so thankful. I've never had anyone be this understanding. I've never really had a healthy relationship before him. Just the fact that he would do this because he knew how I was suffering made me feel the best I have in months. I'm currently cleaning my apartment for the first time in months because I feel calmer than I have in a long time. 

Anyway, I just want to let you all know that our anxiety doesn't have to prevent us from finding love. They are few and far between, but there are people who will understand and lift you up rather than brush you off or think you're ""crazy"" for being anxious about every day things.

Over the last 4 months I've been dealing with some anxiety (which I have now come to realize I have always had, but never at this level). Anyway, most of the initial anxiety stemmed from health concerns - now that I've got a lot of tests done (I am seeing a cardiologist in a week and that will be the final test I do), I really do believe my symptoms are nothing but anxiety.

So that belief that I am okay has helped heaps...

But, it's weird...

There are days where I have very little (or even no anxiety at all), no sensations, no symptoms, etc...

And then the next day, I can end up feeling anxious even though there is nothing in my conscious mind / thoughts to warrant it. 

ie: The last few days have been really good / normal, then yesterday my heart was beating at a normal rate but I could feel each and every heart beat. And today I am feeling a bit on edge, but less so than yesterday, and I suspect tomorrow will be better, etc.

Does anyone else get this?

Days where it is really good, and days where you are anxious seemingly out of nowhere?

It's like the brain is running on  some sort of cycle or something. Like a circadian rhythm but an anxiety rhythm?

I'll often let emails sit in my inbox for days (or forever) because I'm just too scared to read them. Of course not replying to emails and calls is seen as rude and irresponsible, so people end up getting the wrong idea about me.

It's gotten better where I can go with my parents, girlfriend, and some friends but it still gets bad even with them on occasion.

I was the photographer for a Mercedes Benz AMG driving academy at a race track this week and my boss asked me if I wanted to do a ""hot lap."" A hot lap was actually riding shotgun for 3 whole laps around Lime Rock Park with a professional race car driver in the [Mercedes GTS AMG](http://i.imgur.com/9GjcuWv.jpg). I was anxious but I was not going to pass this opportunity up because of anxiety. 

And I did it! I went with an awesome instructor named Kevin and made it out without panic or anxiety! It was like being on a roller coaster and we hit 137mph on the front straight. It was probably the single handed best experience of my life, and I don't think I'll have much of a problem driving with people anymore haha

616,Turns out my Anxiety is more than just Anxiety,"Hi folks,

I've been following this subreddit for a while and I just want to say I finally went to get help. It's taken me 13 years to accept the idea of professional help.

I would have cyclical bouts of extreme Anxiety and Depression and I was just fed up of feeling like I'm crazy. I asked my doctor for a referral and he made it happen.

This week I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Anxiety and Depression are a HUGE part of it. I have NEVER felt so clear - my whole life suddenly makes sense. I'm happy o know what's up, because now I can get help and work on myself.

My point is that Anxiety and/or Depression can be a symptom of something else going on, whether it be mental illness or medical issues. I encourage each and every one of you experiencing symptoms (hell, you might not even realize that you're experiencing some) to reach out to your doctor or a professional.

You DON'T have to live in pain and suffering.",31,2017-08-27 23:03:11 EDT-0400

623,Does anyone else get dizziness and vertigo?,"I get racing thoughts, then feel almost like my sense of touch is affected. My mind begins to worry and I'll feel dizzy, nauseated. Sometimes this will persist for hours then go away naturally.

624,Feels like I'm doing horribly at everything while everyone else has it together,"Both in work and in life, that's one of the things I've always struggled with, personally. I find it nearly impossible to judge where I fall in relation to others. I regularly feel like I'm horribly unqualified for what I'm doing. If I write code, I feel like it's spaghetti. If I dance I feel like I'm committing treason against the very concept of music. If I cook I feel like I'm about to create something outlawed by the Geneva Conventions. Then I see someone else doing the job SO much worse, and rather than making me feel better it just confuses me. Am I supposed to be doing it that way?

Before the layoff, I was working on a team with someone that made me feel like that. People seem to hate them, they're constantly getting yelled at by the clients, all our co-workers dislike them, and every time I see their paperwork I have to correct or expand on half of it, but the supervisors are giving them excellence awards? I feel like I'm missing something but haven't the foggiest what it could be.

Can't accept that I'm doing okay because of how out of my depth I feel, but on paper I'm doing better than the person getting all the praise. Except I don't get praise, I just get 'very important' work quietly assigned to me and never mentioned again. Makes me crazy, because if I don't generally do a good job they wouldn't give me anything important, but if I do then why is this person who seemingly doesn't getting treated like the shining example of what everyone should do? Why did they make the cut and not me, when I'm topping the board in satisfaction, contributions to the team as a whole, numbers, and accuracy? What do other people know that I don't?",9,2017-08-24 11:44:26 EDT-0400

627,Sunday Anxiety,"Does anyone else get this, too? 

Every Sunday I wake up and feel anxious about so many things and it gets worse during the day.
""Oh, the weekend is almost over and you haven't used it to its full. You haven't enjoyed it as much as you should do. You didn't do as much as you wanted to. Oh, the week is over and I haven't done anything worthwhile. An new week is starting tomorrow, back to work and stressful life. There is so much you want to get done but you won't be able to""

628,I relapsed into an extremely severe panic attack today due to a customer at my job,"I'm a cashier. That's all I am. I can't control store policy. I kept telling myself this over and over. But this man's words were not what was making me fall apart.

He looked and sounded exactly like an older version of a man that did something... very bad... to me as a little girl. Like 10 years old.
And this old man wouldn't stop screaming about things that were out of my control.

I had to internalize the panic attack. My heart rate was through the roof I felt like I was gonna pass out. I'm a garden center cashier so I was trying to play it off as a sudden allergy attack so he wouldn't give me shit for starting to cry and looking so off.

I got screamed at.
And he blamed me for everything. Things that are store policy. I couldn't call a manager because if I tried to speak I'd become completely inaudible from sudden sobbing. I had to stand there and take it all as if I was okay with it.

So many stores require you to tell them if you have severe depression. They consider it a disability. They should be asking about PTSD and anxiety. I was alone outside. And if it wasn't for one saint of a customer who came up to the man and screamed at him for being such an asshole, I don't know what wouldve happened.

It is nearly 5 hours later. I'm home. And I still can't stop my heart rate from beating so fast and panicking.

I couldn't show anyone at work how broken and scared I was. I had to keep playing it off as allergies. I had to run to the bathroom saying it's my period suddenly showing up.
I had to chug water to try to keep me from suddenly outwardly panicking.

I had to internalize a panic attack from 3pm-7pm.
And now it's nearly 9. And it's all coming out.

I relapsed.
It's been a full year since my last severe panic attack. And now it's back.

I hate everything.

I'm sorry if this isn't supposed to be in this section of reddit. I needed to tell someone. You guys seem to be understanding I'm sorry ",60,2017-04-12 04:50:26 EDT-0400

630,does anyone have crippling anxiety just on the thought of having to study?,"I was always good in school, even went to a national competition in 8 th grade in biology. Went into a really good high school where in 2 nd grade my accumulated anxiety started to take away more than give, i stopped studying as much hoping that i would have more time to socialize and maybe try to get a girlfriend (boy were you wrong bruh). I got through high school with a fairly good grades so i was able to get into a good college. On second year of college i had a mental break down, rendering me useless. I feel like i'm learning how to live my life again. In this past 2 years i wasn't able to pass any exam or subject.First year i wasn't able to be physically near college. I simply can't study, not only i can't concentrate or find any motivation. I feel completely crazy, i'm lost and i don't know how to help myself. I did manage to study for an hour or two for number of times but it was really bad. With constant stopping and i couldn't focus, my thoughts wander off and i forget what i'm doing. Actually only thinking about studying makes me want to run away, most of the time i can't even start. I really like knowing things, i'm really curious but with all the grades, the teachers and other students, there's a lot of pressure there. It's too much for me. I know that in the end the thing that will help me is keeping at it and being patient and a bit stubborn but i can't see this happening. Why is it so hard when i actually like it. 

Feel free to say what ever you want, i like different opinions. It shows me that it's not all that bad as i see it. 

EDIT: Thanks to all of you who shared their thoughts with me, i'm really grateful and i can feel my will for trying and fighting rising. I wish you all the best in dealing with your problems too. Cheers!",38,2017-04-10 21:04:54 EDT-0400
631,I finally made friends and did things I never imagined myself doing!,"I've been at my new university for about 4 months now. Since the start, I've loved every single thing about it, all except for the fact that I had a hard time making friends. Finally, though, I went to a club meeting that is meant for pre-service teachers. I was hesitant to go at first, figuring that there was no use in going and that it would probably be lame anyways. I was so so wrong. I went yesterday and all the members were SO nice and passionate about teaching. They welcomed me and already considered me a member. They invited me to an event tonight and, at first, I didn't want to go. Again, I was hesitant, but I went anyways. I had a GREAT time. It was a Relay For Life event, since the club does mostly volunteer work. I met new people and even danced-- I never dance. Even at prom I didn't dance, I just stood on the dance floor like an idiot. But this time I danced with everyone and had an amazing time. I talked to people, which I don't usually do when going to new things like this. It takes me a while to warm up to people, but here I just felt so comfortable and eager to meet people. We all exchanged numbers and names, already making plans for the coming week. They were so nice and so welcoming, it was an amazing feeling and, though I am exhausted, I am so glad I went.",5,2017-04-08 11:36:21 EDT-0400

Does anyone else get extreme anxiety over death? Not just dying itself, but what comes after? Personally I would love to believe there's an afterlife but realistically I feel there is nothing. An endless void. Unaware of anything, never to exist again. And I find it so, so terrifying I go into a panic attack and cry.

I can ignore it most of the time but I can get triggered by films, TV shows, even ask Reddit questions. I think it's the nothingness that scares me, the fear of the unknown and never experiencing anything ever again. I'm so so scared. 
Can anyone give some advice over how to get over this, besides continuing to ignore it? ",73,2017-04-14 02:30:32 EDT-0400

640,How to forgive yourself for past mistakes? Even if those mistakes lasted for years?,"I have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that I have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that I have the right strategy to tackle it if I ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing it.

Most of the time when I make a mistake, I go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer self-criticism and I end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the process.

Sometimes I even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how I look at myself and affected how I work and how I think during my studies *(which is the worst becuase the education system have ""no mistake"" policy and have a ""pass or fail"" mentality and also the most important thing in my life for many years so it causes a lot of anxiety and fear in my life)*

644,"Please convince me not to Give up, i dont want to end it","A couple of you might remember my previous post. Things have gotten considerably worse since then. My anxiety has morphed into it's next greatest obsession: Hallucinations.

Then I think I actually did have one. I was sitting in the back seat of a car, and I saw a spot of dirt on the seat in front of me move. I had a panic attack as would be expected. I will not allow myself to fall into insanity because of this, and if it persists I will make plans to take my own life. 

My mother is tired of this shit, and I don't blame her. I don't fucking understand why I can't just use CBT like every other person and fix this. I'm costing my family 1000s of pounds in therapy that isn't fucking working and cancelled trips that I was too afraid to go on.

649,Hello World.,"Hello to everybody in this great community.

Today I made the first step in getting help and getting better and I have to say I feel a great weight off my shoulders.  I went to the Dr. today!

It was extremely difficult just to go and I was a wreck the whole time.  The nurse and Dr. were just the best very understanding the nurse even got me an ice pack I was sweating so bad.  I explained to the Dr. that my anxiety has been getting progressively worse the last few months, I've always had social anxiety but been able to muscle through it, but I haven't been able to go to the grocery store or any big store for months and I had a panic attack yesterday while training a new employee at work.  I got half way through the training and I just had to go I couldn't control it.  I talked to my parents and made an appointment for the Dr.  I've been dreading since I made the call.  

Its been a few hours since I left the Dr. and I'm still a little shaky but I'm feeling very positive.  My parents are incredibly supportive and loving and I can't express my appreciation.  They are not very stoked that I was prescribed meds, but I'm optimistic that the meds will be a more or less short term solution.  I did talk to the Dr. about therapy and I will be getting a hold of a therapist shortly. 

The Dr. prescribed me Paroxetine 10mg to take daily and Lorazepam 0.5mg to take when I have panic attacks.  I'm going to start meditation and yoga today and work on it everyday.   I've already taken my dog out for a walk today and it felt good.  

If anyone is struggling with getting the courage to get help I completely understand.  I tried to go by myself and I couldn't I had to have my mom come with me and that helped sooooo much.  Heck just thinking about the appointment give me anxiety.  But its over I did!  I'm so proud of myself :D and I know anyone in similar situation will feel much better after.  If you need to talk to someone I'm here or you can pm me :D 

Thank you all for reading and being such a supportive community to each other.      

Btw I'm 29 M and I kept singing this song in my head while waiting for the Dr.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM

The waiting is sooo hard!

654,I put in my two weeks notice,"Today in a fit of anxiety, I put in my two weeks notice for a decent job.

It doesn't pay much, but the staff are so kind and the atmosphere (while very boring) is so warm and welcoming. 

I did this because I am not catching on to the job very well. I'm extremely bored there, but a few other associates were doing all of these tasks, tasks I didn't even notice needed done, and I was just pittering around straightening up. It was at this moment that I realized I am exactly what I hate, someone not pulling their own weight. 

They could tell something was bothering me, and so I let off a bit of steam. I told them I was disappointed in myself for not acclimating very well. They were extremely comforting and consoling.

A bit of back story, I feel I am a coward. I've lived a very lonely life, but a very nurtured life as well. my co-workers are all women. 

Part of me resents this. I am the way I am because I never had a driving force in my life. A tell-it-like-it-is sort of voice to get me off my candy ass and handle business. If I stay at this job, I feel like this will keep happening, and I will never become the man I need to be. I am too soft. 


But then I want to stay. They are legit cool to work with. I did feel a bit left out as well in that instance, because they were all working together while I was off by myself. That was hard to digest. My entire life has been that way. 

I told my boss I didn't think I was meshing very well with the team or the atmosphere. She said she wished I would stay, and that I did a great job anyway. I completely disagree, and I don't know how to handle her kind words.


And so I come home, tail between my legs, feeling defeated.  I just don't know what to do about anything. I am so lost. ",1,2017-07-01 03:17:40 EDT-0400
655,Do I just enjoy people pitying me?,"Hey all,

So, until recently, I never dealt with any sort of anxiety. Like, I‚Äôve always been a bit of a worrywart, but never so bad I felt it was negatively impacting my life.

But, over the last year or so, something‚Äôs changed. Personally, I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trapped in a toxic environment with no real way out, and everyone‚Äôs always fighting with one another, which gives me a lot of stress because I have to work from home so I‚Äôm always there.

Anyway, I have two major things. First off, I‚Äôve been suffering from really bad mood swings. Like, I only ever really feel sort excited and impulsive or absolutely exhausted. And when I‚Äôm in either of these moods, I can‚Äôt shake them no matter what. They just stay as long as they want, and while at first it wasn‚Äôt really a problem, I‚Äôm starting to experience those lows more and more. Like, sometimes I‚Äôll have days where I‚Äôm all excited to work and do stuff and then the smallest thing will happen‚Äîsometimes even just a stray thought from my past‚Äîand I lose all energy, and instead of working, I just crawl back into bed and beat myself up and tell myself how bad I am and stuff like that.

Secondly, I‚Äôve got a major fear of pissing people off. I don‚Äôt really understand this one, but basically, I‚Äôve become everyone‚Äôs punching bag because I‚Äôm so scared to say no and I‚Äôm so easily guilted into doing other people‚Äôs work or stuff like that. My mind can‚Äôt fathom somebody being upset with me over a prolonged period of time because I jump to all these insane conclusions about how they‚Äôre going to hurt me, or hurt my family, or just something crazy like that. I get so many headaches just trying to think through my day and pick apart everything everyone said to me just to make sure I didn‚Äôt upset anyone.

Anyway, my main point of this post isn‚Äôt to ask for a diagnosis‚ÄîI know I need a doctor or something for that. I just want to know if any anybody has some advice because at this point, I‚Äôm getting a little scared to talk to my best friend about it. Like, he‚Äôs always been there for me, but whenever I have sort of a freakout moment(which at this point feels like once or twice a day) I quickly send him a couple messages freaking out or something like that and, unless they‚Äôre really serious, he‚Äôs starting just ignoring them. Also, I don't *feel* like it was this bad until I sort of stepped back and realized I needed help, so I‚Äôm worried that maybe I don‚Äôt have these problems, and maybe I just enjoy being pitied because for some reason sending a message to him feels so good, and sort of bumps me up a little bit even if the next couple minutes are spent freaking out about whether he‚Äôs gonna stop speaking to me or not.

So uh, yeah. Just any advice until I can get to the doctors would be very much appreciated. Also, how do I restrain myself from venting and just deal with this stuff by myself? I don‚Äôt want to burden anybody. Thanks.",0,2017-07-01 02:11:37 EDT-0400
656,Challenging Anxiety,"Yesterday, I challenged my anxiety in the biggest way I ever have. I've been going to group therapy DBT for treatment of BPD, depression and anxiety and that was already one of the most difficult things I've ever done, but I've kept up with it and been doing my best using my coping mechanisms. I've got a long way to go and I'm still pretty low, but I'm doing much better than I ever was and I'm grateful for that.

Sometimes it's extremely difficult to leave the house or do just about anything due to the different ways the anxiety manifests, other days it barely bothers me (it tends to fluctuate with the mood swings of BPD). In regards to going out and doing stuff, sometimes I'll feel comfortable and 100% okay and safe and out of nowhere start to majorly panic and be consumed by anxiety and then need a break from social interaction or have to leave immediately, which is embarrassing. Usually though, I can have my anxiety under decent enough control so long as I have my partner with me, as he is my anchor and soothes me. If I need to leave, he gets me out of there, and as a result of this I've become extremely dependent on him. I appreciate his unconditional love and support, but I realize there are times I will have to do things on my own. I want to be that strong. 

Yesterday, I took my first step alone. I've always wanted to be a part of activism, so I went to the first meeting for an organization I'm interested in all by myself because my partner had work.On the way there, I had a panic attack and I also had another in the bathroom. I was incredibly ready to leave but I did breathing exercises and gave myself a pep talk before gritting my teeth and going into the selected meeting room. 

The entire time I was on edge, my insides were screaming and I felt like I was going to explode... But it was still nice. It was terrifying, but the people were very loving, kind and all around good people that shared my level of empathy and interests. Afterwards on the ride home, I panicked again and started to drown in bad thoughts of how stupid, awkward and weird I was and how they must've all hated me... I started feeling overwhelmed with the desire to self harm and suicidal thoughts, and my mom is bad with mental health so she just kinda ignored it and offered an ""it's okay"". But then those people reached out to me for no reason at all, expressed that they loved I was there, that they had been happy to have me and looked forward to working with me in the future. 

I realized then... I challenged my anxiety. And though it was only a small step forward, I won that battle. It was fighting against me harder than anything, but I still went. I may have been shaking, but I talked, laughed and smiled. I did it all by myself, and gave my mental illness the big middle finger. Of course I cried to my partner later that night and he soothed me and comforted me (especially when I had another freak out because they posted what I considered an ugly picture of me) but I still did it. I made new friends, and now I'm going to be a part of something I've always wanted to do. 

I'm so scared right now, and my anxiety is hitting me pretty hard. It's kinda pitiful, but I know I need a few days to recharge. But I challenged it. I fought it with hope, love and desire for my own happiness. Maybe right now all I'm capable of is therapy, working on commissions from home, crying and obsessing all day, and taking itty bitty steps to challenge my mental illnesses. But I still did something I wanted to do for years, and used my new coping skills to fight off the evil thoughts afterwards and didn't resort to self harm. I may not have won the war just yet, but I won the battle. 

And I want you all to know that you can do it too. ",6,2017-07-01 02:59:49 EDT-0400
657,Jobs & agoraphobia,"I posted this in r/agoraphobia earlier but haven't gotten any feedback so I was hoping I might be able to get a little advice on a more active board....

Agoraphobia started ruining my life in March. I had been working 2 jobs since November and started getting really flaky with both of them throughout March & April before quitting one in the beginning of May. Since then I've gotten really good at going to work everyday and staying my whole shift, which im proud of but its only about 30 hours a week and a little above minimum wage so I don't see it as a long term ""career"" and it's obviously not that great of a paycheck. Going back to school is not realistic for me but I'd love to work in a nursing home as a cna or have a receptionist job or just something that's more challenging and better paying than my current retail job. Has anyone successfully gotten a new job despite having agoraphobia? How did you handle the filling out an app, interview, training and what not anxiety on top of agoraphobic anxiety? Thanks for reading & I appreciate any suggestions!",3,2017-07-01 02:06:42 EDT-0400

659,Don't know where I'm headed...,"I've been high anxiety lately because of home issues, but I've also been feeling like I'm going to burn out at work. I'm a technician on a very demanding unit. I work three 12+ hour shifts per week. I've been okay with this for the most part, but I'm starting to feel like it's too much for me. My work is emotionally and mentally taxing. Also very physically demanding, but I don't mind that.

Here's where I'm mostly stressed about: I've been on a road to acquire a Bachelor of Nursing for the last couple of years. Working with nurses for the last year and a half, I'm not sure this is for me. I think I would burn out quickly and it would be a constant emotional battle. I would like to remain working in healthcare, possibly as a therapist.

What is making me anxious, is I'm 28 years old and I feel like I should have this done by now. I feel I've dilly-dallied all this time and I'm too old to want to become something now. In order to be a Psychologist I need a PhD or a PsyD, both which will take another 8-10 years of schooling. I want to start a family here in the next couple of years, however I can't help but feel as though it's not fair to do that when I'm still figuring out my life.

Realistically I know people go to school with children all the time. I know that people older than me start over. I expected myself to have shit figured out by now, and I don't.

Any words of wisdom or encouragement? Have any experiences to share?

Any input is appreciated!",2,2017-07-01 03:56:53 EDT-0400

661,Psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft... Anxiety is currently worse and I have a weird side effect,"I have PTSD with my primary problem being severe anxiety. My psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft a month and a week ago. I started on 25mg and she upped it to 50mg a week ago. The first time around, it was rough, my stomach was upset, I was nauseous, and my anxiety subsided briefly, but came back after a little while. The side effects did subside after a week or so. 

Since my dose has been doubled, I have had my migraines return, I feel sick all the time, and I'm overall not adjusting well. I want to brave out the storm to see if this dosage will work, but man I am so ill. 

One of the strange things I've had occur is earworms. I have one out of  handful of songs constantly stuck in my head, but it's one or two lines and it's extremely stressful and anxiety inducing. I've never had a problem like this before. I can consciously stop briefly by focusing really hard, screaming in my head, or making actual noise. It comes right back, and is stronger when I am alone. Do any of you have a strategy to combat this? ",4,2017-07-01 01:36:15 EDT-0400

663,Anxiety symptoms,"Hi all, first time posting. I'm curious as to what others' anxiety symptoms are, and whether or not you've ever experienced a change in your symptoms over the course of your experience with anxiety.

I feel like my symptoms have changed over the years (I am 24, and my anxiety disorder/OCD was diagnosed in high school). A few years ago when I was graduating college I experienced vague migraines that went away once I graduated. This year I am starting a new job, last summer I moved a few states away from home to attend graduate school, and am generally doing well, but inside I feel like a total mess. I'm having a lot of swaying/dizzy spells that feel as if I'm on a boat that is in rough waters. Also experiencing a lot of shortness of breath/feelings of suffocation/throat closing feelings. 

I have really debilitating health anxiety coupled with OCD (making it almost impossible to not obsess over anything I deem to be ""amiss"") so I always assume I'm dying because the symptoms of my anxiety seem to have evolved over the years (with a few mainstays such as constant hyperventilation/not being able to take a satisfying breath, heart fluttering, general feelings of wanting to jump out of my skin.) 

Anyway, was curious as to others' experiences and looking for a little validation as well haha.

I start thinking it'll be in HIS best interest not to have me around because why would he want me around to pick dumb arguments. 

I worry for what feels like days that I'm not good enough for him, all because of one stupid remark I may have made. I'm not sure if this is normal. But I do know I want it to stop, because he can only love me as much as I love myself. But when he gets angry so quickly, I have a hard time accepting myself through his eyes.

666,"19F, Had my first really bad panic attack now I'm constantly scared of having another","So, I'm new here and I have no idea if I did this right or wrong, but I feel like I need to reach out for some advice.

Let me preface this by saying that I've always been a relatively anxious person. I have had the palpitations and burning feeling in my chest before.

A few days ago, I had a really bad panic attack. I had spent 20 hours over the past 2 days watching series, neglecting sleep and eating. I had been feeling some anxiety before because of an argument I had with my boyfriend (I always get very anxious whenever I think someone is upset at me). I  am used to it though - my chest just feels heavy and my body feels numb.

However something else that had never happened to me before happened along with this. I was sitting in the shower crying, going over all the times I've made people mad at me in relationships - next thing I know it feels like a switch flipped in my head and I'm running out of the shower, I can't control my thoughts and I can barely breathe. My vision starts to go wobbly, and then everything around me seems unfamiliar and I don't recognize my parents. THAT freaked me out, losing my cognitive functions is like my greatest fear and I thought I was developing schizophrenia. I calmed down eventually, but I've been having trouble falling asleep and my appetite just returned today.

I don't know what to make of it. I'm trying to find the right thought process to recover. I went to the doctor yesterday and he said I'm fine, I just need to normalize my eating and sleeping habits. (I work from home so I'm a law unto myself and because of this I was sleeping 11 hours out of the day, and barely eating.)

Since it happened though, I keep evaluating all my thoughts to see if I'm going crazy, or I'm thinking anything that will trigger the same thing that happened that night. I also get anxious now whenever I don't feel 100%, like when I'm hungry or tired. Also, losing consciousness to fall asleep gives me anxiety as well. I want to be okay, but a part of me feels like this is the beginning of a decline. 

I don't want my anxiety to conquer me, I want to conquer it! But like my doctor said, there is no quick fix and I have to put in the work. 

I'd just like tips and maybe reassurance that I'm not on the brink of schizophrenia. My boyfriend is clueless about anxiety (he's the analytical type, and can't really understand what I mean when I explain my anxious thoughts to him. He has expressed his desire to learn though.)

What do I do? ",3,2017-07-01 02:59:13 EDT-0400

A couple weeks later, I was diagnosed with major depression, and along with that came every one of its symptoms.

Academically, this has been the hardest semester thusfar. I'm on track to get a C on my transcript for the first time ever, which is a major disappointment to me.

I have two jobs and both of them have put me under major stress. One is brand new and has been stressful in that respect. The other is an older job where I feel obligated to keep up a certain level of over the top job performance.

All of my friends and my long distance SO have been having major life events and have been less able to support me through this time, which has been really hard.

I want nothing more to drop out and go home and do nothing forever. Realistically, I know no one is disappointed in me but me, but I'm just so upset and having such a hard time that it feels like everyone else is disappointed to.

I just need some words of encouragement. I feel awful.

After I hung up I immediately broke down crying in the corner of my bed and my boyfriend told me how proud of me he was and that he'd be happy to go with me to my first appointment and wait for me. 

Hopefully this can be some inspiration to anyone else with a similar issue. You can do it, I believe in you. ",34,2017-04-07 16:54:07 EDT-0400
705,This morning I got anxiety about not having anxiety.,FML,28,2017-04-04 19:33:51 EDT-0400
706,"Do you ever apologize profusely? I say ""sorry"" so much that it's basically the only word I know.","It started about 8 years ago when I was 11. I had two friends who bullied me, so I just started saying sorry all the time. I used to get reprimanded for it when I was in a police explorers group; the detective who led it yelled at me for saying it so often. Of course, I ended up holding my tongue and just shied away from the rest of the group. When I started working my first part-time job, everyone made sure to note when I apologized profusely because I felt like I messed up. At school: the same. But only my favorite teacher never made fun of me, she just reassured me that there was no reason to apologize.

I'm in college now, studying to be a Spanish teacher. I want to break this habit, but it has progressed so much. When I say sorry, I really do mean it because I feel as though I've screwed up somehow, but I understand it can sound repetitive and insincere to others. I don't want to be annoying, but I honestly can't help it. I apologize for, what others say, the stupidest and smallest of things. If I don't know how to do something I'll apologize for not having the knowledge in whatever it was. On days where I feel really bad and more aware of myself, I just don't speak.

I want to work towards being more professional and not so anxious all the time. The medication I've taken for the past 2 1/2 years has helped tremendously with my anxiety, but now that I've gotten this far, I want to break old habits. What can I do?",25,2017-04-02 03:13:59 EDT-0400

709,"DAE is afraid of classes, work, or places you KNOW you ""should stay""? Do anyone else feel anxious during class, skip them, etc? I need help.","Background: I am a 20 year old female. I fucked up my high school years because of agoraphobia and anxiety. Classes were a nightmare to me, but I managed to graduate in 2014 regardless (with a very low attendance level). I spent the following years struggling to improve my education and getting a treatment that helped me a lot. In fact, this year I was just admitted to an excellent university, my dream program.

Now that my first semester at uni started, I am scared shitless. I have been skipping some classes (not as much as I was in school, but still) simply because sometimes I feel SO FUCKING ANXIOUS during classes. My mind thinks about so many things at once. ""What if I leave class, everybody will notice"", ""what if I have a panic attack here"", ""what if I faint"", and so on. And the fact that I know I have to stay there fucks up my anxiety even more. I just wish I had a trick or two to control those intrusive/negative thoughts, that are product of a mixture of agoraphobia, fear of bodily sensations and maybe social phobia. 

I don't plan on skipping classes anymore, I am planning on going tomorrow, warrior mode, and planning to face everything, no matter how hard it will be. I can still save my semester. I just wish things weren't so hard. 

Side note: I'm already on CBT and psychiatric treatment, which to be fair, helped me a lot. My therapist says my classroom anxiety will drop the more I expose myself (and she said this wouldn't happen overnight), but damn. Sometimes it is just so difficult.",20,2017-04-02 15:33:36 EDT-0400

711,my wife tried to commit suicide last night!,"I got home from my therapist last night and wife told me she had taken 24- 200mg seroquels. I called the squad and she was taken to a local ER where they intubated her and got her stable. She is now awaiting transport to a psych unit.
I understand this is needed and also that while she is in their care she is being well taken care of. However as my therapist has told me she is my drug and I feel so alone and lost without her. I am trying hard to keep it together for my kids and I am aware of some coping mechanisms that I learned about earlier this year when her and I were both hospitalized.
I'm not sure how I feel at the moment, I feel a little numb to be honest but also so conflicted in my emotions. I've worked out and my frustration helped me set a new personal best on the dead lift, but nothing is bringing me joy.
I don't feel as if I will do anything silly but I am glad that we have no firearms in the house. 

edit: Update: She is still awaiting transport at this time last I heard. Thanks all for the support and the great ideas on how to help my wife, myself and my family during this time. u/kev753 I like the idea of a letter, I will definitely do that. It helped when her and I exchanged letters when we both in the hospital last time. Different units obviously but the nurses and pca's were very cool and allowed us to pass notes. Also her parents are not helpful at all during these times. They feel as if they have done their time trying to understand her illness (bipolar1.) So there is no longer a need for them to be bothered when she is in the hospital for a mental problem; because according to her mother it is all just in her head.
u/snugglyaggron I will gladly take valuable insight wherever I get it; even if it's from random strangers on the internet.
One other note for now; while I have had my moments this evening with crying and all that that jazz, I have also been trying to ""detach."" THe book ""co-dependent no more,"" by Melody Beattie has been really helpful and insightful in that regards. I will update as I hear more. Thanks again all it does mean a lot to me.

edit: update II; I jut got back from seeing her at the psych unit. It brought back a lot of memories; because I was there myself in January. She was really wanting to get a shower and get cleaned up; which I take as a good sign. She signed some paperwork that stated she agreed to stay 7-10 days. I am not sure how concrete those days are; especially since she is really wanting to do a group therapy step down program. Her parents are being asshats about the matter still, and she was upset that they were acting that way, and I get that it's tough when you do have the support of those who seem closest to you. u/iliketosmellmypoop you are 100% correct that there is almost no talk about mental illness, and it is really pissing me off too. I am now at the point where if someone asks how thing sare going I am going to be up front and tell them how my wife is doing, and what is going on; because FUCK THE STIGMA!
Thanks all for the love and support; I will continue to update as I can.

edit: update III for those still following. She was in better spirits when I left her this evening. She feels as if this was a call for help and that she is glad she got a ""reboot;"" now she wants to focus on not only getting herself better but also the things our family needs to do move on. Again I thank you all for the outpouring of love and support. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think we can see a break through the trees.

edit: update IV She is still in the hospital and when she asked about being released all she was told was this week. I have had multiple breakdowns over this whole situation over the weekend, but I haven't checked out yet. I know that will only solve the problem for me. She has had a couple of her meds changed and she was finally started on an anti depressant today. I know I am blessed that she didn't succeed in her attempt; however my heart aches for my wife. 

Edit V: if anyone is still interested in this thread or not. I'm editing because I'm happy. Both of us spent the past few days guarded 'ly' optimistic. However she is coming home tomorrow morning. Just have to wait until I get a call to go pick her up. I am aware we both have a lot of work to do on ourselves and also in our marriage.  Thanks everyone for the love and support during this time.

715,"I am a physician with anxiety, here is my story","Emergency Room Physician (M.D.) here, wanted to tell my story. Just to let you all you guys know, this shit can affect anyone, and you can still be successful in life.

Started in high school, I would say this was an existential crisis that started my anxiety. Did not know what it was(anxiety that is), initially saw a social worker, she referred me to a PhD psychologist who diagnosed me with OCD, I saw a psychiatrist in the same office who gave me clonazepam as needed (which worked). I had tried Lexapro. 1 dose, increased my anxiety 100x, decided to not go ahead with it. I essentially thought I had OCD, my psychologist taught me CBT ways where increasing my exposure to things that bothered me and made me anxious would in the long run make me not anxious.  This existential crisis/anxiety/OCD spilled over into freshman year of college and then I became focused on 1 goal - getting into medical school. Anxiety kinda disappeared (I mean, I am sure I still had it being a neurotic type A personality, but it wasn't an every day all day for no reason type of anxiety like I had had).

Well the day came, I got into medical school. Starting medical school that anxiety came back, for a few weeks. New city, new people, new environment, new work load, more stress.  This also eventually tapered off on its own.

Then residency hit, anxiety came back in full force. In residency training I was working 60-80 hours a week. Constantly switching from days to nights. Getting yelled at and called ""dumb"" by senior attending faculty physicians for not working up a patient right, this or that. The intensity and stress (over 300K of med school debt) caused one of my worst periods of anxiety to date. I seeked help, finally getting a psychiatrist (hadn't seen one in years) and after only a session or maybe 2 diagnosed me with GAD.  I had no idea.  We also did some CBT although it was different than the CBT/exposure/response therapy I had done for OCD.  In the end, it was too much and I ended up on Zoloft.  Like my prior episode with lexapro, I took a dose and the medication shot my anxiety to the roof. I ended up on a slow taper up eventually getting to 100 mg and for the remainder of residency my anxiety was on the backburner/gone.

We decided that maybe I could try getting off the med, and I tapered over a few months with no side effects. Sure enough though, the anxiety came back (essentially night shifts and switching back to days doesn't help anxiety).  I now am working my way back up.

So anyway, thats my story. I made it through all that training with GAD, at times terrible, crippling anxiety.  I say this for those of you struggling in classes or with careers, if I somehow did it, you can too.

If any of you guys have any questions for me (like how do I treat anxious people that I see in the ER?) or other questions feel free to ask!

716,I think Magnesium saved my life,"Started taking Magnesium 500mg per day 2 weeks ago after doing a bit of research. my anxiety  is now like 10 percent of what it was before. 

Before I started taking this supplement, I couldn't drive. I couldn't go the store without feeling anxious, needing a way out, looking for the nearest escape route, Traffic? Forget about it. Fearing everything, impending doom. I literally could not drive less than a mile to the corner store without my blood pressure and heart rate skyrocketing. My life was a constant state of fear. Just... anxiety all the time. Daily full blown panic attacks. I still have lots of anxiety issues, but the big ones are gone. I can go to the store now. It's impossible to put into words how amazing it feels to be able to drive again, to go to the store, in general, just doing shit on my own without constant worry and *anxiety*",37,2017-04-02 04:21:55 EDT-0400
717,Anxiety over sleep. How do you cope?,"This morning I write to you with zero sleep. I went to bed knowing I had to get up earlier than usual for an appointment, and I made note of the time I should be in bed. It wasn't really any earlier than usual only about a 30min difference. 

So I get in bed like any other night. I am lying there and notice it's taking me a tad longer than usual to get to dream land. Looking up at my clock I realize about a half hour had passed, so I mentally subtract the amount from my 8 hours. Now I begin to feel worried about not being able to sleep, and you know the rest of the story.

I gave up at around 2am, and I got up for the day feeling absolutely furious with myself. Now that I had that sleepless night the worry will happen AGAIN tonight. I'm afraid I will continue to have sleep issues for a long while :(

721,How do you guys deal with anxiety poops? Nothing is working for me.,"My anxiety is under control for the most part. I was on medication years ago but not any more. I have some mild generalized anxiety but it only really flares when I'm dealing with stressful situations like a lot of deadlines.

Over the last few years I've started having bad anxiety-related bathroom issues when I'm in social situations. I *like* going out but I hate when it does to my body. I never had this when I was younger. 

At first I only sometimes got the poops/constant need to pee when I went to clubs and shows, I just thought it was from alcohol - but then I realized it happens when i don't drink too. It's got much worse since, now it's to the point that I have to pee every 15-20 minutes when I go out, even when I'm sober. I usually get mild diarrhea too, but sometimes it's REALLY bad. There have been nights when I'm literally in the bathroom (and actually going every time) every 10 minutes. I'll get a solid 5 minutes of relief before my insides are spasming again. At parties I can barely stand because I constantly feel like I have to pee. When I'm stressed out at work, this leaks over to my home life and I sometimes have to get up 2-3 times at night to use the bathroom, and sex is difficult because I constantly feel like I need to pee.

I became very aware of it last week when I was trying to buy tickets to a show I knew was going to sell out right away, I was really stressed/nervous about getting them and - I had to run to the bathroom to poop THREE times in the HOUR before they went on sale. 

**Here's the thing though**, pepto and imodium seem to do nothing. If I go out for a night with friends, there have been times I've eaten 6-8 pepto tablets and still have to use the bathroom constantly. One night not long ago I had 3-4 imodium pills and I was still in the bathroom actually pooping every 10 minutes for the first 2 hours, we went out the next night too and I had another 2-3 pills and it was better but I still used the bathroom probably 6 times in 4 hours.

It seems unhealthy to be downing like 6 Imodiums before I go out for a night (once every ~2 months) but I don't know what else to do.

728,For people with anxiety who drink and smoke weed,"* Firstly I want to state any advice I might be giving on how I overcame this is not aimed at people who can enjoy a joint or a drink every now and then. I don't mean to sound absolute with some of my statements, it's just in relation to the hole I was in.

I smoked weed for 7 years (started at 16), daily for 6. I slowly started drinking more and more alongside it until it was 4-5 beers and 2 grams of weed daily.

I've had anxiety since about 12. Bad depression, suicidal thinking, isolation gradually got worse from 18. By 22 (last year), life was so shit. It was unbarable. Over the 3 years before I'd had failed relationships, unemployment, family problems, intense isolation (weed and drinks on my own in a little shed watching videos off my phone - 8 hours a day sometimes).

I'm a prime example of using my anxiety as an excuse to abuse substances and avoid social situations and self improvement. I could have convinced you back then that I'm all good, just sorting through things. I have remarkable people skills when I apply them (did sales for 2 years), but I wasn't interested in anything other than getting fucked up and living in a realty where ""this is my life for now . . ."".


Almost decided to live in my car, live with a crack head, travel the country (aka: begin my homeless life, cause I really had no money and if I did it would've gone to beer). I was losing my mind.

After being heavily suicidal for a week I decided I can't live like this anymore - but I don't want to die right now.

I planted a thought in my head. 'if you ever want to overcome this, you need to begin to change'. I envisioned the person I wanted to be; even if I wasn't unequipped to be so at the time.

**It took me one year** of very gradual changes to get to where I am now. One week sober. I closed up the shed, changed from bongs to joints and sat outside my house on a chair. The joints got bigger and bigger but a least I was only drinking 2-3 beers a day. 

I implemented hobbies back into my life. Didn't spend a lot of time on them, but just 5-10 mins was a start. I joined a gym, some weeks I went once or twice, sometime I didn't go for a month. I reached out to old friends, sometime we didn't catch up until a couple weeks, sometimes we were both busy at different times, but I saw peoples faces and her their voices - after too long of seeing the same-old and only connecting with people through weed or alcohol (or other).

Had to work so hard to **prepare myself** to change my ways. It didn't take weeks or months. It took a whole year - 52 weeks of ups and downs, but a commitment to improving myself. It was difficult. It didn't feel like anything was different mentally until toward the end. I saw psych's, drs, counselors and was so optimistic they would help me change myself until I realized I already knew what to do. I decided I can channel all my anxiety into self improvement.

Bought a huge whiteboard, and everyday woke up I had these chores to do. Idea's, reminders, quotes. Things just kept coming to mind. Things to fix/buy/take for a walk/hobbies to look into. I was still a depressed, anxious, alcoholic-stoner - but instead of watching tv, playing games, watching life slip away - I felt like I was on to something.

I never expected the benefits from cutting down and quitting. Every department of my life is better. I had to force change. It took me a year because change made me more anxious.  **I've been sober for a week and the change is awesome!** I laugh, I stay active, I speak clearly, I look people in the eye, I get things done as I want to get them done - immediately. Living a different reality.

If anyone here is being controlled by these substances I just want to remind you that they are holding you back. These coping mechanisms are making you doubt yourself and not allowing you to progress - not allowing you to know yourself without them.
 

I've heard every excuse in the book against self-improvement. Don't gratify your situation. Don't gratify your anxiety. It's a little runt that wants you to believe you can't change and will never be happy enough anyway. Lower your pride to allow for change. Take control of your life. Learn to love yourself again (you deserve to).   Life will welcome you back with open arms.",65,2017-05-24 19:40:19 EDT-0400
729,Does checking E-mails make you anxious?,"TL;DR Got over anxiety socially, however recently checking E-mails has made me nervous. This weekend I took off (I'm the CEO trying to be more efficient) & didn't check my E-mail Friday, so I knew I'd be in for a surprise Monday. I have a tendency to get sucked into notifications (even if but a text) and want to know how I can over-come this to not be worried, and more importantly not get sucked into responding to everything. 

Hey guys, I used to have a tiny bit of shyness & anxiety when I was younger. I'm 19 now, and had forced myself to go out quite a bit (meet women, talk, etc.) and I found that my anxiety all but went away (socially)! 

I got an injury though & have been stuck at home for a few months, going out is VERY limited. I kind of let it take me over (I have anxiety around injuries) and hid inside, afraid of getting a set-back (which ironically set me back). Anyways, thought I should share that because it might explain why...:

I went to check my E-mail this morning. I run my own business, and there was just something this morning about checking my E-mail where I was SO SCARED to check it! I had 3 Skype messages, and about 10 E-mails (8 of which were useless). I saw the notifications and had that ""ping"" in my chest like I was gonna die.. 

I'm wondering if maybe it's because I haven't been going out. So, in my isolation, the body is naturally becoming anxious again. I might have to force myself to go out even through my physical pain because oh my gosh was checking my E-mail probably the hardest thing today... I can run a multi-national business from home, yet checking what needs to be done today was too scary. I don't understand lol.

So guys & girls- does checking notifications make you anxious? I find that when I get ""down"" it creates this loop where I'm anxious to check, but I am also addicted to checking (and getting sucked in to whatever it is). It's like I can't leave one notification un-responded. Maybe that's why I was so anxious... this was the first weekend (and Friday) that I didn't check my E-mail AT ALL, so I knew a couple messages would be waiting. ",32,2017-05-22 20:48:16 EDT-0400

734,I built an online therapy journal for getting things off your chest,"I've been managing anxiety for most of my life. 

About 10 years ago, I found that writing in a journal helped me sort out my thoughts, decompress, and get things off my chest that are stressing me out. I always feel a little bit lighter after I journal.

I've spent the last 2+ years building an online therapy journal called KindMind. I use it pretty-much every day, usually twice a day, so you know it's good¬Æ Thought friends at r/anxiety might find it useful:

I started a new job recently and I am not doing so great. Or maybe I am and I just havent learned enough. Its a job requiring speed and I am not that fast yet. I am always worried people are discussing my performance. Or talking behind my back in general. Im worried I wont be able to get up to par fast enough. I really need this job.

I am worried Im constantly dying. Every glitch in my body is a signal of cancer. Everytime I get slightly sick its cancer.

I wake up in a sweat from dreaming of anxiety. I sleep 10 to 12 hours a day simply because I dont want to be awake, and have to face these feelings. They haunt me regardless.

I find rarely find peace. Ocasionally after work Im able to ground myself and enjoy a few hobbies. Today is bad, though. Im typing this on my lunch and I couldnt even be bothered eating. I just want to drink the world's entire water supply and fall asleep.

I need some sort of reassurance that this will pass. That I will get use to the job. That Ill work past all this health anxiety

I have a CS education and worked as a software developer. Obviously there are enough jobs I could apply for with this education. Even becoming a freelancer could be an option.

But I'm too anxious. I need someone who constantly tells me I'm doing fine or w/e or I feel very uncomfortable because I think I'm doing everything wrong / everyone dislikes me because I'm a lazy douche. 

During my last job I tried really hard to be *normal*. But I could tell myself all day long I'm doing fine it didn't help. Lost the job basically because of my *weird* behavior.

I mean I know that I can't ask for a job where everyone is nice to me and tells me that I'm doing fine.

755,I did it. I said no.,"I haven't posted here before here goes.

I suffer from anxiety. I am a people pleaser and do not say no to people, and do not speak up when something is wrong. I'm terrified to. 
My neighbour takes advantage of this. She takes advantage of everyone who will let her and unfortunately she ended up living beside me. I have lent her money, given her food (I have a family to feed), I have lent her every movie I own, given her milk and sugar countless times, plunged her toilet, helped her set up her internet and cable, listened to her cry about whatever's bothering her today. She used to make up wild stories all the time about people watching her from my back yard and wouldn't stop when I said there's nobody there. I put up a motion light FFS.

Good lord why have I done all this? I'm not even her friend. Wow I'm a chump.

Anyway. She just called me and asked me to get her smokes and she could pay me back tomorrow. I said ""I'm sorry, I can't"". She asked if I didn't trust her and I said that wasn't it at all, that I just have to start saying no to people. ""Not just you, my sister as well as others"". She gave me her usual sob story and ""I don't know what I'm going to do"" etc etc and she sounded pretty choked. 
I once said no to her before. She came over for the *third* night in a row to say that someone stole her outside lightbulb and needed my husband to put in a new one. We had company over and were literally sitting down to eat, food on plates already. I said ""no, sorry, he can't, we have company..."" ""Oh but I need it to watch..."" She starts getting upset and I said ""even if I asked him he's going to say no as we are literally just sitting down to eat"" ""well I don't know what I'm going to do"" ""sorry"" then she gets all snobby as if to say ""thanks for nothing"". What a shitty person. She acts so sweet so though.

As I type this all out I feel outraged. I've always known it's been bullshit, and generally I'm not the one to put up with shit, but I can't say it to someone's face. Because I fear conflict so bad, I guess. I get major panic attacks if there's a bad conflict and I'm even near it.
I have a psych appt. tomorrow so I guess I'll bring this up (again).

I'm feeling pretty proud that I said no, though! Now to just say no the next hundred times she calls or knocks. :)

My free time consists of sitting down, standing up, pacing, eating, mindlessly and fruitlessly browsing the internet, attempting small tasks or activities without success, etc.

Then I feel guilty for wasting time and spiral into the depths of anxiety.

I end up incapable of even deciding what to attempt focusing on. I can't figure out what to think about. That's when the hopeless discomfort really kicks in.

It's as if I just can't casually relax. I become trapped in a mental cage that prevents productive thought or activity. Healthy, interesting thoughts form in my mind during these bouts, but I can never progress them. They're immediately quelled by a dominating feeling of unease.

I've been like this for years. Not 100% of the time, but a decent enough chunk to impact my well-being.

I have hobbies and interests that provide relief at times, but recently the wasted hours have been plaguing my mind more and more.

I have goals, too. I suppose I should decide firmly what to do with my time and stick to that schedule?

I‚Äôm sort of at a loss as to what to do. I feel as if I‚Äôm wasting my life. Any ideas or tips on how to stop falling into this pit?

I'm an anxiety sufferer for a really long time now, however, I don't claim for it to be no where near as serious as what some of you have. All anxiety is terrible, but mine is weak compared to what I've read.. and that fact alone gives me so much respect for each and every single one of you guys. 

Anyway, a week or so a go, I was reading a thread on this sub-reddit and saw someone repeat a technique their therapist taught them to calm them self down. The technique (from memory) went like this:

Look at 5 things
Touch 4 things 
Hear 3 things 
Smell 2 things, and
Taste 1 thing

I've battle tested it and it works amazingly for me. I guess it adds more dimension to just mindfulness. Give it a go and see how it works out. I really do hope it serves some help!

771,How can my boyfriend love me?,"A little background: We are both mid 20s and live together. I suffer from anxiety and depression, which only showed up about a year and a half into our relationship. To say the very least, it has caused a strain on both of our lives and our relationship.

I have thoughts about being unlovable. Not worth it. That he's going to leave me, cheat on me, etc. I constantly wonder if he's falling out of love with me. Asking him ""Do you still love me?"" doesn't work because it annoys him and him getting annoyed/impatient makes me feel even MORE insecure.

This is the man I want to be with for the rest of my life. And please know, this is only MY perspective. Please don't tell me he's unsupportive or that I should be with someone else or be alone. He's doing his best, he just doesn't know how to help me. 

So how can I help him help me? If I tell him exactly what I want to hear, and he repeats it back to me, it loses it's meaning and doesn't make me feel better. Are there resources for someone who has a SO with anxiety/depression? 

I need constant reassurance that he loves me and wants to be with me. I'm a ""words of affirmation"" type of girl and he just doesn't see the need to say the same thing more than once. But like I said, I need constant reassurance. I know it's not fair to him. I know I'm annoying. 

Is there a way we can meet in the middle? So that I'm getting the love/reassurance I need but he doesn't feel like he's constantly catering to my anxiety? Because I don't want him to feel that way, and I'm worried that's what is happening. ",18,2017-05-21 08:43:06 EDT-0400

I am super thankful that I have to be at work very early in the mornings or I would spend all morning thinking, ""four hours till work, three hours, two, half an hour,"" . 
But on my days off, when I wake up in the morning, my mind immediately starts spinning with all the things I need to get done that day and, ""have I forgotten anything? Will I be able to get to the post office and back in time for that appointment? Should I write this down so I don't forget? But what if because I write it down, I take too much time and won't be able to go to the grocery store as well?"" 

And on top of that, there is a layer of guilt, ""Is this a good use of my time? Is this the best use of my money? Am I being productive enough? Am I doing enough for my boyfriend as well? Am I spending too much time inside? Am I exercising enough? Am I spending too much time online? Am I talking to my family enough? Do people think of me as inconsiderate?"" 

And then, of course, there's the looming feeling of, my weekend is slowly drawing to a close, the clock is ticking and in 24 hours I'll be getting up for work, twelve hours, six hours, am I going to get enough sleep, five hours, and then, the cycle starts over. I don't even dislike my job, it is very fast-paced and sometimes stressful with difficult social interactions (hotel front desk), but overall it's enjoyable. I just feel like the time that I have to myself isn't really MY time because it's consumed by all of these horrible feelings of anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, if anyone has any tips on what I can do to ease this, it would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy yoga & sometimes meditation, and I have a feeling that they would help a lot, but lately they keep falling into the ""not a good enough use of my time"" category. I feel like I used to have so much more time! It seems impossible that days are still 24 hours long. 

Any advice is much appreciated, PMs too. Thank you. I hope you are feeling fine <3 ",58,2017-10-10 20:47:00 EDT-0400
776,My anxiety makes me irrationally hate everyone in public spaces. How can I stop feeling so mad?,"I‚Äôm a university student who lives at home. To get to university I have to get a bus into the city centre, walk to the train station and then get the train to university.  I go to university most days so this journey ruins my mood almost everyday.

The thing is, I understand that most people get angry by slow walkers, people who get off an escalator and then come to a sudden stop right at the bottom, people who decide to count out pennies at the checkout etc. but these things make me extremely, irrationally angry. I‚Äôm guessing this is down to my anxiety but the way people act in public makes me so much more angry than it should. I mean angry to the point where I‚Äôm clenching my fists or biting my fingers really hard to let out the frustration. Even things like people laughing too loud on the train cause this internal rage. 

I know I‚Äôm making myself sound like such a dick but I don‚Äôt understand why people in public make me this angry. It gets to the point where by the time I get home I am in such a foul mood. I‚Äôve tried just relaxing but I honestly feel like I can‚Äôt.

I live in Birmingham, UK and the centre is always busy and, for example, there are a lot of tourists who will just abruptly stop and take pictures in busy areas. I get that tourists want to take pictures but at the same time I‚Äôm getting this automatic physical feeling of rage. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm battling between my conscious thought of ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt that much of a big deal and you shouldn‚Äôt be angry‚Äù and the automatic response of pure rage. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I just want to get home and people like this are hindering that.

I know this post seems so pathetic and all over the place but I just don‚Äôt understand why these little things are enough to put me in such a bad mood. Has anyone else experienced this and have any idea about how I can stop feeling like this? ",50,2017-10-12 19:34:41 EDT-0400

Sometimes I stay up as long as I can on the night before and then sleep until noon the next day, just so I can avoid the day. I hate being alone and overthinking, I get so so anxious and depressed, so wasting my day sleeping seems like the best option.

791,Anyone else had anxiety since very young age?,"I swear I‚Äôve had crippling anxiety since I was 4 or 5 years old. I can clearly remember constantly worrying about my parents every single day. if one of them was 5 minutes later than usual I would immediately worry and convince myself that they‚Äôd died in a car crash or some tragic accident. I was especially attached to my mom, and I would have panic attack-like episodes of intense crying and shaking when she was at work late. I would also have bad anxiety about my health, would often convince myself that I was gonna suddenly die of some sort of disease, which is something a 5 yr old definitely shouldn‚Äôt be worried about. 
I also was super shy and pretty much didn‚Äôt talk to anyone at school apart from this one girl who was my best friend up until recently. I would sit with her at the swings on the playground, at the exact same swing in the exact same spot every day for three years because I was terrified of change. I was so shy that I wouldn‚Äôt even say more than a few words even to family members like aunts, uncles and grandparents. The only people I interacted normally with were my parents and my one friend. 
I didn‚Äôt get formally diagnosed with anxiety until I was 13. I‚Äôm 17 now and still the same anxious person, although I‚Äôve definitely  gotten better. I think anxiety is just a part of my personality that I was born with, since I had it at such a young age. Also should add that I really had no trauma in my childhood; I have a good life in general. I really just think I was born with anxiety. 
Can anyone else relate to this?

792,[DAE] Feel like you have to prove that your Anxiety is a problem?,"No one really even questions me, but I have such a hard time believing that my generalized anxiety disorder is real. I also don't know if other people would even believe I have it. Or that it exists at all.

**So when I realize that my symptoms are really there, or have someone else point it out to me, I feel so much better.** Like if I can treat the anxiety then maybe I could be so much better off someday. My mom confirmed that she knew I had anxiety even when I was super little. It made me feel so good to know it was real even back then.

As a kiddo I was always worried about accidentally lying (i.e. saying I would be at gymnastics, and then some unforeseeable event would happen and I wouldn't be), had tummy aches during school all the time, cried to the point of hyperventilation often, was triggered by scary or disturbing movies or news, was ""worried"" about so many little things. It wasn't normal for a little five year old to be thinking about stuff like that, and that's nice to know.

I'm still struggling with anxiety as a 25 year old, but it looks different now. It's teeth grinding, heart palpitations, digestion issues, occasional hyperventilation and crying, intrusive thoughts, ears ringing, rumination, etc. Even when I have good days, it doesn't disprove that I have GAD.

Regardless, I am who I am, and I love who I am. Even if I have GAD I am still going to live my life and use that knowledge to live my life even better.

Does anyone else struggle to accept or believe their diagnosis and feel like you have to prove it is real?

I remember crying in middle school after getting a C on a math test, because I knew I was gonna have a rough time when I got home.  So essentially, I conditioned myself to fear bad grades.  I would stress myself over exams, essays, projects etc...that my immune system would tank and I would frequently get sick.

Ever since graduating I've struggled with jobs.  I feel like I'm constantly trapped and being judged, which leads to problems focusing and concentrating on work.  I have no idea what career or field even suits me.

798,"TIL that deep breathing can make anxiety worse for some people. It decreases the CO2 levels in the same way as hyperventilating does. which has many nasty effects, including anxiety.","All info is from this article: http://www.rbphd.com/Docs/breathingretraining.htm

Sometimes deep breathing is not appropriate for someone with certain kinds of anxiety.

I have had symptoms of air hunger for about 5 years now, and i just learnt that it's an actual thing. It's a symptom of overbreathing. No one in my life has talked about it. Air hunger is the sensation of being unable to take a satisfying breath no matter how deep you breath. It's caused by not having enough CO2 in your blood which is caused by hyperventilating (overbreathing). But also from breathing too deeply. (Also overbreathing) I have essentially forgotten how to breathe normally. I have to think of how i breath all the time. Otherwise i breath way too fast and shallow. Or i forget to breath then take a huge breath to compensate. All while feeling really anxious. The crazy thing about hyperventilating is that its caused by anxiety or stress, but hyperventilating also causes MORE anxiety. 

Before i knew what air hunger was i followed general anxiety deep breathing excercises, but they didn't feel right, they made me feel worse. They explained why that is in the article i linked. It's essentially that breathing too deep can have the same effect as hyperventilating. They explain everything from why it happens and what happens in the body and also how to do breathing excercises that works for this kind of anxiety. I really recommend reading it. If you find that your anxiety is because of overbreathing then deep breathing excercises are not for you. ",17,2017-10-13 01:43:34 EDT-0400
799,Does anybody else avoid speaking to friends because you worry that they might not reply because they secretly hate you?,"I'm so frustrated with myself. I know I'm being irrational but I can't help the way I feel.

In a few days my university classes are going to start again and I was unsure about a few things regarding the timetable. Anyway, the obvious solution would lie in asking people who take the same classes, right?

I had to force myself to text into a group chat with people that I'm friendly and never had a problem with. They're all nice and helpful. But since there were no classes, I didn't see them for a while.

 So when I attempted to text, I kept asking myself, 'what if they hate you, what if they only pretended to like you and they're annoyed by your questions, what if they don't reply and you're being too needy' etc.

Logically, I know that these worries make no sense because these people have never done anything to indicate that they might feel this way about me. So, like usually, I bullied (motivated?) myself  into texting anyway. 

When they didn't text back immidiately (which, hello, is totally understandable because they're not available 24/7) I kept working myself up.

I'm so done with myself because, in my head, I know these worries are senseless and that I'm being ridiculous, but I still can't help myself.

This problem extends into other parts of my life. I'd have to be in an extremely dire situation to ask for help from anyone, even from my best friends. I'm always worrying that I'm being a bother and that I'll be dumped for being too needy.

813,How I Learned To Make My Anxiety More Livable In One Year (And Nearly Eliminate Panic Attacks),"You're going about your day and you start to notice a feeling of being just a little bit on edge. It starts somewhere inside your head. Maybe you feel a little bit of tension building in your chest or your face. 

You try to ignore it, but think you know what's happening. Then your heart starts beating faster as you realize what it is. 

Breathing becomes a chore and you're panting for air before you know it. Breathing like a marathon runner, but it still feels like you're not getting enough air. 

Another panic attack. 

Last year I was having them about twice a day. Even when the panic attacks calmed for a while, there was still an underlying feeling of always being on edge.  I just couldn't relax.

It got to the point where I was afraid to go outside. I barely left the house for months (except to go to work). I was afraid I'd have another panic attack in the car or at the grocery store.

It was miserable and terrifying. 

You don't have to constantly suffer without help if you have persistent anxiety that's making life miserable. 

Eventually I couldn't deal with it on my own anymore. Through some research and helpful therapists, I was able to find some ways to get my anxiety to a livable level. 

There are dozens of ways to deal with anxiety, but these are a few that worked for me.  They may or may not work for you, but give them a try and see how it goes.

--Get Support From A Professional--

After being in a constant state of panic for months, I decided enough was enough.  I found a mental health organization in my city and asked them if I could come in to talk about what was going on. 

I realized that a sick brain probably couldn't fix itself. I needed help from someone who could look at my life from outside of my sickness and see what was going on. 

This is the number one thing I could recommend to someone suffering from anxiety (or may other things). 

I still remember the relief, like 100lbs went off my back, when my therapist said: ""You're going to be okay,"" after months of being afraid I was going crazy. 

Don't be too proud to ask for help. It's the smart thing to do. And if money is an issue, there are many organizations that provide quality mental health care for people on a low income. That's what I had to do, so I know it's out there.

--Get All The Junk And Bad Habits Out Of Your Life--

I don't care what it is: Excessive driving, smoking, too much caffeine, internet addictions, people that always bring you down. 

Whatever it is, do everything you can to get it out of your life. 

Our brains our affected by what we put into them and the environments we put ourselves into. There are no exceptions. 

You might not be able to get things perfect, but set yourself up to be a little more healthy every day. Within 3 . . . 6 . . . 12 months, you'll be amazed at how much better you feel.

--You Don't Have To Be Pushed Around By Your Thoughts--

Thoughts are just thoughts - not necessarily reality. 

Our bodies and minds are fundamentally connected. What we do to our mind affects our body.  What we do to our body affects our mind. 

Mindfulness meditation, visualization techniques, EDMR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), isochronic beats. All of these techniques help the brain  stabilize itself to a more peaceful state. 

I won't get into them here (you'll have to do your own research), but believe me, they help. 

Need an easy way to get started? 

Breathe in 4 seconds.
Hold it.
Breath out 4 seconds.
Repeat two more times. 

Feel better? Do that every time you start to feel anxiety come on. It works. 

--Dump The Emotional Garbage--

Holding onto resentment, anger, unforgiveness, bitterness, entitlement, and all those other negative emotions is poison for your brain. 

It doesn't matter whose fault it is -- you have to let that garbage go.  

I've seen people literally go crazy feeling sorry for themselves and being angry at people in their lives who have hurt them. 

Yeah, it sucks. Especially when it wasn't your fault.  But you have to let it go. 

If you don't know where to start, simply say to yourself: ""I surrender the right to this (anger, resentment, etc.)"" every  time you feel it come on. It might take a couple months to really let it go, but keep practicing this. 

--Get Some Sunlight--

There's something healing about being outside and moving around. Maybe it's because, thousands of years ago, we were basically nomadic and constantly moving around for our survival. 

There's something healthy and healing about the simple act of moving. 

You don't have to go run a marathon or go to the gym four times a week.  Just go outside and walk around the block for twenty minutes.  It'll clear your head and your thoughts. 

--Get Your Life Together--

When we don't know what we're living for every day and why, it's no wonder we're anxious all the time. 

Take a few hours and decide for yourself where you want your life to go, who you want to be, and the people you want to be around. 

A couple great places to start:

The late Scott Dinsmore put together the Live Your Legend website (Google it) to help people get some direction, passion, and purpose in their lives. 

Read Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl (on Amazon). He wrote this book while he was a prisoner at an Auschwitz concentration camp. He was eventually put into leadership at a mental health hospital because so many of their patients were killing themselves. After Frankl came in and used his methodology, not a single person committed suicide under his care.

And after you get a rough idea of who you want to be and where you want to go -- start saying ""no"" (say it ALOT) to anything that doesn't get you there.

--Get Out Of Isolation--

Isolation destroys the brain. People are social creatures and without a healthy community of friends and family, we just start getting weird in our thoughts. 

Anxiety, paranoia, depression -- these can all come about when we don't spend enough time with others. 

It's hard to have a good community these days. Many experts have called this one of the loneliest generations in American history.

But you still have to take the initiative and get out there.

Call up old friends (if they're healthy people to be around), go to a cafe, find an interesting group on Meetup.com, go to church.  Do whatever you have to do to get outside and around other people.

That alone will take 100lbs off your head.

--Be Thankful --

Gratitude, even during hard times, will exercise your positivity muscle in your brain. 

Once a day, write down a few things you're thankful for and why. 

After you've worked through the more obvious things (e.g. family, friends, etc.), try to practice a more difficult form of gratitude: creative gratitude. 

What is creative gratitude? Being thankful for things that suck.

Here's an example I came up with in my own life recently: 

Many things have changed in my life over the last 5-6 years. A lot of things or people that used to give me stability are no longer there or no longer work for me. I was depressed for a long time about it. 

Eventually I realized that it's healthy for me to change and for life to change. It means I'm alive - because only dead things don't change and grow. 

I was eventually able to say to myself: ""Thank you for this opportunity to rewrite my life into anything I want it to be.""

--Brain-Dump Everything--

Studies have shown that people who write about their negative experiences, even just fifteen minutes a day for five days, have a noticeable increase in their ability to come with hard times.

Go to a Dollar Store and get a cheap notebook. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Write down everything that comes to mind about your situation. At the end of the week, see how you feel. I bet you'll feel at least a little weight off of your shoulders.

--Four Things You Can Do Every Day To Make Your Life 3,7000% Better Within A Year--

There are four areas everyone needs to be healthy in to live a good life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. If you improve in those areas just 1% everyday, your life will be 3,700% better within one year.

I did this myself when I was feeling terrible.  Within just two weeks of practicing these ideas daily, I was feeling noticeable better.

I won't write them all out, but Google ""How to be the luckiest guy in the world"" by James Altucher to get the full story (it works). 

You might feel pretty hopeless right now. But if you ask for help, do some research, and take some initiative (ultimately, no one can fix this but you), you can live a much better life in a few short months, and a totally transformed life in a couple short years.

Everything in my head seems well thought out, until it comes out of my mouth and it sounds like garage. I don't have knowledge about a lot of things I think I should have knowledge about. I've bullshitted through basically everything my entire life. 

Some things I say don't make sense. I forget ALL THE TIME. My friends and family have to repeat certain things to me constantly because i have a hard time remembering a lot of things. Much of anything I'm told goes through one ear and out the other, because there's so much going on inside my head, I can't keep track of what someone is saying to me + what I want to say/respond with. I find myself confused a lot but I play it off like I'm not and just go with most things without really understanding and knowing what I'm going with.

They needed twelve volunteers, and despite every urge in my body screaming for me not to, I raised my hand!  

When it was nearing my turn my entire body was shaking.  I was breathing rapidly to try and calm down.  And my part came closer, and closer, and closer until finally...

it came.  And I spoke my lines.

And it went great!  I spoke for about ten minutes, just interacting with the other people in the play.  And I read clearly, fluently, I even caused the people watching to laugh at the right moments!

He kept me on the ground, talked to me like I was an actual person, brushed my hair out of my face when I said I was hot, held my hand, talked to my wife on my cell phone which I dropped some yards back.

821,Finally decided to start taking Lexapro; wish me luck!,"After a decade of dealing with crippling anxiety, three years of a panic disorder, and half a year of agoraphobia, I decided to finally start taking the Lexapro prescription my doctor prescribed as backup if other treatments didn't work (tried beta blockers for symptoms and saw a therapist, both helped a bit but not enough). I had been putting off taking it for months but after two awful panic attacks in the span of just a couple days, months of increasing depression, and becoming more and more non-functional, I took half of my dose just now for the first time (my prescription is for 10mg but I'm going to cut them in half for the first week or two).

I get super nervous about medications and I'm terrified that I will have even worse panic attacks, lose my personality or sex drive, become incredibly nauseous/sick, and all other sorts of horrible side effects. I took a xanax with this first dose so that I don't absolutely freak out.

If anyone has tips or success stories with staring an SSRI, I'd really like to hear them! Please don't respond if you have anything negative to say about them--trust me, I have read all sorts of horror stories but right now am just looking for something positive to keep me from completely panicking.

*UPDATE* Thank you everyone so so much for all the responses! I can no longer keep up with replying but I am still reading all of them. I'm feeling a lot more optimistic of this! As of right now, I'm actually feeling really good for once. Probably the placebo effect from knowing that I'm finally treating this.

823,Does anxiety stop anyone from watching new shows/movies?,"I'm 23M.

I'd like to watch more shows, movies, documentaries but I always get a bad feeling in my gut before I can.

It's happened since I can remember but it takes a lot of convincing to get me to watch a show or movie and even then I'll only watch comedies.

I never realized it could be because of my anxiety until I really tried to watch shows like shamless or any kind of movie. I would enjoy the first episode or first part of the movie but I just don't see the point in committing to a new program.

I watch the same comedy shows everyday, usually I go between always sunny, workaholics, trailer park boys, the office, arrested development, community etc. All very funny shows.

Are these show repeats that are keeping me happy actually making my anxiety worse?",18,2017-04-19 16:59:45 EDT-0400

Now you lack the skills to socialize and have an identity crisis. This is how I feel. Even after treatment and pills I still feel lost. I feel like a shell of a person. A blank slate. Someone who pretends to like what other people like for the moment in order to fit in. Creating some sort of pseudo personality from bits and pieces of others' personalities just to get by.

827,Doctor said to have children when I asked for help with my debilitating anxiety.,"Update: filed a complaint with my insurance. The representative agreed this was wrong. It‚Äôs going to the review board. 
Update 2: I have switched my PCP from this sludge bucket to a woman doctor with glowing reviews on ZocDoc. I will meet her Saturday and hopefully get proper care and see what to do about my anxiety. 

Update 3: thank you everyone for your genuine support. I found a better PCP but will see them later on and instead concentrate on seeing a therapist - psychiatrist path. My insurance is working on my complaint. 

Update 4: love my therapist! 

I‚Äôm a woman. Let‚Äôs start there. I‚Äôm in my mid 30s. 

I went to my doctor to get started on the path for anxiety treatment. I suffer almost every day from anxiety and it‚Äôs been like this a long time. I‚Äôve finally taken the courage to realize I need help and so wanted a referral. 

The doctor barely looks at my chart. He didn‚Äôt even ask why I felt anxious. He asked me what I want to do. I told him I want to see a psychologist. He asked if I want meds. I told him no. He told me both those things won‚Äôt help. I should seek help from family or church. I told him I don‚Äôt see those sources as being helpful. To which he went into telling me to have children. It will give me purpose in life. I was shocked. I told him that doesn‚Äôt seem like the right medical thing to do for this. 

But he took it upon himself to give me a lecture about women, biology, genetics, evolution, and how the opioid crisis is due to men not having children and real jobs. He told me that women are so stressed these days because they work too much. He said that in the old days they were even more stressed - why? Because they didn‚Äôt have washing machines. He went on and on about how women should be having children and so should men. Some crazy biological link to all this. Nothing really about how exactly it helps anxiety. 

I was livid! He knew nothing about me and nothing about my situation to even have children. It made no sense and felt like a violation of my right to even choose to have children. Plus he wasn‚Äôt really medically doing his job. He just spouted his agenda. I got the referral and I told him I will never come back there. 

I can‚Äôt imagine someone closer to the edge of despair with anxiety and seeing this guy. I‚Äôm now shaken by this event which is causing me to feel anxious. As a women I have to say to other women - do not take this shit! Also - really?! - having children cures anxiety. Omg. ",211,2017-11-02 05:26:10 EDT-0400

830,Zoloft changed my life.,"I want to share my experience with Zoloft, in hope that it may help some of you who are on the fence about taking medication. 

I've had generalized anxiety throughout my entire life and have seen a therapist in the past. There have been 3 points of my life where my anxiety was the worst, with the most recent one being May/June of 2017 at work. 

I was struggling at work, struggling to manage my workload and was constantly feeling overwhelmed. In May, I was told I had to give a presentation in front of the entire company, by myself, my biggest fear. After that news was delivered, I didn't sleep for an entire month, and was constantly worrying and freaking out about the day where I would have to deliver the presentation. My anxiety had become so severe that I was having panic attacks when I came into the office in the morning and I regularly contemplated quitting my job and leaving it all. My work and personal life suffered, and my anxiety consumed me. 

I knew I needed to do something about the way I was feeling because my anxiety combined with the insomnia was actually making me go insane. 

I decided to see a psychiatrist who put me on 50mg of Zoloft. She had me start at 12.5mg for 3 days, then 25mg for 3 more days, until I finally worked up to my current dosage, 50mg. 

The first 2 weeks were a little difficult. I still couldn't sleep and I would get diarrhea whenever my dosage increased. But i distinctly remember over 4th of July weekend, which was about 2 weeks after I started the medication, I started feeling like my old, happy, smilegirl55443 self again.

Something in me shifted, I can't explain what it is. I've been on the medication for about 4 months now, and I'm the happiest and most successful I've ever been, in both my work life and personal life.

Some positive life changes I've made in the past 4 months:

* Made a core group of new friends who I really connect with on a deep level
* Switched to a plant-based diet
* Fell in love with my job and initiated a re-org at my company, which led to my position morphing into my current dream job
* Read books on personal growth and strengthened the relationships in my life
* Started loving myself again
* Started sleeping like a baby again
* Learned to take criticism without becoming upset - I now think of it as a positive thing and a way to improve myself in a new way

I hope my story helps anyone who is thinking about trying medication. I too was at rock bottom, desperate to try anything to feel normal again. Medication has different side effects for everyone, and this is only my experience, it may be different for you.

I hope this post helps someone who is feeling the way I was a few months ago.

831,getting rid of social media has helped,"i haven't been using any social media accounts for the past 3 or 4 days, and i've noticed my anxiety has definitely lessened. i find it easier to talk to strangers now, i have less trouble making eye contact, i can fall asleep without my heart rate sky rocketing. it's just a weight off my shoulders not having to witness every single aspect of other people's lives, and it helps me focus on my own and get more shit done. this obviously won't work for everyone, but i have hope that this'll be a huge help for myself and for others.

She doesnt beat me on the regular just when ive really annoyed her which makes me hesitant to tell anyone. 
Today I told my grandma what she did and she completely took my mums side saying ""sometimes a slap helps you snap out of it"" I couldnt be more angry as this entire conversation arose because they were talking about how to deal with my little sisters anxiety which is apparently all my fault. yeah the double standards when being a middle child are great...

835,"Holy Shit. Is this what Anxiety feels like? Guys, I'm so sorry.","Bit of a backstory. I‚Äôm a 30 year-old male who has never had a history of anxiety. Sure, I‚Äôd get stressed on occasion but I always knew how to cope when I did. In fact, I‚Äôd go as far as to say I was almost too laid back. Nothing ever really phased me. My attitude to life was ‚Äúif you can change it, make a change. If not, just smile and laugh and accept whatever life is throwing your way‚Äù.

That all changed 3 months ago. My god, did it change.

Back in August, life was going fine. Great girlfriend, great job, happy and on top of the world. Had a bit of a stressful week that week with a combination of work, etc., but nothing worse than I‚Äôve experienced before. By the end of that week, everything was resolved and nothing major was going on. I went out for a couple drinks that night. Went home, then went to bed.

The next day, I woke up and my body felt like it had slept through a fucking war zone. My body was coursing with adrenaline, I felt tense all over and a tightness in my chest that I had never experienced. That tightness intermittently switched between a moderate and severe tightness to a moderate and somewhat severe sharp pain, localised around my heart. As soon as I woke up and realised that feeling wasn‚Äôt fading, I got myself to the hospital (having grown up learning that chest pains in a young, relatively healthy male = bad). My breath felt shallow, my face and hands were tingling all over, my body hurt. It was pure, unadulterated hell.

I went to the hospital and was seen almost right away. I explained my symptoms and they did a battery of tests (blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, etc.)They kept asking me if I‚Äôd taken any drugs but I assured them the only vice I had put in my body the night before was alcohol. After a few hours and no relief, I came back with a clean bill of health. I was told that it would eventually subside and to just wait it out. If things didn‚Äôt get better, then to come back the next day.

I went home, in debilitating pain and discomfort, and forced myself to sleep that night. I fly regularly for work, so my emergency jet lag sleeping pills were a god send. 

The next day, none of the symptoms subsided throughout the day or night, so when I woke up in the morning I took myself to a different hospital closer for me.  Same thing, same tests, same results. I asked them if they could at least give me something for the symptoms, even if they didn‚Äôt know what it was. The way I was feeling, I knew painkillers or a Xanax or something would have helped. Nothing. They told me to schedule an appointment with my GP so that‚Äôs what I did. 

1 agonising week later, I was able to see my GP. When she asked what the issue was, I explained to her the 24/7persistent, relentless, crippling pain and discomfort - which at this point had graduated to:

-	Tightness in chest
-	Chest pain
-	Back/shoulder/neck pain (which I can only assume is from my body being so tense all the time)
-	Lower back pain
-	Hot flashes
-	Tingling face/arms/hands
-	Ringing in my ears (this is fun)
-	Inability to sleep (unless I supplement with sleeping pills)
-	Charged with adrenaline, inability to sit still or just stop and think (not because I have worries going on in my head, but because I was so crippled with this pain and discomfort)

At that point, she ran some more tests but couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me. She consulted with another Doctor and at that point, diagnosed me with anxiety.

Anxiety? I didn‚Äôt believe her. None of my problems were mental. I wasn‚Äôt anxious or stressed out about anything (with the exception of this one issue). There‚Äôs no way it could be stress! We went back and forth and I finally agreed to see a Psychiatrist if she would also refer me to a chest and lung specialist.

Anyway, after seeing a chest specialist, lung specialist, more GPs, a psychiatrist and a therapist, along with a battery of tests, it seems that it is anxiety. And it is pure, crippling hell. I went through heroin withdrawal one time in my life, and that was a walk in the park compared to this. 

I used to be a happy, carefree, go-lucky guy. I‚Äôm now reduced to a shell of someone, so overwhelmed with pain and discomfort, that all I can do is breakdown and cry at the end of each day. I have no escape. No ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù. Unlike other people who I speak to about anxiety, I don‚Äôt have any triggers. My baseline level of feeling is my body being locked in fight or flight mode. I‚Äôve been experiencing a physical 3-month panic attack and my life is hell. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt say this to make you feel guilty for me. I say this to apologise. I used to think that people who suffered from anxiety (or depression for that matter) just had the wrong outlook on life. All they needed to do was smile a bit more, but on a brave face and just get on with life. 

I now realise just how sincerely wrong I was. Anxiety and depression are very real. And now, experiencing it first hand, I can only offer my sincerest apologies. Not just for being flippant about these two issues, but because I truly do sympathise now for those of you suffering. I know I never did before. So, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so, so sorry for what you all are going through.

For those of you who are curious - I‚Äôve tried beta blockers, but don‚Äôt seem to get any relief until I get to 80-160mg (2x a day), and even then it‚Äôs only about 60%. Though it does take it from unbearable to bearable. I‚Äôve taken Valium and Xanax to ease the symptoms on days I needed to focus, which helps alleviate the pain by about 70-80%, but I‚Äôm well aware of how addictive they are so I can‚Äôt consider these a long term option.

At this point, I‚Äôm at the end of my rope. I used to say I would never, in a million years, take antidepressants. But then again, I had never experienced what this actually feels like until now. I guess sometimes we‚Äôre all talk, eh? After speaking with my psychiatrist and those close to me, I‚Äôve made the decision to go on an antidepressant (Mirtazapine). At this point, I feel like it‚Äôs my only option. I wish this wasn‚Äôt the case, I wish everything was back to normal, but unfortunately that can‚Äôt happen. So now, I‚Äôve decided to take the medication in an attempt to get my life back.

Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm telling you all of this. I guess I feel like I don‚Äôt have anyone around me who knows what I‚Äôm going through. My girlfriend is amazing and supportive, but she (understandably) just doesn‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm going through. 

Thanks for listening guys. And again, for what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm sorry. 

Here‚Äôs to the Mirtazapine. Hopefully it works.

842,Does anyone else keep a family member out of their life in order to lessen anxiety?,"My dad has been an alcoholic since he was 16, long before I was thought of. It continued throughout my childhood. He was never abusive. I would go to his house on the weekends and it was normal for the most part.. minus the fact that every single day after lunch he would start drinking. I remember looking in the kitchen trash can and counting at least 13 beer cans. He got sad when he was drunk. Again, no abuse whatsoever, but it still wasn‚Äôt a good environment for a child to be around. I would also wake up to the sound of him vomiting in the bathroom.

I remember going to a couple of AA meetings with him. He had gone to several rehabs before. He was in an intensive rehab facility (2 year program) when my mom had a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was 12. As my legal guardian, my dad had to come out of the program to care for me. The first night home, he gave in and drank. Since that moment on, I‚Äôve abandoned hope for him. He decided to give into alcohol in my time of need. 

I get that addiction is harder then I could ever really understand - but the idea of being around my dad or talking to my dad gives me so much anxiety. Ever  since I turned 18, I haven‚Äôt spoken to him. He will send me cards but I have never responded.

I feel guilt for avoiding him but I feel so much anxiety when I think about speaking to him or seeing him. I feel like I will be happy with my life with not ever seeing him again. And it sounds so harsh because he‚Äôs never really DONE anything to me - compared to some stories I hear - but it just gives me so much unnecessary stress.

Does anyone else have anything similar? Am I in the wrong for avoiding him for the rest of my life?",33,2017-11-05 05:28:24 EST-0500

859,I was told yesterday I have 60 days to move out and it took me a year to find this place. And the guy I was dating just bailed. And my birthday is on the 10th.,"I've probably messaged upwards of 30 or 40 people by now about rooms for rent. I've gotten a lot of ""no's"" in response because I have pets. Can't get rid of my pets because they're the only family I have. My real family is full of abusive alcoholics. 

Have a few people who want to meet up about me possibly renting but I can't even bring myself to be hopeful about it.

I needed to pick up boxes from work today so I could at least feel a little more prepared about all of this and I can't even do that because my stupid coworker left them out in the rain.

If I work an extra day each week, six days a week, I can afford my own place. But I'd hardly be there and I don't want to do that to my dog. And I worry it would make my depression worse.

The guy I was dating just walked away because I told him I couldn't afford to go on a day trip we had planned because of all this. So thats cool.

And I wasn't planning to do anything for my birthday already because I don't have anyone to spend it with but now all I want is to just find a place to live.

I'm also angry. I'm angry at how easy other people have it. My coworker Louis has an entire apartment with his girlfriend who he's been with for three years.

862,Went to the ER yesterday. The best thing I have ever done!,"First of all, I wanted to thank anyone who replied to a post I made last week about going through a crisis and several panic attacks. Those replies were so helpful and I am so grateful to those that reached out and helped me.

I also wanted to preface by saying I have never taken any anti-anxiety medication or any anti-depressants in my life before yesterday.

My anxiety has been really, really bad this past week. I haven't been able to sleep or eat, and can barely function. I wasn't able to go into work, and I'm going to have to make some pretty big life decisions in the near future that I did not feel at all ready to make.

Yesterday I woke up and it's the worst I've ever felt. I couldn't even sit still and barely felt aware. My body felt like it was going to implode and there was nothing I could do about it. I wanted to cry so badly but couldn't even do that and it honestly felt like I was starting to lose it, like for real. My SO told me it was time to get some emergency help. So he took me to the ER.

I was there for hours, and ERs give me a panic attack on their own by just being there. After multiple hours of waiting and talking to several nurses and a doctor, they gave me some Ativan on the spot, a prescription for Xanax and Zofran, and sent me on my way. I made it clear to them that I needed emergency medication and they listened.

**30 minutes or so after taking the Ativan, I felt like a whole new person.** The negative voice in my head went away, my body calmed down, and I could finally breathe. No more brain fog, no more crazy heartbeats, no shaking. It was all gone. I felt so much relief that all I could do on the car ride home was just laugh (not in a creepy way, at least I don't think ;) ) because it felt like such a massive weight was lifted off of my chest.

Now even 24 hours later I've been able to sleep and eat on my own without a need for medication. The Ativan has obviously worn off by now, but it's like it snapped my body out of the panic. I haven't had another panic attack, and I've been able to smile and laugh, even in the face of an unknown and pretty scary future. I was even able to take my first ever dose of Celexa an hour ago without freaking out. I've had no desire to take any Xanax either. One of the best parts is that I'm not numb; I can think about these life changes rationally and though I'm still scared and nervous about them, I know no matter what happens I will be okay.

I wanted to post this for a few reasons. Mainly, if there is anyone else out there who is going through something similar to me, please go and get help. In a span of 48 hours I went from feeling so helpless and the worst I have ever felt, to honestly the best I have felt in a long, long time. There is no shame in going to the ER for anxiety if you need to and all of my doctors were so understanding and sweet.

Even while typing this right now, I feel so zen and at peace. I can't honestly tell you the last time I ever felt like this.",14,2017-08-01 21:45:28 EDT-0400
863,"Something like ""Existential Dread"" ?","This is hard to explain.I feel like whenever i have some free time, i can't simply enjoy it, i can't fully relax. 

Let's say I'm home on the weekend, there are things I need to do such as working out, reading my papers, cleaning, washing the dishes, meeting with a friend etc, and according to my plan i can have a beer and watch a movie or read at night. But when i do all of these and finally sit on my couch, put on a tv show or a movie, suddenly and slowly I feel something is coming up inside me. Suddenly i become heavy, tired, I feel a sensation of sadness is settling in slowly, and when i notice these sensations my hands get fidgety, stomach get upset(i had some episodes of ibs in the past) so instead of focusing on a book or a movie i focus on those sensations and can't enjoy anything, so i pause the movie and go for a smoke, it eases down the symptoms a bit but they come back 10 -15 mins later.  As in the example it  happens mostly when I'm alone and at night time but it can happen any time really. 

Does anybody relate to this? Is it something other than anxiety?",16,2017-08-03 13:45:33 EDT-0400
864,Anxiety Won This Round...,"My wife and I drove an hour out of town to spend the night at our friends camp. I was nervous about this trip all week, but leading up to it i had a great week. No setbacks or anything.  So we drove up in the afternoon and everything went well, we even got to their camp and I was surprising my sell with how well I had been doing. My anxiety was always on my mind, but we played some card games, went to McDonalds and even had a few beer. It started getting late and we were finishing up our last card game when almost out of nowhere I started to feel anxious, and it continued to get worst, almost to the point where I had to walk outside and leave the game. Fortunately I stayed until we finished cards and then everyone went to bed. We had our own little cabin me my wife and dog. We went in and my wife and dog fell asleep. I started to feel more and more anxious, thinking of things like I'm an hour from home, I'm in the woods, we don't have a bathroom, what if I have a panic attack here. Then it started to downpour and that up my anxiety for whatever reason. Also, the next morning we were all supposed to go to church and then hang out in the afternoon. That also made me very anxious knowing I wouldn't be going home for a long time. All this build up to the point where I woke my wife up around 3 in the morning and told her we had to leave. We drove and hour in the rain to get home. Obviously once I was home I was fine.  But this has bothered me all day, and has made my wife very upset. Not at me but the fact we had to lie to our friends and the fact that she feels that she can't help me when I'm feeling like this.  I'm proud that I made it to the camp, but disappointed that I had to leave. Some days you think you have a grip on your anxiety and other days you feel like your back at the start. Thanks for listening, guys! ",3,2017-08-07 07:48:24 EDT-0400
865,"How do others actually function and cope/deal with life on a daily basis, as in work etc...","I have been having a real bad time with anxiety for a few years now, im involved with my local mental health services and am awaiting counselling (for the 2nd time) plus im on a host of medication.

Just wondering how others cope with daily things like work/money, going outside, dealing with people? I haven't really left my room in 3 weeks and have major issues involving my self-image and how I look, so bad I have not been able to hold down a job for any real length of time, I can barely face my own family never mind strangers and always feel exposed and anxious in public, waiting for others to judge and ridicule me.

Its slowly killing me at the moment, now theres some self harm involved, I have zero friends, no kids, not married/no girlfriend nothing. Full stop. 

I also know i'll never have those things in the future either. In fact the only person keeping me breathing is my mother, as sad as it sounds for a 28 year old man. ",21,2017-08-03 01:21:56 EDT-0400
866,Does anyone else have trouble enjoying the present because they can't stop comparing it to the past?,"I spend nearly every day thinking about memories of old times and how good those times were, to the point where I can't enjoy the present to the fullest because it doesn't compare.  I do like the time I spend with my SO, my friends, my family, but it never feels like enough.  It always feels like something's missing, like it isn't as good as those times in the past.

The stupid part is I've felt this way for years and then I always end up looking back on the times I thought were meh as good times.  I thought today was boring and uneventful but there's a good chance I'll be looking back on it this time next year wishing things were this good.  

I guess it's hard to tell what days will be memorable until you're looking back on them.  There's no way to tell one certain day is going to be super significant in hindsight and stand out to you.  I want things to feel special *now* though.  I want every day to feel super wonderful and memorable and special.  

It really really sucks being caught in this cycle.  I spend so much time obsessing about the past that I can't enjoy the present‚Ä¶or maybe I spend so much time obsessing BECAUSE I can't enjoy the present?  I don't know, point is I wish I could just take things day by day happily instead of being stuck in the past :/

Anyone else with this problem or am I alone?

867,Find the strength,"I feel that something people with anxiety suffer from (including myself) is that we give up. It's so very easy to say we're not going somewhere to doing something or trying something new because we know that our anxiety will fill us with dread along the way. 

Do you guys ever push yourself to get through it? I truly believe this is the strongest way to kick anxietys ass. 

Just recently, I had an opportunity to go to my girlfriends cottage about 2 hours away. I skipped out on the experience because I knew I would have a panic attack in the car with her and her family (road trips are one of my triggers). Well, she was up there for a few days and her father drove up the second day. I forced myself to go and push through my anxiety because it's what felt right. I brought things to occupy myself with to evade my anxiety. 

My point is, I went to the cottage, and I had an absolute blast. Easily the best memory I've made this summer, and I almost passed it up because this darkness in my mind was controlling me. I beg you all to find the strength to get through your struggles. I know we all have anxiety to a different extent, but we're all here experiencing everything together. 

Thank you to such an awesome sub who's shown me that I'm not alone with all of this, and who's shown me so many ways to deal with this. You guys rock.

I made the call yesterday.  Shook like a leaf the entire time.  But I did it.  I haven't been able to do this my entire adult life (27 now) but I did it yesterday.  And today, I feel like a weight the size of a planet was lifted off my shoulders.

These outrageously vivid nightmares started about ten days ago.  I've had only one per night, but they are much longer and more vivid than any dreams I've ever had before.  I've had more nightmares in this 10 day period than I have in my entire life.  Each one is scarier than the previous nightmare.  They each have a consistent story and flow, but none of them have any relevance to my daily life, what I've seen on TV, etc.

Each of these nightmares also occurs immediately before I wake up.  I feel that it is the fear that wakes me up.  If I didn't wake up, the nightmares would be even longer.

Is there any way that I can stop this?  If it continues for much longer I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep anymore.  Suicide would be the inevitable result.

Please, please, please help me!!!  This is torture.

877,"I keep shirking big life responsibilities because I collapse under the weight of all the stress. I don't know how anyone handles life sometimes, much less clinically anxious people.","There are always a million things to do, places to go, bills to pay, people to see. The list is always endless. I know this is just adulthood, and everyone must make it work. But I cannot. I get so incredibly anxious thinking about all I have to do, all I haven't done yet, how I still don't know much about doing any of these things (no one ever taught me the first thing about finances)...and I just collapse under the weight of it all. I freeze, and I just don't do any of the things I'm supposed to do. I lay there and obsess about what I need to do for hours and hours, but I don't do anything about it. Then I lie about why I can't get anything done, because ""anxiety"" is not an acceptable answer. It pisses everyone off and ruins my life. 

I flew to my father's house this week because this half of my family is disappointed that I do not see them often enough (because I don't get time off at work). The whole time I am forced to babysit my much younger siblings and get grilled for not making enough money and living up to the expectations of a normal fucking adult. Then my mother's side got angry that I don't see THEM often enough, so I'm traveling there next week. Amidst all this, I realized that I forgot completely about my volunteering commitment to a local hospital. Volunteering that I need to get into the school program that will hopefully give me a real career, since mentally fucked me fucked up college the first time around. This is not the first time I've forgotten volunteering because of anxious obsessions about other facets of my life. Needless to say, they are sick of me being unreliable and will not be asking me back. Then my coworkers complained about me not getting enough done at work. I can't please family, friends, work, anyone. My life always implodes because I can't be a fucking functional adult.

So today in my session, we wrapped up everything with mandatory stuff like treatment plans and emergency stuff but also about the future in college and my week. She gave me tips for distress tolerance, etc.

Before I left, she wanted me to read what I learned in therapy. Instead of just making things up, I read her my Reddit post about what I learned (link above).

880,I aCCOMPLISHED SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF SINCE APRIL DUE TO MY ANXIETY AND IT FEELS SO GOOD! :),"Hi guys,

Thought this might be a good place to share this! Because of my anxiety and depression I fucked up real bad this year in uni. Failed all of my Winter sem courses and even one in the Fall term. I've been so embarrassed to talk about this to anyone because I feel like such a failure. Since coming home from school in April I've been DREADING dealing with the consequences of all this. Although I had my appeal (aka document outlining my struggles/extenuating circumstances that caused me to fail these courses and why I would like them basically removed from my transcript) ready since April I haven't been able to send it in. Every time I would log on to do it I would read over my appeal letter, criticize tf out of it, and close my browser. I would try to send it I would simply freak out and ended up getting nothing accomplished. It's been four months now since I've been trying to do this and I finally hit that send button today!!!!

Basically, the point of this post is for anyone who's anxiety is keeping them from doing something they absolutely NEED to get done (or you'll be straight up screwed like me) but can't seem to find the courage to do it. Finding that bravery will make a world of difference for your anxious thoughts. Trust me. I don't think I've been this happy in years! ",18,2017-08-18 23:16:03 EDT-0400

886,"after decades of dealing with anxiety/panic attacks, I finally figured it out.","I might not be able to help everyone but hopefully one person.
I'm in no way an expert and I'm still trying to master the following method. It's all about Mindfulness/awareness/Living in the moment, that's the answer. Why do we get anxious at times? Because of our thoughts - thoughts that only exists in our mind. It's almost impossible to be anxious while you're living in the moment without thinking about the past or the future. Each time you catch yourself thinking/daydreaming just be aware of it and go back to the present and you'll see what a huge difference this makes. I'm not keeping my mind busy to forget about things, i'm doing my best to keep my mind quiet. At night before I go to sleep, I focus on nothing and I have been sleeping a lot better and I am no longer dealing with morning anxiety, why? Because I am not focusing on any thought, I'm letting thoughts come and go. 
This is seriously as easy as it sounds, try it. For a few hours just let thoughts come and go and just be ""aware"" of that precise moment. 
Before when I used to practice this I always gave up because I thought I was supposed to not think of anything but the key is to just be aware that you're thinking, control the thoughts, don't allow them to control you.",25,2017-08-21 15:58:11 EDT-0400

889,I feel guilty about being anxious. Anybody else feel the same?,"tl;dr I go through good periods and bad periods and during good periods, I hate myself for being anxious and think it's my fault that I got anxious 

My anxiety seems to sort of go through cycles. It's not like I'm bipolar or something--the lows aren't quite as low as flat out depression and the highs aren't as high as mania. Plus the cycles seem to be mostly triggered by things that happen to me, even if I don't always know what caused the change at the time. 

Anyway, basically sometimes for a few weeks or whatever I'm pretty anxious and I just feel like everybody thinks I'm uncool, nobody wants me around, I'm dumb and lazy, and I wonder why anybody is even friends with me to begin with since I'm such a fuck up and I get scared that my dad will stop loving me and that my friends will leave me. While the anxiety during these periods is mostly related to my self worth and interactions with other people, not all of it is. I oftentimes during these periods feel myself questioning and checking every decision that I make. 

Then, for whatever reason, I score a win somehow or somebody compliments me and I start to feel that things are looking up. Sometimes if I'm really into whatever project I'm working on then, I get a kind of giddy, optimistic feeling and just feel like everything is going to be alright.

But anyway, during the happy periods, I look back on my sad periods and think about how I thought about myself and realize that A. It's totally irrational, I make mistakes but realistically I am not the world's biggest fuckup. I have a lot of things to be proud of and I'm just letting my mood/worldview taint my perception of myself and how I think other people see me and B. It doesn't matter that much what other people think of me and I know I have inherent self worth and that there are things I can be happy about, regardless of whether cool people see it that way. When I start to feel better, I feel guilty about feeling anxious and insecure earlier. I hate myself for letting this silly negative worldview get to me and waste my time and cause me to waste my potential. I hate myself for getting caught up in thoughts, problems that aren't even real, and I feel like it's my fault those thoughts stayed with me for as long as they did because I didn't have enough willpower and foresight to just block them out and not let them get to me. I feel like the reason the negative thoughts were able to appear and take control is my laziness and lack of hard work to keep them out. 

Does anyone else ever experience this? How do you deal with it? I know I won't be happy all the time; things happen and some level of insecurity is normal. But how do I keep the negative worldview from taking over my thoughts? How do I keep myself from being overwhelmed by these thoughts. Does anyone have any useful tips on how to recognize negative self talk and change it to be more optimistic, or at least not as hyperbolic? 

I think sometimes I let negative thoughts persist because in a way it's easier and more comfortable to just stay sad. That way you have a bit of control over your sadness. If you start to feel something like ""Everybody else is cooler and smarter than I am"" but then you tell yourself ""No that's not true"" but then you go out and do something that day that validates the negative theory, you feel even more like shit and you didn't see it coming. 

Sorry for rambling. Anyway if anybody has any thoughts about this they'd like to share, comment them below. ",10,2017-08-16 02:56:09 EDT-0400

893,"After a panic attack has subsided and you're able to think rationally again, does anyone else just stop and think ""what the actual fuck just happened to me?""","Panic attacks are so weird and so scary. The worst thing for me is that overwhelming feeling of sadness and dread where you feel nothing will be cheerful again and that you'll continue to feel horribly scared forever. That feeling, luckily, subsides for me most of the time. But when it's all set and done and my body is exausted, sometimes i just stop and think and say ""what the hell just happened to me??"" sometimes that thought makes me more scared and sometimes it's calming to know that no matter how horrible that feeling may be, it does eventually pass.

894,Is it real or not?,"Whenever I have a good day where I make it through situations that are usually tough for me and I am more active and talkative, I feel like my illness is all just a big scam. Today I did exposure therapy for social anxiety and I actually did pretty well. I was able to talk to strangers kind of easily and my therapist thought I was doing well. But then I get to thinking. What if she thinks I'm doing so well that my illness is just something I'm imagining? I was even cracking jokes during it. I feel like I don't even compare to how bad some people have it. Sometimes I ask myself if I am magnifying my symptoms just to seem worse than I am, but then I remember the days at college where I could barely leave my room out of fear of interacting with my roommates. I wouldn't eat if they had friends over and I would hold myself from going to the bathroom for as long as possible because I didn't want anyone to see me. I skipped classes one day because one strand of my hair looked ""weird."" I dropped a class because they assigned a presentation. I don't know if I'm just really good at faking my personality sometimes to the point that I can trick myself into dealing with things better or if I'm not as sick as I lead myself to believe.

903,Anyone else feel fake when trying to think positive and supportive instead of critical and self-loathing?,"Yes there are days when I actually think AND feel good about myself. But most days, especially the ones with anxiety, I tend to think very critically and beat myself up.

I have noticed that there is something within me that agrees with my negative thoughts, and is selectively looking for things in real life situations to use as evidence for me being of no value, that I suck, that I can't get my shit together, that I'm basically failing in life. Deep rooted neural pathways reinforced with the message ""I am not good enough.""

However when I try to think positive, even making it a daily routine for a month or so, I feel there is nothing within me that agrees. There is nothing within me that agrees when someone says something nice about me, or appreciates me for all the good and courageous things I say or do. It just feels fake and simply not true at all. And it makes it really really hard to stay with any attempts of changing my thinking. I feel the effort is totally in vain since it fails to work, and I also fail to make a long lasting habit out of it.

Just a reflection, maybe someone else ca relate and share some tips.",12,2017-06-06 22:29:54 EDT-0400

Another example I can think of was when I was with this close friend and his other friends (again, they're acquaintances to me), and they mentioned a road trip, and again, they invited me. 

I don't know if I'm actually liked or they didn't want to be rude. I can't be sure cause I'm rarely asked to hang out. I'm always the one initiating. Even sometimes I'll ask if they got plans for Saturday night, and they'll say ""yeah"". I mean I was making it pretty obvious that I wanted to hang out, and I was expecting a ""yeah, come at my place at 9pm"", rather than just a ""yeah"".",26,2017-06-03 21:53:45 EDT-0400

907,Starting medication was the best choice for me...,"I have been a fairly frequent visitor to this sub over the last couple of years. I have a pretty typical story, I was a high achiever who worked myself almost to death throughout university and started experiencing horrible anxiety. I started to obsess over the thought of making a mistake (e.g. forgetting to reference something in an essay) and immediately jump to being expelled, my career down the drain before it even began.

It sounds a bit trivial now but in my worst I was an absolute basket case. I'd lie in my bed crying thinking how pointless it all was. I thought all my friends hated me. In social situations I was trapped in a cycle of drinking to make myself relax, then waking up feeling anxious & mortified about my drinking. I even had to call a suicide support line once.

Fast forward to recent times and a new and stressful job made me really evaluate things. I'd been prescribed Esitalo before but never took it as I thought it was 'weak' and that I was not 'really' mentally ill I was just overdramatic.

I finally made two decisions: I was giving up drinking and I was going on medication. 

Both have made *such* a difference. My recent achievements include keeping my house tidy, sleeping eight hours overnight, and cooking dinner every night. I know these things probably sound tiny, but they're things I haven't done consistently in over three years.

Plus, I feel I have so much more perspective. I made a mistake at work recently, and instead of it turning me into a catatonic mess convinced I'd be fired, I was able to think of a solution, explain the situation to my boss, and move on.

Honestly, it had been so long since I was anxiety free I think I'd forgotten what it feels like to have a clear head and some damn perspective! Going on medication has really made me realise that there was something seriously physiological going on - the way I was feeling was *not* normal or 'just a bit stressed'. I still feel a bit stressed on occasion, but not the crazy wild panic and terror I'd feel before.

I'm not planning to be on medication forever, as I think with the combination of my new healthy habits (especially quitting drinking almost totally), I will be able to be medication free really soon. But I just wanted to post this in case anyone else is struggling with the stigma and embarrassment that I did - if your trusted GP/psych thinks this is an option for you, please don't be embarrassed. It's just one tool to help you get on top of this crappyness we call anxiety!",26,2017-06-06 14:28:35 EDT-0400

916,Can anxiety make you feel like you're physically sick/have a virus?,"This seems to happen to me a lot. I was blessed with a kick ass immune system, but I'm always freaking out about getting sick, especially before a big event. I have prom on Thursday and I've felt shitty since Sunday from what I think are nerves.

My symptoms are:
-weak body (hard to describe)
-lower back stiffness
-nausea (but in my throat, not stomach if that makes any sense at all) 
-overall not feeling well but can't really describe the feeling. but it feels absolutely awful like I might as well have the flu or something 
-throat tightness 
-rushes where I feel like I'll throw up but never do (I'm severely emetephobic and have only thrown up 3/4 times in my 18 years on this planet, all of them >5 years ago.)
-not feeling comfortable unless i'm in my bed or in the bath 
-difficulty sleeping 
-feeling like I have a fever but I don't 
-tense legs
-feeling helpless and like if i were to get sick no one could help me 


I think I have allergies right now but I'm so worried that it's a cold. I'm also scared I'll throw up either now or before prom or I'll feel sick for prom and have my day ruined.


Is it really possible that how I feel physically is really just all in my head and due to anxiety?? Does anyone else get this? How can I stop it?

I missed assignments because I just couldn't focus and kept lying to myself that it's ok because I'll study really hard for the exams and get a passing grade. Now it's 2 weeks before the exams and I still haven't studied. 

I swear I tried, I feel exhausted from trying so hard to get myself to work but I can't concentrate and feel like it's a waste of time because I'll just fail anyway. 

I know college isn't the be-all and end-all. I'm still young, at 21, after all. It feels like a big deal now but I know in the grand scheme of things it won't be. I'm afraid of informing my parents and friends. I wasn't even passionate about what I was studying, I just thought it would be something I could tolerate (I was wrong).

923,Going to push my anxiety. Wanna come with me ?,"I just wrote like 100 words and erased in on the phone. I'm gutted but let's start again. 

So I'm a 32 year old man living in Ireland. Have depression and anxiety for 16 years. I have had thousands of panic attacks and I'm still here. I have attacks about nearly every thing in my life. But they all passed. I wrote before that I am very open about talking about my attacks as I don't feel ashamed anymore and would like to past that to others. I am no way a guru to this quite the opposite but I'm welling to talk and not afraid. So I'm house bound with anxiety a hermit crab we will say. Been house bound for years but I am happy I just want more in life. 

Also excuse the bad grammar and spelling hard to try when brain gone mad. But we will struggle on. 

So I live in Ireland and it's lovely all green and leprechauns. I don't drink (I know shocked) I used to go for a few pints but hangovers and anxiety do not mix. I spend most of my time on my PC or with my family. I used to have friends everywhere calling in and out but as you get older that goes away you don't feel much sadness as its just what happens and I'm still close with every one of them. That's enough about my lifestyle. 

I go to a cbt councilor every so often. She has been amazing in so many ways. I used to be so afraid but now I see it as a challenge. I beg anyone that feels they are having any problems go get help why not. If you have car and the engine don't start you get a mechanic. I fully understand that some people it's not that easy, but try and seek it out help is there. I'm.in Ireland and I have the same fear you do not the  thoughts as that is more individual to each of us, but the reasons it happens is all the same physically. 

So when I started writing I had a pressure around my head not bad like just a gentle press like a jumper laying on it. I had a bit of shakes. And the huge thing is the feeling just below my rib cage like a liquid feeling. That is the adrenal gland where a lot comes from. I was sitting In my sitting room now I'm in car on my journey. Honestly I was nervous but typing this out for second time has distracted me so I'm chill. 

So they journey starts my nieces in the car, they are in a bad mood the are young 4 and 2ish. They want trolls soundtrack so I'm on spotify looking for the soundtrack. Was freaking a bit as the Wi-Fi wouldn't cut off and go to mobile data and they where getting angry. Kids are not the greatest for logic. But good for me as put me into chaos situation and forces me to deal with it. 

So down to business I feel the adrenaline push into my stomach. And the start of the attack first I say OK let's do this I feel my feet tingle and the air conditioner in the car feels colder than it is. My body is more sensitive to everything. My eyes are more focused and I'm at alert stations my thoughts are OK as I'm typing on this and I'm.focused on it more. The Adrenalin will pass it might do another squirt but that's OK too. All noises are super focused this is fight or flight I'm sensing a danger but it's not there like its sucks but like its a good thing. If I was in danger I want my senses to be alert I don't want to be getting chased and walking into walls. I feel like I must go to bathroom. And fear I won't make it be embarrassed but fuck it don't care I'm OK just looking for something to conform a fear response. I'm OK at the moment it's like a 3 on panic scale no need for mindfulness but it is always a good thing for anyone to practice panic or no panic. I'm glued to my phone. I have a bottle of water a xanax ( always bring one but never used it to this day just comfort blanket) and pastel sweets with honey resume remedy they are called will link in comment all the stuff I'm talking about after. Just more focused on pushing past anxiety.   I'm about to go into shopping centre next test. I'm like 8 miles from home. 

So new paragraph for shopping centre. Sister decides to go to top of car park always great that more walking. I never use lifts as the feeling uneases me so I use stairs thanks to my sister I get some extra exercise. Still feel the urge to use bathroom so I will I'm a bit dizzy. And sounds ambled up. Sitting in chill area my knee are feeling weak and my constant about noise around me like Superman able to focus on them. And my breath gotta take a deep breath to just chill like a 5 on scale I also lost my sister so I'm afraid my neck is going mad looking left and right my legs are shaky when no stop and I feel off balance. I'm calmer now but still present just more chill. No where near what I was at I hate waiting around my sister is murder for looking at stuff and prolonging the stay I am more of get it done go home which we all are I think. So everything going great then my sister decides to change the plans now we at battle stations as per usual life throws a curve ball. We must wait for here father in law to give him something so my escape plans are fucked this messes me up. I'm grand thou I felt the Adeline enter  my body and I started sweating like I just walked 2 miles and a headache is starting. I was at a 1 now I'm at a 6 with the new news I fell like shouting at my sister but that's not going to help anything let's just take it as another challenge. Worst things is texting someone on phone and they don't respond that is huge trigger for me that few minutes it takes for them to respond. I quit smoking two years ago and moments like these his I just want one. But I know that was not helping me so I am sitting in resting area as my sister does more shopping. God I never expected to write this much sorry for that. So I'm sitting here focused on the phone typing and its working all the systems are at red alert but I'm like floating past them. Letting them take three course. It always passed and we always win. Deep breath in just let myself float and calmness is slowing taking over again.  All the noises are lowering in volume headache still there thou. Just a better feeling of calm and excitement a high feeling of accomplishment. I was so focused on my anxiety I didn't notice I was showing a plumbers bum I laughed mortified but at least something to laugh about. 

I feel it's time for new paragraph as it looked messy. I'm. fine now just tired they take the energy out of you. I'm still in the shopping centre but I'm. good I'm OK now. It always passes. I love when I can separate myself and float it's such a great feeling takes practice thou. I'm so sorry I wrote far too much. It's helping me so much just to type it out. Nearly finished now panic is completely gone I might as well be at home. 

Found my sister and going home been eventful but win over all.  Gotta keep doing days like this to learn experience winning over them to gain confidence and get back to a normal life. Thanks for everyone that read it. Hope it might help someone. 

tl;dr just a blog of my experience in panic attacks from a house bound person going to shopping centre and pushing my limits.

927,I took my driving test today and passed!,"Today I finally got around to getting my full license. I've been driving for almost 4 years, but that was kind of like a learners license where you have restrictions and can't carry passengers. Two months ago I finally got the courage to book my full test. Two months flew by and for the past few days I have been so nervous. Last night I felt so sick and this morning I didn't even think I'd be able to make it to the test centre. But I got up on time, I left on time and I arrived early. Walked in, checked in and my instructor was ready for me before schedule. 

The 10 minutes before my test when I was waiting, I was surprisingly calm. Maybe because it was too late to back out, so I just accepted that I was going to do it. The test was pretty smooth, I didn't make any major mistakes, we chatted and I drove very well I must say. 30 minutes later, we got back to the test centre, I did a pretty poor parking job but oh well, the third attempt was perfect. 

He told me I did great and I passed. I was sure I would fail before I did my test or that anxiety would get in the way, but I didn't even think about anxiety. I'm still surprised at how calm I was the whole time, I just drove like normal and checked my mirrors a lot. Then just to push myself a bit more, I went to get some lunch by myself. I feel so relieved, I'll hopefully never need to take another driving test! This really goes to show that I need to stop doubting and questioning myself, because we're all capable of doing whatever we want to.

928,I had my first panic attack without my (now ex) boyfriend there to help me.,"My long term boyfriend broke up with me about a month ago and it has been unimaginably difficult, but I've been getting through.

Last night, however, I had one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I couldn't breathe and I was beginning to lose sensation in my hands. When I felt it coming on I realized that my ex wasn't going to be there to calm me down like he always used to be, which sent me into even more of a panic. I picked up my phone and was about to call him (dear god, it would have been bad if I had called him) or 911 (I hadn't decided yet) when my three roommates walked in. I assume they had heard me hyperventilating and sobbing/yelling.

They all came in, sat around me, and held me and did deep breathing. They said soothing words until I calmed down and regained control of myself. 

So that's it. I did it! For the first time in a year, I calmed down without my ex there to soothe me. I obviously still need to work on calming myself down since my friends rushed to my aid, but I feel a whole new appreciation for my friends too. 

Life fucking sucks sometimes, but there is always a silver lining my friends.

930,I'm so sick of being mentally exhausted everyday,"Seriously.

Every day feels like I've just walked off the Battlefield, and I have no time to rest at Night, because I'm just getting geared up for the next day and then the next day, and then the next week, and then the next month, and then the next year. You get the idea.

And even when I TRY to rest, I can't fucking sleep because my mind is too active. Fuck my stupid mind.

I sat down today, and realized how little days I've actually had that haven't included stress/anxiety,feeling tired, not mentally in the mood for anything. I can literally count the days on my hand. That's terrifying to me. This is not healthy.

I try to remain optimistic, but everything just constantly brings me down. If it's not money problems, it's someone saying the wrong thing, something not going right in my day. It's like I'm constantly on ALERT and I'm so anxious about everything, that by the time I get home, I can't even think straight. Feels like I've been walking through a Nightmare, and the worst is yet to come.

It's a Friday right. Weekend is starting, I should be enjoying myself? Wrong. I'm already worrying about Monday, next week, what I need to do, stressing over that. I can't enjoy one day without worrying about bullshit all the time. I just want life to leave me alone for a second.",41,2017-09-23 02:47:16 EDT-0400

932,There really ought to be some kind of epipen for anxiety..,For when an anxiety or panic attack comes on very suddenly (and usually very inconveniently). I have chewed up a Xanax before but god if alprazolam isn't the worst taste in the world and it doesn't go away for so long. Being able to just whip out a Xanax epipen would be amazing. ,106,2017-09-24 10:53:43 EDT-0400
933,Do you also feel like you are ALWAYS thinking?,"I'm bothered by my constant thinking. Usually, I wake up feeling ok, not much in my mind. But as the day goes by, more and more ideas accumulate in my mind. I remember I have a test in 1 week, then I remember I have to buy a book, that I have to practice something, then I remember a friend or a girl and start thinking about them, sometimes even making fantasies of being around them and doing cool stuff. Sometimes I manage to get things done, but its always with that partial focus, as if a part of my mind was still occupied with those thoughts.

Sometimes, I spend a lot of time anticipating something. I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study, research it, think about how it's going to be, then when the time for studying comes, I'm thinking about something else. Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening, and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else.

Sometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander.

Does anyone feel these things? Do you think it's related to anxiety, or do I have ADHD or something else?",28,2017-09-24 21:18:44 EDT-0400

939,Something Silly that helps me take my meds,"Last week I finally decided to go to the doctor to get help dealing with years and years of barely livable anxiety. I finally got some meds and am feeling a lot better! 

I still feel a bit anxious in the morning before I take the dose, as swallowing pills has always been a trigger for me. But what helps is actually personifying the anxiety itself and talking back to it.

For instance, I'll have the pill in my hand, and say ""Look out anxiety, I'm about to take your WORST NIGHTMARE!"" and then I laugh like an evil villain and swallow the pill. It sounds silly but it's really helped me, it feels empowering like I'm actually fighting the illness and I'm strong. 

I also feel like I can identify the anxious thoughts more easily after taking the meds, and so I'll feel them come up, and say ""fuck you anxiety, the the fuck out of here"" and then laugh again, and it's really fun and empowering. 

I don't know if this will work for everyone, but it's really helped me feel a lot better and more in control!",10,2017-09-27 20:03:43 EDT-0400

942,I went to my first party,"Hi Reddit so I‚Äôve been a long time lurker on this sub and a couple of days ago I had my freshers party. This is also my first college party ever so I was nervous as fuck. I have had anxiety for a long time now and have learned to control it so far in most areas except for one; girls. 

Seriously though I‚Äôve had a pretty messed up love life, got attached to the wrong girl for 2 whole years, chased after her like a puppy despite knowing I had no chance with her and basically had zero experience dating wise at my first college party. 

One thing that‚Äôs happened over the past two years is that I‚Äôve improved myself drastically. To be confident, I have to have something to be confident about. I lost 14 kgs of weight, started going to the gym, I write my own stories and try to force myself to be more social. Basically I tried to become the best version of myself. So I decided to go for the party knowing that even if I don‚Äôt do well with meeting a girl, I can still have a great time with my friends. 

So I enter the party and start talking to people I know. I go to a Liberal Arts college so everyone knows each other and hugs are encouraged. People are drinking, smoking and dancing everywhere around me and for the first time ever, I danced my butt off without caring if someone was judging me or not. I just didn‚Äôt give a damn anymore. I spoke to plenty of girls, both seniors and from my batch, and to my eternal surprise, it wasn‚Äôt that difficult. I basically walked up, said hi, and started a conversation. A few times, girls walked up to me and started talking to me. Surprise surprise, apparently I‚Äôm not as ugly as I think I am. 

I hung out with this one girl for most of the night and she was way too tipsy to even walk. So we literally sat down on a couch and she went to sleep on my shoulder. After a while, I told her I have to leave cause it was really late and I had to get back home. She wakes up and tells me how nice of a person I was for not talking advantage of her. What happened next, I hadn‚Äôt imagined happening to me in a million years; she asked me for my number. We‚Äôll see each other in college regardless but I have never felt so confident or validated in my life. It made me feel good about myself, something my socially awkward self hadn‚Äôt felt in years. I used to think I‚Äôm an introvert but like my friends kept telling me, it turns out I‚Äôm a socially awkward extrovert who can‚Äôt wait for his next party. 

Thanks r/Anxiety for giving a 17 year old the time of his life. I‚Äôve never posted here before but I‚Äôve read a lot of posts and taken a lot of advice for this sub. You guys are awesome and keep the memes coming. They‚Äôre my favorite part of the community!",4,2017-09-24 23:14:57 EDT-0400
943,Frequent nausea & vomiting.. Am I the only one?,"I am usually anxious before bed and upon waking up. During these times of feeling anxious, I am always nauseous, and I almost always vomit.

Sometimes it's less frequent. However, I usually wake up with ""morning sickness"" during stressful life events. I am going through a hardship now, and the nausea is becoming unbearable. Sometimes I am unable to sleep and I'm nauseous and throwing up all night. Tonight was one of those nights. :(

945,Fear of Vomiting - anyone else?,"Hi there

I was just wondering if anyone experiences the same kind of panic attacks as I do, and if you have any ways of helping yourself. 

My panic attacks always come down to feeling nauseous and sick, and the fear of vomiting. This means that even the feeling of being full can send me into a spiral of panic. I have spent many an hour hunched over the toilet convinced I'm going to be sick (but I never am). It usually progresses from feeling a bit sick, to full on shivering/shaking and an overwhelming nausea. 

These kind of attacks only usually come when I'm feeling generally stressed - like before an interview. Unfortunately this means that I often struggle to go somewhere because I'm terrified about vomiting on the bus, or driving while I feel so sick. If it happens the night before, it often leads to me not being able to sleep, and in the morning not being able to eat (not helpful when you're about to take an exam/do an interview!).

I feel like, if I could just stop the nausea, I could stop the cycle of panic, but nothing seems to work. Any hints/tips would be most helpful!

Thanks :D",29,2017-09-28 15:26:00 EDT-0400

955,This is how i overcame my anxiety.,"Find a therapist and get medication if  you need it. They saved my life. I barely had any side-effects. First weeks will be tough.

**Do** things you that make you scared. Scared of getting outside? Go outside every day. Scared of making social interactions? Push your comfort levels. On day 1 you ask for a product in the supermarkt. On day 2 you ask someone the time etc. On day 60 you go skydiving. 

**Eat** healthy. Seriously, this one is huge. Research what is healthy for the human brain.

**Exercise**

**Don't** hide. Don't feel like a victim. Millions of people are struggling and you happen to be one, go and do something about it!

Realize that anxiety can be **cured**. The reason you don't hear about it a lot is because people who cured their anxiety just go on with life. They don't go on these platforms anymore. I promised I would post here if I beat my anxiety. 

You will feel more anxious taking action, because you are leaving your comfort zone. Your brain is only thinking about surviving and your survival brain is just fine laying in bed all day. Don't give up. First weeks will be very tough. This is because you're making changes. 

Finally, don't take life too serious. This mindset helped me a lot!

Good luck on your journey. The time is now.

969,I don‚Äôt know if I can post this here... but it‚Äôll help me calm. Please delete if it‚Äôs against rules,"So about three months ago I was diagnosed as anxiety/depressed. Normal typical combo. I have meds, yea, and they work sometimes, but not really. I‚Äôm not suicidal, I‚Äôm just upset at myself. My life is good and I have no fuxking reason to be depressed or anxious. But, here I am.

My depression is pretty bad, if I‚Äôm honest. It‚Äôs hard to get out of bed, to remember to do basic things like brush my teeth or shower. I hate doing my hobbies (cooking, makeup, working out, gaming). It‚Äôs not nearly as bad as my mother‚Äôs, and again I have no right to have it for as long as I have (going on 8 years. Mom chose to ignore it)

My anxiety is the worst part of it. I can‚Äôt take phone calls. I hate talking to anyone (this includes my fianc√© and our roommate). I hate small talk. I hate interviews. I am terrified of anyone I have to respect and the wrong things come out of my mouth (my last job I was fired for making an off comment to a manager who I tried to apologize for, as when I‚Äôm nervous my mouth explodes). I can‚Äôt ask people for help ever, and if I do it takes me ages to work up courage. It takes me three days to get back to calls for jobs (because thankfully online applications are a thing). I get these horrible panic attacks monthly, where my entire body numbs up and I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt sleep at night scolding myself. I am terrified of being robbed so any little sound keeps me ticking.

On top of all of this I‚Äôm almost certain my eating disorder has come back. I apparently make these wonderful meals (though I‚Äôm certain they are only saying it to try and make me feel better) but I can‚Äôt eat them. I haven‚Äôt fully finished a meal in three years. I eat a meal a day (but if it‚Äôs something I love like pizza I get the calories I need). I haven‚Äôt gone back to the puking, but I‚Äôm really worried.

My mother in law scolds me for not doing basic shit that a human should remember to do. My mom still refuses to believe it‚Äôs as bad as I think it is. I avoid talking to anyone about it because I can‚Äôt trust anyone. Its because it‚Äôs what I expect them to say. 

I can‚Äôt afford therapy. I have insurance but I don‚Äôt have a job. My fianc√© does but all of it goes to our bills. I can‚Äôt ask my family to help because they are in just a bad situation as me. I can‚Äôt drive, I can‚Äôt find a damn job due to the stress and the time of year that it is. I‚Äôm terrified, and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I just needed to vent it out. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to say anything. Infact I hope this to just get flooded away. Even if someone does respond I probably won‚Äôt respond back. I hate burdening others, especially when some of you probably have it worse off than me.",18,2017-12-13 22:06:57 EST-0500

973,How I‚Äôve learnt to accept and manage my anxiety,"I‚Äôve sought therapy to treat my anxiety for the last 7 years or so. Most recently I saw a therapist who I resonated with and I felt helped put me on the path to helping me manage my anxiety, She prefaced the very first session with the notion that I will never truly be free of anxiety which is OK, it is a part of who I am, but I can learn to manage it. And that is what I set out to do (which for me was a new outlook / way of approaching my anxiety).

As the sessions progressed I made notes of the key takeaways which I have sought to incrementally embed in my daily life. I now refer to this list almost daily. 

What I‚Äôve learned in my sessions (these are taken from the notes I‚Äôve jotted down in my phone):

1. I can re-wire my brain to change my inner belief system. It takes time, but I am making progress. 

2. CBT is effective to put things into perspective. It helps rationalize and observe the situation. 

3. What is the worst thing that can happen in any situation? Think of it, define it and realize it's not that bad.

4. My mind, thoughts and perception of a situation are the problem - not the person or situation itself. Someone else in the exact same situation would perceive and react differently based on their own perceptions.

5. Progress is based on small incremental improvements through various tools and exercises such as hypnosis, meditation, CBT and exposure. Like a jigsaw, all the pieces come together and I can effectively tackle my anxiety. 

6. A 'so what' attitude is the attitude to have. So what if I fail, so what if something goes wrong? So what!?

7. I can embrace my awkwardness. Laugh at it and myself - don't take anxiety so seriously, no one else around me does. 

8. I don't judge anyone else so harshly, so I shouldn't judge myself so harshly. If I see someone awkward or anxious I am empathetic - I don't negatively judge them. So why do I judge myself, and why would anyone judge me. Don't be so critical of myself or hold myself to a higher standard.

9. My inner dialogue defines my reality. Think positive, and be positive. Think confident, act confident and be confident. 

10. Setting exposure goals and tracking them helps. 

11. Writing thoughts and progress down helps solidify it in my mind. 

12. Even when I have a bad day - don't be harsh - I am making progress. 

13. If I diet for 3 weeks then binge one day. I haven't lost all progress for the other 20 days where I ate healthy. The same applies for anxiety. One bad experience does not negate the progress I have made.

14. Each day I am moving forward and improving.

15. Meditation is like weight loss. It's takes time to notice the work you've put in before you see results. Don't be disheartened and persevere. Each day I am improving. 

16. As I improve, I notice I am more observant of my thoughts. When I have a thought which provokes a negative reaction (i.e a knot in my stomach) I catch myself questioning the thought and whether it is rationale in the context of the situation. I then stop (or attempt to stop) my thought and replace it with a more reasonable and rationale thought. This doesn't happen every time - I still go into autopilot from time to time, but I find more and more I am becoming more observant and intercepting my negative thoughts on a more regular basis.

My sessions have since ended, but I still go back and add to this list from time to time. Perhaps in sharing my list, it may be of benefit to someone else. ",14,2017-12-11 02:18:06 EST-0500

A lot of the posts here are about people's troubles (which is ok, people need help and there's support for them here), so it's always great when people post supportive messages. 

So, everything will be okay. Panicking isn't gonna solve a problem, just take a second, a minute, an hour, maybe even a day to just take a time out and calm down. I wish you all the best, it inspires me to see how much you guys are able to go through and still survive. ",25,2017-04-24 16:38:54 EDT-0400

My teacher said he didn't realise I was nervous until I mentioned the fact, and he said that I did very well to calm myself down and carry on. After he said this, he gave me top marks so I'm super happy :D

984,I just had an enlightening anxiety attack.,"So typical Friday night after work. Go home turn on the tv watch something. I decided let's change ""typical"". So I threw on my big headphones. Turned on ""Wish you were here"", closed my eyes and laid down. 

After about three songs in I caught my mind wandering. I have ADD so I thought Damnit! I can never pay attention to anything (a thought that I have quite often) and then suddenly for the first time I thought WHY? Why does it matter that I don't pay attention... that's who I am... why do I get mad at myself for being me?...

BOOM ANXIETY ATTACK

pop off the headphones and race outside to go on a walk. 

Panic attack lasted about 10 minutes but the whole time I could only think one thought, Why do I get mad at myself for being me?

Then it hit me. That's just what I've grown up doing... but I can change it. And then...

BOOM PANIC ATTACK ENDS

Now I have set a goal. To be me. To be happy. To not question why I do things, but to live in the moment and understand who I am. 

Tonight was amazing. I can finally say I am glad I had a panic attack. 

(Also I had my Xanax prescription in pocket the entire time and I decided not to take it!!!! Small victory)

985,Little Anxiety and FitBit humor I shared with my therapist earlier today,"I have a FitBit that can track my heart rate. I got it through work because they would reimburse me $100 through a health program we have.

Well I have had panic attacks while wearing it. Since my FitBit tracks my heart rate it classified those time periods as being in the 'cardio workout' zone for heart rate. I thought this was slightly funny as during those times I am usually curled up in my bed not doing any sort of workout, and my therapist saw the humor in it and thought it was funny as well so I figured I would share it with all of you.

So apparently I should refer to my panic attacks as cardio workouts instead.",12,2017-04-27 00:57:48 EDT-0400

992,"I'm scared, Im only 15, I used to be depressed/ suicidal, I have adhd, obsessive/ intrusive anxiety along with mild depersonalization and derealisation and i think its getting worse. i cant live like this..","Throwaway because my brother knows my account name.
Basically, ive always had pretty bad anxiety as a kid, and I was diagnosed adhd when i was 14.  I should add that I had/have a prescription for dex amphetamine and ritalin. 

When I was a kid I usually had anxiety about things that could actually happen. 

now its things like being terrified about terrorists invading my country that is two continents away and stuff like obsessive thoughts that if the terrorists saw tht i was circumcised Or not i would get murdered.

When i was 14 i smoked weed, it gave me dp/dr symptoms, but I didnt care and took a break of 5 months. I think this might have triggered an underlying anxiety thing in me, or at least worsened it.

Than I smoked and still felt a little weird when not stoned, like not being able to close my eyes for longer then 5 seconds because of flashes. There were a few more but I forgot.

I started smoking atleast once a week, commonly with some friends. We used to go through upto 4 or 5 grams in one day, usually across 2 or 3 people. 

I started feeling a bit weird once because I needed to take an extra 5mgs of ritalin in my prescription. I felt like a zombie and someone said t might've been dp dr. 


So my anxiety mind goes full research and scares itself alot, and becomes even more paranoid. This also led to increased anxiety when smoking.

I still smoked every now and then and all seemed fine. Untill I went full research again and decided that with my anxiety I shouldn't be smoking.

I decided to take a break from weed for a while, which lasted 1 week total. I smoked a gram I think, spread out in 1 hour. I took maybe 0.1 gram with me home because I got it from a friend, So that was what happened last week. 

So 4/20 comes along and I decided to roll 1 mid sized joint/ spliff which was propably the best joint I ever rolled. It was a 1 part weed plus some stems 5 parts loose tobacco.

So I got a little stoned on that day, mostly nicotine headrush but it was fun. The next day I take my usual 7.5 mg amphetamine prescription in the morning to help with my adhd. I also found 5 mg more amph and My prescription also says to have another 7.5 mgs in the middle of the day, arround 3.

So i had 12.5 mg amph and I took it at 4 in the middle of the day. An hour later I felt a little bit of effects, but then I feel my depersonalization playing up, weird head pressure and reduced hearing were my most common symptoms. 

This gives some anxiety but it was fine, definetely not something to worry about too much. I spent the entire evening researching some stuff I was hyperfocused on. 

I staye up in bed till it was 2.30 in the morning, basically on my phone. i wook up 4 hours later at 7, the weird head pressure and dp dr still there. Its 6 noon now and its still here. 

I dont take my meds in the weekends so maybe its just a comedown? I usually dont get these but i took 5mgs more yesterday so maybe thats it, I just had a small anxiety attack about this.

Im gonna tell my parents about my drug use. I have a problem, because I know the drugs worsen my anxiety, but I cant stop for longer than a month. I used to be deprressed a year ago, and Thats kinda gone but now Im numb.


Please help, is this just a comedown?

I've suffered from anxiety and depression for about 5 years. I used to think it started with my specialty, which is one of the high risk surgical fields. I thought it grew into me with my training. Eventually I sought out treatment. I saw a psychiatrist and I was put on Lexapro which worked well for the anxiety and depression.

Unfortunately Lexapro made me very dizzy and I never got over it, so I was on Cymbalta for a year or two which seemed much better. I still suffered from extreme fatigue, brain fog, memory problems, and thirst. I attributed this to working extremely long hours, family and personal stress - and even the side effects of the Cymbalta.

I checked my thyroid, which was normal. I checked my calcium and it was slightly high. For a year we followed my calcium and PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels and they were raised. After two years of messing around, I was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma in my neck. It's a benign tumor that raises the calcium in your blood and causes a lot of side effects, including anxiety. My anxiety was poorly controlled even on Cymbalta and seemed to be breaking through even on higher doses.

The adenoma is out and I'm already on half dose Cymbalta (30mg). My symptoms have lifted like a cloud lifting off the ground. Even though baseline bloods were done on me before I started medication, always remember to rule of medical causes of anxiety like thyroid, parathyroid or medications.

If I don't have my entire attention occupied on something, it gets even worse.  I'll start tearing up out of nowhere and my body will feel like its shaking a bit.

I'm reminded that inactivity actually creates a lot of tension in the body. I was listening to some music and being by myself I unabashedly made a silly hand gesture to the rythm and I could feel a kind of release from the sense of tenseness.

It's just a reminder for all of us I think. It's pretty darn constructive to move your body properly every once in a while if you're usually not very active. Whenever the snow passes I want to start jogging again :)",18,2017-01-04 19:37:02 EST-0500
1015,Lexapro turned my life around.,"Hey All,

Just wanted to throw my hat in here. I have suffered from anxiety and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm a guy in my early 20s, and I thought ""enough is enough"". I was constantly over analyzing myself and every situation. My flaws seemed huge to me, and I assumed everyone thought negatively of me all the time. My life was consumed by a spiral of negative thoughts and social anxiety. 

I went to my doc, admitted my social anxiety, and he prescribed me Lexapro 10mg/day. I took my first pill a few days ago, and not two hours later, I had nearly complete relief of my anxiety of all kinds. The bad thoughts completely stopped. They say it could take up to six weeks to get any benefit from the medication, but that was not my experience. The bad side of that is I was not able to sleep well the last few days, and am just now not nauseated. I'm waiting for more side effects to appear, I'm sure they will. I can feel the sexual side effects that are described and the inability to cry, but I'm still joyful. 

I can't believe it. My life has done a complete 180 as of earlier this week. I went from being socially awkward and anxious to just being... me. To being a leader. It's like all the noise from outside was turned down to near silence and I can think and focus and perform at the top of my game. I lead a meeting yesterday with 20 people whom I don't know and just sailed through it. I was in disbelief the whole time.

I'm saying this to say that there is still hope - don't discount SSRI's like I did for so long. This isn't an ad for Lexapro (although I'm a believer now), but I hope this might convince one or two people to give meds an honest shot. I believe in myself now. I believe in my life now!

I'll answer any questions. Best of luck everyone.

This is a story that it repeats itself since my first relationship, Till now I have 3 long relationships (I am 30 yo btw), 2 with woman and 1 a man, that's not the problem itself

Its always the same, I began confident and when the time pass I become more clingy and needy, even posesive with my partners, i think that kills the 2 first relationships, Now with my third one I was able to do different, till one day on last june I have a  horrible panic and anxiety attack, since then it was a roller coaster for me and my boyfriend, I go to 2 therapist, none of then know how to deal with me, then my boyfriend almost break with me in september and my reaction afterwards was of guilty and a enormous sadness and depression, Then I tried to kill myself, don't do it at last, but go the next day to ER and then to a psychiatric hospital, being med since then, the anxiety got calmed and I was more in control now, except from times when I think my relationship is in trouble, then I become more anxious, clingy, needy and with a overwhelming fear of lose my BF, of course this is something he no tolerates, additionally I tend to develop some kind of second ""personality"" to deal with people around me because Recently I notice I have a terrible social phobia and cant deal with people I don't know normally. This is ironic, because I want to Know new people, hug everyone and being over expensive with the ones that I like. I'm kind of ambiguous right now, and don't even know how I feel like this

Last year on december 31 my BF was decided to broke with me definitely, this was my worst nightmare come true, so I burst in tears, scream and get the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, then calm down, dominate myself and try to speak with him, at last we are more or less stable and talk the things, even that day I knew about this second ""personality"" of mine, 
He said he cannot tolerate more my anxiety and that he wants me to being an adult, acting like one, being independent and not needy and clingy with him. I know my relationship is almost over, but at least I want to prove that I am worthy of being alone with myself, I don't want him to get out of my life, at least I want to become a friend, but i don't want to make him suffer because of my condition, and I don't want to be alone without someone who understands me and hear me (I am crying, is fear itsellf, I know) 

I am working with myself, try mantras, meditation, even going to see a doctor yesterday to make a formal diagnosis to know my condition, but I still wonder if this is by the lack of something chemical or it is a condition itself, even if is the anxiety that trigger everything else

I am so confused, I need a guide and it will be more than a month to know the results of yesterday's diagnosis test

I don't know how to deal with this anymore, don't even recognise myself or what I do, I lost control of myself at this point, do you have any idea?

The Day before I start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, I start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the next day.

I start losing sleep, I toss and turn at Night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.

Then the Day of this thing rolls around, I wake up in an absolute foul mood, I set off 3 hours earlier than I probably should have just because I can't bear the thought of sitting in the house when I have this thing coming up (I psychically cannot relax, my body won't allow me). I've tried staying at home knowing I have some appointment later in the day, and I honestly feel like I'm trapped in a jail cell.

But then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. This thing I've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes I honestly feel like I'm losing my sanity. I go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done.",58,2017-05-11 01:04:04 EDT-0400
1025,Being Taken Off Suicide Watch,"I've struggled with anxiety and sensory perception disorder my whole life. Last summer (between Junior and Senior year of high school) I planned to commit suicide to escape my anxiety. I couldn't turn off my brain and I couldn't handle it anymore. I had a therapist and saw a psycologist but they only made it worse, the therapist honestly shouldn't be allowed to practice.

I held two bottles of anxiety pills in my hands considering taking them. They would have killed me. But instead I walked to my parents and handed over all my medicine and told them I needed more help or I would die, I was finally honest about how bad it was. I spent most of my summer in and out of the ER and in an adolecent psych ward where I got help.

I am off of suicide watch now. I don't self harm anymore. I have control over my anxiety. Of course I still struggle with panic attacks and some situations but I found healthy ways to cope. I haven't cut since August. 

I'm just posting not only because I am proud of how far I've come, and I have just finished my stressful IB diploma exams. But I also want to give hope to people. I did it. I got help. I'm alive and I honestly thought I wouldn't make it here. Anxiety is part of my life, but it doesn't control me. I am alive. ",58,2017-05-12 22:40:29 EDT-0400
1026,I did it. I ran my first 5k alone.,"It was exhilarating and awesome. At first, I had decided not to run it. The race was one of the two options my professor offered for extra credit on the math final (or we could build a robotic project). I chose the latter because there was no way I felt that I could do the run alone. Besides, none of my friends could do it because of their jobs and busy schedules. But this morning I woke up feeling depressed/angsty. I sat there thinking for a while but a few minutes later I randomly chose to go at the very last minute. 

When I pulled into the parking lot I had a huge wave of anxiety hit me when I saw hundreds of people. I wanted to run away and go home but I chose to stay instead. It was difficult to just walk amongst the large crowds and being alone kind of exacerbated my anxiety. I registered and waited until the race started. Those 25 minutes of waiting felt like hell. 

Then the race started. I did struggle a bit in the beginning (not very athletic) but by the end of the race, I was really happy. I also met some amazing people on the way and we all encouraged each other to keep going, even if we were complete strangers. I would've never imagined doing something like this out of the blue, especially alone, but I did it! I do not regret this decision at all. This is a start!

1031,Recently I've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job.,"My doctor and counselor have me listed as Extreme Anxiety and Depression, Early childhood PTSD, Bi polar, borderline personality disorder. It's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. This has been an on going problem my whole adult life. My first job, I had reasons for being depressed. I dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and I didn't have a stable housing situation, I was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. I didn't want to call myself weak though and admit I had a problem, so I attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. 

I skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything I could to feel numb. 5 years later, because I didn't seek help or medication early on, I was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not working properly. I have had a girlfriend for 4 years now, I just play games now and skate, no negative influences in my life.

None the less, last month I lost my job, where both my girlfriend and i worked together, and commuted together for 2 hours everyday. We both made pretty decent incomes, My girlfriend is my back bone and structure to things getting better in my life. I can't thank her enough despite me losing my job and making the workplace awkward for her. 

She helped me apply for disability. She helped me stay in contact with my Advocate for whatever questions needed to be answered. We filled out the questionnaire's together and made the best of a shitty situation, we have savings to go off of, luckily we live with her father in a nice location in California Rent free, we cover utilities and our phone bill/internet and that's it. Well, has and groceries as well, we just do our best on her one income until my SDI gets submitted and approved. I'm currently seeking my residency and gathering needed paperwork for the drivers written test, then I can finish my SDI application.


My point to all this is I would be homeless and probably dead without her. She has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, I've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her.  I have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (I'm 24, she's 21 later this year) I wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a Taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. 



I just hope that I get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. She put off school for me from the very beginning, the least I can do is help her get through school. 

Sorry about the rant. I hope everyone has a great day.

1035,Panic attack at the gym,"Today my husband and I were at the gym together. He REALLY enjoys his gym time. It's his chance to de-stress, and work hard and relax. We have a rule that we go together but work out separately. Today I was running on the treadmill and started have a severe panic attack about work responsibilities (I am a young associate in a big law firm and I'm near my breaking point between the hours/stress). I walked into one of the yoga rooms that wasn't being used, and started having short breaths and chest pains. I was struggling to control it or myself. Tears welling. Fuck I was lost.  A minute later the door opens and my husband walks in. He wraps me in a hug and says ""sssh come here"". I just started bawling. He held me and said had me do my deep breathing with him. Then when I finally calmed down I apologized to him for ruining his workout (his sweat and dried and he was cooled down). He said ""babe lets work out together. You'll feel better.""  we did some great circuit training and then came home, opened wine and ordered sushi.

Today, I tried to get an appointment for a therapist, to no avail, and this put me in a really depressed mood.

Then- my Geography teacher sent me some work to do in an envelope, with a letter of support.

I always feel like my hair is *never* right, and when I put clothes on no matter how good it looks it always feels like something is off about my shirt or pants or shoes.

And this applies to everything like whenever I learn something I always feel like I'm not learning it right or doing it right. I've been playing guitar for 6 years now but still know virtually nothing about scales, chords, hell I don't even know most brands of guitars or amps or pedals or any of that stuff at all. So it makes me feel like everything I do with guitar isn't genuine.

1046,politics are making me sick,"I know this sub isn't super political, and I'm not trying to take a side and argue for demopubs or republicrats, but I feel like I could use some advice. I've only recently come to acknowledge my anxiety issues, so I thought maybe you folks could help out.


It doesn't matter what side you are on politically, or if you are - like I am - more in the moderate/independent sphere. It's hard not to look at Washington DC right now and not feel like the whole damn country is about to collapse. The president and his people are involved with Russia, maybe? They are changing health insurance, or they aren't, or they are, or they aren't etc....the country feels like it's totally unstable and chaotic right now. I'm definitely angry at Republicans right now because they look like such villains, but the democrats aren't exactly charging in to save the day, so I am not super happy with them either. 


I feel oppressed, and in truth my life hasn't really changed much at all since Trump (but then he hasn't really DONE very much successfully yet). I think it might be more in my head than anything. But I can't turn it off. I can't stop being afraid of what's going on here. My anxiety often causes sleep problems, stomach issues, etc...but it's getting so much worse lately.


I have thought about trying to avoid any and all news sources, but I don't even know how other than sticking my head in the sand. Is it a good idea to quit social media for a while, and try to avoid checking media websites? Is there a better way to shed this anxiety? I feel like this is the extra bit of anxiety that's going to rip my psyche apart but I'm not really sure how to fix it, short of...I don't know, moving to Canada. I wish I just didn't care, but my country is such a big part of what I grew up being taught to believe in, and I feel like its downfall has begun. I guess when I have a problem in my own life, even when it feels big I know somewhere in my mind that it's small. But this one...outside my quivering stomach, this still feels like a really big deal.

1053,"DAE feel like they are so good at hiding their anxiety, the people don't believe you when you tell them you're anxious?","As the title implies, I feel like after dealing with anxiety for over a decade I've gotten my poker face perfected. When I had my first panic attack in high school I had no idea how to hide it. The first few months after my anxiety really kicked in I cried and freaked out in public, in class, at 2am with my mom, you name it. Eventually, I learned to sort of keep it under wraps, and I feel like it's been that way ever since.

 I've gone on to hold multiple stressful jobs, am currently doing well in a very rigorous grad school program, have plenty of friends, and have been in a great relationship for over 3 years, and all this time I feel like I have been able to mostly keep it hidden. While my anxiety definitely waxes and wanes, I feel like I never mention it to anyone unless it is to the point it is unbearable, and even then I just excuse myself and say I feel anxious without making a scene, or I make jokes about it.

Now this has recently become a problem. With some additional stressors in my life I feel like my anxiety is coming back in full force and while I probably seem the same from the outside, I'm starting to have multiple panic attacks a day/ high levels of anxiety, while driving, hanging out with friends, in class etc. When I try to bring it up I feel like people don't believe me because I don't ""seem"" anxious. I probably look fine on the outside but I am having an absolute meltdown inside my head. 

Anyways not sure what the solution is to all this. Is it good to keep your anxiety under control outwardly even if it isn't the same inwardly? I certainly can't express every time I feel anxious, I would never get anything done and would probably be the biggest downer in the world to hang out with.  The other day I expressed to my gradschool counselor that my anxiety was getting really bad but he said I looked like everything was under control and my grades were great so why don't I just drink some tea, take a bath, and meditate. I wanted to scream, like oh all I have to do is take a bath and my TEN YEARS OF ANXIETY ARE CURED???? GEE THANKS!

I usually don't go out because I'm not comfortable with how I look and depression tends to make me look more on the unkempt side. I haven't been outside in a while and my mom wanted me to go the supermarket.

I gathered my courage and braved it out. i admit I did look a bit not well put together my hair was kind of frizzy  and messy. But i did my best to tame it and i was wearing a baggy sweater with sunglasses, but I thought to myself ""I'm just going to the market, not the red carpet"" I almost regretted my decision when i stepped out  because I saw lots of people my age and they were well dressed. That gave me a lot of anxiety and I saw some give me weird looks. But i decided to try and not be so sensitive and ignored if i thought they might have looked at me bad or not, since no matter what i look like, i still have a right to be outside and get food. 


That thinking did help me a lot. I thought i was going to have a panic attack and run back home. But i kept going! I'm not sure when the next time i will go out, but I'm glad i was able to get some food and not care that much of what others thought especially of my looks and kind of go on autopilot mode! since it is kind of rare or maybe I'm just tired of caring so much lol.

My hands begin to shake, I start to stutter, I start to worry about if she can tell, I hesitate, and then I just forget about it. *sigh*

I usually just tell myself 'well if confidence is so important that she can't see all my wonderful qualities, then I don't want to be with anyone like that anyway, hmph!"" (But really I'm actually very sad).

I got my first job at a gas station. Tomorrow is my first day of training.    
I'm so happy but I'm also scared as fuck at the same time.    
I'll be there for 4 hours and I never did something like this before.   
What if I can't do it? What if people think I'm weird?     
I'm so shaken right now. 

I GOT A JOB!

**EDIT:** Okay guys, I had almost 4hours of sleep today. I woke up at 6:30am even though my alarm goes off at 7:00am/7:30am because I had nausea, diarrhea and stomache cramps. So I spend half an hour on the toilet until I felt good enough to move again. I went back to bed to try and catch my last 30mins of sleep but my cat decided he wanted to play instead and kept waking me up.     
I lied in bed, hoping I wouldn't die from sleep deprivation or diarrhea, until I was feeling better and then went to take a shower.   
After that I made myself some tea.    
I have 45mins left until I have to leave the house, then I have 10-15mins to arrive at the gas station. I just hope I don't shit my pants. 

**EDIT 2:** Okay guys. I just went and because the higher ups are coming over today, the manager wasn't able to train me. I was glad but also a bit disappointed. At least I got my nervousness out of my system so I can start fresh tomorrow. I felt like shit today and I'm not sure if I would've been able to work hard but tomorrow I'll be more rested and more efficient!   
I'm just worried because the manager said I'll be working 4-6h, maybe 8h and that's a bit much for my first day but I'll handle it!    ",23,2017-12-04 13:31:24 EST-0500

1086,"I become so Obsessed with things i like that it takes away the enjoyment i have with it, how do i stop?","A while ago I discovered this music group that is obscure in the west. I have so far downloaded most of their albums and singles from a career of over 20 years, so it's a lot to put it simply. Besides that I have a folder with nearly 80gb of videos and pictures of one of the singers. 

Its hard to keep up with news about them since I don't speak the language, and I'm always on a state of nerves to keep myself updated, trying to find streams or downloads of the latest TV appearances,etc. I browse a forum for the singer in their language, and for some reason whenever I see a new post I get all anxious, I immediately past it on google translate only to read gibberish. 

Recently I came across an exhaustive list of all of their songs. Some of those I just can't find, and I'm getting really anxious about it. Just now I was trying to find them, and I got so worked up over it that I'm still having a little bit of pain on my chest, and my eyelid won't stop twitching. The fact that I'll probably never listen to those makes me so anxious.

I hate to be like this, this takes away all of enjoyment I get from listening to them, watching videos,etc. I hate this. ",15,2017-12-06 22:25:18 EST-0500
1087,I DID IT! (Huge Step),"Well, everyone, I conquered about the toughest thing I have ever had to do related to my anxiety.

I haven't had really *bad* anxiety attacks in a few years now, but I had to face the dentist to have teeth extracted last week. This is one of my biggest triggers. Not because of pain, pain I can do. Because of the freezing making my tongue numb and the feeling I'm choking. The last time I went to the dentist I had to bolt and reschedule because I just couldn't get through the procedure. 

This time I did it. I thought about going to my physician for a mild sedative, but as it came closer to the date, I just repeated to myself that I'd be okay, and I just had to get it done.

Finally, that day came last thursday, and right before, after they did the freezing, I thought I was going to have to bolt again, but I just took a 5 minute break and came back, and they did the procedure. Now, I'm not going to say it didn't feel weird or it didn't hurt. My jaw still hurts from it a week later.

*But I did it!*

1110,"TIL: Dictionary's word of the day, ""Ataraxia,"" is what we want to achieve.","Definition: ""a state of freedom from emotional disturbance and anxiety; tranquillity.""

Origin: Ataraxia ‚Äúimpassiveness, calmness‚Äù is best known from and associated with the ethics of the Athenian philosopher Epicurus (341‚Äì270 b.c.). It is acquired by shunning politics and obnoxious people, by paying no attention to the gods or an afterlife, and by devoting oneself to trustworthy friends and a simple life. Ataraxia was important to the Stoic philosophers, also, but for them the final goal was apatheia, which means not ‚Äúapathy‚Äù in the modern sense but ‚Äúcalmness,‚Äù imperturbability gained from the pursuit of virtue. Ataraxia (spelled atarxie) entered English in the early 17th century.",11,2017-02-02 04:07:19 EST-0500
