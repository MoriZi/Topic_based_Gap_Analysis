8,"It took me a while to realise my depression was caused by anxiety. This is how I overcame anxiety, it might help?","I definitely had abnormally high anxiety since I was a young child. I was bullied and my parents put very high demands on me to do well so that wouldn't have helped. When I was about 16 I became depressed and eventually overcame it, by overcoming my anxiety.

A lot of people reading this probably have more severe anxiety, I was pretty typical GAD sufferer:

- I feared social interaction. I remember my heart used to race just from talking in online games let alone real life.

- I feared being around people. I couldn't cough in crowded rooms, use public restrooms, make eye contact and during the bad times my legs would buckle while walking if I knew people where watching me, so sometimes I would get stuck.

- Never danced or sung in my life or even tried. Stays completely still during rock concerts.

- Failed almost every oral presentation due to not doing it.

- No sports, no girlfriends, only a few really really nice understanding friends.

- Finally, fear of failure so strong you don't try leading you to fail at life bringing on depression. Lose job, fail out of uni, family asks you to move out etc.

I overcame most of these by joining a martial art, I don't know how else to say it really, I was forced to go to a martial art dojo. The first few times I was absolutely shitting myself as I had to move! and sometime they made noises! but I was lucky in that I was forced to go. After about a month I did my first grading and was once again shitting myself as everyone was watching me but I had this weird sense of confidence, knowing I had the full support of my peers and many hours of training, I knew I could do it and I did!

Fast forward 12 months and I have so much more confidence in myself. My posture is better, I'm more fit, I'm more friendly, I'm better at talking to people, I stopped playing video games and watching TV, I went on a few dates (which again where a huge challenge).

I'm still about 100 000 miles from where I want to be, but I don't fear the dark any more. Everybody is different but maybe seeing a factual case of someone actually becoming less anxious will give you hope that it can happen.

These days I'm probably only as nervous as a normal person, public speaking, talking to pretty girls and dancing are probably my biggest fears still, but I feel completely liberated, I'm free from my own mind and I plan to be the least anxious mother fucker in the universe.

**TLDR** I faced my fears in very small incremental steps in a warm, friendly environment that I was forced to go to and it made me less anxious in life",28,2013-05-06 12:49:19 EDT-0400

12,Minor breakthrough today,"So a little background first, I am terrified of driving. (bridges, freeways, and one underpass close to where i live) Well I'm 18 and still haven't learned to drive so my dad has been pushing me to go out and drive. I generally have an attack when we first start driving. My dad understands I have issues with driving so he hasn't really pushed me to do any of the things that really freak me out. 

Well today after half an hour or so, I needed to get into the center of town. There are three ways to do that. One, get on the freeway which I refuse to do right now, two is to go along a truck rout and that takes about five or more minutes longer, and third is to go through a very tight and small underpass. As we were about to turn to get onto the truck rout, I said screw it and went straight to the underpass. Now mind you, I was gripping the wheel with white knuckles and my dad was just as shocked as me. I never push myself so I have no idea why I chose to face one of my fears today. 

I was scared as all get out and the few seconds I was in there felt like forever but I am glad I did it. After I did it we stopped at a gas station so I could get out and breath. 

I thought you all would like my little story and maybe it can help, I don't know. That underpass still scares me but I know I have to try and face my fears if I ever want to live a semi normal life. ",7,2013-05-01 06:09:18 EDT-0400
13,Phone calls,I get anxious whenever I talk on the phone with someone I don't know. It gets really annoying and to the point where I stumble over words and can barely get out a sentence. I don't know why this happens because I am perfectly fine in face-to-face situations but there is something about not being able to see another person that makes me anxious as all hell. Are there any tricks or ways to get rid of this? It is really getting in the way of being a productive person.,19,2013-05-07 06:13:34 EDT-0400
14,I beat GAD / SAD 6 years ago without meds. Hope I can help.,"As the title suggests, I recovered from Generalized anxiety (GAD) and Social anxiety (SAD) about 6 or 7 years ago (I am 31 now) without the help of medications. I wanted to make a post that will hopefully help a few people through their conditions. I will try to be brief and get to the point, so i'll provide a short backstory and then get to what cured me.

Backstory: I started getting panic attacks at around 18, which lead to quite crippling GAD and then SAD. At my worst I was unable to leave the house for more than short periods of time. I had dozens of panic attacks daily, could barely interact with anyone but family, and was underemployed for many years. I tried dozens of medications for the first couple years, but nothing really treated me effectively, and many made things worse. I suffered immensely until I was 24.

I started seeing a therapist, who insisted that I had some deep seated trauma in my childhood causing my anxiety. Like probably most of you, there was nothing apparent causing my anxiety. It just happens to some people with no specific cause. My therapist kept digging for something, and I kept wasting money and saw no progress.

Therapy was a bust and I was completely hopeless. What changed my life was a book: Feeling Good by David Burns. It introduced me to the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

I quickly realized that knowledge is power. I read about a dozen books about CBT, learned everything I could about anxiety and depression (namely, that negative thoughts are the root of the issue) and worked persistently through it all.

I spent about a year doing daily CBT exercises that I found in various books and on the internet. I LIVED this stuff. Every time I had a negative thought, I plucked it out and rationalized it. Told myself over and over that these thoughts were wrong and that I need to break the bullshit habit of irrational thought.

After maybe 6 months of CBT, I felt significant improvement. After a solid year, I was probably 75% cured. 6 years later, today, I can honestly say it's 95% gone. I've had maybe two panic attacks since, and I was able to talk myself through them so easily, they didn't last more than 2 minutes.

I'm now confident, successful, employed in a fantastic job and live independently. I didn't turn into the life of the party; I still need to work at social interaction, but I barely flinch at things that used to send me into a panic attack just thinking about.

I'm happy to answer any questions or provide details for anyone that needs it. I'm not suggesting that CBT will work for everyone and that medications are useless (they are extremely beneficial in certain situations) but I want to share my story in hopes that some people will benefit.",16,2013-05-02 05:56:37 EDT-0400

17,"Let's talk about cigarettes, smokers with anxiety disorders","So who here is a cigarette smoker? I'm very interested in this for I am a cigarette smoker who has anxiety and panic. Regardless of what we discuss we all need to quit, I just find it so difficult and I'm sure many do. The reason is because being a smoker allows you easy escape from situations without it being too abrupt. The simple line of ""I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette"" can get you out of any situation. But with the smoking comes the health anxiety, at least in my case. I am constantly worrying about health problems caused by smoking cigarettes. I am only 23 years old and have only been smoking for 2 and a half years, but it's time to quit while Im ahead and it's time to take more control of anxiety and panic.

 I wanna hear your stories. Anybody successfully quit? How'd you go about it? What other ways do you manage your anxiety without the smokes? Anybody still a smoker and wanting to quit?",29,2013-05-05 01:40:44 EDT-0400

25,I am a guy who used to suffer from social anxiety and no longer does (AMA),"/u/rainman18 asked me on /r/meditation to describe what had changed for me. I typed a long response for him and, as luck would have it, lost the response. So I decided to visit here and share my development

I am male and have the background probably most of you have
1) Super anxious mother, absent dad. No one to turn to when I couldn't take my mom anymore. She did a lot of things that didn't exactly have the outcome of, er, pacifying my anxiety.
2) Terrified of talking to girls
3) Might as well have gotten my doctorate for all the research I did into anxiety and all the rumination I expended on. For long stretches, EVERY. WAKING. THOUGHT. of mine was about how to outsmart or out-think or manage my anxiety.
4) Enormously self-critical of my performance and my anxiety and my thinking
5) Fundamentally unhappy even though I came to develop compensatory behaviors which fooled a lot of people into thinking I was confident.

I'm not going to spend anymore time discussing the ways I suffered over the years for brevity's sake. If you are interested, go ahead and ask :)

Now on to how I overcame anxiety

As I said above, I spent many years researching and ruminating and plotting/developing compensatory behaviors for my anxiety. About a year ago, as part of this neverending search, I came across a book named Search Inside Yourself by Chade Meng Tan. It introduced me to mindfulness from a neuroscientific/practical benefit perspective. For someone with a hyper critical mind, I think its emphasis really suited my need for specific outcomes and efficacy data.

And so I began to meditate. Being brash, I started off meditating for an hour and spent the hour being utterly frustrated and incensed at myself for not being able to pay any quality attention to my breath. But the next morning, I swear, the world looked more garish, more vibrant. I was sold. 

Over the next couple of months I would continue these hour-long sits in which I would spend 80-90% of the time running the mental treadmill over these thoughts ""I don't know if I'm doing this right. This doesn't feel right. I think if I pay attention to the vibration of the breath in my nostrils I'll be able to stay mindful for longer. No.. that didn't work. Dammit! Why isn't this working?"" Sitting turned into a deeply unhappy, hyper-critical time in which I obsessed more about whether I was meditating correctly, or how I could meditate better, than actually, you know, meditating. 

I can't even say that I was being diligent in the frequency of my meditation. Over the last year, I've meditated an average of one day a week - maybe. A stretch of 3-5 days followed by some life disruption (usually tiredness) and then 2 weeks off. But I did try during my waking hours to pay attention to my breath whenever I could. Ironically, this meant that I carried the same hyper-criticism and dissatisfaction and unhappiness into even neutral activities. But, in retrospect, it did provide a diversion from my usual, *consuming*, habit of ruminating all day everyday about my anxiety.

During driving, during conversations with my mom, and so on I would try to come back to the breath. The intention and determination to stay mindful was always there and I can't precisely explain why. After maybe 5 or 6 months I noticed that my mind was getting quieter. I used to talk in my head A LOT but that had diminished - and would continue to diminish over the months. My anxiety was largely there and my avoidance behaviors and compensatory behaviors and ruminating thinking was still there. I still couldn't approach any girls if you put a gun to my head. I could barely make eye contact with strangers for fear that they would be offended. The self criticism was still strong. I would still rather have died than turned to a friend or loved one and shared my problems with anxiety, or my two academic suspensions from an Ivy League school (simply could not function due to performance anxiety), or that I was a virgin who had never had a girlfriend.

But something was happening. In an ineffable sense, it got a bit quieter in my head, and then I started to loosen up here and there. I would say yes to invitations from friends (I never accepted ANY invitations from friends before), I would hold eye contact (even with girls!), smile, and even say hi to strangers. Now, full disclosure, a lot of these developments occurred because there were times when I wouldn't feel anxiety. Times, for instance, when I would look at a girl and my chest wouldn't constrict painfully and I wouldn't feel like a deer in headlights. Sans the associated physical symptoms, I behaved healthily. 

But. Nine months in, the higher hanging fruit in my anxiety totem pole - sharing intimate details with people (people, even those who barely know me, have often called me out for being closed off), conversing with my mum (especially about anxiety triggering topics), approaching girls - all of those still triggered the physical symptoms of anxiety and avoidance. I was convinced that the key to beating my anxiety was abating the overwhelming physical symptoms of anxiety which trigger avoidance. I was wrong.

To cut a long story short, over the last three months, three key events happened which helped break me completely free of anxiety. The first was having my first ever girlfriend. The second was her breaking up with me 3 days after we were together due to insecure, compensatory habits I had developed for my anxiety in the past and my ensuing deep guilt and soul searching, and the third was a meditation retreat I attended.

Today, I still feel anxiety. I still trigger avoidance when I feel the physical symptoms of anxiety. But there's a clear difference in my response. The moment I feel those physical symptoms and that avoidance, I have this ineffable intuitive sense that attending to my anxiety in a certain way only increases my suffering, I have this intuitive sense that *I have a choice* about whether to cultivate the anxiety or let it go, and I have this intuitive sense of how exactly to let it go.

Think of it like playing basketball. You shoot the ball and it goes into the basket, broadly speaking. But you have only an intuitive sense of how you're able to calculate how far the basket is, how much spin to give the ball, what arc to give the ball. Now think of what happens when a beginner plays in a basketball game when someone applies defensive pressure to them. Their brain gets scrambled because of their anxiety and they lose the ability make use of that intuitive sense. But look at a professional player. He is not oblivious to the defensive pressure. It still affects him. But he is still able to recover from the momentary mental confusion and tap back into his intuitive sense of how to direct the ball into the hoop, even though he could never tell you how he's able to do it. 

That's how it is with anxiety and me. It arises like a bubble and I experience it and something tells me that I don't have to continue paying attention to it in a certain way (what 'in a certain way' means, I will never be able to explain in words). So I direct my attention to my breath. SOMETIMES, my attention will instantly go forcefully back to the physical symptoms and my mental confusion will return and this will happen over and over again. The KEY DIFFERENCE is that whereas before I would have questioned whether I was being mindful in the correct way or if my mindfulness was working or whether I needed to tweak my technique or try something different is that I bring my attention right back to my breath, over and over again. SOMEHOW, I'm not sucked into the anxiety. I can't explain it. But it's not voluntary - AT ALL. It just sort of happens in the way the basketball player intuitively knows to fluidly change his pace and his direction at full speed to elude defensive pressure. I could never fully explain it. And that's the thing - I simultaneously have a clear intuitive understanding that if I try to consciously mess with these responses, my anxiety will only inflame and increase. I subconsciously understand exactly how much to get involved and how much to leave alone. I subconsciously understand that attending to the physical emotions of anxiety and mental confusion does something bad to my quality of attention and thinking. How all this came from simply paying attention to the physical sensations of my breath and body, I have no idea - but I really didn't do anything more special than that over the past year.

So looking back, I can safely say that none of the efforts I made to help my anxiety alone were worthwhile. But, at the same time, I'm not even sure I could have helped any of the efforts. The more I meditate, the more I see that it's a very questionable proposition to attribute any of my volitions or emotions - healthy or not - to my doing. In fact, more and more of my creativity and my performance comes from understanding how my drive to manage and exert control and intellectually master/understand only interferes with beautiful processes which are working themselves out. But if you had told me this a year ago today when I found Search Inside Yourself, I'm not sure it would have made a difference even if I had completely believed you. The brain does its own thing. :)

Ask away! I've omitted and truncated here and there because I realized this was turning into a tl'dr :)

39,"Screw you, anxiety","I am SO over this. 

Today started out really good, it was actually an awesome day after what had been kind of a crappy week. My kids were getting along swimmingly, I got a ton of stuff done, it was just good.

After I made lunch and got the little ones down for a nap, I sat down to play online for a little bit and BAM. Anxiety attack. Out of nowhere. WTH?

I beat it though! It happened, I didn't stop it, but I powered through. My husband was asleep after working a 16 hour overnight shift, and he is working again tonight so no way was I going to wake him up. I only had one kid awake, so I set her up with some cartoons and I forced myself to eat, drink some water, I went out and watered the yard, I scrubbed the heck out of the bathroom and I mopped the floor. 

My house looks amazing, and I managed to get through an attack alone. It feels like a big victory!

But seriously. Why do they just hit like that? There was not a single reason for it, at all. I was relaxed and happy. Now, I'm in that tired, kind of achy anxiety-hangover phase. I feel kind of depressed, kind of full of dread that I'll have another one.  Screw anxiety.

I mean, right now... as in, right now at this very moment in time, i feel okay... not ""i can take on anything"" but more the ""i'm feeling okay... not great, but not terrible."" and it's these days that i feel somewhat decent that make me feel like i'm a fake.

Any suggestions you can give for getting that little-hater to STFU?",14,2013-04-09 22:56:30 EDT-0400

Now, I'm pretty sure the guy felt no embarrassment or shame, but whenever I'm asked to repeat what I said, I feel embarrassed and if it happened at a comedy show with hundreds of people, I don't know how I'd cope.

49,Anxiety is seeping into my relationship,"Using a throw away account since my boyfriend is a Reddior.

My boyfriend (25/M) and I (23/F) have been together for 2.5 years. I'd say overall we have a great relationship. We're very much in love, trusting, best friends, supportive..all that good stuff.

I have suffered from anxiety since I was about 16, after my high school boyfriend commited suicide. Nothing too extreme, just constant worry of outcomes.

Now recently I have realized that my anxiety is getting pretty bad in my relationship with my boyfriend. I find myself always questioning his moods(even when there really isn't anything up) I constantly fear that he is mad at me, or will be mad at me if I'm not perfect. Arguments almost cause me to have a panic attack out of fear that he will break up with me. He is the kind of person who after an argument or disagreement would rather just cool off and not talk for a little while. Which becomes hell for me because of the constant ""What is he thinking?"" ""He's going to break up with me"" ""What can I do to fix this before he hates me?""

Last night I was out at a friends, left my phone upstairs to charge. He had texted me to say goodnight. I obviously didn't see it.15 mins later I get a text ""guess you're busy..night"". Immediate panic. He hasn't answered any of my texts yet, most likely because he is still asleep. But I'm still in this weird state of panic that he is so mad at me and I won't be able to deal with arguing.

Can anyone relate, or help?

Edit** Boyfriend is awake now, everything seems perfectly fine, as it normally is. What I was feeling before I finally heard from him was almost unbearable",25,2013-04-10 17:42:58 EDT-0400

60,"Had a panic attack, dissociated to the point where I questioned my own existence.","I'll try to keep this brief.

Last night I was having a hard time dealing with anxiety over having to move. At 1:00 am, I took a 1mg risperidone (that I was prescribed a long time ago - I'm not on any meds now) to help me sleep. At 1:30, I was playing Skyrim, when the worst panic attack I've ever had began. I became so dissociated that I wondered whether or not I even existed. I figured ""I think, therefore I am"", but still felt really dissociated. I went outside for a smoke. The nicotine helped with the dissociation, but when I got back in I started to have full blown panic - the worst I've ever had. I tried to call a crisis hotline, but the only phone I have access to can't receive calls, and this was one of those stupid hotlines that has to call you back. I wrote down some of the things stressing me out (this always seems to help), and by 2:30 I was feeling mostly normal after watching some Futurama for a bit.

What the hell was that? I've never been that dissociated before - even on dissociative drugs!

I called my doctor and set an appointment for Monday. I'm getting back on some meds - I can't handle this anymore.",14,2013-01-25 22:06:07 EST-0500

I didn't dress up to match the theme. As the night went on, the only thing to keep me occupied was to order as many drinks as I could drink at the open bar. My boyfriend introduced me to a few people which was awkward because I had to fake smiles, and I couldn't make conversation because of my anxiety.  

After a while the CEO (I had no idea) started talking to me and then asked if I was having fun. I just kinda froze there and was like ... 'uhh... errr... .... ........I feel out of place'. Bf didn't tell me that was the CEO of the company until a minute after talking with him. I embarrassed my boyfriend with that and now I feel like shit.

One woman behind me honked at me as I was attempting to get into his street. I missed my turn and was lost for a few minutes and when I was at a stop sign and it was my turn to go a kid on his bike passed by right in front of me which made my heart skipped a beat. Luckily I got home safely. I'm still shaking about all of it. It was very unpleasant. And I told my mom I was suffering from anxiety but she didn't believe me.

65,It gets better,"My personal experience started 4 years ago today when I had my first anxiety attack. It's also the day my daughter was born. I started to get light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. I had no idea what was going on. I ended up in the emergency room in the same hospital my wife was delivering in. A month later, I had lost 30 pounds, and was finally diagnosed with anxiety attacks. I started taking some meds, and it took a while but I found some that worked for me. I started changing my habits, eating right, exercising more, finding ways to de-stress, and stopped pushing myself so hard in so many different directions. Today, the anxiety isn't gone, but it's a world of difference from 4 years ago. I'm better. Still taking meds, though a lower dosage, and my wife has been amazingly supportive, even though I'm sure she can't totally understand what I'm going through. She is my hero for the way she had to basically be a single mother while I was getting the help I needed, and she never complained once, though I could see the hurt in her eyes. 

I'm writing this because I want you to know that while you are in the midst of struggling with anxiety, it can feel like a pit you can't get out of. I'm not going to lie, it wasn't a quick fix, but I'm better now. There is hope.",3,2013-01-23 22:38:48 EST-0500

79,I apologize to everyone on /r/anxiety...,"  I just feel a little bit bad because I have finally learned how ignorant I have been when it comes to anxiety. All throughout my life I never knew that anxiety is a diagnosable mental illness that can be treated medically. I always thought that anxiety was a state of mind, an emotion like anger or joy, but not a mental illness like depression or schizophrenia. This was not by any intentional harm on my part, but I grew up hearing it referred to in that way.  
  
  It has not been until recently that I learned how wrong I have been. I finally sought help for my depressive episodes I have been experiencing and my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist and that I be treated for depression and ANXIETY. The moment we began to discuss it I began to realize that I am constantly consumed by my anxiety. I have panic attacks and deep rooted fears of doing or saying the right thing to others. I avoid social interaction and all stimulus that triggers these panic attacks and have all consuming anxiety to the point that getting out of bed is the most difficult part of my day. I thought all these things were just a part of my personality and that I just needed to accept that I am less than others. Things that seem so easy to others is a battle for me every single day. It is very obvious to me now that anxiety may be the root cause of my depression.  
  
  After meeting with a therapist I have found this subreddit and have been educating myself and I am so appalled that I have been so misinformed.  
  
  I would just like to apologize to be one of the many people who have been misinformed about this condition. I would also like to sincerely thank you for the hope that you have given me as a subreddit that I am not alone and that this CAN be treated. Many of the posts I have read here have moved me to tears because I have never related to anything as much as I do to everyone here and I am so grateful to know that I can get better. It won't be easy, but I now know that it is possible.  
Thank you so much for reading.

82,I built a nest,"So, Christmas Eve morning, my partner and I got last-minute asked to host since his parents and sister had no power (Toronto ice storm), and we did.  I panicked.  Big time.  I just wanted everything to go perfectly and started flipping out that I'd ruin it.  We came up with the idea that I'd build a nest.  

I built my nest in the bedroom.  It meant that if I had to excuse myself due to mounting anxiety and panic, I'd have everything I'd need right there.  In my nest I had:

* fresh, cold water
* a clean, made bed
* smoothie - I can't get food down when I'm anxious but can often do smoothies or V8
* phone - for calling my mom or the crisis line
* books
* laptop AND CHARGER
* crackers
* a bowl, for the nausea - if it has to be dealt with, deal with it in private
* TP - for wiping up my mouth in case of nausea

Just knowing it was there made a **huge** difference.  I knew that I had a safe place to go with all the things I need to feel better, and that I could make a quick, quiet escape if need be.  There were a few white knuckle moments, but all in all we had a nice time and his family felt festive, warm, welcome and happy.  Which is what I wanted so badly.

What this lead to was - **nest on the go**.


We packed up my nest and brought it with us to my parents' place the next day.  I was so soothed by the thought that my nest was immediately deployable, that I had my laptop, could access the forums and various breathing technique and visualization sites, had water, crackers, etc - we didn't even need to deploy it.  Just knowing it was there was enough.  

Just thought I'd post in case this helps someone.  Build a nest, and one for on the go!!  They are customizable!!  What would you put in yours?",17,2013-12-28 01:47:11 EST-0500

i'm also a young teenager, so i had to ask my parents for permission. it was a whole big ordeal since they're protective, but in the end, they said yes. yesterday night.

so then i woke up this morning and by an hour ago i was sobbing to my mom that i can't do it, she got angry and told me to stop crying, it wasnt a big deal. and it's not, i'm just stupid, freaking out about some teenage party.

and i -know- that if i don't go, i'm going to regret it and never forgive myself. and if i do go, i might not be able to handle it, with all thsoe people there (imagining it is what made me throw up), and just freak out there, and maybe regret it.

95,In total shock of aunt.,"I'm a pretty quiet guy. I have tons of anxiety and depression from growing up with alcoholic parents. I'm 25 and 2 years ago my dad died from liver failure.

My aunt is a very strict person but comes off as nice. She's in her late 60's and is a court judge. We have never had any type of altercation before. Right now, she's in a town with some family members on her side of the family that I haven't met before. She calls me and wants me to talk to them on the phone. I talk to the two relatives over the phone for a couple minutes each. I thought it went pretty well. One of them actually said ""You should be here taking down shots with (other family member)."" And I said ""Heheh..yeah I guess so.""

After our conversation ended, I expected them to hand the phone back to my Aunt so I could say bye. They didn't hang the phone up, and immediately they start talking about me:

Aunt: ""SO WHAT DID HE SAY??!""
Relative one: ""He said he was excited about Christmas""
Relative two: ""He just gave me a bunch of BS and that was it""
Aunt: ""See. I told you!""
Relative two: ""Yeah""
Aunt: ""He's the hardest person in the WORLD to talk to. He doesn't even drink and sometimes he...""

And at this point I immediately hang up the phone fearing they would see that I'm still on the other end. I don't know what the hell is going on. I have never heard anybody, or any family talk behind my back before like this, immediately felt sick to my stomach. I don't drink because I hate alcohol.

104,I did it.,"As an 18 year old, I got my first job today. Despite not wanting to ever leave my house or speak to anyone due to anxiety, I have a job.

105,How my child helps my anxiety.,"I'm a single mom with a 5 year old child. I'm a domestic violence survivor, and was previously morbidly obese. I've lost around 110 lbs with another 50-60 to go. I have a lot of self esteem related anxiety that I'm sure most of you can relate to. I find myself still thinking of myself as that grossly overweight person and putting myself down in a myriad of ways. I've noticed strangers become confused and uncomfortable when I talk about myself as fat because I don't look that way anymore, and they didn't know me as the person I was before. My sweet child, who doesn't understand things like self loathing and anxiety, tells me every single day that I'm beautiful and the best mamma in the whole wide world. To my knowledge, no one has ever told him to say this or prompted him to do this. There have been days that I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed and felt like a shit person and a shit mom because of that. He said it anyway. It made me smile when nothing else did. It got me out of bed. He has no idea that he helps me, he just loves his mamma. I must not be so bad after all.

106,Does anyone else suffer from irrational guilt?,"Or at least what I am told is irrational guilt. I have a lot of anxiety due to my former job, which involved helping people. I feel huge amounts of guilt for the people I couldn't help or the people I think I should have done a better job for or done things differently for. I've been seeing a therapist, have had many reassuring conversations with friends and former colleagues that I could not have done anything differently, but I feel so bad all the time, like I am living with a great burden. I have other features of anxiety too that are unrelated to this (OCD, irrational fears, etc). My therapist is trying to get me to live comfortably with the worst case scenario, which is the idea that maybe I could have done a better job some of the time, but that's life. But it is really hard and I feel so guilty all the time. I can't enjoy anything good in my life because I feel that I don't deserve it.

My wife has always been aware of my agoraphobia (my version is a fear of crowds), and has put up with me lovingly. Now she knows how deep my fears truly go.

I'm thankful I did it. Thankful for all of you and your posts to motivate me. Thankful for one Redditor in particular. If she's reading this, she knows who she is - thank you from the bottom of my heart.

It's making my social anxiety even worse than it already is, because it's usually better if I just don't say anything. I know what I'm trying to say, but when I'm trying to say it I usually stumble.

111,"""Why are you so quiet?""","So, I consider myself well on the way to recovering from my anxiety disorders (GAD, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, PTSD, OCD) but one of the things I still have a little trouble with is just letting myself talk.  

I want to clarify that I'm very pleased with my progress and that I don't foresee this being an issue for the rest of my life, but it's enough that everyone (not exaggerating) I meet eventually asks me, ""So, why are you so quiet?""  

I usually just shrug and smile.  I feel like answering honestly would just come across as giving excuses.  I've told people I was homeschooled a couple of times (which is true, but I don't like reinforcing the stereotype that ALL homeschooled kids end up socially inept.  The fact that people have been all, ""Aaaaahhh, that explains it!"" the times I've used that line just makes me more reluctant to do it again.)  

Fact is, I'm somewhat unusual, I've had a weird life, and I have some issues that the average person might not understand.  What are some of the ways that you explain to others why you're different when asked?",19,2013-04-02 19:17:04 EDT-0400
112,Had my first anxiety/panic attack 3 months ago. Terrified of living and growing weak.,"To start, I used to drink 3-4 energy drinks a day and one day it caused some sort of attack. I quit energy drinks cold turkey and thought this would be the end of it. Since then I have felt disassociated from real life, overthinking things like looking at my hands and not feeling like they are real, whenever I am driving the left side of my body tingles and I can't stop touching my face. Red lights are a disaster and I can't wait for my car to start moving again, I feel as though since December, my life is on big anxiety attack. I don't know what to do. I have considered seeing a therapist, but I am not worried or anxious about anything, I live a pretty happy life and all of this came out of nowhere. I fear of being put on medication and I have heard that most anxiety/depression medication can cause thoughts of suicide, or make anxiety worse, nausea, and all the other symptoms that I am trying to solve.

113,Does anyone else have problems with their friends/family believing what you say? And not just about your mental health problems? (xposted to r/depression),"I no longer have any friends and am close to only 1 sister, so I have no one to really talk to about this stuff (I guess other than my shrink). Believe me when I say that I appreciate anyone just reading this.

I don't know if it's my anxiety or not but this feeling that my family don't entirely believe me when I tell them things I swear borders on the paranoid (which I guess makes me more anxious, yay).

Eg. I've talked to them many times about my sleeping problems. I have been having disturbed sleep for almost 18months thanks to my AD Cymbalta and it's affected me so much more than I can explain. I'm currently on my 4th kind of sleeping tablets, which kind of work but not really. But they always seem to act like I'm exaggerating or just attention seeking or something. It is so depressing.

Or trying to explain why I still refuse to speak to my father. He's severely bipolar, has a quick temper, is verbally abusive to the point of making you feel like he will become physically abusive, is an insecure narcissist, is extremely racist, prejudice, hates people and is a conspiracy theory pscyho. He didn't like that I wasn't on his 'side' after another long psycho rant about 'blacks', etc, and told me he didn't want anything to do with me and hasn't spoken to me in 2 years. No matter how many times I try to explain this to the rest of the family it's like they're not actually listening to me.

I guess what depresses/annoys me the most is that I have real trouble even trusting myself and when I feel justified in thinking that other people don't believe or trust me I feel completely worthless, like a non-being.",30,2013-04-02 06:29:00 EDT-0400

116,Anxiety as I'm falling asleep,"I have a problem where when I'm drifting off to sleep my brain seems to wake me up with a wave of adrenaline. I am not having a panic attack, but I become completely alert again and have to start the process over again. The frustrating thing for me is that I'm pretty good at getting myself relaxed and untensing my muscles, but that once I start to drift towards sleep again, my anxious subconscious takes over and sort of jolts me back awake again with adrenaline. 

I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions. Should I meditate before bed to just reduce my subconscious anxiety levels? When it happens the first time should I get up and try to relax and then go back to bed? Also, is it better to just go to bed way later when my brain is so exhausted that it can't really protest anymore? I know, worst comes to worst, I always have klonopin to fall back on, which I will probably use tonight because I didn't sleep so well last night, just looking for some advice. Thanks.

119,Klonopin and Xanax - a comparison for anxiety,"I've read a lot of threads on here about Klonopin vs Xanax, and having taken xanax as needed for panic attacks, I recently came off some light painkiller use and had started taking more xanax (still less than 1.5 MG/day) as I've been rather stressed lately. 

I went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.

I got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.

I have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.

Xanax (alprazolam):

Pros-

* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks
* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover
* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay
* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it
* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout

Cons

* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster
* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.
* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable
* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax

Klonopin (clonezepam):

Pros-

*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety
*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)
*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it
* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.
* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle
* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz
* Nice warm feeling and relaxing
* Less amnesia
* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely

Cons

* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.
* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)

Having been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.

I find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.

Best of luck out there, it's going to be okay.

I go over what I said, how I said it, if I smiled/laughed enough, if I made good first impressions, etc...It's really stressful, and I feel like I'm self-obsessed.

I had a lot of good moments, but there are a few moments where I wonder if I acted okay. It's really silly, but I can't help it.

127,7 most helpful things I have learned to control anxiety.,"Hi guys,

I've had anxiety since I was 17 (I'm 25 now), so about 8 years. It was very bad for 3, then died down a bit, then came back after smoking some weed in Feb.

I read a book called ""At Last A Life"" which I can honestly say has helped me understand anxiety a whole lot better than ever before.

Here are some of the crowning bits of knowledge I've learned.

1. You are NOT going mad, you are just a sensitive person with anxious thoughts. That's perfectly okay. Many people have strange or upsetting thoughts every day, however, we are so sensitive that we get worried or upset about these thoughts. It's this reaction to the thought that causes anxiety, not the thought itself, so (as hard as this can be to do), just ignore the thought. If you think of something awful happening, just say ""yeah, grand. This is just an anxious thought. Whatever"".

2. Anxiety can't be gotten rid of like a flu, but it can be managed so well that it feels like its gone. 
One of the best things I've learned is that I will always have anxiety, I am by nature of a nervous disposition. But that's okay with me. I am learning to be okay with it, I have stopped fighting it. I don't beat myself up about it and I move on each day. In essence, I am reducing my anxiety about having anxiety. 

3. Deep breaths. You can't panic and relax at the same time. You can control your breathing which in turn controls your heart rate. When you get that sinking feeling of anxiety, take 10 nice long deep breaths while repeating the following: ""I am a good, I am kind, I am okay"". This will give your mind a positive message to focus on while you slow your breathing and relax.

4. Stop trying to figure out how to control or stop anxiety. You continue to give it more power which increases its hold on you. Accept it.

5. Remember that an anxiety attack is a release of adrenaline into the body. Your mind believes there is a threat so it releases adrenaline into your system to help your caveman body deal with it. This was great when the threat was a cheetah but not so great when the threat is a thought you can't run away from. But understanding what the panic attack is allows you to relax slightly. 
So when a panic attack starts, realise that this uncomfortable sensation is just adrenaline rushing around your body, it can't hurt you. Although it is uncomfortable, nothing can happen to you. The adrenaline will stop soon and you will feel better.

6. Apparently 1 in 10 people in America have anxiety. You are not alone and you are not as isolated as you feel. You are one of many who feel this way so don't feel like you are all alone and the only one who feels like this. You are perfectly normal and this is going to get better over time. As you learn to deal with it, it gets easier and this happens with time. It won't be gone tomorrow so don't put pressure on yourself to fix it. 

7. Buy the book I mentioned above. It goes into great detail and is written by a guy who dealt with anxiety for 10 years before he learned how to deal with it. 

I wish you well guys. Remember that people with anxiety tend to be very nice people who get upset because of their thoughts. That just shows what a lovely bunch we are. Those horrible thoughts of you doing something bad, having something bad happen to you, bad things happening to other, worries about the world, economy, exams, etc, etc are only just thoughts. One you learn how to control your reaction to them, you will learn how to control your anxiety. Hope this has helped!

Love to all!



Edit:
I'm glad to see that this post has helped so many people over the past 8 months. I would like to add a new point to the list which is my favourite so far.

8. When you begin to feel anxious and get that sinking feeling in your chest/stomach, you probably feel like you want to run away. This is normal but we all know that running away from thoughts doesn't really work. The technique here is to sit there and say to yourself: ""Okay, Welcome back anxiety. I am going to sit here and be as anxious as I can for the next 5 minutes. I am going to feel every anxious feeling and I am going to try and be the most anxious person in the world"". Remember back to point 5 that anxiety cant hurt you, its just a sensation caused by a rush of adrenaline. Sitting there and trying to feel anxious removes all of its power and gives you back control. Its the opposite of what you've probably been doing so far isn't it? It really works for me, I realise that I am in control and that I am not afraid of feeling this way. The feeling dissipates and I am left feeling really delighted with myself! ",50,2013-08-07 13:51:54 EDT-0400

133,"For those who have social anxiety, please listen to my words","I've always felt ""off"" in social situations for as long as I could possibly recall, and only until 3-4 years ago did I really come to understand that it was something labeled as ""social anxiety"".  An analogy I like to use for social anxiety is as if its a super power; the power to be able to suffer in all situations possible.  To keep this short, I have been working with a great new therapist (whom I had to be forced to go to) and she has greatly helped me understand just what I needed to do to help myself.  Social anxiety made me so so afraid of doing the ""wrong"" thing; or behaving in a way that would bring up social conflict.  This brings up its own massive mental chaos of its own. Learning to be 100% ok with who I am *right now* can make all the difference in the world.  Its ok if you do something wrong; nobody every judges you as much as you judge yourself.  Everything will always be alright in the end.  Believe in and love yourself.  ",10,2013-08-06 10:45:05 EDT-0400

139,[Rant] If I die today I'm going to die wearing my wedding band.,"I haven't struggled this much in a long long time. Today I tried to eat crackers and was afraid of dying. So I drank broth made from a bouillon cube. Let's be honest, I probably felt like I was dying because I got NO sleep last night and because of the stress of being trapped in my own mind and because I hadn't eaten anything. 

My aunt died in May. It started that night. I felt my heart do ""something"". I was gearing up to take on my personal white whale - a fucking chemistry class. After all the failing and fighting and insulting and sadness of my childhood, I was just so terrified of getting back into one of my problem classes. 

I flashed back to the anger and disappointment on my mother's face and the smug pout as she quipped about being someone's maid. Since that's all I could possibly do. Getting cleaning supplies for Christmas... ugh. We didn't KNOW about my learning disability. Why would we check? I was considered ""above average"". I didn't know WHY I couldn't live up to ""above average"".

It's been a little over two months since the descent started. I think I'm dying every day. I love to paint my nails (I am/was an avid laquerista) but I cut them off so I can better document how healthy they look. I am checking my lymph nodes and they ARE a little sore, but it MIGHT be because I'm fucking poking them all the time! I spend an unreasonable amount of time with my hand on my heart. I'm not super patriotic, I'm making sure it's beating right. I have to stop myself from running to the blood pressure cuff every time I'm near a pharmacy. Sometimes I want to check it more than once. Let's be perfectly honest, my heart could very well be having abnormal palpitations, but it's probably from the stress of worrying about it.

I'm so so worried that I'm driving my fucking glorious husband insane. He says I'm not. I can't believe him. He says the stereotypical, ""You need to shrug it off/get over it."" I can't EVEN be upset because there's a tiny person inside my brain that is SCREAMING at me to get over it! The me that people are used to; who fights so hard to take back control from... whatever this thing is. That said, I've already decided that if I am dying I'm going to leave him. We're still young. he can find a nice girl who will live a long life instead of taking care of my while I die. I really really wish I could stop thinking about that every day.

I miss the days of pulling out my hair, intrusive thoughts, and repetitive stress dreams. I thought that was bad! I would trade all of my eyelashes and brows to beat this. I've had panic attacks before, but not multiple times a week. Not when I'm home alone and it SEEMS like I should be able to relax. I've never sat in a doctor's office and cried, ""Is it my heart!?"" No, it's the stress induced muscular tension. I feel totally encased in chaos. Fuck this pressure in my chest.

I passed chemistry. Something I never thought I'd do. I thought I would be able to take control back from myself. I took care of some of the back pain, apparently it's going to be a process.

145,"Wanted to share some really, really small success","Well, I have social anxiety disorder. I went to the mall yesterday with a friend, because she asked me to go ""job hunting"" with her.

I've never had a part-time job before, and I'm young...but, she's had a job before. On Tuesday night I was making myself nauseous at the thought of approaching a staff member/manager to ask if they're hiring, and handing my resume in. I thought I'd end up getting rejected or everyone would say, ""Sorry...not hiring""

I thought my friend would take the lead since she's done this before, but actually, I was the one who approached  95% of the people to inquire. I put on a smile, and I just went for it (completely faking it...that isn't me *at all*)

But I ended up giving in my resume to 9 places, one place told me that I'd have to apply online, and when I got home I applied to two other places.

I have a bad feeling about a couple of the places, because I know they probably won't do anything with my resume. But for most of the places, at least right now, I'm feeling like I have a slight chance.

I'm worried about possibly getting an interview, because I don't think I can pull off that kind of fake confidence again, one-on-one, but I'm happy I did something out of my comfort zone.

149,"I'm totally losing it, falling into unhealthy behavior most of my day the past few, etc. Is anyone out there?","I finally joined to make this post because if nothing else, I feel like I need to vent it.

I have always been an anxious person, but it has never seriously impacted my life for more than short periods of time. Basically,I tend to get fixated on something to 'panic' about quietly, time goes by, I feel reassured or whatnot etcetc rinse, repeat on a small scale. This has happened since I can remember, the first episodes being when I was a small kid and feeling for a few months like I was surely going to die (something along the lines of hypochondria). My mom took me to the doctor, he said I was fine, I got over it. Onto the next thing.

I fear this is going to sound stupid, but here it goes. I imagine you aren't judgmental people, I'll bank on it! Recently, I somehow stumbled on the 'conspiracy' reddits and everything there seemed 'true' to my panicking mind. I spent hours of my day self-debunking these and gathering reassurance etc. on the internet. This has gotten worse and while I don't worry about those more ridiculous things, I now worry endlessly about 'plausible' real-life doomsday scenarios and constantly feel like the sky is falling down, that I'm not going to live to see old age, that everything I do is pointless etcetc. because we are all doomed. Again, spending large swaths of my day trying to reassure myself, and instead just falling more and more into it.

So the obvious rationalization is that most things in the world are out of my control, and in such events, there is little I could ever do. I feel now like I won't ever feel normal again. I'm having nightmares, I'm taking OTC pills to help me sleep, I'm focusing on these things instead of spending time with my friends and husband, and I'm withdrawing from my hobbies (mainly gaming) while I'm spending time convincing myself I'm doomed.

So I'm looking for help. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from doing these things? Is there anything I can do to calm down my mind? Do I need to run off and get medicated (I really am opposed to this, but now I feel like I'm never to be able to resume a normal life). Basically, what are some first steps, and what should I be looking to do about my feelings?

157,Something helpful I noticed watching King of The Hill,"Of all things. I saw the episode where Luanne moves out and becomes Hank's neighbor. She moves out with three horrible roommates who make her life a living hell. The episode is about her being suck of Hank's rules and then her becoming him in making rules for her own home.

Anyways, something I noticed was where Hank has a heart-to-heart with Luanne and says that he thought he needed his space in the den, but he realized that the lawn is the perfect place for him. When he's out there, nothing else matters. It's his relaxing place. He tells her to find something like that.

She is cleaning the pool the next day when she starts to notice that the pool is a place where she can be alone with her thoughts. She gets the pH balance to be perfect and calmly explains how she solved her roommate/bills situation. 

So, I took something strong from this. Sometimes when we're anxious, we simply need to find something to dedicate our time to that we truly enjoy. Make it ours. Use it as a meditation experience almost and collect your thoughts to make smart decisions not based heavily on emotion.

Find our lawns!

Edit: I absolutely adore you all. I love how this became a place to post what your ""lawns"" are. It's made me so happy to read all of these. Be proud of your happy place. Dedicate as much time to it as Hank does with propane and propane accessories. :))",14,2013-08-20 02:44:20 EDT-0400
158,(UPDATE) I'm seventeen years old and last night I slept in my own bed for the first time.,"Hey guys :) I meant to do this on the one week mark, but ended up a day late...

I actually feel really proud of myself when I think of the past week! I've been in my own bed for a whole week straight! It's been a bit tough, and I had thought about crawling back into my moms bed at least once every night, but I never did it. Though, this may be more related to laziness then anything ;p 

I found that having the tv on at night was easier than setting up music, but it is still a struggle to stay focused on falling asleep. The only problem is that it is about that time when new horror movie commercials will be coming out, and that it the last thing I need while sleeping alone in the dark!

159,"Does anyone else fear that your anxiety causes you to come across as intimidating or ""asshole-ish"", especially to the opposite sex?","So I have moderate social anxiety. It's not crippling or anything, but it manifests itself in ways that I'm sure many here can relate to. Hell, I had to think about it for two days before I finally decided to make this post. I'm not especially outgoing, talkative, or smiley a majority of the time; and I'm beginning to think that these attributes give me a sort of ""resting asshole face.""

I have a decent sized group of friends so I'm confident that I'm a decent person and fun to be around when I'm comfortable. But the thing is, people very rarely approach me. As in, I can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to come talk to me. Worse yet, women NEVER approach me. I know most women aren't especially prone to do that anyway, but it still sucks.

My older brother and I look very similar (we've been mistaken as twins a few times), and we're both, by most standards, pretty good looking guys. He doesn't suffer from anxiety, and both guys and girls come talk to him all the time. The same doesn't happen to me. I know if I want to meet new people, it's really up to me to make it happen for the most part. But, you know, anxiety lol. It would just be nice if people came to me at least every now and then I guess.

171,LSD Helped fix my anxiety,"Last weekend was an incredibly good weekend by my standards. As of late I have been very depressed and afraid to hang out with people. Ive had serious social anxiety since I was a teenager that Im pretty sure resulted from growing up in a sheltered private school then switching to a public school. Ever since I graduated and stopped smoking so much things have been going much better. In the past couple of weeks I made the decision to leave my band (not because of my anxiety) and that made me feel really bad. We had a couple more shows to play so I said I would play them cause we had already booked them and I didnt want to be a dick. Long story short we played the greatest show Ive ever played in my life. Something about that night just clicked. Absolutely no fuck ups, 100% crowd participation, it was phenomenal.

So naturally this left me feeling pretty good. Im normally kind of resentful towards my band mates, as if I never REALLY felt like they were my friends. But after the show we decided to chill at my house and celebrate. I said it was cool cause my mom was out of town. We hung out, drank, smoked, dropped acid, saw a shooting star, went on a trippy adventure etc. Id never had so much fun in my life. I finally felt like these people were my friends. The week after this I felt strangely peaceful and confident. I wasnt afraid to talk to people or answer my phone. I went from going out once or twice a week to almost every night. I even decided to give my band another chance and we have been practicing and writing much more since then. It was a huge step in the right direction and I have been happier ever since.

Acid was one of the greatest experiences of my life. For me it was the catylist for change. It may not work the same for you but it may not hurt to try it.

173,HEY GUYS I JUST GOT MY LICENSE!!,"Hey! I'm so happy, I've been twitching for like an hour!

So awhile back I posted for support because I was about to take my test and I get crippling nerves over several things, and driving is one of them.

Anyway, I couldn't take it that day so I made an appointment for today. Well the lady at the front desk was SO nice, but even so, I was still nervous. I thought I could get through it but it took so long waiting. By the time I got to a different lady who takes my photo, I could feel it coming on. ""Oh, this poor lady doesn't know what she's about to witness."" I tried a breathing exercise I learned in Psychology class and it held the tears back, but my nerves were still on fire.

She asked me how many times I've taken the the test, and I said 3 or 4, couldn't really recall. A few minutes later she told me it was actually 6(!) Her voice got really low, and she asked me what was wrong. ""Oh no, we're gonna talk about feelings, and she doesn't deserve this."" I said everything. She took a few seconds and asked if I got really nervous. I nodded, then bit my lip, and started crying. I smiled at her a little to try to let her know I was ok, and because I knew this was going to happen. I said I was sorry, ""This must be really weird for you, some girl crying,"" trying so hard to keep from just sobbing loudly then and there, embarrassing her/putting her in a difficult position.

She was SO nice and understanding. I normally get kinda offended when people say ""Just don't be nervous,"" but when she said it.... She was like a motherly-figure in this moment and I wanted to make her proud. She told me what to do (pull around back, park in no parking zone), but through the tears I didn't understand so I asked her to repeat. She told me to get up and that she would show me (awww so sweet :,)) The nice old lady at the front desk looked concerned when we went. After we went outside and she showed me, I told her thank you. I honestly didn't expect her to be so understanding, because I figured she must get a lot of teenage girls crying.

She told me I could have my grandpa sit in the car with me until the instructor showed up, so I did. At first he thought they wouldn't let me take the test because I was clearly still upset by the time I went back in and got him. (He was with me another time this happened, but my mom was there too and she just made it worse. Poppaw made me feel better by not putting any pressure on me to calm down). Well a few minutes later another woman finally showed and it was the instructor. Poppaw made a joke with her, and it set the mood a little lighter, enough for small talk until we got started.

[We're gonna skip 99% of the test] My foot still had it's little seizure on the pedal, I thought I would get in trouble for it. The lady was nice I could tell, so if I felt I mis-understood/heard her, I recited what she said back to her.

At the end of the test, she said I did good. That still doesn't mean I passed, so I kept listening. (She said I went over pedestrian lines a little, and turned my wheels the wrong way on the curb.) As she was getting out, I asked if I passed, and she said yes! I then rambled about how she's the best instructor ever (cringe). My poppaw was right outside the car, so he made some talk with her and I saw her mouth the words that I passed. He got up to my side of the car and I had this HUGE grin on my face. Then we hugged.

I went back inside and stood at the front desk. I saw the photo lady from where I was and she saw me. She mouthed ""Did you get it?"" HUGE grin and mouthed ""Yes I got it!"" She gave me a thumbs up, and told me to have a seat. The old lady from the front desk saw our little circle of smiles and giggles and joined in lol. They were really nice, I couldn't have asked for better people to be there. The photo lady told me congrats but I was still twitching and she was like, ""Well you already have it now!"" I was just like ""I know, I dunno what's wrong with me! (lol)""

Anyway, I'm really happy right now. Me and Poppaw got some BK milkshakes and went home (he drove, he knew I was still freaking out). Ah, it was a good day.",6,2013-08-15 00:40:29 EDT-0400

I always find myself thinking that my friends/family/SO dislikes me for some reason or another. Even if we haven't had an argument or anything, and nothing is going wrong, my mind seems to give me all sorts of a reasons why a person might be unhappy with me/dislike me - I guess it is a self-esteem thing, I generally feel ""inferior"" or ""unworthy"" compared to other people, sometimes I can pinpoint why I feel that way and other times I don't know why, it's just inherent. 

Anyway, I fear that people dislike me, which makes me nervous about how I look/act in front of them. As a result, I basically end up avoiding them because I don't want to annoy them/make them dislike me further. But usually this just makes people think I don't want to be friends anymore and we lose touch. I feel bad because I've lost a lot of friends due to this whole issue. I realize that evidently, avoiding people doesn't help friendships/relationships whatsoever, but I simply don't know how to stop constantly thinking that people secretly hate me.

183,How do I stop worrying about things that A) never end up happening or B) don't turn out nearly as bad as I imagine?,"I need someone to talk to, guys. I'm a lifelong hypochondriac and general anxiety sufferer, and lately, I've been suffering from work-related stress. Whenever I hear about possible snags in a project, or things that aren't 100% figured out, I get worried. I think about all the bad things that could happen, and I lose sleep over it. I stress out and I try to talk to people about it but most people are pretty dismissive. It makes me want to cry, but at the same time, I feel silly for basically whining.

Most of the times, the problems I imagine never end up becoming actual problems, or if they do, it's never as bad as had imagined. Thus, I'm losing sleep over nothing basically. Which is really sad when I think about it.

It's frustrating because I know it's anxiety, I know it's irrational, but I can't help it because I guess my mind doesn't truly believe it. Sometimes I do breathing exercises, and it helps a bit, but it never really destroys the anxiety completely.

I texted everyone who came this morning to thank them for hanging out, but very few have replied so I'm wondering constantly and really obsessing over the thought that they are upset with me, perhaps over me saying something stupid while drunk. I literally keep checking my phone every minute or so to see if anyone has replied. There was one point where my friend and I were singing along to a song we both know, and I accidentally said the wrong lyrics (even thought I know the words,) and he called me out on it, laughing.

194,Anyone with physical anxiety symptoms? Read this!,"Hey folks, so I want to pass on some revelations that have been made. If you read my previous post, you would know that I was freaking out for weeks b/c I had been experiencing arm pain, numbness/tingling in my hands and fingers, including some serious spasms in my pinky finger. My wrists have also been weak, my elbows have hurt. Of course, being a hypo, I assumed I had ALS. I went to a new doctor because my insurance switched over. Before that, I was with KP, and they would simply just take my blood every freakout and tell me, ""You're fine, you're just stressed."" 

Well, I got a new doctor on my new insurance and she's wonderful. I prefaced my visit by telling her, ""I have been diagnosed GAD. I know I'm a hypochondriac, but I'm experiencing some symptoms that are too real for me to ignore and I've been very scared."" 

Turns out, yes, anxiety and stress have contributed to my problems. Instead of having a terrible disease, I actually have a lot of issues that have come from anxiety and stress.

My doctor did a great job of explaining to me how ""anxiety and stress"" ACTUALLY CORRELATE AND CAUSE symptoms, which I think is something that isn't anywhere near clear enough. 

First, she went over and began giving me a physical examination. She put her hand near the top of my ankle and immediately said, ""Relax."" I am relaxed,"" I replied, but she said, ""No, relax."" I realized that I had serious muscle tension, even though I swore I was relaxed. 

Then she asked about my symptoms, and I told her that I was getting numbness/tingling in my hands, weakness in my wrists and fingers, and arm pain. I was convinced it was precursing ALS. 

She immediately had answers. She then said, ""So, you have anxiety. Do you have any nervous habits?"" 

So I responded. My hands can't be free. I always have a hand on my chin, scratching and pulling on my beard...like when I'm driving, or just sitting. I also use my cell phone a lot in public, especially when I'm just bored while standing around and grab it and pull it out. I also do this thing where I constantly pick at my finger nails. I also always rest my elbows and sit with bad posture at my desk, which is not ergonomically accomdating either, because I use a laptop on it, rather than using the slide-out for the keyboard and mouse. 

Turns out, my ergonomic environment and terrible habits have caused a slew of minor, onset RSIs (repetitive strain injuries). 

I have carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel, which is explained by computer mouse usage, poor ergonomics, as well as bad posture, and something called ""cell phone or tennis elbow,"" which is caused by constantly bending the arms upward. 

These conditions are caused from excessive nerve pressure, and while they are annoyances for sure, they aren't killing me! 

It all comes back to how healthy we live our lives, and as humans continue to try to adapt to these sedentary lifestyles, we continue to put our bodies in an environment that's not completely fit. 

My anxious habits (the hands-can't-be-free thing) and actual stress (muscle tension) have caused this. Exercise, meditating, and changing my lifestyle are the recommendations for improving. 

The thing is, none of this is really explained like this. I think a lot of us go to source sites and just read, ""anxiety and stress cause pain, numbness, tingling,"" and we all think it's some rare, direct correlation. The truth is, anxiety and stress make us do things that put us at risk for this. 

My stress has also caused my eye twitching, and my poor diet (according to her) is what is causing my muscle spasms. 

I'm really, really, really glad I've got a doctor who literally sat down and talked to me for an hour and explained everything to me, rather than just taking my blood, not seeing any warning signs, and kicking me out the door (like the docs at KP used to do). 

Suddenly, I'm excited to continue to change my life. I've always been a nervous wreck--always have spent wayyyy too much time at my computer...especially obsessing over my health, which is BAD. 

Finally, I feel like I'm constructively fighting my anxiety/hypochondria, rather than just believing I'm in a cursed body. 

Instead of going straight to Google to try to solve your fears, find a good doctor and get to the bottom of each and every symptom you feel. 

As you begin to build confidence in the diagnosises, you can lower your overall stress and anxiety, which actually will make you less likely to experience more problems. 

I hope this post is good advice and a good example.

196,DAE have sudden irrational fears?,"Usually if I'm freaking out there's a kind of reason or at least whatever I'm freaking out over is something that could possibly happen (even when the chances are very very slim). But today I began freaking out over something very irrational. I was panicking because I was afraid of chocking to death on my vomit in my sleep while drunk. Here's the kicker, I don't drink. Never have, nor do I plan to. I had absolutely no reason to be afraid of that yet I was freaking out. Has this kind of thing (freaking out over something that could absolutely not occur) ever happened to any of you guys?

198,"[Help] How do I get around/brush off the question ""What are you doing with your life/what are you doing now""?","I absolutely hate this question, it seems to be the number one thing anyone who hasn't seen me in a while will ask me, as well as complete strangers when I meet them. It's holding me back from catching up with a lot of people because I don't know what to say.

The real answer is ""I've actually been doing nothing all year because I have depression and social anxiety which, coupled with my useless degree and lack of experience, leaves me unable to even start applying for jobs, let alone qualify for any. My mental condition is a struggle on a weekly basis even when I am doing nothing at all.""  - which clearly no one wants to hear in light conversation, let alone at all really.

The question itself evokes so many emotions: rage - because who are they to question my life? Why can't I demand an explanation of their life plans or accomplishments? Anxiety, because it's putting me on the spot and I have to somehow lie and conceal the fact that I am having a horrible time at the moment and that I have no idea what I will do, and pretty much don't believe I will go anywhere or do anything in life. Annoyance, because its just a stupid small talk question, they don't actually care, they just want a discussion point and to be able to judge me, and I am sick of explaining myself 50 times a year. And more depression, because it just reminds me of how I am currently doing nothing because I am too incompetent to do anything. 

I'm imagining the next time someone asks me and I just want to be able to say fuck off, or just move on without answering, or more realistically just answer succinctly and change the subject, but I don't know how to do so politely. The only thing I can think of is to say ""nothing exciting"". Does anyone have any ideas or experience?

209,I just got pressured into agreeing to sell my car because of anxiety. This is getting out of hand.,"So for backstory, I work at a store where I went from being inventory (minimal interaction) to being a cashier (lots of interaction and I have to touch money). I have switched my medication from Prozac to Zoloft, and because it works a thousand times better for me, I've been able to preform in this job and face my fears. It's been a great experience, although it's definitely more draining than my last job. I have the highest customer feedback scores! There have been a couple times where I needed to excuse myself because somebody started shouting and have a small panic attack in the bathroom, but most of my supervisors understand.

A couple nights ago I was working the night shift, and this particular night was slow, so not all cashiers were needed on the floor. He calls me over to the cashier station, which is an unused register, and starts asking me questions about my car. What kind of car it is, how many miles is on it, what condition it's in, etc etc. I thought this was weird, but I couldn't find the voice to say that these questions were making me uncomfortable or even ask why he was asking, so I answered his questions. Maybe he's trying to kill time, I reasoned. He then says ""Come on, let's go outside and have a look"" and being that it's slow anyway and fresh air is always nice, I agree. He walks around my car, inspecting it, and asks more questions. He explains that his wife is learning how to drive and that they need two cars so that he can drive to work and she can drive around the kids. He asks me how soon I can sell it, and being too far into this conversation to back out now, I tell him that I need to do some shopping around, but probably within the next couple months. He asks how much I want for the car, I say that I need to get an assessment from Carmax and that I'd let him know. At this point he's really happy, he doesn't feel comfortable about buying a car from a stranger and tells me that his wife will be so happy to hear that they've found someone willing to sell them a car. The rest of the night, he's periodically gushing about the whole deal while I try to figure out what I just agreed to.

Guys, I don't want to sell my car. It's completely paid off and runs awesome. I have no idea what to do. When telling this story to a friend, he pointed out that he was very rude in trying to pressure me into this, but I think that maybe because he's from Yugoslavia, he doesn't understand our customs yet? I feel like I'm really the one to blame. As a child I was abused, and as a result, I have a very hard time saying no. This has landed me into doing some things I'm not proud of in the past, and I don't want to let this happen again. I can't just avoid him like I normally might do in an uncomfortable situation, because he's one of my bosses. I'm scared that if I back out, then he will resent me and it will affect my job. I'm also horribly scared of conflict. I also have no idea why he chose me to ask. I looked around everywhere for a sign or something from someone trying to sell a car, and haven't found anything. I'm not sure that he could have chosen me because of my anxiety, because I've really only been working this position for a month. What do?",22,2013-09-13 22:46:56 EDT-0400
210,Terrified to go back to university,"It was okay last year because I lived on campus. I was living with two other girls who were in the same course so we walked to classes together sometimes, but they mostly stuck together just the two of them. Everything was in reach, I could hop to and from the library whenever I wanted and it was no problem running back to my flat for a nap between classes if I had the time. I made some friends too but I ended up not liking them very much. There was a bit of drama so I was switching between who to sit with in classes, then the one I stayed with most starting hanging with another group who I didn't know and excluded me, and the other friends were already close enough together, so I just felt like I tagged along behind them. Towards the end, I kind of fell away from them all. Well I texted one a few times over summer but I still don't like him very much, and spoke to another one only once. She wanted some information about something and never continued the conversation once I gave it to her.

So none of those friends stuck and no friends from home go to the same university, so I would say I'm alone this year. And I'm absolutely terrified.

I can't do things on my own, I start panicking badly. I have to travel in for nearly an hour and I'll start crying on the way. Uni starts back in three days and we don't have our personalised timetables yet so I have no idea which classes I definitely need to attend. When I sit in lectures, where am I supposed to go? Just sit by myself down the front? What if some of the friends still expect me to sit with them and think I'm rudely ignoring them? And seminars are worse, we're expected to DISCUSS. I *do not* talk in class. And who do I sit with in there? People are all already friends with each other. And I'll probably forget where all my classes are too.

Plus, since I don't live on campus anymore, I'll have to find a way to fill time between classes. I can go to the library but it's always hella busy, and I'm not very good at studying anyway so I'd just be sitting on facebook/tumblr/reddit. Then I'd probably lose track of time and miss class/turn up late. I was late to ONE class last year and although nothing came of it, I was incredibly embarrassed. Or, again, what if those friends expect me to hang out with them? They sit in the on-campus bar and I hate the on-campus bar, and I can't order from the cafe or buy from the shop. Which also means I'll have to drag a load of food with me and if I forget one morning, I'll be hungry all day.

This has turned into a huge venting post, I'm sorry, these are all really stupid things. God I'm so so scared, I don't wanna go back.

211,My biggest anxiety trigger is a required class for my degree :(,"Right now I'm in my ""last"" year of college, and I'm finishing up my second language requirement in Latin. Last year was a really tough year for me, so my grades in this class were pretty terrible. Starting a new semester means I have to study even harder to catch up to my peers, but every time I try and study I have to fight my anxiety head on. I constantly second guess myself, I can't concentrate, and I start feeling depressed and hopeless when I don't understand something.

I do understand why this particular class is a big trigger for me, and it's mostly because of how stupid I feel in it. Other than this class I do really well in my other subjects, but I end up feeling like a failure when I'm confused in this class, which is all the time.

I'm making attempts to reach out to classmates, though getting through social anxiety takes time. Talking with my instructors only makes me feel worse. If they are offering tutoring I'm planning to go, but if they don't I'm not sure what I can do. 

In a nutshell, I need to pass this class (plus another semester) to graduate, but my anxiety is making it very difficult and I'm not sure what to do. Thanks for reading, I kind of just needed to vent, and I'm sure someone here can relate to anxiety over classes :)",16,2013-09-11 06:00:29 EDT-0400

I am a smoker of nearly 5 years, I want to quit but I'm trying to find a balance between quitting smoking and dieting, doing both at the same time is a recipe for failure. I've been diagnosed with asthma, a benign heart arrhythmia called atrial flutter and more recently, impaired glucose tolerance (hence the dieting).

I have my own company that is doing very well but its an enormous amount of stress on my shoulders. every day i'm plagued by worries about having deadly conditions such as heart failure/disease, multiple sclerosis, etc. even with no diagnostic reasoning. I get occasional chest pains but my heart has been checked so many times with nothing wrong. Pains in my abdomen are always followed by a few hours searching the web for things like liver disease or other frightening conditions...which just makes it worse. I've recently had a few days of extreme fatigue which could be caused by so many deadly conditions. How do I stop convincing myself that I have these things. I constantly avoid going to the doctor about things because 1) he'll tell me I have something deadly or 2) he'll laugh it off as anxiety and won't take me seriously.

214,Having a crisis: facial scarring,"(this is a crosspost from the body acceptance subreddit - I hope that's okay)

Hi everyone,

This is my first post on reddit, I hope I'm doing it right. I'm a 25 year old guy, and for the last couple of years I have struggled with depression and social anxiety. The main cause of all that: when I was 15 I was in an accident which partly burned my face. It healed to a certain extent in that I don't look like your typical burn victim, but there are a lot of smaller cuts. My skin is very pale (it doesn't tan in sunlight at all), I have very deep, almost black, permanent bags under my eyes and there isn't a single spot on my face that's smooth or clear. I basically look like a meth addict all the time, which is often how people treat me. I've been told that most people look past the scars, and while that may be true for a lot of people, I meet people almost every day who feel the need to comment on it in a very hurtful way, as if it's my own fault that I look like this. This has been going on for years now, and I honestly can't go on like this anymore. I'm becoming more and more withdrawn, more and more stuck in my own head. The realisation that I'm going to be alone forever - which I always knew - is really hitting me hard these days, now that everyone in my age group is ending up in long-term relationships, moving in together, having children. Everyone is living their life, and I can't even leave the house without looking at myself in the mirror for hours (which often leads to me just staying inside after all). I used to be fairly social besides these issues, but these days I honestly feel disgusting when I'm outside all the time. I look at myself in every reflection, notice everyone who's looking at me when I'm walking around. My social skills are deteriorating, and I'm very, very afraid where my mind is going while I'm alone in my flat every evening. I feel like I'm locked in a prison, and the older I'm getting, the more unlikely it seems that I'll ever get out of it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse every day.

Anyway, I need to change something. I literally can't take another day of sitting around, mindlessly surfing the internet, breaking down crying, hating myself. Obviously I tried to fix myself in the past through various remedies, but nothing ever worked. These days I can't even force myself to go outside to excercise because I just can't stand people watching me, laughing behind my back anymore, which leads to me gaining weight. I'm not exactly fat right now, although I definitely have to much fat around my stomach-area and I certainly lack muscles (again, way too self-conscious to go to the gym. Previous attempts to go ended in my being laughed at in such a condescending manner that it's not even an option for me anymore). I'm so, so tired of being always being the ugliest person wherever I go.

I don't even know what I'm really asking here. I just hope someone out there (who maybe went through something similar) can give some practical advice. I know therapy is probably something that's going to be suggested a lot, and I do agree that I need it, but I simply can't afford it right now. 

I feel like the biggest loser in the world. I hope someone can help. I need to break out of this loneliness before I go completely insane (which, I sometimes wonder, I might already be).

220,[Help] I've made a mistake.,"For some reason I decided to go study abroad this semester in the UK. Travelling was really hard on me. It's naturally stressful and I'm too nervous to ask people for help. I had a bit of a panic attack on the airplane and have been subject to a pervading sense of hopelessness since then. I even cried which I honestly didn't know I was capable of. Not because of resolute bravery, but because I have become a master of suppressing the impulse.

I finally made it here, moved into my dormitory, and now I'm alone. I feel miserable. An ocean is separating me from literally every person I know and instead of the way it was before, where I could use friends and family to help me in doing certain things, I am now in charge of absolutely everything.

I'm hungry, but I can't bring myself to go get food for fear of being judged I guess. Walking down the streets is harrowing. Every step feels scrutinized. I'll have to meet my roommates soon when they get here which is making me anxious and then there is the prospect of making friends, going out, socializing with girls, being safe, finding my classes, and actually being in my classes (hopefully no class participation).  

At home I could manage dealing with anxiety and social anxiety because everything was familiar to me and my home felt safe. Now, I recognize nothing. I can't bring myself to look anyone in the eye and if I did, it wouldn't bring me any comfort. I drastically underestimated how excruciating and lonely this process would be. 

Do I back out? Waste a bunch of money and slink home like a coward? The relief would substantial and I can't stop fantasizing about it. Or do I ride it out? Will things get better or will I just continue to tax my mental health?",15,2013-09-14 15:09:26 EDT-0400

223,[Help] Am I having anxiety attacks?,"I know everyone is different, but what I experience doesn't seem like a ""typical"" anxiety attack from what I've read online, but I'm not sure what else it could be.  
Generally it happens when I'm walking as I usually go for long walks every evening, and its often the one time in the day I can really think and process things. I'm a pretty big introvert, so my walks tend to be something I look forward to as they are a time when I can really be alone and recharge. Last winter I was going through a really rough time and I started having these little incidents. Basically I'll have a memory. It's generally something that has no bearing on my present state, that's not really that big of a deal. The memory hits me and i feel an acute embarrassment, although embarrassment might not be the right word, even if it wasn't even that embarrassing when it actually happened.  Then there's a ""climax"" where the feeling peaks and I have a physical reaction to it. I contort my face into a grimace and my neck muscles tighten.  I think I read something a long time ago that the act of smiling can release chemicals into your brain that make you feel happy because your brain associates smiling with being happy. As a result, I've gotten in the habit of trying to smile to counteract the grimace which results in me making all sorts of odd facial contortions.  This whole thing happens in a span of probably 2 seconds. It tends to be cyclical and will happen a couple times in a row or sometimes just once or twice. It doesn't really happen randomly at work or school or anything- mostly just when I am out for a walk and have time to think. It got bad enough for a while that it was just happening so much, that I stopped going on my beloved walks, but eventually as I got the rest of my life a little more in order, they went away completely.  Now they're back. Is this anxiety? I know putting a label doesn't really change what's happening, but it'll help me figure out how to deal with it perhaps.

This sounds dramatic but I can't even feel her inside of me anymore. I am a different person. I honestly feel like I woke up one day mourning the life I used to have and mourning the death of myself as I used to be. I am now boring, way too serious, always playing it safe, and always afraid.

238,"My parents don't understand anxiety disorders, and at this point, I've fucking had it.","I've tried to explain this to them SEVERAL TIMES about how I have problems with anxiety.  But they continue to REPEATEDLY CALL ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN. (Hello?  What's wrong??  ""Oh I just wanted to see if you wanted to sign up for this service that I'm selling. I'm one account away from getting promoted"")  So, its not even an emergency, and they call me like someone fucking died.  

So the above example happened yesterday, and I said without thinking much about it that I would be able to help my mother out. (she was unemployed for 18 months, and started selling insurance recently)  I figure, hey if I can help her by getting a life insurance policy, why not?  But, I recently lost my license (I've ordered a new one from the DMV), and I'm NOT DRIVING ANYWHERE until I get a new one.  Also, I apparently need an ID anyway to sign up.  So flash to this morning. I'm looking for my ID again, and i get 42,000 phone calls from my parents place. Just before I throw my phone out the window, I turn the ringer off, and go to bed.  After I calmed down, about an hour later, I get another phone call and explain what's going on.  I somehow get convinced to go out anyway, and then hear ""Oh make sure you don't come in wearing jeans, you need to look presentable. see you soon!""  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

1.  I'm not going ANYWHERE TODAY.

2.  I'm guaranteed to get no fewer than 16,777,216 phone calls as a result.

3.  My parents will probably come over to my place.  Even if I don't answer the door, they might use my spare key that I left at their place in case i lock myself out.

241,Finally drove after 4 months!,"Last night then again this morning I drove home from work and back to work again. I had a friend with me in case I had an attack of course, but I did it! I started having an attack this morning after I had already parked the car, but I distracted myself with opening up my store and the symptoms subsided. I stopped being able to drive in October of last year, one day I was fine, the next I wasn't. For some reason every time I drove and had to stop at a red light or intersection I would have an attack. It took for 3 months to figure out exactly what was going on. I thought I was dying! I loved driving and enjoyed my independence! At times even being the passenger in a car would cause me to have an attack and they weren't driving crazy or anything. Always stopping at intersections or stop signs I would just freak out. It's SO irrational! Over the past few days I've been reading through others posts here and it helped me a lot. So. Thank you! Reading about how you've done little steps toward conquering your triggers and I thought I'd give mine a try. It worked. I hope I'm not jinxing myself and I don't think I'll be back to driving 100% and by myself just yet, but it's something. Baby steps!",12,2013-02-23 19:44:34 EST-0500

As of Sunday, I have been completely off Paxil and I'm surprised at how I have only had minor withdrawal symptoms. I'm so happy and can't believe after 9.5 years I am no longer on an antidepressant. Hopefully the withdrawal I am experiencing goes away by the end of the week because the brain zaps are fairly annoying but I am just so happy!!

262,[22F] My anxiety is exhausting...,"Just a rant and seeing if anyone else feels the same.  

I'm so tired. Every social situation and every human interaction I have throughout my day, I overthink it. I'm a medical assistant for a pediatrician and I talk to 20+ people on the phone and encounter 20+ patients in a work day. Every single conversation I have with a patient, I think about how it went. I play the whole conversation out in my head. I say ""bye, have a nice day"" and in think things like ""Oh why did you say that thing, that was so weird they probably think you're creepy. And why did you make that joke? It wasn't funny. They may've laughed but they didn't find it funny. Ugh they probably hate you and think you're weird and stupid."" And then repeat situation 19 more times. 

And then there's my boyfriend. I talk to him about my anxiety and he is very understanding and super helpful. He's the best and I am so blessed to have him in my life. We've been friends for many years and he always had a thing for me. I question myself everyday wondering why someone so amazing could love me. It boggles my mind that he loves me. It really does. I'm worried that every time I talk to him about my anxiety, he gets annoyed and hates dealing with me. I overthink my encounters with him. He gives me no reason to believe that he's tired of dealing with it. He's always reassuring and tells me he loves helping me feel better.  We've been together for a year and I've been working on my anxiety, which has greatly improved in other areas. It was much worse a year ago. He even reminds me that it's improved since we first got together, which it has but I still feel like there's more I want to work on. I think it all comes back to my confidence. If I was confident in myself and my abilities, I'd be able so say ""That conversation went well. You were perfectly pleasant and they liked you."" And be done with it. I automatically assume the negative and think some total stranger is out there hating me right now because of the way I said something. 

All in all, I have improved but I've only skimmed the surface. I want to conquer it. I want to overcome my negative thoughts and shut them down. I want to be confident. I want to say ""I'm good at this."" ""I look beautiful today."" I want to sleep. I want to go on with my day without worrying about what some stranger thinks of me. I want to go one day without replaying a single conversation in my head. I want to love myself. I wish I could see myself the way my boyfriend sees me. 

Edit: thank you all so much or your kind words and thoughts. They have all been very helpful. I wish you all the best of luck with our struggle and that we become the people we are truly meant to be; anxiety free. ",27,2013-12-14 17:40:03 EST-0500

Everything dies, and I've always been okay with that fact. But when I see his little face, anxiety floods through my entire being. Anyone else experience this?

265,[RANT] I'm tired of being scared.,"This whole week has been nothing but blurry vision, brain fog, trouble concentrating, body aches, and chest pain.  I feel like my body is in a constant fight or flight mode. I never have peace in my mind. I'm always in a fog, always on edge and lately on the verge of tears all day. I'm just so tired of it.  Fifteen years straight of this seems to be my breaking point.  I'm so tired of being scared all the time.  I don't even think I'm scared of dying anymore, I'm just scared of having to go through all this tomorrow.

I literally can't even remember what I said five minutes ago sometimes and I try not to lash out at my loved ones, but some times it happens.    I feel like this is me feeling sorry for myself, but really all that I want is to feel normal.  I can't remember the last time I woke up and felt normal.  I envy people who don't have that constant voice inside their head telling them something is wrong.  I truly wish that voice would
 shut the fuck up.

267,Mindfulness and viewing everything as exposure therapy.,"For several years now I have been in a type of psychotherapy for anxiety, depression and pure obsessional ocd that uses Mindfulness that I have found extremely helpful. The more I use it the more results I get. 

Recently my therapist has been working with me to do a series of exposures to one of my big problems and although she kept adjusting the target to get it to a do-able point I just haven't been able to do it. She apologized to me, something no therapist has ever done to me before, for not coming up with way for me to work with this target. I am still shocked about the apology and I am very glad I have someone so focused on really helping me without her own ego being in the way. 

After discussion we decided to back off a bit and have me work more on daily triggers as they come up really cranking up the mindfulness of my own emotional reactions. It turns out after lots hard but worth it because it was effective work there is a lot of stuff I had been avoiding. Some are things that provoke only low level anxiety not much different than my usual baseline so I ignored it to focus on other targets. Others were bigger but it turns out that all these years I automatically blocked myself from being aware of them. The fear levels were medium to high so I would shift them away the moment I noticed them to cut down on how fearful and on the verge of panic they made me. The thoughts associated with those situations are like slippery eels slithering away as I try to catch the little nasty little b******s. It is been seriously hard work to get a hold of 'em long enough to expose myself to the thought/feeling so I could feel it until it wears itself out. 

I have kept at it because exposure helped me slowly but surely eliminate so many repetitive thoughts and their associated emotions that used to constantly fill my head which now feels empty by comparison. It's difficult and intense but it worked before so I grimly have kept at it. I am getting better at being aware of my own emotions beyond the usual general fear level with only peak high level fear stuff really registering (with some big things just zipping away).

It has been rigorous to try to be present longer and longer though out the day but in just the past month I have seen quite a difference in my awareness, how much I can hold before it escapes and how I am able to do into stronger and stronger emotions. It makes me very glad I am doing this. No wonder it was hard to do the big target when i had so much already going on inside of me unaware to myself taking up so much energy. Doing this will eventually reduce or eliminate the daily stuff crapping up my life and leave me with more practiced ability to confront the target properly. And I am finding out I am tougher than I realized and I am finally able to face more of the old feelings of shame and selfhatred I used to practice that has kept me from giving myself credit. I am tough to do this work. I am strong to have survived even when I did not really want to or believe I would even find anything to help me. I have dealt with this much and made progress so I can make at least a little - maybe even alot - more progress.


edited to add this article which basically describes the kind of mindfulness I am doing. There are many ways do to Mindfulness such as focusing on the breath or a mantra and focusing on being present in whatever activity you are doing, gently redirecting one's mind to the focus every time it is caught wandering like a hyperactive monkey on illegal stimulants. well at least my mind has often been like what I imagine one of those would be. anyhow here is the article:

* **Integrative Mindful Exposure – Emotional Surfing 1**
http://www.mindfulexposurebook.com/integrative-mindful-exposure-emotional-surfing

I maybe should add that I have carefully and most cautiously built up to the point I am at now having done a ton of work on being able to stay present without dissociating, learning to prevent most panic attacks, grounding exercises, body scan, abdominal breathing. I know when to stop doing something a good measure before when I am likely to trigger panic because 1. panic sucks, hurts, and in general highly unpleasant and 2. it makes it that much harder to do the activity again. I learned my early warning signs so I do'nt push to the point of likely triggering a panic unless it's something that must be done. In therapy it just makes me that much more relucant to do the work so better to dip my toe into the target pool instead of full immersion - or better yet start with the smallest shallowest pool and verrrrrrrry s l o w l y work up to the big ones and then dip my toe in for a few breaths testing the waters. Forcing myself too far and fast just reinforces the fear. Going slow lets me nibble away at the target. In the end it does not take longer than going for the juglar because the other method isn't doable for me so it wouldn't get done :o",3,2013-12-09 20:09:34 EST-0500

272,Took Xanax once and feel a lot better.,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old guy and have had Anxiety my whole life. This last year has been the worst so within the last few months I started therapy and got Xanax.

I was reluctant for awhile to take any Xanax because of the addiction/dependency potential. But a few days ago I took it for the first time cause I wanted to be comfortable taking it in case I really need it.

Anyways, I took it (.5) and was pretty surprised. I was expecting it to be a lot more intense but it just gradually came on and was very relaxing.

Ever since then I haven't taken anymore. This was 2-3 days ago. I still feel not anxious and overall pretty calm.

Just wondering if anyone else here had similar experiences? I'm not saying this is some one time deal miracle drug. Because I'm not expecting for this to last forever. But I was thinking if I was able to take it just a few times a month it would keep me balanced.

278,Does anyone else feel like people laugh at you?,"My girlfriend recently got a job at our local wal-mart (we share this account) and she told me to go to work with her for about 4 hours or so and I didn't have anything better to do so I went.

Let me state that two ""cool kids"" decided to pick on me when I was looking at the Skateboards by saying ""Hey, nice skateboard, faggot"" and hitting my shoulder. That's not the point. Doesn't phase me, happened all the time in high school. It was when I was walking around and people were carrying on their own conversations and then they'd burst into laughter. I couldn't help but feel as though they were laughing at me and I've always felt as though people in stores and malls and other areas were always laughing at me. Over my hair, my clothes, the way I breathe, I'm not even certain what other excuses my brain could come up with for these people to ""laugh at me"". 

I'm not sure if this stems from my anxiety or if I'm just slightly paranoid of what I look like to people. I came here to see if anyone else feels this way.

Edit: Since people are asking me to stop caring about what others think, it seems appropriate to mention that I don't exactly mind for what people think about me because I've always been teased and ridiculed and such. I would ask if you would please telling me to stop ""giving a fuck"" because that wasn't the issue in the first place and it seems kinda rude. :/",39,2013-10-21 19:02:36 EDT-0400

I have a mild (VERY mild, I'm not comparing myself to war vets or abuse survivors) form of PTSD from a past event in my home where thrumming bass kept me awake for several days and the perpetrators were aggressive and violent. Glass bottles were thrown at my bedroom walls and windows from the outside, and I went into a full panic alone and with no resources to lean on. I couldn't leave because I was afraid for my safety, and I was in my own home. 

After the event, it took me about four months to be able to sleep through the night without heavy doses of sedatives. They started to affect my memory, so I stopped taking them as soon as I could cope with earplugs and white noise. I never had any problems with anxiety during the day because it was usually quiet and there are very few people around.

They say that water torture drives people insane because of the anticipation of the next drop. Right now, that is my life. **There is random thrumming bass vibrating through my apartment at all hours of the day with no consistent pattern.** It's not songs, it's not in any pattern, it's four or five bars of this, four notes here, six notes there, and mostly just fuzz. The first time it happened was late at night, and I assumed it was the neighbors downstairs, so I stepped outside to ask them to be quiet. As soon as I stepped out, silence. I went back inside, it was still there, but from every angle outside it was silent. It's like the music is coming from inside the apartment. It's been a week and **I can't find it.** I can't think of anywhere else it could be. It's like someone embedded speakers in my walls to torture me (my roommate hears the music too, I did consider schizophrenic paranoia-type hallucinations).

I'm at my wit's end. I have to have tv or white noise playing through my headphones at all time to keep me from having a panic attack. If I sit in silence just hearing the cars drive by and the wind blowing the trees, I get anxious and find myself crying and rocking back and forth within 30 minutes waiting for the sounds to start again. I'm worried that the constant headphone use will damage my hearing, and that adds a new level of worry.

I'm asking other anxiety sufferers because I'm hoping you won't just tell me to get over it: **what do I do?** I'm nervous and very depressed, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and if I lose my job from this, I might starve. Please, somebody give me some advice.

UPDATE: It's happening! I'm trying to take deep breaths. I'm watching Scrubs to drown out the noise, it's working pretty well.

I looked at my city's ordinances, they do mention noise not permeating the barriers of other people's homes for extended hours, but if it's less than 30 minutes within an hour, the laws are pretty lax. It's a very liberal town, and the attitude often gets to be ""just let people do what they want"".

Thank you so much for the support, sometimes it gets lonely feeling like I'm just a crazy person that no one will ever relate to. I've had pretty dark periods where I swore I would never connect with another human being on a deep level and I should just kill myself. Hey internet strangers, fuck yeah.

283,Why do I have such a hard time accepting the idea that people could genuinely like me?,"I realize this is somewhat of a vague question, but this is starting to tear me up inside and I had to vocalize the question somewhere to someone. 
I've been dealing with depression for awhile, but confronting my anxiety is a fairly new challenge to me although I've been experiencing it for years. 
Long story short, I went out of town to visit a good friend. He took me to a party, and although I hit it off with mostly everyone, today has been nothing but anxious thoughts thinking ""there's no way these people actually thought I was alright.""
I get that this is completely irrational, but that doesn't stop the thoughts from coming.

284,"This is random, but be warned - The movie ""Gravity"" is ridiculously anxiety-producing.","Ok, so I went to see the movie ""Gravity"" yesterday with my SO. I knew it was intended to be suspensful, and the previews made me anticipate a potentially scary situation (being stuck in space). But, I had no idea how bad it would be. I've had panic attacks in the past, and in certain sequences, the sounds of the movie almost made me have another one. Sandra Bullock's character starts having a very increased heart rate that the audience can hear, hearing her breath, and hearing a ringing sensation similar to one if you're going to pass out. It freaked me out a lot more than I'd like to admit, but I was able to do some deep breathing to keep myself relatively calm and not have a full-blown panic episode (which, by the way, I haven't had a sever one in close to a month; I'm doing so awesome with it!). If I hadn't been in the comfortable presence of my SO or had developed these coping skills, I could have easily freaked out. Just as a warning, if you're an anxious person/have had panic attacks, Gravity might be triggering. ",23,2013-10-16 04:07:25 EDT-0400

287,Today I accomplished something huge.,"I have severe anxiety when it comes to public speaking, particularly in classrooms. I'm a senior in college and until today I had **never** spoken in class. With the help of my therapist, I arranged with my professor something to say in class (I tend to completely panic during class so I had to think of something beforehand). I practiced what I was going say - it was only two sentences - for three hours last night. And when she asked the question, I raised my hand and I said it. I spoke in class for the first time ever.


It was the worst feeling ever. It's been three hours and I'm still shaking a bit. My heart was racing, pits and palms sweating. I felt like I was going to die. My throat closed up, and the two sentences that I had practiced for so long came out as phrases. 


But I did it. I spoke in class. I think I've taken a huge leap forward.

289,Does anyone else feel like their lungs are trapped?,"Hi /r/Anxiety.

I've been on Reddit for quite a while but I never thought to see if there was an anxiety subreddit.. silly me :P

A little bit about me to begin:
I'm 22, male, and live in Canada. I have just begun taking 25mg of zoloft yesterday, and will up the dose to 50mg in 5 days time, and up to 100mg in 12 days. I have taken Zoloft previously but stopped abruptly because I was unhappy with a side effect. The specifics of it are that during sex, I was unable to ejaculate for a very long time (sometimes up to an hour and a half). I was very lucky that my girlfriend at the time was understanding and very very patient with me. She tried everything to get me to not worry about it, but instead I just stopped taking the medication.

ANYWAY. What I really want to talk about is my big anxiety problem.

About 1-5 times per minute I feel like I must breathe extra deep and puff my lungs out as if they would not fill with air otherwise. It's a really uncomfortable feeling and if I'm not able to breathe deep enough, I can't forget about it and I spend the next x minutes trying to breathe. It's a real problem because it distracts me from school, work, conversations, movies, EVERYTHING. It's a really hard thing to describe, but if anyone else thinks they might be experiencing the same thing, I would love to hear it.

Thanks.",36,2013-10-17 23:17:26 EDT-0400

291,Things I've learned from depression and social anxiety,"* Nobody thinks about, or analyses what you do or say anywhere near as much as you do yourself
* It is always better to be yourself than to pretend to be something else; acting never pays off, and you might lose track of what you are really like
* Don't reward yourself for progress by doing something that damages progress
* You should be nice to yourself. Don't look for things to hate yourself for, instead, find ways to better yourself. You deserve praise for many things. 
* Perspective is very malleable. You can always find a more positive way of looking at a situation
* Don't worry about ""ending up"" a certain way. There is only one end, that is when you die. So we all ""end up"" the same way.

310,PROGRESS!!!!! Director of radiology at local hospital told me I can bring my cat for emotional support during extremely stressful testing!!!!,"**Update at the bottom.**

Greetings, /r/anxiety! I haven't been in here for a while, and I apologize, but my emotional state and anxiety have been a little high for me to come in here. Ridiculous, I know, but that's how it's been.

I really wanted to share with you something positive that feels like a huge accomplishment in my battle against anxiety.

Today is a very very stressful day, and I'm having a huge anxiety attack over it, but I'm somehow managing pretty well.

So this morning, while panicking about the events yet to unfold today, I receive a phone call informing me about an appointment tomorrow that I didn't know I had. I already have two medical appointments tomorrow and there's no way I can make it, so I reschedule.

I had an idea of what the test was supposed to be, but no one informed me of the whole details. The man on the phone goes over the details with me and once done he asks me if I still want to go through with it. This test is going to be a nightmare. Both physically and emotionally, and most people tend to back out when they hear the whole details.

I've had severe stomach issues for most of my life, so even though I absolutely do **not** want to go through with this nightmare of a test, I tell him that yes, I'll do it. Because if there's even a tiny chance that it reveals what's wrong with my stomach and leads me in the direction of healing, it'll be worth it.

He asks me if there's anything he can do for me and if I have any questions. I feel my voice catch in my throat. I know what I want to ask, but I feel like I can't. I feel like I'll be laughed at. I struggle, but I bite the bullet and explain about my anxiety and about how my cat is a great emotional support animal [we've started taking him to my medical appointments and my fiance and him camp out in the car while I'm having testing done].

I haven't registered him as an emotional support animal yet [you don't have to have the prescription to register them, but some institutions will ask to see the prescription in addition to his registration papers, I've heard and read] and I don't have a prescription for him yet because psychiatrists are in high demand in my area and I still have yet to find one I can go to.

It turns out that the man that had called me about my appointment was the director of radiology himself.

He tells me that yes, I can bring my cat in, and he'll put it in my file and let the radiologist know about it. And if *anyone* gives me *any* trouble about having Nova [my cat] with me, to call him [he then gave me his *personal* cell phone number] and he'll set things straight real fast.

He *also* told me that if I'm *ever* in radiology [even if it's during an emergency room visit] that Nova is welcome to come in with me and again, if anyone ever gives me any trouble about having him in radiology, to call his personal cell phone [at any hour, night or day] and he'll take care of it.

I started crying like an idiot while on the phone with him, thanking him over and over and over again.

So even though the events of today are still causing severe panic, my panic had been lightened somewhat by the conversation I had about this nightmare of a medical test I'm gonna have to go through.

The fact that Nova is being allowed into radiology with me [I'm not going to let him be in the room when the machine is actually running, my fiance will be taking him from the room when the machines are on] and will be allowed to comfort me between images being taken, is a huge deal to me. It feels like someone has taken a fifty pound weight off my shoulders.

**Update:** Today didn't end up as badly as we [myself and my fiance] were afraid it would. It was a really huge relief and overall we walked away unscathed.

I'm also still excited [not looking *forward to it*, I'm very emotional but not upset over it] about the phone call this post is about.",14,2013-06-05 20:23:46 EDT-0400
311,Relationship anxiety: I can't stop worrying about the break up even though everything is going perfectly. (Xpost r/relationship_advice),"(For the record, I'm not diagnosed with GAD or anything but anxiety disorders definitely run in my family. I've been talking with a therapist for months.)  
I (19f) have a fantastic boyfriend (21m) who would do anything for me, loves me, even thinks I'm somewhat cute when I go all neurotic on him (he says I'm sweet-crazy!). We've been together two months and everything is perfect.  
We had a talk yesterday, when he made a joke of being single again, about our potential breakup and he said what I was feeling: Considering our ages, chances are we will break up at some point but we hope to be together for a long time, and if that ends up being forever then that's great. This, logically, is exactly how I feel about the situation, and the fact that he agrees completely couldn't be more amazing.  
Unfortunately I've had a string of bad relationships in the past that have all included the guy getting tired of me and leaving me for someone else/becoming unattracted to me. Needless to say, since these are my only other relationship experiences, this pattern is somewhat ingrained in my head and, now that we've talked about our potential breakup, I feel like a switch has been flipped and now I can't enjoy the relationship **now** because I'm hyperaware of the breakup. He didn't write back for a few hours? He's getting tired of me.  I already want to hide the things that he's got at my house so I don't think of him if we do break up. My head is in perpetual what-if mode, a very dangerous place for me to be.   
I realize I can't control the future and should just be here now, because we're young and in love, but my anxiety doesn't realize that and  
won't  
SHUT  
**UP.**  
If anyone has any advice as to how I can chill my brain out, I thank you in advance. I just want consistency. I'm tired of heartbreak.  
**TL;DR:** I have the perfect relationship right now but the realization that we will probably break up is ruining it for me. Curse you, Say Yes To The Dress and adorable old people who have been married to their high-school sweethearts.

313,Try Magnesium supplements.,"I decided to try it a week ago. It is in powder form, and you put it into water. Apparently, it is supposed to relax you.

Well, it is working. I don't feel as stressed out for some reason. Sure, I get panic attacks, but that general feel of anxiety is not here anymore.

Just thought I should point that out.

edit: Just wanted to say that I am no doctor and I also wanted to again add that it doesn't exactly cure panic disorder. Many have pointed out that it relaxes the muscles in your body, but doesn't do anything to your mind. Well, at least for me, a lot of my panic attacks results when I get really tense in my muscles. When I start to become anxious, my muscles tense up, sudden pain can happen, one thing leads to another, and I will think I am dying and things get worse and worse. But now that my muscles are more relaxed, a lot of the panic attacks that I experienced in the past do not occur anymore. So if you are trying to completely get rid of panic attacks, it probably won't deliver. But it is an effective way of helping you I think. ",23,2013-06-04 04:36:49 EDT-0400

317,"Would ""social rage"" be considered a form of social anxiety?","Until today, I never really considered the things I feel to be a form of anxiety, but since I've never heard of ""social rage"" I started to wonder if maybe it could just be anxiety that is expressed within me in a different way.

I *hate* being in public, especially in any retail or restaurant setting.  The longer I spend in any given retail establishment, the more infuriated I become.  Sometimes particular things will set me off, like having slow-movers get in my way and block an entire aisle, waiting in a slow-moving line, or a particular product that's obviously overpriced and designed to prey upon the ill-informed or uneducated, and sometimes it just seems to creep up on me for no reason.

Regardless, the longer I spend in a place, or the more various places I have to visit, the more frustrated and enraged I become, until I eventually start fantasizing about ramming people with my shopping cart, tipping over shelves or displays for no reason, or firebombing the building (not that I would ever do such things, it's just that picturing them in my mind helps to keep me calm.)  Eventually, I will reach a point where I'm just thinking ""Screw this, I gotta get out of here.  I'm ready to f&$*&ng get home.""

So could this be a social anxiety kind of thing, or does it sound like something else that I'm dealing with here?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, feel free to keep adding anything else you want to mention!  I should have noted in my original post that I will be seeking out a doctor or therapist in the near future, I'm not attempting to self-diagnose or self-treat.  I just want to know what kinds of things to ask about or focus on once I *do* locate a doctor.  Of course, if I see one and their opinion on what is going on with me is much different from my own opinion, I will take their advice, I just want to have a ""starting point"" for a conversation with them.

EDIT 2:  It seems it may be a moot point.  I called my insurance company today to check, and I do not have any mental health care coverage whatsoever...  bummer.",14,2013-06-05 00:26:53 EDT-0400

I hate feeling obligated to go over, when I just want to enjoy my solitude in the comfort of my own home.   If I lived in a different city then they would be less inclined to bother me.   Their pressure and my feeling of obligation always makes my anxiety flare up and makes me want to retreat even further, but I can't think of an excuse to get out of going to see them.   

I love my family, but it just seems like they feel like because I'm reclusive and don't go out much that I don't have my own life and things I want to do, even if it is just playing video games, reading a book, or watching a movie/tv. 

Also, its not like I never see them, heck i was over there memorial day, but it seems like they want life to be how things were back when we were all living together, before I grew up and got my own fortress of solitude.

329,Really proud of myself tonight,"I went out with friends tonight, and didn't have any sort of break down. No anxiety before leaving, no panic attack once I got there, nothing. I did feel a little left out but that's because it's literally been months since I've properly hung out with a group of people. 

I stayed really calm, didn't have any alcohol and tried to stay off my phone, I did watch the tvs in the restaurant for a bit but other than that I participated in the conversation. 

It seems like a really big deal since this was something that I stopped doing once I started getting anxiety about things. 

Now I need to sleep for 12 hours to recover :P",10,2013-11-02 10:02:23 EDT-0400

332,Anxiety as explained to those who don't understand [Rant],"I'm sure this has been done before, but I've got to rant and this seems the place to do it.

I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago at the age of 26. I went through debilitating periods growing up where I had no idea what was going on. My parents thought I was faking attacks for attention. I was never taken to a doctor, never given medication. I dealt with these attacks in very, very poor fashion. First I used sports, and then turned to alcohol and drugs as I got older. I try to mask being petrified about meeting new people, large crowds etc. by acting out, and sometimes attracting negative attention. I will go to a new gym, get to the parking lot, and talk myself out of going inside because I can feel the adrenaline starting to rise. I want to get out and make new friends, but I am terrified at the thought of going to new meetups or social gatherings without someone I already know. 

I became pregnant last year at the age of 28, and had to quit my medication (xanax) cold turkey. Counseling helped some, but not very much. I married a man who doesn't have the slightest idea of what I go through. He tells me I have a good life, I shouldn't worry about anything etc. When I act out and worry/get stressed/have an attack, he would tell me I'm a horrible person, not nice, worry about stupid things, and a plethora of other comments that never helped.  

My mistake was not going back to my doc immediately, putting my kiddo on formula and getting back on anxiety meds. I wanted the best for my daughter and thought that was being breastfed. I wasn't concerned about me, but I should have been. It has ended up with my husband filing divorce paperwork and leaving me and my infant to fend for ourselves.

As you can imagine, that did not help things. Of course, my friends are all team my8ponies89, and his are all on his side. But when trying to explain how my anxiety contributed (I say that, because it wasn't all my fault that we ended up at this point) my friends don't understand. They say such things as:

* just focus on the big picture
* don't worry about anything. You will be ok.
* shake it off
* get over it (as said by my soon to be ex)

Debilitating doesn't even describe what I go through when an attack happens. I can be sitting there, minding my own business, when a nasty thought enters my head. All of a sudden, my brain has torpedoes locked on that one thought, and we are going to fire and make that thought explode into fifty other thoughts about how bad things are, what could go wrong and how it's going to totally fuck me over. 

Chaos ensues in my mind. Physically, my heart is beating so fast it feels like I am out on a run. I'm sweaty, I'm scared. My chest hurts. I can't breathe. On the outside, I may look only slightly amiss. But mentally, I'm a wreck. I'm helpless. It consumes me. My mind has my body in a jail cell in the depths of hell, and I am a prisoner within the confines of my head.

I stay like that for what seems like hours, although it may only be a few minutes. I try to function normally. I have to take care of my daughter. I have to drive. I have to work. I have to do XYZ, but I don't even remember doing it half the time. 

Then, it starts to subside. I slowly regain focus and composure. I made it through one more. I can go on about my day.

Until the next one. 

I have an appointment today to try Paxil, which is safe for breastfeeding. Wish me luck. ",30,2013-11-04 17:35:42 EST-0500

335,Started Paxil last week. I feel like a new person! No anxiety.. For the first time in ever.,"I'm 17 years old male and since I could remember I've had anxiety... I've always worried about things, scared of doing things, going out in the world, being in public.  I was sick of school, my grades were horrible, barely any friends, loner, not social, very shy and that quiet kid. So in 8th grade I talked my mom into putting me into online school so I didn't have to deal with that. Well that obviously just avoided the issue and didn't deal with what was the core problem that was troubling my life.   
    
  
 I'm now in 12th grade online still, and honestly the past couple years have been so wasteful due to my anxiety taking over me from being me, feeling free. I feel like anxiety was a cloud over my mind, and now it's finally clear, FREE TO BE ME! I AM ME NOW! I also suffer from social anxiety (online school didn't help) which is the **WORST**. Anyone who has social anxiety can agree. Any social situation I get in, I feel like my mind goes blank, my voice gets quieter and I just am a different person. As if I go in auto pilot mode and have no control whatsoever and freeze. Always looking around, worried people are looking at me or speaking about me etc, just WEIRD SHIT!  
  
**Last week I went in to a regular doctor checkup, mentioned anxiety and he offered paxil 10mg (my mother uses paxil too) and I wasn't sure.. But thankfully I took the offer. He said it takes up to 2 weeks, it's been 9 days now and it's kicked in/kicking in. 2 days ago I woke up, same as usual but I didn't feel that anxiety feeling.. I always have really bad anxiety when I wake up and I was in complete awe with a smile on my face. The first time I felt me and was able to be me with a clear mind. None of that foggyness/anxiety ridden mind. Overthinking, overlooking everything, feeling uncomfortable 24/7. All that's gone. 

  Today was my first day at my job(worked there for a few months, never really talked to anybody) with this and it was unbelievable, I was talking to people, laughing, smiling. I actually could hear myself talk with my normal voice, not that anxiety weird voice I get where I talk quiet and sound different, not the blank mind I get when trying to say something. Whenever I talked it just came out smooth without worry and it felt amazing.
   
  
 Now the only medication I started using for it was cannabis, that was around 16.. Wasn't until late 16/early 17 that I really started smoking regularly (on and off). Which caused other issues. But it was the only thing that made my worries/anxiety melt. Now since I'm on paxil I'm going to slow down my weed usage, but I do want to say that it does feel different being high while having no anxiety to begin with now. Defiantly going to be a after work thing now.    ",26,2013-11-01 14:14:37 EDT-0400

337,life seems like a waste,"Hello r/anxiety!
I'm  a 17 year old boy who is going through highschool in sweden.
i have a few problems, sooo here goes.

I've started to feel more and more lonely and have been having anxiety/panic attacks frequently over 1 year now. which have ruined some chances to get new friends and fun experiences.
It really gets on my nerves that i cant be a normal 17 year old kid and have fun like everyone else. 

And i can't really see the reason to live really (**im not suicidal or anything like that**) . 
All we do is work work work to pay the bills. Then when we're old, soggy and our bodies are worn out, we get the freedom to do what we want without worrying about not being able to pay the rents. It's as if we are some kind of working sheep for the government.

im talking to a psychologist, have someone here had any similar problems and how did you tackle them?

I have two days before my application to take the script to the next level is due, and I was wondering, if anyone is in agreement that we need to see more films that don't patronise or demonise sufferers of mental illness (I don't see why we don't see more cases where the lead character of a thriller/drama/comedy suffers from a mental illness), then perhaps I could get a quote of support...

...something to let the powers that be know that people want to see this kind of movie. That there's a massive group of people who need to be represented; who need to get across to the world that an illness doesn't define the individual, and that anyone and everyone can achieve a little bit more control of their mind.

I doubt I'll be able to get many quotes in two days, but if anyone has any idea where I could ask people who would care about this subject, please do let me know.

342,So...my anxiety has basically caused a full blown existential crisis at 18 (F),[deleted],12,2013-11-03 23:33:49 EST-0500
343,[Rant] College is frustrating.,"So here's the scoop:

My anxiety is ruining college for me, and these are the five reasons why:

1.  I cannot, for the life of me, concentrate on studying.  I've found that alternative methods sometimes work:  watching videos is one great one, because I can keep my hands busy with crochet which keeps my mind calm and focused.  But now I'm in upper level science courses and videos just aren't available.  I'm forced to rely solely on the textbook, which brings back something that has haunted me over the past two years of college:  I can't read.  Okay, so I am actually capable of reading (else, why would I be here?) but I lose concentration so quickly on it.  I read two sentences, and the rest might as well be in Russian because I scan it and don't intake it.  I get to the end of the page, ask myself, ""What was that about?"" and reply, ""I have no idea.""

2.  Tests feel like a heart attack.  Oh boy, tests are fun.  My heart tries to jump out of my chest, I have *even more* trouble remembering stuff than I usually do, and I just feel like crying.  I breathe deep - in, 2, 3, 4, 5, hold, 2, 3, 4, 5, out, 2, 3, 4, 5 - and I just *know* that people are thinking, ""I wish she would just shut up and take the test, none of us like exams!""

3.  Services on campus suck.  I summoned up all of my courage to go to our academic support services here (I was sure they'd just tell me I was stupid and lazy), and they asked me, ""Are you partying too much?""  *Well, no, I don't ever go to parties.*  ""Are you going home too much?""  *I've only been home once this semester.*  ""Sorry, we can't help you.""  *Thanks.*  I am thankful for our Student Counseling Services, who provide 10 free sessions for every student, but everything else just tells me that I'm a terrible student.

4.  I can't get over my own bullshit.  My therapist told me to go see our Office of Accessibility, and I just felt stupid coming into there.  Like, is my diagnosis even a *thing?*  It feels like mental health diagnoses are a lot like a horoscope; they can apply to everyone if you think about it hard enough.  And even if it is a ""thing"" is it really a disability?  I saw a blind kid walk in after me, and I thought to myself, *I don't have a disability.  I'm just making this up for sympathy.  I'm just lazy.*

5.  I'm terrified of talking to professors.  Pretty often, I get an exam back, and I've done terribly.  And everyone tells me, ""Talk to the professor.""  And what?  Listen to *him* tell me how stupid and lazy I am?  Listen to *him* tell me to read the book more?  I've already beat myself up over that.  I couldn't stand to go have my fears validated.",4,2013-11-04 16:03:11 EST-0500

But I'm not here to explain all that, get some of the same sort of comments as usual.

Not that I don't appreciate every one of 'em, but it's impossible to adequately explain it all, not to even my family, how could anyone here really get it, even if they had the time?

No, all I want is to talk a little bit.  Listen a little more.  What brings you here tonight?  What are you winding down with, or psyching yourself up for?  Where are things headed?

363,Have been going through major anxiety issues for the passed 4 months. I decided to try something new and have been feeling so much better the last few days :D,"So for the passed 4 months I've been feeling so low. No energy, no motivation and no pleasure or joy in much of anything. Just recently I made my reddit account and I browsed through all the subreddits where I thought maybe, just maybe I could connect or at least find people who understand. Well, I found /r/progresspics and was amazed at the life changing decisions that these people made to change not just their whole body image but their overall health and many of their written testimonies were eye opening for me. So many of them felt how I felt.. not just about their health but about the world in general but they made a decision. A difficult but necessary decision to change what they could. Through /r/progresspics I then found /r/Keto have been on the Keto diet for a few days and chose today to do my first workout in forever, although I'm sore and know I'm probably going to be even more sore tomorrow, it feels good to take steps forward than to stand still.

Many things in life are out of my control, but the one thing I do have control over is how I care for myself and my body. I must say.. even though today is my first time working out in a year or so, I have not felt this alive in so long and I feel great. I want to share this with /r/anxiety and will cross post to /r/depression as well because it wasn't that long ago when I felt that I was a waste of space and I didn't belong here anymore. I felt like I no longer wanted to exist.. and now I am looking forward to meeting goals, and that in itself is a goal met. 

Anybody out there that has felt alone, empty, lonely and felt completely hopeless... please know, you're not alone (there are genuinely good people out there that want and possibly need your friendship) if you're reading this and have any opinion on it what-so-ever you are not empty, loneliness is fleeting and so is hopelessness, when you feel you're very lowest, there is only one way to go and that is up. Find strength from within and push forward. Thanks for letting me share this and of you've read this, please try your best to take a step forward.. to make a change.",27,2013-02-12 23:26:19 EST-0500
364,I am someone who has controlled anxiety- this is my story,"Hi, I am a 22 year old female who has learned to control my anxiety. After stumbling upon this subreddit, I really want to share how I was able to get myself under control so that I could live normally again. I really feel for all of those who are struggling and want to help in any way I can. These are the three things that have helped me:
1. I first stumbled upon anxiety when I was 17. I had constant panic attacks, got no sleep, couldn't go to school, my life was falling apart. This stemmed from my friends thinking I would be crazy, the sudden panic of finding a perfect college and being forced to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, moving away from home, and death. I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication. My mother had convinced me to talk to a doctor, that he wouldn't force me to do anything I didn't to do. This was my first step. I talked to the doctor and of course he suggested medicating me. Is this addictive? can I stop using it whenever I want? Is this going to affect me mentally? These were all the questions I had and they were answered; no, certain medications are not addictive, I can stop, and it won't do anything to me mentally besides halt my anxiety. He told me to try a sample, if I didn't like it, I could stop but just take it for three days. Three days later I felt great. A new person, waves of anxiety stopped, I could interact again.
2. Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, certain topics would still stress me out and flare my anxiety up. One of these topics was death: I had just put it in the back of my mind to deal with later but that only made it amplify. While in college I had to fulfill some core class requirements one of which was diversity. I took a religions class for this just because it sounded somewhat interesting (and I did get made fun of by some friends, but whatever, right?). I didn't meant to take anything from that class, but learning about buddhism, daoism, and others of the like, my entire perspective of life began to change. I took another class focusing on asian religions where we read books by these people (Diamond Sutre and Wandering the way most notable) and I was able to grasp a firm, spiritual control of myself and learned to control my body. This calmed me down greatly and I no longer have any concerns with death.
3. School still stressed me the hell out: I was a junior, trying to graduate in one of the hardest majors. I like free credits, we have physical activity courses that give you this so I thought what the hell, took yoga and pilates. I gained more from these than I thought possible; learning awareness of your body really helps you deal with stress. I personally enjoyed pilates more (it is very strong with breathing exercise and gives you the best ab workout ever) but they both dealt with the idea of your body being only yours. I learned many destressing techniques and it was a great release for end of day classes with midterm exams. I learned to control my heart rate, close my eyes, and just release my stress and live in the here and now when I get too stressed out. I do this when I feel a stress induced panic attack coming on. Buddhism texts may have helped me a bit with this, but I really realized myself through these silly classes and have been going strong ever since.
I did have full support from both of my parents this entire time and I never did have to see a psychologist for this. But I found my way through this difficulty and realize that living with anxiety isn't something I can just throw away, you have to learn to live with it and control it. Humans are facing far more stress in this new technological age (with having to stress about decisions for college, making decisions that effect the rest of your life, job ops, etc.) and we didn't all adapt to deal with this properly. Its nothing you need to feel too hindered by and remember there are always people trying to overcome it :) Don't feel afraid to ask for help!

I would like to note: Almost no one knows about my anxiety. I tell no one that I have a strong spiritual side (because that sounds a bit silly) and I never really encourage it unless someone has problems with anxiety. People know that I am a little athletic, but I have it so under control that people ask me ""Don't you ever get nervous in a large crowd like this? You are really outgoing"" I just smile :) I just didn't want to sound like a religious nut! ~",22,2013-02-08 03:11:07 EST-0500

I am 26 and have been scared of driving for years. I failed the two other times partially because of how poorly I handle tests when my anxiety is high. Today I passed! I can now buy a car and drive alone (went from a G1 to G2 for anyone in Ontario). 

Hurray for perseverance! 

Edit: Thank you everyone! I've responded a bit in comments but just as an FYI: I'm not a nervous driver, I used to be and was TERRIBLE at driving. I paid a lot for private lessons, practiced with friends and family so much and now can actually enjoy driving. I conquer anxiety and learn best when left alone and allowed to practice/try things out on my own...which isn't an option when you just have your G1, so I feel like my driving will get so much better now that I can drive alone.

382,"I ""graduated"" from therapy! Hearing about other people getting better always helped give me hope, so I thought I'd share in case it helps anyone else.","Hi r/Anxiety!  I've posted here a couple times with questions and asking for advice, and you've always been wonderful and so helpful.  If anyone is reading this that feels uncomfortable asking for help or advice, this is a really great place to start.  Everyone is so supportive and non-judgemental!


I felt uncomfortable with the idea of therapy for my anxiety for a long time.  I've been pretty functional most of my life, and even when my anxiety starting getting worse about 6 months ago, I still worried that it ""wasn't bad enough"" to warrant professional help.  I was worried that maybe my anxiety wasn't that bad, and that it was just a character flaw that I couldn't deal with stressful things.  But, that was what I've deemed ""anxiety brain"" was seeing.  In the real world, I was crying and panicking almost every morning that I had to go to my easy part time job.  Physically, I was having trouble sleeping, my shoulders always ached, my bowels were almost never happy, and I could feel my heart often doing strange things.  Just because I could get myself out the door and continue with life didn't mean everything was okay.


So, I finally got into therapy after putting it off for several months.  We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication.  I mention this because I've seen some people here are often worried that getting help means you are going to be put on meds.  Not necessarily!  Meds are incredibly helpful for some people, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!  


I saw a therapist once a week for about 4 months, and she feels like I'm doing well enough to stop for now.  With the added note that I can always call if I'm having trouble and want a ""tune up"" session = ).  I've been feeling better, and it was really validating to hear it from her too!  I'm come to terms with the fact that I'm never going to be anxiety free.  But, seeing a therapist really helped give me better tools to deal with it as it comes.  I still feel like I'm more anxious than the average person, but it doesn't bog me down like it used to.  So last I wanted to add some things that I feel like really helped me.

1. Therapy.  Literally, this is the number 1 thing that helped.

2. Keeping a regular sleep schedule.

3. Meditation, on a regular basis and as-needed when I start feeling the anxiety creep up.

4. Keeping a journal.  Writing down my anxious thoughts helps get them out of my head.  And then, it's easier to challenge those thoughts and turn them around.

5. Finding things to look forward to.  I expended a ton of energy on negative things, so I have been trying to replace it to positive things.  I plan short day trips to new places.  I look up fun diy projects that I want to do.  Little things still count!

6. I drink a lot of hot tea.  Sometimes specifically ""relaxing"" or ""anti-anxiety"" labeled teas.  But I honestly also just enjoy the process of making and drinking tea.  I have my own little teapot, and I sit down with it and keep pouring myself tea.  It's lovely = )

7. Exercise.  Even just walking.  It always felt to me like I was burning up some sort of anxiety chemical along with the calories.

8. Podcasts.  I love podcasts.  [Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/) is a great one that specifically addresses mental illness, but in an easy going, often comedic way.  I also really love [You Made it Weird](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/you-made-it-weird/).  It's much more comedy focused, but the host Pete Holmes often talks about his experiences with therapy, and sometimes the guests do as well.  Just hearing people talk about it sort of normalized it for me, and made it seem less scary.  Plus Pete Holmes is hilarious, and laughing always makes me feel better!

That feels really long winded, but I hope it was at least a little helpful for anyone!  If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer. 

EDIT: Just wanted to add one more thing.  After having a low paying part time job for a long time, I just scored an interview for my ideal job!  I wasn't looking for a new job for a long time, because the thought of all the steps I had to do and all the new people I had to talk to made me incredibly nervous.  But I finally got the motivation and gumption to start looking again, and it was actually through networking and talking to people that I got the interview!  I'm hella nervous, but that just means I'll get some good meditation practice in and drink a lot of tea between now and then = )

They scream and tell me everything is my fault and I brought it on my self. They've lost patience and are kicking me out. I have no friends. Before I met my boyfriend I didn't have a voice. The people I went to school with thought I was mute. I have no place to go. Today after I told my dad what happened he kept telling me it was my fault. I lost it. I was screaming on the top of my lungs that ""it's not my fucking fault"" and that I hate him. I slammed the door, locked myself in and started screaming so I couldn't hear him. I took my nails and was just scratching myself hard and hysterically crying and screaming. I've never done anything like this before. If I had a gun I would have pulled the trigger.

395,I do not know what is goin on in my brain these days.,"I almost posted this in ADHD because that's what I thought my problem was until I evaluated myself against symptom lists.  But I think r/anxiety is probably more appropriate at this point.

I've talked to my GP a number of times, we made a few conclusions, tried a few treatments (none for ADHD, just depression, insomnia, anxiety because she thinks lack of focus is directly related to my depression and anxiety) but the one lingering issue I have is a total inability to focus on my schoolwork.  It feels like my brain utterly rejects focusing on it, and is almost painful, definitely very uncomfortable for me to try.  It's boring, sure, most of the reading could be summarized from a chapter to a paragraph, and I feel almost insulted that the writer thinks it takes that much text to get the reader to understand.  But it's school, and this is how school is.  Exciting hands-on learning is just not part of the equation.  Adults in college/technical schools don't get Montessori treatment.   I've never been able to focus on textbooks, but I will absolutely devour a good novel or the internet.  

What I'm getting at, is what else is there that I could be looking for?  Or where do I go from here as far as doctors?  I think I have gotten all I can out of my GP.

I don't meet much of the ADHD criteria except for the total inability to focus.  I don't forget things, I'm well organized...  my brain just shuts down when I try to read textbooks and I feel SO DUMB.  My close friends keep telling me I just have to get over it or quit procrastinating.  They don't believe me when I say there is physical discomfort involved.  I need to do this stupid assignment but I'd practically rather chop 5 pounds of onions than read the textbook right now.  And even if I do trudge my way through today, I have another assignment due tomorrow, and Sunday, so on and so forth.  I have no idea what to do with myself right now.  If I open the book again I will probably burst out crying.",15,2013-04-19 21:33:18 EDT-0400

398,No I can't come to your sleepover...it's complicated,"I wanted to take a moment to write this out. Perhaps as a way to heal or maybe to make a little ripple in this pond we call the Internet. I have battled with panic attacks since I was seven...the heart pounding, fist clenching, teeth numbing sort of attacks. Most of the time these attacks happened in private while my family was just trying to figure out why I suddenly went ""away"". However there were times, those horrible times, when it wasn't just my family. 
As a girl one of the greatest pleasures as a child is the all important sleepover. Those nights of character pajamas and silly dares...you know...girl stuff. Those are the nights when best friendships are declared and you find out all the crucial life lessons. Add anxiety to the mix however and it might as well turn into social suicide. I had a moment like that. They were my best friends...we had laughed...made cookies...shared our secrets...then bed time came and in an instant it was as if I was hanging from the edge of a cliff, my fingers slipping with each passing breath. I collapsed into a recliner and began to panic...spinning out of control like a car on ice. They screamed...they called my mom...I left and the next day...I was in social Siberia. On that day I lost all the friends I had to snide remarks and sidelong glances and realized that I would never have 'bffs' again. It felt like I had died and was left as a husk of a little girl. Eventually new girls would ask me to come stay the night and it was always the same....""no...I'm sorry...it's complicated."" 
So that was my life...even now strange places take me back to that cliff edge and I'm still working on pushing myself a little more. Anxiety is the monster under all of our beds...the unknown enemy who knows exactly what we are afraid of...but we fight on.",3,2013-04-15 01:50:07 EDT-0400

When you're ashamed of how little you've accomplished with your life, these questions sometimes feel like torture.

Are you in college? What do you study? What are your plans for the weekend?  Where do you work?

*i'm a college dropout and i dont plan on doing shit for the weekend*

So I'm left with the options to tell the truth and look like a weirdo or lie to the person's face and feel bad about it later. I wish it was socially acceptable to just tell the person that you aren't in the mood to talk and let them cut your hair. I don't mean anything by it, and I usually leave a much bigger tip if the person understands that I don't really enjoy that kind of small talk.

410,[Rant] I hate the physical symptoms of anxiety and panic,"I really hate the physical symptoms of anxiety. I feel like I could handle the sadness, the stress, feeling wired out, being lonely, etc., but the physical symptoms are what really get me.


For me, those symptoms are centered around my throat and I feel like there's something caught in it, like I can't swallow or breathe, or my neck feels tense. My impulse when I feel like I can't breathe is to seek medical attention, but going to the ER isn't going to help anything. I'm just going to sit in a waiting room for a while, have my vitals taken, lay in a bed and talk to a nurse and a doctor for a couple of minutes, then be dismissed with a bill and possibly a small benzo prescription. I've had more panic attacks than I can count over the last three years and they've all ended the same way: I calm down. They vary in intensity and duration and sometimes the symptoms are slightly different, but they all end the same way. I've been checked out multiple times. I've had EKGs, thyroid tests, a couple of nasolaryngoscopies, and everything checks out normal. I could stand to lose a few pounds, but that's the extent of my medical issues.


I know there is nothing wrong with me physically, but when I'm having a panic attack, all of my experience and knowledge don't seem to matter. All I know is that I feel like I can't breathe and I want to preserve my life. I wish I could convince my panicking self that I'll calm down and that I'll be fine, but I haven't been able to do so to date.


I know all of the standard coping strategies. I need to start working out. I just haven't had the motivation. I can't keep waiting until I feel like it, though, because I never will. I need to force myself to get out and do something. I also need to start meditating again. It's been helpful in the past and it would probably be helpful now. I'm going to a yoga class tonight. I hope that is relaxing and helpful. I have plans to get myself out of the situation I'm in which is causing me so much stress and anxiety and loneliness, but there's a lot of waiting in the mean time that is being filled with anxiety and panic.

411,"To my fellow anxious people, hope this makes today better for you.","Today was a good day for me. Not much anxiety, just a little heavy in the chest and shortness of breaths. Will tomorrow be okay? I have utterly no idea. It may be horrible and I may have a panic attack. But right now, I'm not worrying about anything. I'm feeling good.

We anxious people are a bunch of nice people. Why? Because we are so considerate. We take other people's feelings into serious account. We care, we are cautious, and even though we are scared of getting hurt, we also try not to hurt other people. Our problem is that we care too much. We are sentimental. We are fragile. But that's not a *bad* thing per se, we just need to tone it down. Imagine how it would be if we got rid of the negative parts of our personality and kept the positive ones; we would be the nicest people ever. We would be thoughtful and caring.

I might spiral into an anxiety episode and completely forget about this tomorrow, but remember, it will get better. There is hope, even just a little bit. The fact that you are acknowledging your anxiety and reading about it on this subreddit is a big step to recovery. 

Don't ever think that no one understands. I do! Everyone here on /r/anxiety does. We are not a single anomaly, there is actually a bunch of us. Although you may think that no one around you understands, give credit to them for trying to understand. Sometimes we can't even explain what we are feeling. We can't expect everyone to understand us and yield our way. But just know that *some* of us do understand. You're not alone. 

For practical advice, lately I learned from a TED talk that when I'm anxious, I should concentrate on my anxious feelings instead of thoughts that *make* me anxious. So instead of thinking, *I'm horrible. How do I expect my boyfriend to stay with me? He's definitely going to get tired of me in 3 months.* Try to think, *Okay. I'm feeling anxious. My heart is racing. I feel scared. But it's okay. It'll pass.* I find it helpful because it distracts me from my racing thoughts.

I also have a theory. I believe that many of you would agree with me that we are not very confident people. We doubt ourselves constantly and think that we are not good enough and we are not good at anything. In a positive light, we are humble. But it also damages us. I think that volunteering can help boost our confidence, because we would be making ourselves useful without getting money in return. We would actually be helping someone. Although I normally don't like volunteering and I haven't had the time or energy to do so, I think we should all try. Sometime in the future. We just need to talk ourselves into doing it! 

If this makes just one of you feel better, I've done something good. If anyone wants to PM me and talk, I'll be around. Lastly, I leave you with a quote from Andy Warhol,

""Sometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say, So what. That's one of my favorite things to say. So what.""

412,Social anxiety is ruining my life.,"I am 27 years old, and far too old to feel this angsty. It's obnoxious. I avoid talking about it, because I feel like my level of anxiety-induced social awkwardness is something that most people grow out of by age 16. I don't want to be this person. 

I feel so tired. Tired of second guessing every word and gesture when I'm in public. Tired of the effort it takes to make myself have the most basic conversations, all the while knowing my responses sound very contrived and unnatural. I am smart. I am educated. There is no reason this should be so difficult when it comes so naturally to most people. 

I want more than anything to be able to connect with people, but it's like a necessary part of my brain is missing. I'm so caught up in my own head that I can't function socially, and I don't know how to change. It's crippling in virtually every area of my life. I don't think I can continue living like this indefinitely, and I'm afraid of what will happen when I break. Maybe it'll be a good thing. Maybe not. ",6,2013-12-21 13:13:54 EST-0500

414,"I've put off going to the doctor for help for so long, but today, I did it.","So, after 5 years of panic attacks and depression...I went to my doctor about it.

Everyone always says; 'Go see your GP.. it'll be fine, that's what they're there for. It'll help' etc..  But obviously it's easier said than done. SO MUCH easier said than done.

But today, I did it. 
I went.

I drove to the doctors surgery with my mum. 
Usually in there, you have to wait almost an hour to be seen, but today the wait was less than a minute. 
I didn't think about what I was going to say before I said it.. I figured the words would just come to me. And they did. 
It went a bit like this:

Me: ""I've been suffering with panic attacks since I was about 16. I usually get them when I start a new job, or college, or have an interview, started driving on my own..Basically when I do new things that people would usually be nervous about..I get 100 x more nervous and my anxiety tips me over the edge. My heart beats heavily, my chest tightens, I can't talk, breathe properly and I can't stop myself from crying"".

Doctor: ""You say you suffer from panic attacks, do you also suffer from depression?""

Me: ""Yes.. I think I do""  ~[At this point I burst into tears..Apologising multiple times as the doctor assured me it was okay]

Doctor: ""So do you think you're depressed because of anxiety, or anxious because you are depressed?""

Me: ""I think the anxiety sets off the depression.""

Doctor: ""And is it affecting your life, a lot?""

Me: ""Yes. Completely.""  [Still in a mess of tears - Luckily the doctor gave me a tissue]

-- The doctor brought up a questionnaire on his computer screen. Questions like 'How often, in a week, do you feel like you're a failure and life is not worth living?' and then options from 'Never', 'A few days' 'Several days' or 'Every day'.

After completing it, he said he's going to put me on some medication. Half a 50mg tablet of Sertraline daily, after breakfast.

I'm also now awaiting to hear from a therapist in the near future.


I'm writing this because I know how it feels to feel worthless, hopeless, in a hole you can't get out of.
I know that it's embarrassing and you feel weak.
I know that every day is SO difficult and tiring to keep pretending that everything is okay.

But it doesn't have to be. 
Doctors ARE there to help. And you will never really get just how easy it is until you do it yourself. But it takes that massive weight, that you've got used to for so long, off your shoulders.

I went in with my mum. But really, she didn't need to be there because it was just me and the doctor.
Sometimes its better to go alone, because I know that some people will hold back what they say, but you do need to be 100% honest. 

If you're thinking about going to get help, or have any questions then please ask. I had a few questions that I wanted to know which I couldn't find online. But I will do my best to answer yours from my own experiences. Even if you just want to know how to word your issues to the doctor.


The outcome of my experience is that, luckily, I have a lovely boss at work (Which I've just started) you has said she'll work with me through this and when I'm able and ready to come back to work, they will support me fully.

I've learned, through this, that the human race can sometimes be a hell of a lot better than you give it credit for.


Please get in touch if you need to. And if not, just remember that if I can do this, you CERTAINLY can. 


TL;DR - I went to the doctor after putting it off through fear. It was fine. If you have any questions or need advice please ask. Everything will be okay.    :) ",14,2013-12-18 15:27:11 EST-0500
415,Meditation Technique that helps me to manage my panic disorder.,"**Read Me First:**

My panic disorder seems to be fairly unique, and it could be argued it isn’t exactly anxiety, so this may not be applicable to many people.  I’m no doctor or shrink, nor am I a meditation instructor, and none of this is intended to diagnose, treat, or cure anything.  I just want to share a technique that has been of great help to me.

**Background:**

I have a panic disorder in which the symptoms are about 90% physical (chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sometimes pain in the left arm, sometimes pain in my bowel, sometimes pain in my upper gut just behind/below the bottom of my ribcage, and pain in the back of my neck).  Only in my most severe attacks to I experience the (usually common in panic disorder) symptoms of fear or sense of impending doom.  This has sent me to the ER twice, and I’ve discussed and treated it with multiple different doctors.  One primary care practitioner noted that a large percentage of my symptoms took place in body parts along the [vagus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve) nerve, which runs from the bowel/base of the spine, winding through organs all through the torso, ending at the base of the skull in the back of the neck.  

I brought all of this information to a clinical psychologist who happened to be very experienced with meditation.  This was the first time after 10 years of having the disorder that I tried using a therapist for treatment.
I have a long history with meditation, and a powerful relationship with one specific practice (which isn’t relevant to this discussion).  Because of my experience with meditation, and the nature of my symptoms, my therapist taught me the following technique and asked me to practice it at home daily, until I became able to practice it during an attack.

**A note on meditation for beginners:**

This technique will require you to focus on a physical sensation and on some creative visualization.  If you try this as a beginner to meditation, you need to understand that you will not be able to maintain this focus constantly over any given practice session.  There is a reason people use the word “practice” so frequently when referring to regular mediation.  As you focus on the object of your meditation, your attention will drift and random thoughts will come and go.  You will probably spend more time with your focus distracted than with your focus on the object of your meditation.  Don’t allow yourself to get frustrated by this.  When you notice your attention on something other than the object of your meditation, just recognize that fact and gently push your attention back to the object of mediation.  Let go of any frustration you feel during this process.  If you feel increasing frustration the longer your session goes, then start with shorter sessions (5 or 10 min) and work your way up until it is easier to let go of frustration.  It is more important to be calm during meditation than it is to hone your focus.  Increased focus on your object of mediation will come with time and practice.

**The Tools for this Technique:**

*Focus on physical sensation:*  You can focus on any body part to increase your awareness of it.  I will use the [perineum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum)(taint and surrounding area) as the example here, because that’s where this technique starts.  Sitting comfortably and with your eyes closed, you will focus all your attention on the physical sensation of the perineum (how it feels to be part of your body, where it is, all the physical sensations you get from paying attention to it).  You will do this for several parts of your body for this technique.

*Creative visualization:*  I’m not going to ask you to believe in anything that isn’t real here, but it may seem like it for a couple of parts.  I will ask you to focus your attention on something you are imagining for some parts of this, to combine the act of physical sensation with your imagination as an object of the meditation.

**The Technique:**

This will need to be practiced regularly when you are feeling fine.  You can’t expect any positive results if you only try this during an attack when it is most difficult to influence where your attention goes.  Once you have practiced enough, then you should be able to do this during a panic attack.

Sit comfortably with your back straight and chin slightly tucked.  It doesn’t matter if you are cross-legged on the floor, slightly reclined with your feet down, or whatever (though barefoot in a chair outside with my feet in the grass is particularly good for me).

Start by focusing your attention on your perineum, the base of your torso.  Spend a few moments here until you really have a solid connection of your attention to this part of your body.  Now imagine a point about 12 ft (3.7 meters) below you.  This point is like the roots of a tree, coming straight down from your body and spreading into the earth like a root system.  Visualize it taking positive energy from the earth and bringing it back into you at your base.  However you choose to visualize this, it should make you feel comfortable and secure.  You are grounded, connected to the earth below you and drawing positive energy from it.  (Remember this is a visualization tool.  I’m not asking you to believe in a life force, earth energy, auras or anything like that.)

From there, as you are focusing on positive energy flowing from a point 12 feet below you into your base, begin to move your awareness upward, keeping this positive flow in mind.  Move your attention up to the space between your belly button and your spine.  As you focus on the physical sensation of your body here, and visualize the positive energy flowing up, make sure to go slow and deliberately FEEL all physical parts of your body where you are visualizing a flow of energy. 
Continue moving your attention up your torso, the space between your lower ribs and spine, the area around your heart, your neck, your throat, the base of your skull, your sinuses, pineal gland, to the top of your head.  (If you are familiar with the idea of chakras, these are a really useful visualization tool here, feeling these “energy centers” connected by the energy you are flowing through your body)  
When you get to the top of your head, then visualize a point about 12 feet directly above you.  From here you will visualize drawing in a different kind of energy (preferably something you would connect to the divine).  This point expands into the space above you like a tree sending out branches with leaves to collect the sunlight.  You draw in this positive energy from above you, and bring it back in through the top of your head.  

Now bring the flow from the point above you back down through the top of your head, through your pineal gland, sinuses, throat, neck, clavicle, back down to the area around your heart.

You are now very aware of the physical sensations of your body parts in a column from your perineum straight up through the top of your head, and visualizing comforting, grounding energy from the earth flowing up into your heart meeting with the divine energy flowing down from above and mixing and flowing in the area between your chest and spine.

Continue focusing on this until your timer is up or until you feel like stopping.  I have done this for as little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour.  Slowly open your eyes and take a moment to come out of the meditation as if you were coming out of a nap.

I’ve done this for as little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour at a time, but usually used 20 minute sessions practicing every day before I was able to use this during a panic attack and actually end the attack with this technique.

**Results:**

For me, after a period of practice, this became a very powerful tool for me to manage my panic attacks.  It usually stops them just as effectively as Xanax, in shorter time and with none of those “Xanaxed out” side effects.  I have noticed that if I stop practicing when I feel fine, after a time it becomes less effective when I try it during an attack.  It only works as long as I stay in practice.

Since learning this well, I have used this technique as a passenger in a car, and a few times even with my eyes open in a meeting room full of people, none of them being the wiser that I was fighting off a panic attack.

**Finishing Up:**

If anyone actually spends a reasonable amount of time learning this, I’d love to hear how it works for you.

Any questions or comments?

416,"[Help] My therapist tells me I didn't learn how to self-soothe as a child, which is why my panic attacks are so severe. I still don't know how to self-soothe and I feel like ever since my diagnosis, it's been a downward spiral.","I just don't even know where to start. I started therapy at the end of the summer this year. My therapist is awesome, she's really understanding, and she's helped. When I did her evaluation for anxiety and depression levels, I scored VERY low on depression and EXTREMELY high on anxiety. She said she's never had a patient score this high. But she says I never learned self-soothing tactics as a child, but never really gave me advice on HOW to learn self-soothing. I can't afford therapy anymore, and the sessions my work was paying for have run out. 

I'm tired of having panic attacks. Ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety, I have been hyper-aware of it. It's like any time I get even mildly upset, I can feel the anxiety welling up in my chest, and then it's just panic from there on out. Like tonight at work(I work in a photo lab) I was super busy. I had about 7 orders going and was trying to keep them all organized. A customer approached and told me her last name. Her envelope was sitting there on the counter, but no photos were inside. After searching through all the photos I had printed, I came to the realization that while I pushed the button for her photos to print, they never actually printed.

The lady there was picking them up for her daughter, so she got her daughter on the phone. They wanted to know why I hadn't called them and told them it hadn't printed. I tried to explain that I'd done over 250 orders in the last three hours and had just barely realized they didn't print. The customer bitched and bitched until I gave her 20% off the order. Things finally slowed down, so I jumped at my chance to take a smoke break. Go outside. Smoke. Breathe. 

When I came back into the store, I saw my photo lab was flooded. I had left the water on to fill one of my tanks and forgot to shut it off before going outside. This sent me into full-on panic mode. I grabbed a mop and started sopping up the water. My face was beet-red, I couldn't breathe, I was sobbing... All over a mildly flooded photo lab. Nothing was even damaged. But I panicked anyways. I felt so fucking humiliated standing there and crying while mopping in front of all my coworkers. And none of them even understood that I am NOT sad. I am fucking happy as a clam, I'm just anxious and when I get upset(mad or just generally anything other than happy) I cry. I just do. 

But every time I feel the anxiety coming up, I panic because I don't know how to deal with the anxiety. I panic, which makes me more anxious, which makes me panic, which makes me anxious. It's a vicious fucking cycle. I almost wish I had never gone to therapy because I hate life so fucking much since I was told it's not depression, it's anxiety. This shit didn't interfere so severely with my life until I got diagnosed(or maybe I didn't realize how it was interfering?). 

I'm so fucking miserable. I need to learn to calm myself down and only one of my managers at work seems to understand and give me the time I need to cool off when I get anxious. What can I do to calm down in the moment when I can't just go do whatever the fuck I want to? How do I make myself breathe? How do I stop the humiliation that makes the anxiety worse when others see me cry? How do I just keep this under control? I realize I will never feel normal, but I need to control this.

417,Can an attack actually kill you? ELI5,"Ever since my ER trip last week for a major attack I have been obsessing over my heart. My blood pressure was crazy high and its usually pretty low when I'm fine. The thing is I'm not usually ""fine"" for very long these days.

419,Finally had a friend tell me everything I've always wanted to hear. I thought maybe it'd help you all a little too.,"Been suffering with anxiety since 2009. I haven't worked a single day since then and not being around people is really taking it's toll.

Today, after years and years of nothing.. a really good friend of mine finally said everything I've always wanted to hear. I thought maybe some would like to read too..

""Go out and do something. Not partying it up on the weekends... or weekdays. I mean volunteer for something, get a job, do some lawn maintenance, offer to walk the neighbours dog, look into school... anything!

The more you sit idle the less happy you'll be. That includes drawing, computer time, and video games. Human interaction is important whether you're an introvert or not. The more time you spend alone and left to your own devices the worse it'll get. You are miserable because you spend most of your time alone, thinking about how you're alone, even though you don't HAVE to be alone.

Honestly, I recommend getting a job. Even if it's something simple and doesn't require a degree. Not because you're ""a jobless bum"" but because it gets you out of the house, forces you to interact with people, and it keeps your mind occupied and away from the dark corners that are simply dark corners and nothing else.

Here's the thing. People, your family and friends, they WANT to help you, but it's awfully hard when the person your trying to help won't do much to improve their situation themselves. Bad attitudes and feelings are contagious. It's difficult to hang out with someone who feels so poorly about themselves and not start feeling it as well, especially if you, like pretty much everyone in the world, are already dealing with your own demons.

I know you. I know you're not useless or undeserving, but I also know you need a good push. Your friends love you. It's just hard to say what some people need to hear sometimes.""",3,2013-12-18 00:51:51 EST-0500

422,"[Rant] Just finished my second hospital stay for anxiety. This is what I learned. (Week long voluntary commitment to the psych ward recap, review, and recent after math.) TL;DR WARNING! EMOTION DUMP WARNING!","I am not a doctor and any advice given is strictly opinion.

To start, some back story. I had my first panic attack in December 2008 at the time I didn't know anything about Benzos and was all for a prescription for Xanax. My doctor obliged. I lost my insurance and now am at the mercy of government programs until my SSD and Medicade kick in. These programs do not like giving out Benzos which I am fine with because I am looking to wean off them anyway. That being said anyone thats been prescribed them knows cutting them cold turkey after 5 years is not only unpleasant but highly dangerous. I was 22 during my first panic attack and the condition has only worsened. I have since developed Agoraphobia, Major Depression Disorder, Borderline Personality, redeveloped OCD, and what doctors tell me are the beginnings of manic episodes that could be anything from a new symptom of my depression to schizophrenia but only time will tell. 

I start my journey at a program called Crest in New Jersey. They have me fill out paper work and then give me a survey. I am 100 percent honest about everything including my past Opiate addiction and suicide ideation (The latter is something I still struggle with.). They give me a meeting with a ""perscirber"" which I believe is a nurse practitioner within 4 days I am fresh out of Xanax until then. 

I tried to make it benzo free but check myself into the ER within 16 hours. The Doctor on duty luckily is a believer in Benzo Withdrawal and gives me an Ativan ASAP. I am taken to their psych ward where when asked what I was there for I answered truthfully. A 4 day script of Xanax to hold me over before my appointment. He informs me they ""don't do that here."" and tells me I can go on my way, they'll bill me later. A nurse in the unit that has watched me break down takes pity on me and calls the upstairs doctor who writes a script for 6 .25 Xanax well lower than my 1 mg 3 times a day dosage I am used to, but I'll make it through the night.

The next day I am forced to obtain Xanax from a friends dad. I show up to Crest 3 days later not a complete wreck they ask how I am not in withdrawal, I tell them the truth about the friends dad and they say they can't co-sign those actions but understand and allow me to see the perscriber. Before I see her they tell me 99.9 percent of the people that are given meds in this program don't get benzo's. I say I understand and am ushered in.

The perscriber gives me another interview I tell her about my anxiety, history with mental illness, and general bleak world view she is sympathetic. I tell her my current meds and she says ""That is way too many benzos."" I agree and ask her to help me taper off benzos completely. She says okay and gives me the plan. I am well versed on my medication, she says she wants to give me a longer acting benzo so I don't keep having spikes and rebound anxiety. I suggest Klonopin she says I read her mind. She prescribes me 1 .5 mg of Klonopin a day for 10 days. I am not amused...but I have some left over Xanax and she says I can take 2 if the day is really rough. I ask her if she thinks the drop in dosage is safe. She assures me it is and the fact it is longer acting will do wonders in my taper and gives me another appointment for that Friday (6 days away). Flash forward to Tuesday and the plan has failed! I have taken all my Xanax and K-Pins sans one .5 K-Pin (Mind you I am still taking less than half the amount of benzos I was taking merely 4 days before hand.) My withdrawal is at critical mass and I am in a constant state of panic. Im clammy, sweaty, I think my hearts going too fast, having episodes of numbness in my extremities, I can only sleep 3 hours at a time if I am lucky, and rent is due.

I tell my roommate I am going to get my last check from Dominos. I had been working their for about 4 weeks it was the first real job I have had post my first panic attack 5 years before, and I was starting to fall into a series of panic attacks and self isolation that caused me to call them and tell them I lost my license and can no longer work their. I enjoyed the people and was sad about it, but I just couldn't pull it off any longer. None of this is helping my depression.

I wake up the next morning all ready a little panicked. I live in Brick and worked in Red Bank which is about 40 minutes away. I didn't mind because driving is one of my few non stressors and the area was full of rich folks that tipped hardily. But now I am on a tenth of my prescribed dosage (The .5 K-Pin I had saved for the drive.)  of a medicine I have been suddenly deprived of and I have to drive my car 40 minutes through a gauntlet of automobiles. The drive is terrible as one could predict and I spend most of it trying not to lose myself in my thoughts and panic. I have several ideations of just careening into on coming traffic and putting myself out of my misery but they are luckily just ideations and I manage to make it to my job. I get my check and notice the hospital across the street, as I shake and sweat I realize what needs to be done.

As I walked into the hospital emergency room I felt a sudden relief I knew I would not be allowed to drop dead in this place (at least not without a fight.) I walk up to the reception and tell them I am here because I was taken off my medicine and am now in a major panic attack. I am seen almost instantly as mental crisis cases take preference in this particular hospital. The nurse sees  I am taken to the back, put in a robe that is not made for 6'7"" 350 pound man. Greeted by an unsympathetic Russian nurse that probably has every right in the world to scoff at my first world disorder, but I really wish she wouldn't. They take blood, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. I am interviewed by a crisis manager. ""I have OCD, BPD, Depression, yadda yadda yadda."" She asks if I would like to be admitted to the crisis unit for stabilization. I ask if she thinks it's a good idea. She says yes. So I agree. 

I was worried about being admitted to their crisis unit because *MORE BACK STORY ALERT!* I had been in a similar unit about 3 months before in San Francisco I had moved to LA to do Stand Up Comedy (another odd non stressor.) and ran out of money. Despondent I went to girlfriends house who lived in Oakdale a small farming town about an hour from San Francisco. I had planned to go there to essentially have sex one more time before I killed myself. So I went over there had sex, hung out, we talked about life and love and all that shit and I was at peace with myself. I told her I was going to San Francisco to find work and I would be back soon. She wished me well and I b lined it to the Golden Gate Bridge. A police officer walked up to me as I stared at the beautiful structure he asked me if I was alright. I said yes. He asked again. I said no. The officer then escorted me to San Francisco General Hospital where I was 5150'd. The people were nice enough but the lack of funding meant I NEVER TALKED TO A SINGLE DOCTOR DESPITE BEING THERE FOR 10 DAYS! Also I was the only person that really really insane. With no one to talk to but nurses and people that were nearly non functioning due to their illness, most of who stayed in their room aside from a nice man that was once a rich business man but had digressed into a child like mental state and a man that could be described as future me I soon went stir crazy. I called my mother (something I was highly against.) she called me a faker in nice terms sent me 1500 dollars and I proceeded to drive cross country back to NJ. All in all it sucked and I learned nothing of my illness.

So yea I was afraid this place was like that place, and it was not. I was wheeled down to the unit they took all my strings off my clothes (because I can't stab myself with one of the many pencils in my room.) at this point I was introduced to my roommate a man who claimed he was there for benzo withdrawal which he was. He then said the doctors here didn't give benzos at all. And I was then asked if I wanted to go to a group. I did but during all this riff raff of medical tests and what not I forgot I was having a panic attack. Which escalated. I left the group in a cold sweat the nurse tried to calm me down. I was given an Ativan I calmed down and went to sleep.

The next morning I was antsy but the nurse assured me it would get better today. I was given 2 .5 mg of klonopin a day and learned all the people there complaining about not getting benzos where people that were abusing them and I was fine. I didn't get to see a doctor that day but it went off pretty good. I was introduced to the social people that where in there. Some where comical, others sad, most were actually kicking heroin or another drug. I was forced to attend groups (not really but not going wasn't helping my case and frankly I hadn't talked to people for so long on a regular basis I welcomed it.) much like the people some of the groups were comical, others sad, and most were based on kicking heroin. My first day went well.

The next day I met my doctor and social worker. I was still not sure about the no benzo policy and at the time knew I was only getting my K-Pins because I brought my prescription bottle in with me. So I sit down the doctor asks how I feel. I say disinterested in life and constantly anxious. She asks me what I take for depression. I say nothing SSRI's have had bad side effects (more suicidal ideation.) in the past. She was shocked and immediately prescribed me Zoloft and the High BP medicine I wasn't taking due to finances. Then she got to my anxiety I told her about my attacks and medicines. She asked what I was on before. I told her about the Xanax 3 times a day 1 MG. She was pretty upset the persricber at Crest cut my dosage to what she did. I told her I really wanted to get off benzos but I wanted to taper off just like I told the people at crest. She said she was for that as well and re upped my K-Pins 2 2 1 MG pills a day to stabilize me. It worked. 

Over the next few days my meds were tinkered with mostly the Zoloft was increased and I asked the social worker what I should do about not working. She got me in contact with ICMS which is a case management program who are trying to get me on SSD and Medicade so I can go back to school. I was pleased but still having panic attacks. I made face to face friends for the first time in a long long long while and was finding myself attached to this crisis unit. I had massive panic attacks every time I realized I would be leaving. My doctor said it was normal and they were always there if I needed them. I felt reassured for the first time in a long time. I was mostly panic free aside from a few flairs (less than 30 minutes) over the next week. Until my mom visited. The day before that I had a massive panic attack as she does not believe I am ill. To her credit she tried and the meeting was pretty good.

The days past the down side was this group of adults being treated very child like but that was the idea. Nothing was stressful everything was done for you. You were constantly reassured and were encouraged to talk to the other patients about whatever. Group therapy was amazing. I was happy. 

Life felt balanced, but it was time for it to end. I was discharged last Wednesday after spending 7 days in the unit. I got the number of some great people I hope to keep in contact with. And was given a new prescription and outpatient psychiatrist also I am on a official and safe K-Pin taper and no longer in constant panic though it still comes and goes.

The second I stepped out of the hospital and into my car reality hit me and I spent the whole drive home having a panic attack, granted it was much less extreme than the one I had driving up there. I've went back to isolating since I've been released and am now working through the system and it's bureaucracy. My first shrink appointment is Wednesday. Tonight I went to dinner with my mother. I had constant panic attacks due to my agoraphobia. She was annoyed but realizes I am no longer faking it...after 27 years. She asks the questions most of you guys probably get asked by the people that try to understand your anxiety or depression but can't fully grasp it. ""Why don't you just roll with it?"" ""What is the reason you are so sad?"" ""Why do you think those hand movements help your panic attacks?"" ""Is there anything I can do?"" and there isn't really. It's going to be an uphill battle for life I suppose but I'll take it and the first spark was allowing myself to be helped by the crisis unit. I now know though pretty extreme my condition is manageable. And hope to continue to progress. I plan to take a walk in the park tomorrow and I think I am looking forward to it.

In conclusion my crisis center did miricales for me. But after my trip to the SF crisis unit I know these vary from hospital to hospital. Also there are some downsides like These places are filled with some iffy characters and uncomfortable things and after leaving there is an assimilation process back into the regular world, but if it is in a moderately well funded area and you really want to stabilize yourself and have the symptoms I have or any other mental illness including addiction you might want to check the option out.

I've been recently diagnosed with general anxiety, but I'm pretty sure that I've had it my whole life. This year has been pretty rough with a ton of physical symptoms, stress, and frustration. I'm a graduating college senior that has been accepted to medical school, but over the course of the year I have felt as if I am getting less intelligent. Things that used to be easy for me have gotten much more difficult. The things I used to think about and find interesting have become dull and unexciting. My sense of humor is fading. I just no longer feel connected to myself or the outside world. Do others feel this way? I started Cymbalta a month or so ago, and a lot of my physical symptoms have faded, but my feeling of mental decline has not. Hope you all have a great day.",54,2013-03-04 23:38:33 EST-0500
428,Anyone else get anxiety from intense guilt? ,Mainly I start to run this loop in my head where I start to feel horribly guilty about myself. Guilt that college is costing my mother so much money and guilt that I'm not performing to the best of my ability academically. I feel guilty that I'm now 20 years old and have still never been in a relationship. I feel guilty that I'm no longer a teenager and still a virgin. Mostly I start to think about the past and the guilt makes it very hard for me to build a better future. ,40,2013-03-06 03:06:33 EST-0500

I had that experience last night. That comment made me feel so anxious, I had to leave soon after. I said my goodbyes, explained that I had to work early the next day (I didn't), and then took off. I could feel my face growing hotter with each step as I made my way home, and I started experiencing the familiar feeling of vertigo in the pit of my stomach that I feel when I start playing unsavory memories in my head.

I sit here this morning at my desk, in front of my laptop, feeling utterly foolish, and defeated. And all because of that one comment. Damn it.

430,2 months on Celexa and I feel amazing,"Yesterday I was driving in some really insane traffic with a very empty gas tank, and I was relaxed and didn't panic. Today, I went to a *very* pretentious hipster coffee shop by myself, and actually made a friend while I was there. She gave me her number and everything. I talked to the baristas, the other customers, it was amazing. I sat by myself and enjoyed my coffee and worked on some sketches for my job. Then I met up with someone I haven't seen since high school so we could discuss an illustration I'm doing for him, and I wasn't nervous at all. I didn't even think twice about calling him on the phone when I couldn't find his house. 

These seem like minor things that anyone could do, but every single one of these events were times that I would have for sure had a panic attack, or I would have just stayed at home in my pajamas instead. 

I feel like a champion.

439,"After three years of episodes of shortness of breath and feeling faint, and a recent trip to the ER, I was finally diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder today.","I was recommended today to get a prescription of Lexapro by a doctor whom he himself suffers from GAD and takes Lexapro, and said the results were night an day.

I have never known anyone to have GAD, so have never spoken to anyone about whether or not my symptoms are normal, which has been terrifying, as I always assumed there was something wrong with my heart.

I will go through long periods of time, in this case about 2 months of constant shortness of breath. There will be times where I don't notice it, but for the most part I have a hard time getting a full deep breath. Then there are the very common episodes, mostly when I'm out of the house, that my heart rate will raise into the 80's, my hands and feet become clammy, my throat feels like it is closing up, and I feel like I may faint. This happens a lot in class (I'm a college student).

444,"So, is it unclear for anyone else WHY they get these attacks?"," I've been feeling good, and going to the gym. Last night, I went to bed and my heart was pounding. I felt an attack comming, and got up and walked around. I talked to my uncle for a while and started feeling better.

 But why is it happening?

 The doc said physically, I was ok. Blood test was normal. Sugar, pressure, etc.
 Everything checked out fine.

   So am I crazy? I'm ok, for example, today i had a good day. I'm not mad or frustrated while typing this. But if I get an attack tonight, I'd have no explanation for it. But the good thing is that I don't feel scared about ""WTF is this"" anymore now that I know I am physically ok. So it's easier to psyche myself out it. But still, the after effects are annoying(like feeling cold).",13,2013-03-01 03:21:12 EST-0500
445,But what if it is never fine?,"I don't think I will ever, ever beat this. I have been working on it since high school... now I am two years out of college and just want to die. I've tried medicine, therapy, nutrition, chiropractic care, journaling.... I don't know what else to do. 

I am constantly anxious. So much that I am always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. When I feel relaxed and nonanxious, I notice. It rarely happens. I started drinking and found it gives me that feeling. I am now drinking every night, going to work hungover two or three times a week. I hate myself so much. I am scared all of the time. I am isolated because of it. Men scare me so much. I want so badly to be in a nice, healthy relationship... but I get so scared. I hardly go out in public anymore. I go from work to home. I am hypervigilant constantly. Always aware of my surroundings, wondering why is this person acting like that..thinking what if they tried something. I can't take it anymore. 

For the first time in my life outside of an actual panic attack from fear, I don't believe this is going to get better. I have completely ruined my life and am getting too old to backtrack and fix anything. I haven't had some terrible event happen in my life, like a soldier, to have PTSD. When I was little, my parents would fight constantly. My father would throw and break things and get in my mom's face and scream and push her, my mom would make me stand in front of her so he wouldn't do anything. I don't know if that is what causes this, but it is no where near what other people with anxiety/fear/PTSD have been through. I am ashamed at myself for not being stronger.

**Edit:**

Length of time trying things:

Medication - Few months of Zoloft in high school, few months of Prozac in college.

Journaling - Months at a time on and off

Therapy - Longest was 3 years in college. I miss that counselor. They were great :( Probably the only guy I will ever trust. Although I hope in getting better I can trust more someday.

Chiro - 3 years now and sticking with it. My back is super straight at least :/

Nutriton - I am eating really healthy and have been for 2+ years. But I drink coffee daily, which I know does not help my anxiety.



Other things I have tried:

Kava Kava

Rescue Remedy

Passion flower

Vitamins...

**Thank you so much for your responses you guys** :) It really feels good to know I am not alone in this. No one I talk in person seems to understand.

One afternoon after a long walk I was relaxing on the couch when I noticed my heartbeat.  I checked my bpm and everything was normal except I could feel my heart my heart beating...and it was annoying and of course, it worried me.  Good ol' anxiety at it's best.  

Anyhow, this feeling hasn't really let up.  I don't feel it throughout most of the day.  Going for walks and bike rides seems to distract me from it and I feel fine for a little while, but when I'm just watching tv all I seem to focus on is my heartbeat and obsessively checking my bpm.

The panic attacks were so horrible that I would sit on my couch and stare at a wall for 5-6 hours at a time and just couldn't move.

453,"DAE dislike the overuse of the phrase ""panic attack"" in casual conversation?","A friend of mine was telling us a story tonight that involved her driving through what many would call a ""sketchy"" area. She said that while she was driving through she had two panic attacks. 

I suppose it's possible she did indeed have two panic attacks. However, I only recall having three or four in my anxiety-ridden life (24 years old), one of which was particularly horrific, involving serious hyperventilation which led to a loss of control in my hands and facial muscles (they sort of crumpled up). The others were less severe, but still had me breathing fast and deep with an overwhelming sense of desperation. 

So, when I hear people just toss out the phrase ""panic attack"", I'm a little...annoyed. Anyone else experience this?

Edit: Alright people, I'm big enough to admit that belittling my friend's experience was not the best way to handle my frustration and that there are probably some feelings that came before my annoyance that I should take some time to sit with. Got it.

These are all perfectly legitimate reasons to quit a job.

I was offered a new job starting tomorrow that meets all of my requirements and will hopefully help make up the money that I need to cover my remaining bills. It's a much better opportunity hands down.

The problem is that I have to quit this other job without giving 2 weeks notice. They owe me about $150. I am terrified.

My anxiety has always left me feeling completely responsible for everyone else's problems and made it really, really hard for me to say no to anything. I have to do this TONIGHT! I've just been sitting here trying to work up the courage to call or go in, but I can't. I just feel like they're going to yell at me and I'll start crying or they'll find a way to force me to continue working there.

I didn't stay too long, about 2 1/2 hours. I was the first to leave - but at least I went, and I had fun. I met some new pretty awesome people, and got to catch up with old friends. I'm feeling pretty proud of myself right now and wanted to share with you guys! :)

479,I did it! Today I went to the store!,"Just wanted to share some good news with everyone here! For almost the past year, if I wanted to leave the house, I had to push through horrible panic attacks that would last the entire morning before leaving the house. I tried a different medicine, and after taking it for around a month, it's really kicked in and today I actually went to the store and bought myself something and had no anxiety! For awhile, I was scared that I was gonna be stuck in the house for the rest of my life, but now I'm finding my way. I hope this brings some encouragement to others here who are in a low spot at the moment. Stay strong.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind messages :) Since so many asked, I am now taking 10 mg of Lexapro. It did take 3-4 weeks for the medicine to really kick in though, but it was worth it. Before the Lexapro I was taking Remeron, but I had to switch of it because it wasn't strong enough and gave me bad side effects.",28,2013-10-24 02:56:07 EDT-0400

484,[Relaxing] Advice from my counselor.,"My counselor gave me this tip for when I get anxious about doing.. anything, really. It sounds simple, but it's helped me a lot so far. 

The 5 Minute Rule: Try [the activity or task] out for 5 minutes, and if you still get stressed out or hate it, allow yourself to stop, and tell yourself you've tried. 

Examples: Going out for a walk, getting groceries or making dinner, doing homework/work tasks, or even getting out of bed.

487,My dad died.,"It was something I was anxious about.  I wrote it off as an irrational fear... he had been sick, but he was getting better.  He wasn't terminally ill.  He was young.  It'd be fine.  I could go on my vacation.  Nothing bad would happen.

And then I got the call.

I almost feel guilty about my normal anxiety right now.  Like I should be so overwhelmed with grief and I shouldn't be worried about trying to remember people's names and how everyone's going to want to hug me and how exhausted this whole thing is going to make me.  How terrible is that?  My anxiety makes me feel... selfish.

And I wish I wasn't so anxious, because if I wasn't, then maybe I could get up in front of a group of people and tell the stories that only my mother and I know.  But I can't do that.  I can't even tell stories in small groups.  I don't have siblings to do it either, so I feel like it's all on me... and it's not something I can do.  

I worry that people will think I didn't love him.  I did.  I was so lucky to have him as a father.  He wasn't perfect.  He was impatient and enjoyed annoying me and always insisted he was right and constantly interrupted me.  But he always supported my interests and goals.  He reassured me when I, an adult, had nightmares.  He'd call me over to see something interesting - whether it was on TV, outside our house, or in a book - and he'd come running if I had something to show him.  He made me laugh constantly, and I always considered it the highest praise when I made *him* laugh.  And I recently found out that he was always talking about how proud he was of me (even though I don't feel like I deserve it).

While I was planning my trip, he said, ""I'm going to miss you while you're gone.""  I laughed, told him that he'd probably enjoy having the house to himself so much that I'd come home and find my stuff all packed up.  We joked about it, but he insisted that he'd really miss me.  I feel so lucky that I had a dad who told me - not constantly, but often enough - that he loved me, that he really did want me around (even though I'm at an age when I'm supposed to be out of the house).

I don't even know if this is the right place to put this.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm not looking for advice.  I don't know.  I guess I just wanted to talk about him *somewhere*, even though this really did start as a thing about my anxiety...

Well I say fuck that bullshit. I don't know if you guys can relate but along with my anxiety comes a lot of depression and issues with confidence and self esteem. 

Just do it. Just be more social. Just be more confident. Just be less depressed. Just do it.

**Disclaimer** 

Anxiety comes in all shapes, sizes. This post is not to tell you why, diagnose or provide an alternative to therapy or medicines. This cannot answer the ""Why am I this way"" that plagues so many. This post is to make a collection of a multitude of methods that work for the individuals who post with their Anxiety in hopes of providing a hand to those who may need it. 

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**

From my knowledge this fairly new to field of Western Psychology.  Its main focus is Mindfulness.  Becoming aware of yourself,  feelings and thoughts.

>*Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses in particular on the ways clients understand and perpetuate their difficulties through language. Providing a comprehensive overview of the approach and detailed guidelines for practice, this book shows how interventions based on metaphor, paradox, and experiential exercises can enable clients to break free of language traps, overcome behavioral problems, and enhance general life satisfaction*
[Source](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1999-04037-000)

>*The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym*, **FEAR**:

**F**usion with your thoughts

**E**valuation of experience

**A**voidance of your experience

**R**eason-giving for your behavior

And the healthy alternative is to **ACT**:

**A**ccept your reactions and be present

**C**hoose a valued direction

**T**ake action
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)

**Mindfulness and ACT**

>Being present means being in direct contact with the present moment, rather than drifting off into automatic pilot, and getting in touch with the observing self, the part that is aware of, but separate from, the thinking self. Mindfulness techniques are taught to experience the observing self firsthand, whether they bring awareness to each of the five senses, thoughts, or emotions. 
 
Opening up is the ability to detach from thoughts (defusion) and accepting, or making space for and dropping the struggle with painful feelings, urges, sensations, etc. Acceptance is the ability to allow what is to be as it is instead of fighting or avoiding it. If someone is thinking, “I’m a terrible person,” they might be instructed to say, “I am having the thought that I’m a terrible person.” This effectively separates the person from the cognition, thereby stripping it of its negative charge. When someone is experiencing painful emotions, like anxiety for example, they might be instructed to open up, breath into, or make space for the physical experience of anxiety and allow it to remain there, just as it is, without exacerbating or minimizing it.
[Source](http://www.goodtherapy.org/acceptance_commitment_therapy.html#Mindfulness and ACT)

This is the book I'm using right now:

[ACT Made Simple by Russ Harris](http://www.amazon.com/ACT-Made-Simple-Easy-To-Read-Acceptance/dp/1572247053/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382941250&sr=8-1&keywords=ACT+made+simple)

**OK** Stop for a min

Take a deep breath. In through your nose. Notice how your breath passes through your nose....how it cools the back of your throat as it fills up your lungs....Don't think anything of it, if you are, that's ok. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath. How your body expands from the inside out...Now, notice how your clothes feel against your skin...how your shirt feels on your shoulder...take another slow...deep breath and close your eyes and breath a couple more before coming back to this...

**I know you just read those words. Now go back and take a couple mins to really try it. :)**


That's mindfulness. It takes practice, but It really has helped me get enough breaks in the storm to start moving forward against the wind.

 I know that was a lot of info. Scan it as you can, maybe come back a couple times. 

**Meditation**

This is the single best thing I do for myself. (Again, ill update later). Simple start. Mindfulness is kind of like Training wheels for Meditation for me. It sometimes seems like my mind doesn't want to meditate because it's terrified of being still, but once I just **Start** the resistance fades and it's wonderful, then it comes back, then it's wonderful. 

 [Good Article on Swiss Study](http://sciencenordic.com/mindfulness-helps-against-anxiety-and-depression) 

I've noticed a slot of the science I find behind Meditation has been labeled *Mindfulness*. Not sure why, but there are a lot of similarities. Think of Meditation as a Good nights sleep. You dream, your body re cooperates and your mind rests to get you ready for the next day. As you go through your day, if you start to feel tired you might need a power nap to bring yourself back up. That could be Mindfulness. Meditation practice prepares you for the day, and throughout it if Anxiety starts to tap you on the shoulder, you use a mindfulness exercise to quit your mind again and get back to what you were doing. 

[THIS is a GREAT post from another user about getting started and it's benefits for them](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1msb30/how_i_learned_to_harness_meditation_as_a_tool_to/)

It's referenced in the post think, but [THIS VIDEO](http://youtu.be/7irn1Ga-Gyc) has been EXTREMELY helpful in getting me started. I start is when I lay down to go to sleep and just follow the speaker until I fall asleep. It's going to sound *cheesy*, become aware that's resistance from your brain and just keep going. :)

**Subreddits** 

/r/meditation  

/r/ZenHabits 


**Exercise**

Go walk for 20min. Make a playlist,  get a podcast and just go. Your anxiety will be there whether you are walking or doing nothing. The biology behind it is great. 


**Goals**

Setting goals and accomplishing them is a great thing. It doesn't have to be anything BIG at all. This is for you and no one else. Pick any 1 thing you feel your anxiety has prevented from doing that you *want* to. Start small, and do something, Maybe it's visiting a new subreddit, trying one of things above, or even just responding this this post! You can do it! And even if you don't, Thats ok too. 

**Cut yourself some slack**

I'm harder on myself than I've realized. I beat myself for the littlest things. I'm not good enough, I'm stupid, I'm lazy..why would anyone want to talk to me etc etc. Sound familiar to anyone? What would you say if a close friend that you love said that to you? What would you tell them? And say that to yourself, be your own best friend. You deserve it.

494,"The problem I have with embracing ""don't google your symptoms!""","If I go to the doctor only when I experience symptoms that are agonizingly unpleasant, I could overlook a serious illness, since not all illnesses present with serious symptoms.

On the other hand, if I go to the doctor whenever I feel even the slightest out of the ordinary going on with my body, I'll drive myself and everyone else crazy.

So, without research, how can I tell the difference between symptoms that do and do not call for going to the doctor?",34,2013-10-26 19:12:35 EDT-0400
495,"My personal, slightly goofy WTG-email method.","I'm not sure if there's much precedent for this particular approach, but here is something I find helpful. I call it my WTG-email method.

At the start of the day I compose an email draft to myself, subject line ""WTG - [date]"". WTG stands, quite goofily, for ""way to go!"" (but I'm still too self conscious to be able to actually write that out, but it is how I read it!).

Now, in this email draft, which I update throughout the day, I write at the top ""You've already done these good things"". Then, I list everything even remotely ""good"", ""positive"", ""healthy"" that I do, right after doing it. On some days I might get the great pleasure of writing down a hard thing ""had important meeting and got through it"", but on plenty of days the main items are things like ""pet the cat"", ""ate breakfast"", ""bought groceries"", ""folded one towel, kind of"", ""talked to xyz on gchat"", ""paid a bill"", oh, and of course the old favorite ""made my WTG list"". 

By the end of even a pretty inactive day, it's a pretty long list. One might think that seeing all these tiny things might be depressing, but weirdly, it's not. When it's noon and I start to berate myself that I've done nothing, I can look and it's clear that I've done *something* (even if it's just getting out of bed, or making the list). 

The best part, I think, is at the end of the day I read back through the whole thing, and remind myself of all the big and small ways I took care of myself. 

After reading through, I hit send and in the morning it's sitting there in my inbox from yesterday. When I get up, I open it and can see that yesterday wasn't so bad, and the reality check also helps me to have reasonable hopes and goals for the day. 

Finally, I archive yesterday's and start anew

497,Getting Anxiety attacks while watching a movie..,"Has anyone had that happen to them?

I recently went to watch Gravity with a couple of friends. And about 5 or 10 minutes into the movie, I started getting an anxiety.. attack? My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe. The camera on screen constantly rotating didn't help. It came quite suddenly. I just suddenly noticed I was choking and couldn't breathe.

I started crying, trying to calm down and breathe again. It happened on and off throughout the movie. While the choking, and being unable to breathe came and went, it would be safe to say that I was crying throughout most of the movie.

None of my friends noticed though. At least I don't think so. I've gotten quite adept at hiding anxiety, so I sat still and tried calming myself down with slow breaths and telling myself it'll pass, and luckily, my jacket had a hood, so I had that masking my crying face. 

I also managed to get myself to calm down enough to stop crying before the movie ended and regain composure.

I felt terrible for the whole day after that. I went home after the movie, and just continued crying on and off..

Has anyone.. ever had this. This is rather confusing for me.",25,2013-10-26 16:42:51 EDT-0400

And I write everything in it when I'm anxious or sad

And I draw in it and make lists

And one of my friends. Got annoyed. Because I wouldn't share my private journal with her

because she felt ""hurt that i didn't trust her"" I actually have a lot of trust issues when it comes to telling people about my anxiety

And she makes my anxiety worse because she always lowers my self esteem

And she got angry at ME

because I wanted to have something private to spill my heart and soul into

So she passed me a note

Saying ""im so mad at you"" and I said ""why"" and she said ""you know why -_-""

""i feel hurt you dont trust me"" seriously

and then she proceeded to tell me

that what i have

IS NOT A MENTAL DISORDER

It is the most offensive god damn thing

To tell someone with a mental disorder that their disorder isn't real.

That it's made up.

I felt so shocked

And guess what

She then proceeded to tell ME about HER life and how it was so much worse and that ""see everyone isnt all that normal""

Seriously I'm pissed off at her

My mental illness completely like takes over my life and I fight it. Every day.

And she has the AUDACITY

To tell me that my disorder isn't real, that my problems are invalid because hers are worse

And that I have to give my trust away even though I specifically told her that horrible things happened

In the past to me

With trust issues

And anxiety

I had two anxiety attacks today. One during homeroom and one during that little exchange.

This is why I really don't like to tell people. They like to pretend that my disorder isn't a big deal, it isn't real, I'm over-reacting, to just get over it, that everyone is a little not normal and whatever and that my feelings and problems are invalid compared to everyone else.

523,[Rant] My trip to the ER because of a panic attack,"I don’t expect anyone to read this. I honestly don’t care if people do. This is just a confession to myself I’d like to share with the world.

I’m a 23 year old male and on December 1, 2013 I had my first serious panic attack. It was so severe I ended up in the ER. I thought I was dying. They treated me with some form of anti-psychotic (not sure which) and it only hid the emotions, and allowed them to taper off. But, they also numbed me. During that time, I wanted to feel something but couldn’t, it was just blank. And, any attempted to feel anything was blocked out (I tried to force myself to feel something), and this was almost as scary as before the panic attack. 

	To give some background information. I’m a recent college graduate, as well as a newly commissioned officer in a branch of the military. I have always been a pretty social person particularly at parties and social events, but suffer from social anxiety in big crowds in a professional setting, and just a general awkwardness in small talk situations. I have always been a typically adventurous person up until last year. 
Over the past year, I have changed a lot as a person. I have gone from a determined, hard, working hard partying college student, to a nervous young man, afraid of what the future will hold as well as a fear of how the past: my mistakes, my missed opportunities, my selfishness, has affected my development and will continue to affect my development. I’m currently going through my quarter life crisis, I have thoughts about my deaths once a day in the form of a minor (2-10 second) panic attack. These have become less severe as of lately as I’ve begun focusing on the fact that I will die, and what will I contribute to the world before I die.

There were many catalysts to my panic attack. 

1.	All the previously mention anxieties. 
2.	Thanksgiving is an awkward time in that I have never been particularly close to my family and I never feel like I fit in (except with my 3 sisters). 
3.	My dad and mother are currently in a custody battle with my sister (she’s 17) and it is extremely bitter. In fact, that day I had to bring my sister to meet with my dad (first time she has seen him in two month), and it ended with me having to try to be the voice of reason to them both.
4.	I was drunk and hunger over from a three day binge. I was pretending I could still drink like I did during high school and college
5.	I was going to a party at a high school friend’s house, and my girlfriend, as well as the girl I had loved in high school would be at. My girlfriend was aware she would be there and although she won’t admit it, gets jealous over girls I had once liked. During this party, my girlfriend got trashed (too many card games, awkward situation from her, I have never seen her this drunk) and was throwing up during the bathroom. During this time, the old love began talking to me kind of flirtly (tough to tell, she’s really awkward) and I was trying to keep an eye on the bathroom (making sure my gf was ok)
6.	My girlfriend and I were both getting sick

As this night went on I began feeling uneasy. Like everything was spinning. I wasn’t even drunk (only 3-4 beers, over a couple hours) and I couldn’t control it. Then I began panicking, knocking on the door to the bathroom to make sure my gf was alright. She’d always respond yes and told me not to worry, but I couldn’t help it. I tried talking to people for a while, but that just made it worse. I ended up going to another room, pacing back and forth trying to breathe to calm down. When that failed, I went outside for fresh air, where I then threw up. Finally, I was able to gather myself to get my girlfriend and go back to my nana’s, where I was staying.
	At my nana’s, I was still really shakey. I got my girlfriend in bed, and got in myself, but I couldn’t relax. My heart began hurting, my headed pounded, air became like fire and I couldn’t inhale. After about a half hour, I called my mom, and she came and got me and my girlfriend and we went to the emergency room. And that brings us back to the beginning.

	Currently, I have not recovered fully. I’m getting headaches once or twice a day, as well as the aura indicative of migraines. My throat closes around bed time (it relaxes with deep breathing) and my heart will occasionally feel weak. I have not been up to sleep without sleeping pills since. The worst is I have become a hypochondriac and keep searching online for what’s killing me. 
	For right now, I’m trying to get back into the routines of the day, but have yet to begin exercising again (I think I’m still at least a little sick). I’m trying to deep breath more to center myself and I’m going try meditation tomorrow (I’ve always been an on and off meditator).

	I know I will recover from this, I know time is needed, but I hate feeling so fragile. I have never felt this weak in my life. Writing this now helps me understand what I’ve experienced, and gives me an idea of what I need to do. I just realized that since it, I have been unable to be near my girlfriend. She is a worry wart and her constant need of contacting me is running me thin. I want to tell her I need some space, but it’s difficult. I just hope I don’t get angry at her (I already yelled her once and this is the first time I ever had in 9 months). I hope she understands. But, I will get through this, with her, with me. I just needed to get off my chest.
	
It felt really good to write this.

530,A Message to Fellow Hypochondriacs,"*Itches, soreness, tingling, numbness, pains, and cramps happen.
They happen to everybody, often.
They can happen for random little reasons, or they can happen because of specific actions.
Either way, they are almost never symptoms of major diseases or afflictions.

*A skipped heart beat every few seconds is something to worry about. One is not.
A little chest discomfort is probably a stretched muscle or heartburn.
If you lean on your arm, it will become numb. It's not a heart attach.
Your face, when focused upon, will feel tingly and twitchy - it happens.
Headaches happen, they aren't prophets of strokes or brain cancer.
Heart attackes show wildly varying but almost always strong symptoms.
Focusing on one side of your body will make it feel different, feeding into paranoia.

*Our bodies have been through a lot, we have crossed nerves and damaged tissues that tingle or twitch or cramp or get numb sometimes. Strange or odd sensations will happen to everybody older than 2.

*You're getting older, but you're not getting unhealthy. Health is relative.

*Go for a walk or go swimming or something. Clear your head.
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine isn't a mantra, it's the truth. Believe yourself.

*When you worry about your body, your scope of attention will focus down to the tiniest nerve bundles. We're constantly recieving a stream of sensation from every nerve, but we drown them out. When you start focusing on a part of your body, your attention zooms in and you start to feel things you don't remember feeling five minutes ago, making you think it's getting worse. Remember that.

*You're not being a wimp, you're not crazy. Just affected by modern health-watching.
Our bodies are strong enough to resist viruses, bacteria, temperatures, starvation, dehydration, poisoning, overmineralization, falls, cuts, bruises, traumatic events, and more. We're stronger than you think. 

*How many times a year do you think people just drop dead because of sudden and oncoming afflictions? A huge amount. Millions. It's the truth - it happens. You know how many people there are? Just by sheer odds, not to mention that your lifestyle is significantly more healthy than most other human beings on this planet, your chance of getting a stroke or cancer or a heart attack in the next couple years is probably incredibly low. Don't believe me? Start living a healthier lifestyle. Your odds go way down the better you live anyways, so you have no reason to worry. Just live.

*The anxiety is not rational fear. We are rational beings and have to act like it.
I know it's hard to pretend you aren't feeling afraid for your life at the hint of something wrong, but it doesn't hurt to pretend, even just to yourself. Maybe you doubt it will work, but eventually a little positive reinforcement like ""for God's sake, I'm fine"" to yourself here and there might do some good.

*But what the hell do I know, I'm having a stroke at this very moment because my eye is twitching.",42,2013-06-16 00:42:26 EDT-0400

540,Do horror films set off any one else's anxiety? [Help],"My [F/23] boyfriend [M/29] is very understanding of my  [general] anxiety disorder, but often we butt heads when it comes to selecting movies to go see/rent. 

Due to a bad experience in Sunday School where I was forced to watch a stigmata and Passion of the Christ, all by the age of 14, I've had terrible anxiety about anything surrounding that and as a result, I have a huge fear of horror movies. I freak out and have trouble sleeping because of them. I consider them to be one of my biggest triggers for an attack.

I  try my hardest to find a medium with it- I'm okay with certain films that are more towards the 'thriller' genre, but often that is not enough.

Tonight, we were supposed to go over to his brother's house, and they know about my issue with horror films. They called ahead and said they were renting one. I said it was fine, go ahead without me, I'll stay home. Instead he got cranky and stayed home until now when I was just like, ""just go"". I'm fine with missing out because I don't want to put myself into that situation. I've come a long way and I've learned to say no about these things. I worry way too much and I have an over active imagination, so I'm perfectly fine being home by myself for a few hours. on the upside, I can have the whole bed to myself and watch whatever I want on TV in the bedroom.

I went a head and read the summary of the film and it was obvious that it wasn't for me. I've since gone and taken a Lorazapam and I feel a little bit better.

However, I was just wondering if this happens with anyone else on this Sub? If so, how to do you cope?

543,"[Relaxing] Today, I went to the mall with three stains on my shorts and didn't die of embarrasment","So today I went to meet my mother and aunt who came to see a play in a theatre in my city. I was dressed nicely and both of them complemented my appearance. Everything went fine, I walked them to the theatre where I left them. I was going to go to a very big mall to buy a special kind of automatic pencils I very much like to write with. It was a treat because recently I started some work as a tutor and was able to save up some money.

I was hungry though, so before I went shopping I stepped in for a hamburger to a small restaurant. I ordered a great one, with hot sauce I like and... then the throuble started. Three big red hot-sauce stains appeared suddenly on my cream-white shorts. I tried to wipe them off with napkins but they had already gone into the fabric. There was nothing I could do.

I thought this was the end of my trip. It was so embarrassing. I wanted to go straight to my home to change the shorts and then go to the mall. I live pretty far away, though, and it would mean a long trip both ways.

But then I thought that these things happen to everybody. That I should go to the mall anyway. That maybe it wouldn't be so bad. That I would understand if I saw someone with stained shorts.

And I did, and it was totally awesome, because nobody stared at me or my shorts stained with red hot sauce. I bought two pencils and some lead and then went home. And when I changed, I noticed that the stains were not that big after all and not very noticeable.

Hooray for me!

544,Hi everyone,"I finally got the balls up enough to post in this sub reddit for help. Please forgive my use of a throwaway and my poor writing skills.  

My name is John I'm 23 years old and I'm a firefighter and a paramedic. I've suffered from anxiety since highschool. I have no idea what set me off, it literally happened overnight. I started getting what i later found out were panic attacks all throughout the day and they manifest in my stomach, and make my arms and legs feel like jello. Fast forward to now. I've come a long way since not being able to go out to eat or go the movies but I've never been able to shake away panic and anxiety that comes with having to be somewhere at a set time with no escape. Kind of a like a job, or something that you can't back out of without their being severe reprocussions. All during medic school I would get a lot of anxiety before class, knowing if i missed the days they would throw me out. So I guess what I'm saying is. How can I bring my anxiety level down the night before? How do I keep my mind from racing all night and my stomach goes into knots? How do I carry out my job? And how do I get over it? Any help would be so much appreciated. ",20,2013-06-16 01:33:36 EDT-0400

547,Share how you got your anxiety.,"It's strange how much I remember every detail of it, but I am going to give a shorter version of it.

Up until the age of 8, I had always been pretty normal. Well, that changed until I switched schools. This school had a class for 3rd graders called ''Home care''. Basically it taught kids how to stay safe at home; things like ''Don't play with knives''. Well, one day we started talking about injuries, and how you should clean wounds if you ever get a cut from playing outside. Whilst the teacher was talking, I was not listening carefully to her, and I remember her saying ''I had a friend who scraped her knee. She didn't clean it. She almost died after 2 days''. I am pretty sure I just misheard her, but I got this really scary feeling after that. I had to wash my hands after touching anything until they got really dry and were bleeding EVERYWHERE, and had to wash any wounds or cuts a lot. I would waste so much water and soap because of this, I was scared that a really small cut would end up killing me. Over time I was scared of dying in my sleep. I ended up getting scared of going blind, scared of having brain cancer when I had a headache. I got scared that my heart would suddenly stop. And I was still just 8. Mind you I was not having any panic attacks; I was just always scared. Especially at night. 

This health anxiety came and went, but over the years it got worse. 

I ended up moving again to another school after 6th grade in another country, and that's where my social anxiety developed. Before, I didn't really have problem talking with others, even if I was shy. But now, I was already in a state where I made up irrational thoughts since I thought anything around me was a potential health threat. This caused me to become scared that people didn't like me, so I avoided them, and decided on getting good grades instead. I eventually got picked on because I was never with people. And whenever I tried to become friends with people, they mocked me. Eventually I got social anxiety, aggro phobia, and had difficulty just talking and having coherent thoughts (since I never used my tongue to talk). Mind you, I still had no panic attacks, but I was just so terrified of people.

I eventually reached 11th grade and became really depressed, because I thought I was making friends, but they talked bad about me behind my back. I just felt like ''why bother trying anything ever again? You are just going to set yourself up for failure, like you always have''. My grades went from A's down into C/D :(.

I graduate high school and went into college in the same country where I was in 3rd grade. I still had fear of people and fear of diseases, that when I went into college I felt like a odd apple of an apple tree. Everyone behaved so normal, whilst I was a freak because of all the fear I went through in the past. My aggro phobia got a lot worse. This is where I started to get panic attacks. The lecture hall was always pretty dark, and I often thought I was going blind. I started to be scared of that lecture room. I couldn't go to classes that were in that room. The fact that I got a panic attack from going blind made me have panic attacks from all the other things; fear of cancer, fear of my heart stopping, fear of internal bleeding, fear of going in public. Eventually it lead to self injury and eating disorders. I just became a heap of mess. 

I am done with two years now in college. Even if I am not happy with myself, am still anxious and have the problems I listed above, I am doing a bit better now. I guess it's all because I found my passion for math and science, and whenever I feel down I just read about those two.I have made a few ''acquaintances'', but have never made any new friends. Thank god I still have my friends from 3rd grade, or I would be all alone.

I just wanted to share this because I feel how it is amazing and interesting how all of this happened because of what I heard my 3rd grade teacher said; ''I had a friend who scraped her knee. She didn't clean it. She almost died after 2 days''. Two sentences. Two sentences was all it took to break me. I guess the moral of my story is to always be careful of what you say.",26,2013-06-15 18:11:23 EDT-0400
548,"[Help] I've never talked to a doctor about my anxiety problems. I want to, but...I'm too anxious.","I'm 19. Female. I've had these issues since...as long as I can remember. I never recognized it as a problem. I thought it was just who I was.


I don't like talking to or meeting people. I'd like to make friends, but it's too much of an internal struggle. I've been hoping to find a part time job while I go to university. I've never had one before, but I've had one interview and I thought I was going to sweat to death. I usually can't even bring myself to walk in and ask for an application or call the company. It stresses me out and makes me feel like crap. If I'm suddenly the center of attention I have a hard time breathing normally, I turn red, I sweat, I stammer, and then I get light headed and run away--usually to a bathroom to cry. This affects me every day. It keeps me from having a normal life. I have one friend and a boyfriend. They are the only people, besides family, that I am comfortable around. I'm sure there are other things, but I can't think of them right now.


After I thought about all of these problems I realized I have anxiety...about way too many things. I want to see a doctor of some sort to get treated. When I think about having a normal life I feel so hopeful and happy. 


I don't know how to go about finding a doctor. What kind? How much will it cost? I'm just very nervous about it all and could use some kind words. Also, please share any personal stories you have. I think it will make me feel less crazy.

Thank you for reading all of this.

550,"I am 17 years old, and last night I slept in my own bed for the first time.","I wanted to share my success with someone, maybe even someone who can relate. 

For almost all of my life, I have dealt with a variety of anxieties. For as long as I could remember, I slept in my mom's bed with her. I couldn't explain why, I just could not face sleeping in my room alone. I hardly ever had any friends over (Back when I actually had friends) for the night, because I knew that if I ended up in my mom's bed, there would be a lot of questions. 

Even when my sister had friends over, I stayed awake until they fell asleep, so I could sneak off to my mom's room. 

Because of the small bed size, and because my younger brother also sleeps in the bed (For other complicated reasons), I rarely got a good nights sleep. 

Occasionally, I have attempted to sleep on my own, but couldn't do it. During the day, I tell myself that I want to sleep on my own. I get so close, until the night comes. Every time, I found that I couldn't do it. Something would come up, or something would scare me into crawling back to my mom's room. 

There were times when I was younger, that my little brothers father would try to force me to sleep in my own bed. He would tease me, or laugh at me. Because of this, I would lay awake in my bed until I was sure that he was asleep, so that I could creep silently in next to my mom. He often slept on the floor in the living room. 

Finally, last night, I decided that enough was enough. I will be a high school senior in just a few weeks. It was time that I grow up and face one of my fears. I hooked my ipod up to a speaker, and set in to play some of my favorite songs on a low volume. 

As lights in the house went out, I got a little bit nervous. Could I really do this? I tossed and turned for half an hour, trying to clear my fears out of my head. There were quiet a few times that I almost gave up. A big one was when I had to get out of the bed and throw the light on after finding a thumb tack stuck under the sheets. It would have been so much easier to throw the light off and run to my mom's room. But something inside knew that I could do it. 

I clicked off the light and padded back to my bed, settling in once again. It took a while, but I guess that eventually I fell asleep because the next thing I knew, my alarm was going off on my iPod. It was morning! I had finally, after so many years, slept in my bed through the night. I even turned off the alarm and slept for another hour! 

Tonight will be my second attempt, and hopefully it will stick! 

TL;DR: After 17 years of embarrassment and ridicule, I finally got through a night in my own bed alone.

Edit: thanks so much for the support and good luck! I almost didn't post this, but now I'm so glad that I did :) if I had cash you all would be swimming in Reddit gold. Instead, have some Internet hugs! \(• •)/  ",56,2013-08-10 00:39:18 EDT-0400

After I leave the table or the bar or wherever, especially if the people I was with aren't friends but are people who I like, I tend to replay everything I said or did in my head. I beat myself up over what I did wrong or what might be taken wrong or how I was weird or annoying or not someone they would ever want to talk to again. I convince myself that they made fun of that weird girl the second I left the table, then have to remind myself to stop going down that road.

 I can't look at someone and tell them not to see that grass is green. I can't tell someone not to feel a burn on their hand when they touch a hot stove. Just like I can't see it any other way that these ideas and suspicions that creep into my head are laughably impossible.

I worry about having about 20 different health conditions a year. Adding in about a new 5 as each year passes. I come to terms that I don't have others, but something new always comes in to replace that one. 

It just goes on and on, and though I thankfully haven't passed these tendencies into my children...they now see me in the same light as others. My son laughs and rolls his eyes at me. My wife tells me I worry about everything and gets pissed that I can't just be happy. She says I'm unreasonable and that I don't look at things logically. YET in my mind I'm using nothing but logic. 

In my mind it feels like she leaves everything up to chance. I feel like stress is protecting me from forgetting important details, from being careless when I hand in paperwork that's important. I feel like stress makes me a good father because my kids don't go without anything. It makes me humble and a good worker.

Yet I feel like it's destroying my life. It has destroyed my life, more and more consuming everything as each year passes.

I take the medications that are supposed to work. They are supposed to be the alternative. They don't work, they don't help they just make me blank. Sometimes shit still creeps in, and I still just have to talk to someone. I have to vent I have to feel better, because if I say it, and I hear it, sometimes it sounds so stupid that I do laugh about it.

And my wife sits there and gets frustrated, and I go ""I'm sorry, I know this gets old.""

To which she replies...""::sigh:: it's fine. I'm used to it.""

I'm starting work out of state away from them for a while, so that maybe giving them space from me will help things and they won't be so burnt out by me. I'll only be home a couple of days a week, but it hurts. I'm going to miss so much of my children's life. and I'm going to be so alone. I just don't know how to deal with any of this anymore. I'm not suicidal or anything, I just want to be happy and have my family happy to have me around.

559,It get's better. Seriously.,"EDIT: formatting and why the fuck did I put an apostrophe in gets -_-.

**Why I am writing this** I've been meaning to post here for awhile because I feel like as a 'survivor' of panic disorder and depression that I have, in a way, let down those who still suffer daily. I find that people who have made major improvements and have gotten their lives back rarely ever speak about anxiety or panic, especially on the internet in public forums like these. Maybe it is a result of the stigma associated with mental disorders, I'm not sure.

Anyways, I just wanted to come in here and let everyone know it gets better. Seriously, you really can beat this. I know you, as a current sufferer, likely read a ton of stuff on here and other websites about how difficult of a time others are having. Many talk about how they have had to deal with panic disorder for their entire lives and have ""accepted"" the idea that they are going to live with this for the rest of their lives. There is often a giant sense of hopelessness; I know . I just want to quickly write out my story and let everyone know that there are in fact people out there who really do beat this and go on to find happiness and success in life.

**Background on my history with anxiety and panic:** I started suffering from panic attacks around age 15, after experimenting with a number of drugs (marijuana daily, mushrooms, MDMA, few other small things). Things got bad fast; I stopped going out and seeing my friends. Grades dropped big time. I began taking SSRIs and ativan. After trying a few, I found that Celexa worked. At age 17, after about 2 years on Celexa (40mg) I began to taper off because I wasn't experiencing any symptoms anymore. I thought it was just a phase I was going through. 

Sure enough, the panic attacks came back and even stronger this time. I went back to my doctor and immediately got back on ativan, which I began taking 5-7 times a day, and also started trying out a slew of other SSRIs (tried Celexa again, wasn't working anymore). My panic disorder spawned into full depression and stuff got real bad. I nearly failed high school, I was barely eating, rarely left my room. Thoughts of killing myself crossed my mind at multiple times. I had no friends, couldn't keep up a job, was terrified to leave my bed and absolutely hated myself and life.

**Getting help** My doctor finally asked me if I would try seeing a psychologist. At this point in time, I thought it wouldn't do any good and had accepted the fact that my life was going to be this mess forever. Anyways, I ended up making the appointment and  going weekly. My psychologist 'formally' diagnosed me with panic disorder and depression - I scored 99th-100th percentile in all areas on the standardized severity test I took (forgot what it's called). My psych was also a bit of a hard-ass but we had an excellent doctor-patient relationship. (I still remember on day 1, going in there and I immediately started talking about how horrible my day was and how crippling anxiety is. My psych interrupts after five minutes and says, ""Listen, your parents are paying quite a bit of money right now just to have you sit here and complain. Our time is limited and I did not spend a decade in University to have you sit here and complain. We have work to do."" It was a real eye opening moment.)

I guess the 'secret' to my success with anxiety, panic and depression was a strict regiment of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy(CBT). This included daily monitoring logs, lot's of reading, lots of writing, along with various other lifestyle improvements (exercise, some mindfulness meditation, etc.). I immediately started seeing improvements after a few weeks. It wasn't easy though: CBT is tough, real fucking tough. It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to go through, but trust me when I say this it works damn well. You just have to put in the work. After 8-10 months of regular visits I woke up one morning and realized I wasn't scared anymore. The anxiety and panic were gone. It was like how life was before except even better. I now had a much clearer understanding of my emotions, behaviour and thoughts. I had the tools to deal with anxiety when it appeared and the panic attacks had fucked right off. I kept seeing my psychologist for an additional 3-4 months after this for life and career help (I had previously nearly failed my first year of University and wanted to head into second year with a renewed focus).

**Today** So, in short, today I sit here at age 24 as a completely changed person. Some notable highlights are:

* The old me nearly failed high school and first year of university. Today, I am a month away from starting a Masters degree at one of the top universities in my country. I have a full scholarship. 
* Previously, I was overweight and physically unwell. Now, I live much healthier.  I began running years ago and can now complete a 5km run in under 20 minutes (19:52). I have also been training for a half-iron man race which happens at the end of the month. 
* Before I had trouble walking down the street to check the mail. In February I flew to Spain by myself and vacationed for 10 days.
* I had a horrible time meeting girls and knew nothing about dating or sex. I've had multiple girlfriends these past view years from a variety of walks of life. While none of them lasted very long I am still having an absolute blast with dating and whatnot.
* I thought I would be taking SSRIs and ativan for the rest of my life. Today I sit here medication free for years now (not that there is anything wrong with medication, but if you feel like you don't need it than why bother).
* I'm content. Life isn't always easy but as sufferers of anxiety and panic we know the difference between tribulations like the death of a friend, and well, dealing with this shit on a daily basis. I love the direction I have taken my life and I'm very excited for whatever the future may hold.

So, again, trust me when I say it gets better. I am no one special. I grew up an average/below average kid in almost all facets in life. Nothing remarkable about me, no genius IQ as a child or any of that shit. Just a normal kid who developed a crippling panic disorder. I just want everyone to know that they can beat this shit and accomplish things they never thought possible. If you would have asked me 6 years ago what my life would be like today, I would have answered ""likely would have killed myself by then"". CBT might not be for everyone, I'm not a doctor, but it worked for me. See a psychologist, they're doctors and have an incredible amount of knowledge that can help you. If things don't work out with one, keep trying until you find one you really connect with. I know this shit is expensive but it will be the best investment you have EVER made.

TL:DR: Got severe anxiety and panic when I was a teenager, likely due to experimenting with drugs. Took SSRIs and benzos for years. Life reached a new low and finally saw a psychologist. After a year of hard work, I came out changed for the best and prepared for the world. It can get better, you don't have to live the rest of your life like this.

I'm not sure if it's just from the time passing or the actual bathroom act. Ether way, my panic always passes afterwards.

I read somewhere that ""bearing down"" or using your abdominal muscles in a way that mimics pooping can slow your heart rate so maybe there is something to it.

566,Talk to your friends.,"I suffer from GAD. It has gotten really bad again right now during the middle of my college career. 

I am flaky towards my friends, and I avoid leaving my house unless it has to do with my girlfriend.

Anxiety has put a huge strain on my ability to retain relationships, and it has been adversely affecting my friendships and my girlfriend for a while now.

I have a friend who I hardly get to see anymore. We were close in high school, but since college started, we see each other maybe 8 times in the year. I also have a history of being flaky with him (like I do with all my friends). Last night, this friend asked me to join him and his girlfriend at a bar that supposedly doesn't card (I am not 21 yet). The thought of getting caught bothered me. I asked him if he was sure I could get in, to which he said ""85 percent sure, but worst case is we go elsewhere with some rum in my bag"". Now, normally this would make me feel better, but I began to worry that I would have to get in their car and drive somewhere far away. Transportation has been hard for me lately, I only feel really comfortable when I am driving, and when it is a short distance.

After spending an hour and a half of giving him flaky answers and kind of deflecting questions on whether I would meet up with him, I decided I should be honest with him about what I was feeling. He knows I suffer from anxiety, but I am sure he knew little about what how it effects me. I simply texted him a long response stating essentially, ""I want you to know that I am not going to come out tonight. The reason is that tonight I am experiencing a lot of anxiety, and getting out of the house is too much for me to handle right now. I don't normally explain this to people when I don't go through with plans, but I wanted to tell you so that you don't take it personally. In fact the only reason I have been indirect for the last hour and a half is because I have been trying to conjure up the mental state needed to get up and out of the house to see you. I don't talk about my anxiety much, but if you have any questions you can ask any time.""

Now this felt really good. I think that being honest with people around you forces you to be honest with yourself. I felt a little down on myself for ""giving in"" to my anxiety by not going out, but I wasn't going to pretend that I didn't have anxiety and I was going to own up to it and talk about it shamelessly.

He responded saying, ""Thank you for telling me. Would you prefer to be alone? Because I would love to come over and hang out with you.""

I said, ""Yes! That sounds like a great idea. Are you sure that's okay?

To which he said, ""You underestimate the love I have for you"".

That was pretty powerful, even if the love part was tongue-in-cheek on his part. I never share my anxiety with my friends, only my parents and girlfriend, but this really felt good.

He came over with his girlfriend and a few more of my friends and we had a great night all together. It was made possible by my communication of how I was feeling, which opened up other options for us to all have a good night.

Instead of sulking all night about how I wasn't good enough or normal enough to get out of my house and join my friends, they came to me and made me forget about all of it.

I know I am lucky now to be surrounded by compassionate people. I know that some people don't have this fortune, including possibly some of you reading this. But I advise those of you who do have people to talk to you, even people who might not understand (like my friend), to talk about your anxiety and make compromises with yourself and keep pushing yourself a little bit every day.

I will end this with a little bit of /r/Fitness wisdom- we're all gonna make it.

570,I got a letter from my psychiatrist prescribing an ESA! How do I approach my landlord about it?,"I posted a week or so ago about getting a letter for an ESA from my psychiatrist. After speaking with her, she agreed that it would be very beneficial for me to have an ESA and wrote a letter for me.

Now, I am really nervous about bringing it to my landlord. When I first moved in, I asked about their pet policy and they said my building is being turned into a no pet building, like all of their other properties. They recently bought the building from another company, but it was pet friendly under the previous owner. They are honoring the pet agreement for older tenants that already have pets. So, there were and are pets in the building (including the people who were living in my unit immediately before me).

Anyway, I am nervous to bring this up to them. It's a company, not just a person or family. There are more than 5 units in the building and the landlord does not live there. Legally, they shouldn't be able to say no. But, how should I approach them with the letter? Should I go in with a typed request from me as well as the letter? Or should I snail mail it to them? It seems silly to mail it since the office is so close to my building. Has anyone had experience with this?

**UPDATE!** I went into the office today and the leasing agent was on lunch or something, but the receptionists took my papers and said he would call me when he got in. Now, we wait...*I'm so anxious.*",18,2013-08-13 21:21:02 EDT-0400

Once you learn to master the act of acceptance, you should improve. This is what I have been trying to do with my intrusive thoughts, although it is preeettyy hard.

574,(Update) So I made a doctors appointment - It went well.,"About 3 days ago I made a post expressing my worries over my first doctors appointment for anxiety. 

Well, I stressed, I shook and I panicked - but I went. And I'm so glad I did. The doctor was very patient and friendly (while I, on the other hand, was a quivering mess), took me completely seriously, and talked me through the various options. He spoke about a women with anxiety that he had seen in the past few months, and put me very much at ease.

We discussed medication and counselling, he left the decision of what  kind of avenue to pursue very much in my hands, and in the end he gave me the names of some support forums, and a prescription of low dosage Propranolol.

I really cannot recommend going to see a doctor enough. It was nothing like the terrifying experience that I had built it up to be, and I will be happy to return in the next week or two to discuss how my medication works (or if it does), and whether I need to be given a higher dosage, or try anti-depressants.

Thank you all for helping to calm me down, and if there's one thing that I want you to take away from this, it's that going to see the doctor *helps*. Really - it's worth it.",22,2013-08-08 23:45:46 EDT-0400

I am a rising senior in high school and around 2-3 years ago I started to have severe anxiety whenever I got a new e-mail, a phone message... even menial things like weighing myself (I am not overweight nor do I have big body-image issues). I feel my heart pounding and I tell myself every single excuse not to check it, even when it just turns out to be an advertisement or a friendly message. In addition, I've struggled most with checking my grade or score (especially standardized testing) while I've noticed that my classmates can barely wait to see what they got. 

I am an A student (and always have been since I was in elementary) and when I confided in a few friends about this, they told me I had nothing to worry about when getting back tests or essays because I would have most likely gotten a good grade (I'm not tooting my own horn here, please don't misunderstand this post!). Although most of the time that is true, every time I see one bit of constructive criticism written in red, it feels like my heart stops and the whole day I just mull over why the teacher didn't like my work. I know it is constructive criticism and people aren't out to get me, but I don't know why I don't feel content at ALL when I get 100s but if I get one 85, it nags at me for weeks until I feel like throwing up. 

I am tired of avoiding checking on feedback and most times, I get mad at myself.

I am applying to colleges this year and I don't think I could do it to be honest.

585,"I'm beginning to feel numb about everything, including my boyfriend","Hello r/anxiety!

I am currently 20 year old female, attending school and working.

I'm having a hard time right now. I've been seeing 2 different counselors and a Psychiatrist for the past 2 years, and have been stuck and lost. The first therapist I saw helped me out a lot. I have felt so much progress with her, especially seeing the root to my anxiety and why its gotten me to this point. But then, she left and was placed with another after a year. She's sweet, very nice and loving, but I feel like I haven't progressed much with her. And then while going to counseling I decided to go to a Psychiatric Center to try medication to calm my nerves since everything, and anything, makes me nervous. Not to mention I was feeling so numb. So I want, was diagnosed and given Prozac. It helped me out so much. I felt calm and even happy. But then after 3 months I became depressed every time I took my dose, and even got off to make sure. Then was placed on Effexor, which worked for me for the next 3 months but then it made me irritated, angry, short-tempered and even gained weight and once more stopped taking it. Then took Celexa and immediately got depressed. 

After those, I was told perhaps I was bipolar. I decided to give the idea a shot, and took Trileptal but did nothing for me--it even made me depressed. I wanted to give it a chance, but just saw I was harming myself. I even dropped my birth control and changed and no change occurred but my menstrual cycle regulating. Even been having a hard time losing weight.

It's been a month without medication.

And so, I gave up on the idea of taking medication. I am not bipolar. I am not depressed. I have anxiety. And the anxiety is making me miserable, thus causing depression. I am back to feeling numb, unable to know what I should be working on. I need help, and I want to learn how to get rid of this numb feeling. It's affected how I feel about everything, including my boyfriend. I know I love my boyfriend, but im so numb I don't feel the dread of going to work, no appetite for anything and eating gives no pleasure (I took advantage of this and i'm eating healthier), no pleasure in sex and no feeling of love towards my boyfriend.

Please, someone reach out for me. I feel like, I can't do this anymore. Like i'm slowly giving up, and I no longer want to live. 




I miss finding life pleasurable. 


Please, someone help me. The only feeling I ever feel is nothing or anxiety. '

The news causes a lot of anxiety for me personally. Not the intense anxiety, but just a general background level of elevated anxiety. I get nervous when I can't check it, and I get nervous when I see bad things happening. 

>News is toxic to your body. It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress. High glucocorticoid levels cause impaired digestion, lack of growth (cell, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. The other potential side-effects include fear, aggression, tunnel-vision and desensitisation.

592,Cleithrophobia (fear of being trapped) as a source of anxiety,"I recently became aware that the main source of my severe anxiety is a fear of being trapped, both physically and metaphorically.  For example, I've been known to have a panic attack when trying to remove a tight sweater, or when I'm in a room with a faulty doorknob, but I'm also seeing that making a commitment of some type makes me panicky.  Even something as simple as promising to bring dessert for a dinner sets me off.  My biggest source of stress is my son, who has moderate autism and may require care for the rest of his life.  I'm feeling tremendously guilty that I feel ""trapped"" by my son!  Does anyone else experience this type of anxiety?

594,Anxiety about talking to people you know vs talking to strangers,"Does anyone who experiences / has experienced anxiety about talking to people you've known for a while have any advice on how to overcome it?  I can talk to strangers fine, and I love meeting new people, but after hanging out with someone three times or hanging out with people I know for years I get ultra nervous about what they think of me.  I think they think I'm stupid, boring, negative and rude, and I clam up.  I don't want to share anything about me or express myself naturally.  It's easier with a stranger.

An example - this weekend my cousins had a party.  I grew up with them, I visit them a few times a year.  They're very nice and great at asking insightful questions about people's lives and showing interest, but I still have a hard time talking to them.  I'm different than them, it makes me feel like an outsider - I'm the 'artist' of the family.  I'm very quiet, I never say enough.  They seemed a little surprised I was able to make friends at the party and chat up a storm, and remarked that they would have been sitting in a corner sulking at a party with no one they knew.

I worry a lot about not doing enough to help out, and not doing enough for myself.  I feel like a child when I'm around them, the attitude of their households is my home is your home ... but when I'm helping them clean after the party I don't know where things go, how they like things done or where the cleaning supplies are.  It makes me hesitant to help out, and hesitant to put a lot of effort into things.  I often go hungry while I'm visiting because I'm too nervous to find something to eat or let them know I need to eat.  I would love to cook for them, I'm a good cook and food is great for bonding, but when I think about asking them to take me to the grocery store and paying for food I feel it isn't worth it.  I didn't get mix for my vodka for the party because I was too nervous to drop into a store.  My brain shuts off.  I worry a lot about seeming stupid, I'm sure I do because I can't do anything for myself.

Things are much better than they were years ago, it used to be that I was too nervous to poop or shower.  How can I relax, stop worrying and be myself?",4,2013-07-01 12:43:11 EDT-0400

608,2 reasons why I think exercise has helped my anxiety,"I'm 30 and I've had GAD/Social/Panic Disorder for 5 years. I'm on 30mg Paxil/day with a Klonopin holstered in my front-right pocket at all times, and I've had months where I could barely leave my house. I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/pHGZYB7.png) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/WsuhBnL.gif) which have been passed around in this sub. Anxiety is a big part of my life.

I started running on May 5 of this year and it has helped a lot. I want to share 2 reasons why I think regular exercise has helped me, the 2nd of which is probably new to you (at least I haven't read it before).

1.) There's the [science](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/how-exercise-can-calm-anxiety/?_r=0) behind it. Not only does exercise produce happy chemicals in abundance, it actually creates new neurons and conditions your brain to handle anxiety. Think about that.

2.) If you suffer from panic attacks like I do, you're familiar with the awful chain reaction that usually starts them. Something will set off a physical reaction in your body–either a quick shot of adrenaline, a swift increase in heart rate, or something like that–and the domino effect begins. Your body says, ""Oh noes! Heart started beating faster! **PANIC ATTACK MODE: ENGAGED!**"" and the attack is set in motion. I've experienced this more times than I can count, and the worst feeling on earth is the helplessness you drown in when you know an attack is coming and nothing you can do will stop it. But here's the thing I realized: when your body is used to regular exercise, it will no longer automatically recognize these feelings as instant panic attack mode. Because when you exercise, your heart beats fast; your blood flows; you get light-headed. Your body gets used to these feelings.

Before I started exercising, my body reacted to these things with instant panic mode. Now, if something makes me light-headed, gives me a fast heart-beat, etc., my body says, ""Wait, I felt this same thing yesterday afternoon when I was running."" It makes sense!

I did not want to start running. I don't have time to run. I have two children (4 and 2) and another due this week. I frankly don't really care about all the other benefits of regular exercise. 

I run 3-4 times per week, anywhere from 1 to 2.5 miles. I run in the mornings, usually leaving the house at 6AM so I can get back before the kids wake my pregnant wife. I don't have the energy left at the end of the day to run after work.

I am not a Mr. Motivational Happy Exercise Guy, telling you to go out and exercise to ""be your best, by golly!""; I'm a guy who chose to try exercise as a last resort, and it has really helped. I implore you to give regular exercise a try for one month.  Ignore all the Facebook posts from your friends that say, ""WOOO I RAN 17 MILES TODAY IN 23 MINUTES!"" and just do something that makes you sweat, makes your heart beat fast, and gets blood pumping through your body and brain. Do it regularly to condition your body to get used to these physical stressors.

See if it helps you the way it has helped me. ",54,2013-10-08 14:55:37 EDT-0400

613,"Displacement: from ""oh god I did something stupid"" to ""yay, I noticed a mistake""","I tend to panic about past mistakes. sometimes ones from last week, sometimes from years ago.  when I first notice that I've made a mistake, or done something awkward, I get flooded with guilt and fear and embarassment. the usual ""oh god everyone is going to hate me forever, how could I have been so stupid"" silliness. :)

but lately, I notice a different voice alongside that one. it says nicer things, like ""hey, I'm aware of that category of mistake now. that's cool. pretty soon I'll be able to notice it in time to apologize, and soon after that I'll be able to stop it before it happens"". :) it's a much healthier way of thinking about these things, so I'm trying to encourage that voice to get louder, and reassure myself that the overwhelming guilt isn't necessary.

I'm not sure when the change started, but I think it has something to do with an epiphany a few months ago, that when people are giving me constructive criticism on my behaviour, it does NOT mean that I'm a horrible person, it means I have a chance to improve myself. and that it's okay to have made mistakes in the past, and it doesn't make me worthless or stupid or any of that crap.

yeah, I can be really hard on myself. :P but the more I'm aware of it, the easier it is to change. :)

at this point, the hardest part is the fear that people who knew me when I was more socially awkward will always see me that way, and won't give me a chance to improve. ... one of those people is the same person who actually wanted to offer constructive criticism, though, so maybe it's all in my head? but it's a fear that still feels very real to me, and I'm not sure what to do about it yet.",3,2013-10-13 00:23:53 EDT-0400

I used to go out but after being treated for depression I started to realize what it was like to have less anxiety.  But because I don't want to feel anxious again I have been avoiding going out.  I also have social anxiety so that is just another reason to feel nervous about going anywhere alone.  After a long time avoiding it, I finally made it to the bus stop and sat down for a few minutes before getting up and going back home.  The trucks were passing by so fast I had to leave after a few minutes.  I guess it's a big step but it's hard for me to be pround of myself because I always have high expectations.  I thought that maybe some people here would understand how big of a deal this is to me.  Hopefully next time I will be able to stay at the bus stop longer and maybe even catch the bus to the park.",6,2013-10-08 07:18:23 EDT-0400

616,"Gamers, do you find yourself unable to enjoy certain video games because they make you anxious?","As a female gamer, I can't handle any game like Amnesia, Dead Space, Bioshock, etc. I become extremely overwhelmed with anxiety, to the point where I'm basically hyperventilating. Creeping around corners and just expecting something to jump out and chase me leaves me soiling my pants. It's hard for me to understand how anyone could find them enjoyable!

But pretty much any first person game really gets me going. Games like Halo and Call of Duty use to make me feel so uncomfortable when I was younger, but I've gotten better with those. Games like Skyrim, Fallout, Far Cry and even minecraft(seriously me?) leave my heart pounding. I think overall the concept of things unexpectedly attacking me is what makes me anxious. And I loathe basically any situation where I'm timed/racing another character. I honestly want to enjoy them though, because they look so fun! I find them a bit easier to play when I'm with others, and I have no issues watching my friends and siblings play. That's usually what ends up happening anyway, or I watch play-throughs on youtube.

Nintendo games are what I find relaxing. I've grown up playing with their consoles and love the majority of their games. Anything with mario, animal crossing, harvest moon, pokemon, kirby, etc. are my fallback if I need to relieve some stress. PC games are great too.

Does anyone else experience anything similar? There are so many games with amazing concepts that I want to play, but I literally can't enjoy them! I don't understand why I get this way. Is there any way to get over this?

And what are some of your fallback games that help you unwind when you're anxious?

623,So I got denied counseling...what?,"I finally decided to kick social anxiety's ass.

Since I have no formal diagnosis, I took a trip to my university's disability office and see if there was anything they could do to help out with class participation while I work on overcoming it. They suggested I try out the campus counseling to see if they can do such a thing (which I planned to do anyway for some recent life events).

Well, I got to my initial evaluation, and got through it fine, having my life pretty much written out. **I walked in there for help with social anxiety and another recent traumatizing event.** I wait it out a while, then get a voicemail on my phone.

They said that unfortunately, I would be best off ""referred elsewhere"" ""because of the amount of Xanax"" I take, and ""the risks involved, although I know you know not to mix it with alcohol"". 

I couldn't get to my doctor in time to leave for college, and knew I'd need some sort of drug to knock me out of any inevitable panic attacks as I try to make friends and adjust. I did *extensive* research until I knew for sure that I had made the right choice and would be able to avoid dependence. That ""amount of Xanax"" I take? 0.25mg TOPS. Once or twice a week during the beginning of the semester, but now maybe twice a month at absolute most. I do everything I can to be responsible with my drug use, and only use it when *absolutely needed* (never to ""get fucked up""), and I'm truly not at risk for anything - if I was, there's no way the tiny handful of pills would be hardly touched after almost 3 months. I can understand if they don't want to be held liable if I overdose or something, but I find this complete bullshit. I was VERY clear about all of this and thought complete honesty would be best in my situation. 

I feel like this was a kneejerk reaction to the scary word Xanax. I've said it before...just because there is a POTENTIAL for addiction doesn't mean that it will happen.

My health insurance is hours away and I doubt anything would be covered; on top of that, I can't tell my parents or have them pay for anything outside. This is my only option, and now I'm going to be fucked in my class that is 30% participation, because I can't give the disability office any answers. Does anyone know if I can fight this decision? I feel like it was very biased, especially considering I didn't go there for help with a drug problem I don't have. Sorry if this sounds pissy, because I still am.",14,2013-10-08 06:40:41 EDT-0400

628,Best advice I've ever recieved,"Today I went to my therapy, and my guy made a fucking INCREDIBLE point. 


Us, the worrieries, are really god damn good at worrying. This is because we have a LOT of practice with worrying.  We keep repeating the troublesome thoughts in our head, over and over.  We're rehearsing the idea, repeating it, and keep running it through our minds.

There is an opposite effect that could be happening instead.  We continue to rehearse, repeat and run it through our mind, but instead of focusing on the negatives(the worry, the fears, the problems) we focus on the ""hope"" or ""confidence"" (look at the positives of the situation, look at what you learned) then our problems will melt away. 

You just need to change the focus of your thoughts.  

We need to realize that our human worth is infinite and complete because we exist, we need to resist falling into the mindset that so many corporations want us to be in, of needing external stimuli to feel complete. 

The fact that you are alive is reason enough to celebrate, just focus on the positives of life instead of the negatives, we will enjoy our time on earth that much more.  


I may have worded parts of that poorly, but I hope you all get the gist of what I am saying.  I know that this advice made tons of sense to me and helped something click in my head, and hopefully it can help some of you as well.",27,2013-03-13 00:17:51 EDT-0400

634,Anxiety and unemployment,"I don't know where else to go. I have really, really bad anxiety about applying to jobs and networking... I've been unemployed for 7+ months now. 

I know I should be out there resume spamming and using contacts. But whenever I start trying to apply to jobs, I feel really anxious, like my chest starts hurting and it gets harder to breathe. 

When I do apply, I spend too much time tailoring cover letters/resumes because I over-worry due to my anxiety, and then 99% of the time I get no response anyway. It makes me feel so completely horrible about myself. I basically go through this cycle where I send out a few applications on a good day, get no response, get overwhelmed with anxiety/depression for a long time, repeat. 

My social anxiety is also a lot worse now, because I'm depressed and never go out anymore. So I can't even ""network"" and contact people who I know could help me in finding a job, because they're strangers, or I haven't talked to them in a long time and feel too anxious about it.

Even friends/family/acquaintances just asking about the job search is enough to make me feel panicky. Like I literally feel a wave of rising panic whenever anyone mentions it. I have to force myself to remain calm and act like nothing's wrong.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep going like this, but I don't know how to fix any of it.",27,2013-03-14 21:56:44 EDT-0400

637,Do you have anxiety this very moment? Try this:,"I do this to help myself, and since then I have had great control over my ability to kill anxiety when it comes up.

Go into a room with a reasonable amount of space to walk. Take a deep breath, place one foot in front of the other, heel to toe. Say out loud (preferable) or in your head, right foot, left foot, ect.

Every step with your right foot, say right foot. Every step with your left foot, say left foot. Once you get the hang of it, also incorporate inhaling and exhaling into your monologue. 

Inhale, right foot, exhale, left foot. 

Now do the same thing, except walk backwards. 

Here is what you're going to learn from this and why it will help you. Every single time you lose your balance or falter in any way, take note of how your imagination was running wild. Every time you misstep, it is because you have lost concentration from the present moment, and have begun thinking.

Do this for about 25 minutes, and notice how quickly you improve in your balance. Your balance will improve from your mind gaining clarity. Pay special attention to how out of control your thinking process has become, and learn to safeguard your mind from the static noise of thinking. 

Happiness exist only in this very moment, not past or future. This exercise will help you return to the present moment where you can feel calm and happy. 

Tips: Take one footstep for each inhale, and one footstep for each exhale. Walk and breath slowly, for it will challenge you greatly. Put your awareness into only your breathing and each foot you are using. Focus on your inhale and how your lungs fill with air and become full, and then how wonderful it feels to exhale, and that moment in time between the inhale and exhale. Every time you catch yourself thinking, stop. Continue the exercise.

Once you have finished this exercise, you can test yourself easily to gauge improvement. Say to yourself out loud with your eyes closed ""I wonder what my next thought is going to be."" Put all your attention and energy into identifying what your next thought will be. 

The time between when you say this, and when you have a thought, is called presence. The more you practice, the longer your presence will last. 

Anxiety cannot exist in the present moment. Free yourself by getting here.

Please feel free to share your experiences.

638,[Help] How do you deal with the idea that you might not be living your life in the way that it's meant to be lived?,"I have no idea what subreddit to post this in. I just want to know if anyone else struggles with this, and how they deal.

Most of the time, I'm fine. I've had episodic depression in the past (normally when I go through a big change), and my family has a history of struggling with mental illness. I have recently gone through a big change (graduated from college).

I have been thinking about death more and more lately (not suicide but the fact that everyone dies). Even reading about historical things, I can't help but think about how all the people I'm reading about are now dead and someday me and everyone I know will be too. This scares the shit out of me.

I want to just enjoy life and the people in it and get what I ""want"" out of life. Problem is - I have no idea what I want so I'm constantly second guessing myself. ""Is this what I want to do? Is this what I want out of life? How will I be able to tell? How can I tell if this is better than plan b or c or d? What is wrong with me...shouldn't I know what makes me happy?...etc, etc"" and obviously it spirals out of control from there.

It's gotten to the point where it affects my mood at times. Sometimes I'll have random ""freak out"" episodes where I'll feel like my life has been a dream and I don't know myself or anyone in it.
I am taking advantage of a really amazing opportunity right now (volunteering in a beautiful country for a few months) and want to make the most of it. I don't want this negativity to affect me anymore. I know I've been rambling but any advice would be so appreciated.

Side note: I used to take antidepressants but went off of them about two years ago. I have been doing fine until recently.

TLDR: I am hyper-aware that every choice I make contributes to the sum that is my life, so I'm constantly second-guessing my choices. This is preventing me from enjoying these choices/my general mood.",13,2013-03-14 18:06:09 EDT-0400

649,Has anyone overcome anxiety that brings on crippling procrastination?,"I have severe anxiety when it comes to certain things. Mainly school work. It gets so bad that I will put off assignments to the last hour before I even look at them. I am about to fail two classes, classes that I was passing up until two weeks ago because of this. I had a bunch of assignments and two finals this week and could not bring myself to work on any of them due to this anxiety. For one class I had six assignments totaling 20% of my grade and a final worth 30% due today and I have not worked on either even though I  had an A before two weeks ago. This morning I decided that another class with a final due tonight, 35%, was more important so I decided not to do any of that work and work on that final. Didn't start it until about 3 hours before it was due and took a look at it and don't know how to do it because I couldn't bring myself to review during the week. 

I am really worried for my future because I know I am intelligent and I am capable of doing well when I apply myself, I just cannot get over the anxiety that washes over me when I attempt to start an assignment. 

I failed out of one university for this same reason and am trying to get through an online college so I can get a degree. I have been seeing a professional once a month for 8 months and he has been helping quite a bit, but in the past two weeks I really screwed up. I am going to keep trying until I get this degree, but I know I can do more  with myself than finish a degree at an online college.

My dad told me ''Right now, you have a higher chance of dying by not exercising rather than exercising''.

So I went out, and jogged for 5 minutes. That's freaking right, 5 minutes, without freaking out. It is so little compared to what I did in high school, but I feel proud. My goal is to be able to jog for 20 minutes by the end of this year without freaking out.

But anyhow, as it was happening in a mall, my first instinct (besides trying to call somone to talk me through it) was to hit up the food court. I hadn't/haven't been eating much, and usually eating a bit helps calm me down during an attack.

As I picked through the teriyaki I managed to make myself chuckle with the idea of having ""emergency teriyaki"" on hand for these occaisions.

No it's not a ""made up disease."" 
No it's not a 'fancy word' for being ""psychotic.""

You think I don't realize that all of it is in my head? NEWFLASH: I do. 
That doesn't mean it's easy to ignore it.

Do you honestly believe I like living in fear constantly? Always worrying and freaking out over the smallest and most irrational things?
Do you really think I enjoy being crippled with fear over a situation that is most likely NEVER going to happen?

""Just ignore those thoughts!"" 
HOLY. SHIT. Is it really that easy?! All I have to do is just IGNORE the fear?! I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO TRY THAT!

And if I'm having a panic attack, is calling me delusional really going to help me? Are you that inconsiderate and rude? How dare you. Do you think it's easy being completely fine one second and the next you can't even breathe, it feels like your having a heart attack/dying, your mind is struck with complete and absolute fear, and it doesn't even feel like you're connected with reality?
You think I'm just doing that for attention? I would NEVER purposely put myself through something like that. WHY don't you understand that I CAN'T HELP IT.

Maybe, just maybe, if you would listen to my cries for help things would be better.
Maybe I could get some help and slowly start to get better. 
Unfortunately, being judgmental and making me feel like I'm a lunatic is only going to make things worse.


I just wish people understood that I'm not 'overreacting' and just trying to 'get attention.' I'm not being a drama queen. It may not be real to you but it's very, very real to me.

664,[Relaxing] Just a few things I have learned.,"I have no idea if these things will help anyone else, but maybe they will!

1. Letting cold (like tap/faucet) water drip slowly on to my fingernails. This was suggested when I was at an adolescent crisis center and oddly enough, it helped. I'm not even sure why.

2. Walking while looking down at the ground. Sometimes I get freaked out by swinging things (stuff on a rearview mirror/a fan/etc) and looking down while walking or doing something simple seems to help some.

3. Coloring. I only recently learned this. My mom got me some coloring thing ([this in particular](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/assets/1/14/DimRegular/844787_1.jpg)) and a pack of 50 or so markers. I began coloring that night and found I would space out and let my mind relax for hours while I colored and figured out how I wanted my picture to look.

665,Shut-In starting Zoloft,"I've typed this out about five times now and I'm still not sure how to appropriately word it. Here goes v6.

I'm a shut-in suffering *some* form of depression and *some* form of anxiety - possibly from one underlying issue, I don't know. I've never been formally diagnosed because I'm distrusting - but particularly so of medical professionals. After an especially miserable period however I felt I had to contact my doctor. I did, I begrudgingly left the house, weaved through what felt like thousands of prying eyes and ended up with a prescription of Zoloft at 50mg/day.

I've been told that it can take weeks to kick in, but after reading some reviews and experiences online I'm not even sure I *want* it to kick in. The side effects sound horrific. I'm really concerned about the idea of a drug with the benefits of a similarly administered placebo (as many reviews have put it) when it seems like its side effects can ruin lives - particularly when coming off of it. 

I have a phone call with my doctor scheduled for next week, and I'm already considering expressing concern about this. Does anyone have distinctly positive experiences with Zoloft - and if so, could you describe it? Particularly if your situation is similar to mine I'd like to hear about it, because I feel like I'm wasting my time with this drug and it's only going to make my circumstances worse. And I suspect that that negativity is only going to compound the issue. 

I considered posting this to /r/offmychest because that's what half of my motivation is here. I haven't even told anyone about the Zoloft or where I was when I was at the appointment because I don't want anyone to worry - and it's been a week now so it already feels like it's too late to come clean. 

Thanks, people. ",36,2013-09-27 21:01:54 EDT-0400
666,"I can't believe it, anxiety over beautiful people","I don't even know if this is a term but I actually get anxious over beautiful people.  I am a male and heterosexual but males or females that are attractive, I get anxiety over.  I try to talk myself down say if I am in a meeting and there is a beautiful person in there.  I am 30-ish and this is still a problem.  

Actually, I found it a great way to figure who is beautiful or not, if they give me that weird anxious feeling.   Normally it is 4/40 people.  

And it is the weirdest thing, I can't make eye contact.  I try to hide if I am around.

It depends on the person.  Normally attractive strangers, I can avoid contact long enough, that I may never see that person again.  But the people I work with, sometimes I see a gorgeous female or a symmetrical male and my brain just shuts down telling me, ""Get out of there!!!"".  In some respects, it is narcissistic, why would they be bothered with me anyway.

Me, I guess I am average build, weight, etc.  I guess living in larger major cities and seeing the wealthy, beautiful people when I grew up, maybe gave me this anxiety, I don't know.  And then my parents are top people (sort of politicians) as well.  And I am not, maybe my upbringing had something to do with it.

Sometimes I feel like a robot that is shutting down.  I see an attractive person coming my way.  I try to avoid that person but I can't.  I try to look normal but I don't know how.  I look at my shoes or pull out my phone.  Crap, I don't have my phone.  What do I do, look normal.  I am adult.  At this point, I just sweat and try to avoid a pending panic attack.

* Has anyone experienced this?
* What have you done to counter the effects?
* For me, I guess it could be because I spend a lot of time alone.  Maybe I am just not used to people.
* Oh yea, this perpetual summer sucks.  Gorgeous women in sun dresses everywhere.
* And there are only two genders and unless you live in the sticks.   Most people are attractive to a degree.  So I just end up avoiding most people.

668,Rant about panic attacks and college,"I need to vent about something if that's alright with you. Obviously, you don't need to read this.

So lets start off by saying that I am 21 years old and I've been dealing with panic attacks for about two years now. I don't take medication, I only went to three psych sessions, and I can barely control them when they do occur. 

Tonight, I had a major assignment due at 11:59pm. Normally I would have had an assignment like this done days ago, but with the amount of homework and papers I had due this weekend, I had no choice but to wait until the final evening to complete this. So 8:00 rolls around and I have one essay left to write out of six. I take a 10 minute break and then a panic attack hits me. This one lasts about an hour and then another hits at around 9:50 or so. I couldn't focus, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't do anything. Time was running out to submit my essays, so I did something I didn't want to do. I called my dad and told him what was happening and asked him to help me with the final essay question. When he finished it, he emailed it to me and I put that right along with my other answers. I was relieved in a sense that my paper was done, but I felt guilty. 

I uploaded my assignment to safe assign and then boom, nearly everything my dad wrote for that question was either directly copied or the words were minimally changed. So basically, I am fucked. I deserve this for trying to get away with cheating, but fuck, I'm so sick of panic attacks getting in the way of everything. 

I'm most likely going to have academic sanctions put on me, I'll probably get a zero on the MAJOR assignment, I may even get suspended. It hasn't been graded yet, so I don't even know if he will notice, but I'm sure he will. I don't know what to do. Do I tell him why that happened? Do I wait and see if he says something? Do I try to lie about it by saying I accidentally copied my rough draft into my final? I just don't know what to do. 

Literally all the motivation that I had is completely gone. I don't even want to think about anything related to school, like homework that is due tomorrow, because I am so stressed. ",7,2013-09-23 12:05:18 EDT-0400
669,I called the cops to resolve a domestic disturbance in my apartment a few moments ago. I'm still panicking.,"Earlier this morning, I heard a commotion of what sounded like furniture being toppled over and people screaming at each, impacting noises and what was either a child or infant crying loudly in all of it. This stressed me the hell out to the point where I went downstairs to the apartment office to get a security officer to examine the situation. Unfortunately, when we got to my floor, the noise had died down.

Still, he told me to call the cops in case it does happen again. Thinking it was just a one-time spat, I let it slide, until the same commotion happened again half an hour so later. At this point, I called 911 and asked for a police officer to resolve a potential domestic disturbance on my floor. 10 minutes or so later, two of them arrived, asked questions and I answered them as best as I could (they asked if I was OK because they could tell I was having a minor freakout).

Again, when they arrived the noise had died down, but just as they were about to leave, it started happening again, though only briefly. They couldn't determine what room it was, so they basically just listened in on rooms on that floor to see which room had the disturbance. After they left, the noise came up AGAIN, which ended in me calling the cops AGAIN. This time they sent 4 cops instead of the other 2, and they instantly heard the noise as soon as they arrived on my floor. I'm assuming they've resolved it because up to this point I haven't heard any commotion.

My heart can't stop beating, I've never had to deal with both a domestic disturbance this violent and having to call the cops before. Since the disturbance, any loud noise I hear, whether inside or outside my room, freaks me out and gets my adrenaline going again.

673,Magnesium really helped me,"Hi everyone. Like many of you I have always been a little anxious, and prone to panic attacks. My anxiety got a lot worse this july. My doctor gave me some clonazepam which helped a lot but I was becomming dependant on Them quickly so my doctor wanted to switch me to SSRIs. I had no interest in being on drugs for the foreseeable future so I began to look for other options. (no offence to anyone, i was just scared of the side effects)

I discovered magnesium. I have seen countless people online reporting that taking magnesium supplements cured their anxiety. I am now one of those people as well: my anxiety levels are lower than on clonazepam and getting better every day.

Anxiety is one of the first symptoms to appear with magnesium deficiency. Many of the other weird symptoms of anxiety such as weak hands and cold hands and feet are explained by magnesium deficiency.
The kind that works best for me is magnesium citrate powder. It works within 5 minutes to eliminate anxiety, relax muscles, and improve my breathing (i have asthma). My sleeping has vastly improved as well, my heart rate is lower and doesn't race anymore and i no longer get heart palpitations. Magnesium chloride and magnesium malate are effective as well. Try to avoid magnesium oxide as it is the cheapest and most common but is not absorbed by the  body as well for whatever reason.

Anxiety is my anchor. My thoughts constantly turn to failure and I compare myself unfavorably to others without even realizing it. It's like all my thoughts just flow through this trough of negativity. The more I want to do well, the more I think about failure and the consequences of not doing well. I know what I should be doing, but the constant fear and anxiety are causing me to make mistakes and feel exhausted.

681,Anyone feel normal when they don't have any responsibilities? ,"I'm a 20 year old college sophomore and I've just started tackling my anxiety issues. I've been on Citalopram for around a month and it seems to help in spots, but some days I feel like maybe they aren't helping so much. Mainly I seem to do ok when there aren't many immediate things for me to worry about. I can handle the general worry about my future no problem, but whenever I start to have any sort of homework or responsibilities things start to get bad again. It's frustrating because I worry that in the future I'll never be able to handle the responsibilities of adulthood. If I can't handle homework now then I just don't see how anything is going to ever get better for me as I get older. I would appreciate any sort of feedback/advice. ",17,2013-02-18 03:46:50 EST-0500

685,"[Help] Does anyone else get words ""stuck in their head""? This has been flaring my anxiety and making me feel insane.","I've had this weird thing happen to me ever since my anxiety where I randomly get words stuck in my head. I don't repeat them obsessively; they just sorta roam in my head and I subconsciously 'think' them at random times. (Just to clear the air, I don't hear voices or see things. The only ""things"" I see are flashes of light but that's because I have a floater in my eye. I am, however, terrified of having schizophrenia.)",20,2013-02-15 20:35:19 EST-0500
686,Something incredible happened last night.,"I struggle with general and social anxiety. The social anxiety has gotten better over the last few years, but I still have some difficulties, specifically with hyper-awareness and automatic thoughts. 

I've gotten better about putting myself out there when I want to be around people, but a lot of the time when I am with a group of friends, I feel like the black sheep; the one who isn't acknowledged as much as others, the one who feels left out of the inside jokes, you get my point. Last night was different, though. 

I live outside of DC, so after work, I went into DC with two of my friends to play trivia. Generally, with these two friends, it's easy for me to feel like a third wheel and withdraw from them because they have gotten closer in the last several months. Instead of withdrawing though, I faked it until I made myself feel like I was as included as I desired to be. While playing trivia, I felt like an integral part of the team and not just the tag-along. When we were all taking the metro back home, I noticed that my two friends were speaking to each other more than speaking to me; and while I noticed this and felt that certain discomfort I get when my anxiety is flaring, I was okay because for that moment *I didn't care*. I can't tell you the last time I found myself in a situation like that and just brushed it off. It was so incredible to just not care.

So when I finally got home with my roommate, I felt so light. I felt so engaging. I felt like *myself*. When my boyfriend came to stay with me at night, I didn't feel like I was holding back from him (I've been doing that lately because I've been having some pretty heavy anxiety for the last month). I just talked and held him and laughed with him, and it was the first time I felt that good around anyone in a what feels like ages. 

It was honestly the most beautiful feeling I've felt in so long, and for once, I fully believed that I can actually take back control. This comes on top of me deciding to find some new hobbies to engage myself with, to go back to therapy to work on my coping skills, and to find a psychiatrist to see if I can get back on Celexa to help with my improvement. 

Still, it felt so incredible to not feel anxious, to not feel tense, and to not feel like something bad is going to happen and that I was the cause of it. I just wanted to document this so I wouldn't forget that moment and that feeling. ",11,2013-02-21 19:32:42 EST-0500
687,Has anyone else avoid being becoming involved in romantic relationships because of their anxiety?,"Ok, so I have never ever been in a relationship with a girl ever. I am nearing the end of my high school career and the one the one thing that I want most to be in a relationship. There have been plenty of girls that I liked but I was always afraid of rejection and too anxious that I would be overbearing or just gross and they would want to leave me. I have never really told them how I felt let along asked them out. But at the same time I feel the longer I sustain from asking them out the more likely they will lose my chance to date them.

690,"[Rant] I'm aware of what my brain is doing, but I can't beat it into my head that it's just anxiety.","You guys must know this feeling. You know when you feel something and you immediately search it up? Well I was getting words/phrases stuck in my and decided to do some obsessive research to feed into my anxiety >.> and came across the disorder known as echolalia. Let it be clear that schizophrenia is among one of my greatest fears. It turns out that echolalia is a symptom of a form of schizo. So after reading about it, my brain decides to convince me that I have it. I can tell that I'm purposely ""acting"" like I have echolalia, even though I'm 100% sure I don't. The same thing is happening to me with hypnagogia. My brain keeps placing intruding thoughts in itself. It only happens when I think about it. It immediately goes away when I'm distracted. I guess I'm reaching that point where I'm noticing that it's all in my head and I'm finally understanding this anxiety disorder. Of course, this doesn't mean it's gone away lol. It's still there. But I'm at a point (at least today) where I don't give in to the ""what if's"". I'm reassuring myself that it's just my brain working itself up. And I know that conscious reassurance won't exactly fix the subconscious cluster-fuck that brain is creating, but I'm in the process of acquiring medical help, so I should be able to see a psychiatrist soon. Which means I can fix that. Anyway, I don't I'll bother making a TL;DR to this, so if you've read up to this point, thank you and you're awesome. Have a nice day :).",9,2013-02-17 01:33:13 EST-0500

692,So I accidentally beat my anxiety the other day.,"So I was on the way to the gym when my headache started turning into anxiety. So then I started getting anxious about how anxious I was feeling, of course. ;) By the time I'd gotten halfway through my squats, it was getting intrusive... and I had this strange part of my mind that seemed to *want* to be more upset.

I've noticed that a lot before, and never understood it. Sometimes I've hated myself because how can I get better if I don't even want to? It seems so goddamn crazy. :/

But that day, something clicked: the reason part of me wanted to be more upset was because it wanted my fiance to *know* I was upset, so he could be extra nice to me and not trigger anything by accident. That part of my brain was too disconnected from the speech part to express anything in words, so it was using the only thing it could reach: emotions.

So, I walked over to my fiance and told him I wasn't doing well. I got a hug, and decided to continue with my squats. I still felt crappy, but it wasn't getting any *more* crappy.

Then something really cool happened: I did my biggest squat for the day (130lbs - 10lbs more than I keep thinking of as my max) - and not only did I do well at it (5 reps, a new record) I felt *good* at the end. The anxiety just sorta melted away while I was busy putting all my attention into lifting. :) It felt so good, I went on and did an extra set, 135lbs for 4. :) :)

I've always heard people talk about exercise making them feel really good, but I'd never felt that way myself until now. It's pretty awesome. :)


**TL;DR**: communication and exercise, they work.

693,[Rant] School isn't easy,"I've never been the type that one would call ""social."" I really only have one close friend but I have many acquaintances. I am now a sophomore in high school. Last summer I didn't even contact anyone I know for a solid two months. I was doing very well in school for the entirety of my freshman year but that all changed. Once I got back in school my anxiety level skyrocketed. I've never experienced anything like it before. It went from zero anxiety to thinking I'm going to die anxiety in the span of 24 hours. For the first semester of this year, I did pretty well. I even made honor roll with a 4.1 GPA. This year it's a different story. I'm falling behind severely. I have an F in a class that I could easily have an A in but I just don't do anything in it. I don't understand anything that's going on in my math or chemistry classes and I have a D in chemistry. I feel like I have to choose between having decent grades and having a social life, because I can't handle both. Even now, I'm putting off doing something that I had 2 weeks to do. I'm so overcome with anxiety that I can barely make it through the whole school day. My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework. I know I can't blame anxiety for all my problems, and some of the blame has to rest on me. I've always been a chronic procrastinator and I think I'm just lazy. I know I could be doing well, but even if I was, I think I would just be alone all the time. Thankfully my dad is understanding of my situation, but not the severity of it. I don't know how to put into words what I'm going through, and I know it isn't as bad as I think it is, but right now I have no fucking idea where to go. I'm always worrying about the future because of my bad grades and bad decisions and the fact that I only have one friend. I could always try to get my grades up, but I don't know where to start. Should I tell my teachers about my problems or would they just shrug it off and tell me that I need to do my work. I'm not special, so why should I get special treatment. I feel like I physically cannot bring myself to do my homework, so I keep putting it off and putting it off until it's too late. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to turn. I try to cover all this up as best I can, because I'm actually a well liked person, and I don't want this to change the way people see me. I've always been ""that weird funny guy."" I rarely exercise because when my heart rate elevates I begin to have massive amounts of anxiety. All I ever do is watch TV, browse the internet, and masturbate because those are the only things I'm good at. I'm so disorganized and I often forget about very important things. I don't know how I'm going to make it in the real world if I can't even handle high school. I don't want this to be normal. I want to go back to the way it was. When I was happy. Right now, I'm terrified of what the next day will bring. Of being stuck in the same old situation that I'm in now.",7,2013-02-20 03:24:42 EST-0500

696,Am I the only one who feels too anxious to play first-person shooters? ,"Since I was a kid, I have been watching my older brother play FPS games, the first one I really remember watching him play was GoldenEye 007. I would be sitting in the room with him and his friend playing this game and then the sounds of shooting came, I couldn't handle it, and I had to leave the room. Fast-forward to the present, I can watch people FPS games no problem, but a couple weeks ago I tried to play Halo 4. It was all going fine, I was kinda nervous to start playing, maybe the idea of things shooting at me kinda set me off. We started playing in campaign mode and the controller started to vibrate and it really freaked me out. I couldn't even really focus on playing because I was too scared and nervous to even go forward. I tried playing for a few minutes but I felt overwhelmed and had to stop. I know this may seem silly, but I really don't even think i'm capable of playing these games because of how anxious they make me. ",17,2013-02-20 22:22:53 EST-0500

My mother always told me to think for the worst, so that's what I did. But instead I became hopelessly consumed into the ""what-if's"". I had my first panic attack a few days ago, and that's when I started researching and realized I probably have some sort of anxiety disorder. I've made an appointment with a counselor, because I really don't want it to get worse. Plus, my stress level has been extra high, given that I recently got into a terrible car accident, my boyfriend recently found out that he's deploying for a year, and my boyfriend is going back to work for this company that practically made him get a DUI. On top of all that, I'm in law school. I'm at a point where I feel like I'm crazy and I don't have control of myself anymore. I wake up every morning and the first thing I feel like doing is weep. I feel like no one really understands and has sympathy for me and they just think I'm being stupid for not being able to deal with this and thinking too much at any given moment.

Initially, I was hesitant - I like having TV shows on in the background while I'm doing other things, and I don't need to concentrate fully. But with a show in another language, you have to pay full attention and read the subtitles to not miss anything. Which, for anxiety, I've realized is great! There have been points where I'll begin to get nervous or anxious about one thing or another, and immersing myself in One Piece where I have to really concentrate can alleviate some of that stress.

717,Death Anxiety. The Last Two Weeks Have Been Long.,"Sorry, this is insanely long, and is probably going to get tangental at times, but I really want to get down everything that I’m feeling at the moment. I’ll try to title sections so you can get a quick idea of what I’m spewing out.

For context, I’m a 20 year old male college student from the United States.

Religious views: You may as well call me an atheist. I sometimes consider the possibility of my consciousness persisting after death in some way (and if I’d actually want that), but I get the feeling that when it’s over, it’s just over. 

**[The Incident]**

So, I have a lot on my mind – too much – that I need to communicate in some way. Periodically, especially when it’s bed time, the lights are out and the room is quiet, my mortality hits me like a sack of bricks. It amazes me how I can live in a Western culture that so willingly exhibits death without actually acknowledging it. It’s easy to crack a morbid joke or watch a snuff film, but we’ve become great at abstracting ourselves away from death – we see it happening, but not to us. But I digress. When this mortal wrecking ball slams into my chest, I find myself having a panic attack of sorts – mind you, I’m not clinically diagnosed with anything (yet), but we’ll see when I speak to a counselor.  I usually have to get out of my room, grab a drink of water, and pace around with the lights on for 5 or 10 minutes, after which I am able to repress my fears and get to sleep. 

About 2 weeks ago, while not exactly sober (marijuana) I had one of these episodes. If I’ve ever felt abject fear, it was this hellacious little trip. It was a painfully conflicting episode. I felt an immensely powerful urge to live, but I wanted to go to sleep to escape those thoughts while simultaneously fearing sleep, otherwise known as a “little sliver of death” to quote Poe (you can thank my 2 week macabre Google binge for that one).  For whatever reason, the couch in the common area of my apartment became a source of comfort, and brought out a sheet to sleep on it. Thankfully my apartment mates didn’t pry too much into that one.

**[After the Incident – But First, A Little Background]**

I’ve been reeling from it ever since. I’m currently stuck in a maddening cycle. Now would probably be a good time to explain my situation prior to this episode. I’m a 3rd year computer science student, and I’m not too keen on my studies. So far I’ve mustered enough motivation to have a 3.49 GPA, but I reckon that will change after this semester. My motivation has been good job prospects for my field, and the joy that it brings to my mother and grandparents. I guess, like a lot of people do, I sort of drifted into what I’m doing. I never programmed before my second semester of college, and did so on a suggestion from a friend because I quickly became disillusioned with the idea of being an engineer. 

I usually don’t tell people this, partly because I’ve found it’s something kind of misunderstood by a lot of people and the fact that I feel like I’m 10 depending on how I phrase it, but for several years I’ve wanted to try my hand at auto racing. I started following racing when I was around 16, but never really considered doing it for a living. I was more focused on doing what everyone said I should be doing – focusing on getting into, and doing well in, college. It wasn’t that I was opposed to the idea of college before going, but I’ve found that for me it’s not the oasis it’s often touted as. My college is also notorious for bad weather, specifically winters, which doesn’t help as I feel Seasonal Affective Disorder  may be amplifying my feelings. I guess I could change disciplines, but I’m already so far along and there are not really any conventional collegiate career paths that I’m particularly interested in. Racing has been and continues to be a rich man’s sport (perhaps a bit hyperbolic in some senses, but it certainly takes a pretty penny to support a fledging racing career). My mother has put so much money into my education that I don’t want to just piss it away. I have no idea if I’m actually any good at racing, and properly trying to find out does not come without its cost. I don’t know; maybe I’ll finish my degree and try racing after I’ve accrued some of my own funds. Or maybe I’ll be over it by then and have found enjoyment in something else. Or maybe I’ll drop out and find my way into racing. Who knows right now?


**[After the Incident – Perpetual Existential Crisis]**

So I spelled out my desire previously, however whimsical it may be. I think about the potential satisfaction I could derive from it, but, as with everything in the last 2 weeks, it gets soured by the reminder of my mortality. I find myself cycling in and out of a nihilistic mindset. I think, yeah, I’ll be doing something that is (hopefully) satisfying, but my death and the eventual passage of time makes it null and void. This nihilism makes me view things and people in ways I don’t like. I sometimes look at people and don’t see people but rather masses of organic matter driven to do what they do only by some biological directive abstracted by the minutiae we’ve built into life as we’ve progressed as a species. I see the way I think merely as my brain trying to cope with a threat (death) and being overloaded in the process. I feel that I and other humans lose agency, which only compounds my hopelessness. 

I also keep trying to reconcile enthusiasm for life with an acceptance of death. It seems like right now I can have one, but not both. Looking to an enjoyable future makes me think about losing it all to death. Feeling okay about death makes me feel like I want to go in that moment, when I’m okay with it. Obviously, that doesn’t happen and the cycle repeats.  


**[Coping With It All]**

I feel at times that it would help to get rid of some egocentrism. Yes, I know that the universe existed long before I did. I know that during that time of pre-existence, I had no complaints. But now I have consciousness and I know that, at some point, I’ll lose it for good. When I’m actually dead, I won’t care much, since such concepts no longer have meaning. I know that what constitutes me, at least physically, will persist in some form. But right now I just don’t care about all that. When I’m feeling nice and meaningless, I remember that I have meaning to other people, but I’m hesitant to put all my purpose into going on for other people. It just feels like something I can’t maintain. Sometimes I consider committing purely to helping others (I plan to join some kind of community service effort to try to get a nice dose of perspective).  But that sentiment conflicts with what I think of when I think of what I want to do – race. I picture a racing career that eats up most of my time. I guess I could give part of what I earn to humanitarian efforts, but having those conflicting intentions makes me feel sort of guilty. 

I’ve considered meditation – ego death and all of that. I started by going to a meditation club meeting last week, but honestly the whole thing felt superficial – I felt like I was full of shit for taking part and felt like the kids talking were full of shit. Then again, maybe I’m just not used to listening to people express those kinds of spiritual ideas. And I don’t know what the other kids there are going through. It could be genuine ideas from people genuinely looking for peace. Meh.

I try to take my mind off death and let myself get caught back into the routine of mundane life. Trawling the internet for light entertainment works somewhat, but I’ll often find myself opening a new tab to look up something death related. I want to tell myself that I’ve thought enough about it, but clearly something is missing because I haven’t really resolved this within myself.

I try to tell myself that, if death is really just like a dreamless sleep, then it is a reprieve from the unpleasant things brought on by life. That just seems like such a defeatist perspective to me, though. If I rationalize it that way, I think “Cool, death will take me away from this living curse.” It doesn’t give me much motivation to actually live. 

Sometimes it’s not death itself that bothers me but dying. I think that I won’t be aware that I’m dead, but how aware will I be that I’m on the cusp of death? Will I be acutely aware of my last breath, or will I be unconscious before I’m actually dead? If I’m unconscious before I’m dead, will I, in my last moments of consciousness, know that I’m in mortal danger? The idea of withering away slowly bothers me greatly (perhaps a product of growing up in a youth obsessed culture), and I don’t know if life and experience will really help me to cope with those final moments, in which I imagine myself reviewing my life. The uncertainty of how I’ll die leads to thoughts of suicide that, in some way, give me a measure of control in my death (That was hard to even type out).

The idea of dying a natural death alone bothers me, and I can’t count on having a bunch of people around in my final moments (or if I’d want to subject people to that). I don’t want kids, as I’d rather not risk bringing a person into the world that bears my genetics and has to deal with their mortality, especially not in the way that I am. And, as cold as this may sound, you don’t miss what you never had.

There's one more part. I have to put in in a comment.

718,I love you all.,"I've had a very depressive, anxious night. I have felt really really bad all day, and I'm not sure why. But right now, in this instant, I have this perfect sense of inner peace. I was over at /r/RespectPorn, and it made me feel very one with humanity. I just wanted to thank you all for your comfort. I wish I could meet you all in real life, and buy you dinner, and tell you how much you've meant to me. This subreddit has been the biggest help. It's amazing to know that I'm not alone. I hope you are all doing very well. Again, thank you. Thanks so much. I love you all so much. Every one of you. :')  
  
All of us are in this together. If any of you need anything, message me. I'm here. This post is to thank you, and to tell you that **you are not alone**.

719,"The concept of Time gets me very, very anxious","As the time pass, it seems it pass faster and faster. I know it's a common perception along everyone, but it seems to hit me harder than it should.

I always see myself struggling against the clock. If I'm heading for a meeting, I'm with my eyes fixed on the time thinking I won't make it. If I have a couple spare hours to do nothing, I always think it's not enough time to do something and end up procrastinating until I actually have to do something.

Actually, this bit is the most fucked up part. It seems my life is a constant waiting for something to happen. Everytime I have time to do something, I convince myself it's not enough time to bother turning on my PS3, or starting a movie, since it's ""almost time to something, let's just browse reddit until then"". I'm always sitting here waiting for the next message, the next phone call, the next invite out, the next *anything*. 

Right now it's 5pm here and I'm thinking ""Well, the day is almost over anyway"" (even though I woke up at 3pm).


TL;DR: Time gets me very anxious. I'm obsessed with ""What time is it"", ""I won't make it on time"", ""It's not enough time to bother doing something useful besides procrastinating"".

Anyone feels anything similar? ",12,2013-11-15 22:14:31 EST-0500

722,"Generalized anxiety, does anybody else suffer from chronic stress?","Hey guys I have like super chronic stress from what I'm guessing is generalized anxiety. Was wondering if anybody else gets the same way. This sometimes happens to my arms and neck but mostly the muscles above and behind the ears are full blown flexing and I'm not noticing until I concentrate on relaxing them. It's like I'm constantly stressing and for no reason. I've been suffering from this for about 6 months now and I'm not what I would have thought an anxious person would be. Yeah sometimes I get panic attacks, thinking I'm having a stroke, but that doesn't happen too too often. I'm not nervous about anything, I'm not scared of anything, even when under pressure I don't freak out. But every day I'm so tense and I feel like I'm a kid again whos book report is due tomorrow and I haven't even read the book yet!

Is anybody else the same way? 

Also the stress and depression thing had me really confused for months. I've seen two psychs where one I was diagnosed bipolar. But the second psych ruled it out. We've figured I'm having ""cycles"" because of the stress is working me up to where I'm so tense and feel excited and stimulated (not in a good way), and depression when the stress takes its toll and my body needs a day or two to sleep off the tension that was building up for a week.

723,"Saying ""no"" and setting limits is hard","I'll try to shorten this story as much as I can. Sorry for the length. I swear, all the points I make are important for the overall story!
I have just moved to a small town for school and immediately looked up an animal rescue group that needs foster parents. I have fostered dogs and cats in the past and really enjoyed it. 
I got interviewed and approved to foster with a group and was excited. They send me an email saying there are some kittens available to foster and if I was interested I needed to contact Lady 1 and they provided me with her number. It was the weekend and I was working on a lot of school stuff, so I held off on calling right away. Suddenly, I get an email from Lady 1 who I have never met saying that she has these 3 barn kittens and can I take them? I didn't like that the rescue group just gave her my personal email, but brushed it off. We talk, I ended up with 3 kittens that evening.
Kittens were fine. They hid under my couch the whole time because they were terrified of me. Wasn't rewarding and they shit everywhere on the carpet.. Hadn't had to deal with that before, but I was understanding. I only had them for 4 days. 
After the kittens were gone Lady 1 is constantly emailing me, texting me and calling me about when can take some more cats. I tell her that I am busy with the last stretch of school and that I get a month off at Christmas and expect to take full advantage of it. She asks me ""where am I going over Christmas and if I can take cats with me?"" Ummm, no. I am not taking care of cats during my holiday. I tried to be polite. She continues to bother me and asking what the exact day is that I'm back from my holiday so that she can give me another cat?
Just to clarify, I love fostering. I also love alone time. In the past when I fostered I would do it every once in awhile because it can be a lot of work and I'm 24, I'm still selfish and enjoy me time. I'm not about to give up my entire life to take in cats while I'm away at school.
I e-mail Lady 1 letting her know when Im back from my holiday and explain politely to her that we may not be on the same page with the amount I'm willing to foster. As we are emailing back and forth I find out that she is not officially associated with the rescue group and that they just agreed to help her find some foster homes and that I am apparently her only foster home at the moment. I explain that I am more than willing to help out, but it definitely won't be constant fostering from me and that I am interested in fostering dogs with the rescue, not just cats. 
While this is happening I am not handling it well. I am getting anxious and flustered because I have to make it clear to her what my boundaries and limitations with fostering are. After awhile she is only writing back 1 word responses like ""sure."" She ends it with saying, ""be careful with dogs because if you want me time you won't get any fostering dogs.""
I lost it. I took it as a jab. I deleted all her emails and got super anxious! Why the hell is she acting this way towards me? I never said I was on board to foster a million barn cats! She never asked if I would take more cats after my holidays, she just told me she has some available and needs to know when I'm back to take them. I'm not her partner in this cat fostering and she was acting like I'm on the same page with her on all this.
Very frustrating. I love helping animals, so I feel bad for setting limits, but this woman is too much to handle, rude and not at all accommodating. Fuck her. I don't know where to go from here with fostering with this group anymore.

724,I wish I could learn to stop the negative self talk,"Hi there reddit, first time poster long time lurker. I was actually glad to find there was a subreddit for anxiety. Anyway some back story. For a long time I was morbidly obese (about 495 pounds) and over the past 11 months I've widdled that number down to 300. For context I am 29 years old. I've had every cardiac test possible in the book (EKGs, ECGs, Stress Test, Heart CT, Heart Cath) and everything came back normal (with the exception of the stress test but the cardiologist felt it was probably the extra weight and not a blockage, which the subsequent heart cath revealed to be true). Surprisingly enough I actually have normal blood pressure. So I've been battling anxiety and health anxiety all during this weight loss process, specifically the fear that every little pain in my body or weird feeling is going to lead to a heart attack and eventually my death.  

My problem is basically I'll feel something off anywhere on my torso, whether it's a quick pain or whatever and I'll focus on taking self-diagnostics until it blows up into something larger. I just can't seem to shake the negative self-talk or focus on my body.

731,"""Just Breathe"" Reddit: an anxiety and panic support group. (x-post from yesterday with new/more info)","Hey guys. I got a lot of responses to starting this anxiety support group, so I thought I would make a more solidified post about it.


The project is called “Just Breathe”. Basically, this will be a list of people who all have some form of anxiety or panic. You can sort of think of them (as well as yourself) like a “sponsor”.  We are here to contact one another in times of need.  I know we can't always talk to our friends and family because they can only sympathize with us, but not really empathize.


What I believe to be special about this anxiety group is that we created an “anxiety bio”. The bio will allow you to talk to someone who actually can RELATE to you because they have the similar fears and triggers. Remember, no anxiety is too small or too big. Whether you have anxiety over bugs, flying, social interaction, etc. It is all legitimate and never stupid or silly. 

Even if you do not feel comfortable being contacted, you can still be a part of it! You will be put in the group with no contact info available. You may contact other members of the group if you need support. You can also decide at any time if you would like to make your info available for others. You may also be removed from the list at any time. 

You have the option to be anonymous. You may just use your Reddit username as your contact info, instead of an email address. You can be removed from the list at whenever you would like. Just ask. 


Your information will be stored as a DropBox document. The only people who have access to this list, are the people who have been invited to view it via email or given a specific link. The document will be updated whenever a new members would like to join or whenever someone would like to opt out.


The more people involved the better, the more support there will be!
If you would like to be part of the group, please message me on Reddit or email me at justbreathereddit@gmail.com. I will need the following information from you:

1. Name you would like to go by.
2. Geographic location.
3. How you would like to be contacted. Note if you do not want to be contacted by anyone. 
4. Anxiety bio. (just a little info about yourself and your anxiety)

733,A lot of people freaking over weed. Know it's just an anxiety trigger.,"I've seen a lot of younger folk freak out about weed. There are a lot of horror stories, especially if you Google, about kids who took some tokes and then had ""brain problems"" or the like. There's also people who complain of having done permanent damage.

Just know this--these people have anxiety problems. Weed is good for some with social anxiety and the like, but it can also be an anxiety trigger...especially for those who have hypersensitivity anxiety. 

Anxiety, especially acute physical anxiety, is a terrible cycle caused by a trigger...something that puts you in a full panic, which raises your mind's awareness of a state that it's not used to (or, is out of its equilibrium). When you experience a panic attack, it's kind of like your mind leaves auto pilot and you are suddenly grabbing for the controls. You freak. Panic attacks are very energy depleting and traumatic for the mind. This causes negative thinking and fear, as well as fear of the physical change you feel, which causes more fear, negative thinking, end so on. 

Eventually, panic attacks start a cycle of daily worry, stress and exhaustion that doesn't normally occur to a calm body. This is a manifestation of physical anxiety disorder, which will be tabbed as ""GAD"" by general doctors. I've been to so many different types of visits to assure myself. 

But, what assures me is that my first anxiety trigger happened a year ago when I used a harmless menthol solution that I used to fix a sore lip. Yeah-- it caused the same panic attack and a 5 month long battle with completely foreign and frightening symptoms that I had to fight off each day. I quit drinking, began exercising, etc. I won that fight and spent three months feeling like $1 million. I felt AMAZING! FREE!! SOOOO DAMN HAPPY!!!

Now I'm fighting the same fight again thanks to a mistake with some weed...but it's the same fight. So, hopefully this calms anyone who has had any type of substance trigger GAD. It's hard to accept and understand the problem...and many who don't are the ones writing the horror stories on other forums.

Acute GAD can be caused by one panic attack, and that panic attack can be caused by a number of triggers. There's dozens of anxiety symptoms that are mental and physical that are all related to the same problem. If you don't attack what's attacking you, you will get nowhere. 

But...there's a reason weed is being legalized, and so many use it with no problem. It doesn't do anything like that to the brain...your anxiety is doing that to you. It was just simply caused by a scary situation. 

Not saying smoking can't trigger full on GAD...it can. But, ANYTHING, if it be a negative to your mind, can trigger this cycle of panic and anxiety disorder. Just know you are dealing with the same documented medical issue that so many of us have...and not same rare, unreversable problem that has doomed you. So many seem so discouraged because of that thought process.

Keep calm y'all. ",45,2013-06-11 07:31:52 EDT-0400

735,"DAE have major anxiety when it comes to decision making, no matter how big or small the decision?","I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, but have been working really hard on my day to day anxiety. One thing that is STILL a huge roadblock is making a decision, no matter how small or simple. This is especially the case when potentially hurting someone's feelings is involved (i.e. my perception of potentially hurting someone, sometimes that's skewed) or if I believe I am making the wrong decision. For example, I've been seeing someone who wants me to make a road trip to visit him this weekend. I totally could, but completely over think the pros and cons of doing so, making me a completely anxious mess and I freeze. This generally turns into not being able to make a decision until I absolutely have to. But being anxious I also like being prepared so... it's just all over the place.

I thought we would try and start a program that pairs up people to be ""sponsors"" for each other. Either contacting this person via reddit, email, text, etc.. when you are feeling really bad or just need to talk.



I have awful anxiety about many things. Health issues is one. I have an extreme fear of vomiting (which is emetophobia). I also just have GAD. It can be sparked for no reason at all. 



Even if we are not always available for one another, sometimes just knowing someone else is listening is all you need. Instead of just Googling it and reading other peoples anxiety stories from '05. 



Edit: I have titled this project ""Just Breathe Reddit"". It will basically be a sponsorship program of sorts. I will create a newsletter and send it to everyone who has provided their info. This info will ONLY be used for the people who have allowed me to use them. This list is for everyone who needs a little help sometimes. Whether you are in the middle of a panic attack or not, you CAN help (and someone can help you!) You can help someone else by just listening to them and relating to them. It doesn't matter how big or small. We all have to be there for each other. Everyone MUST be kind and not dismissive. If you think you would be unable to counsel someone during a stressful time, please alert me of this, so I may make a note that you should not be contacted. 


Anyway, we got a good list going so far! I will send the email out by Friday. I will also keep the list updated as I get new people who are interested.  This is going to be great! We are not alone anymore.

741,"Fear Of Driving, what to do?","Hi all, 

I'm a 26 old student driver from mainland Europe, and I'm just so tired of being afraid to drive a car.

I'm not really sure if this is a common fear, but I certainly feel weird to see my peers and much younger friends drive around so casually, while I can't keep my stomach from becoming uneasy at the mere thought of having to *drive* somewhere.

I don't know why I have it, I've been in some small car accidents (without being at the wheel), but nothing major and never felt shock of any kind. So it wouldn't stem from that I'd say.

Is anxiety genetic? I have had some hard times getting to learn to drive with my father, who's a bit of an OCD person himself, and quite the pannicky, pessimist (always assumes worst case scenarios). Could that have influenced me or 'taught' me this fear?

Even then, I'll try to mitigate any chance of failure by metering out each and every intersection on my way on Google Streetview, even though it's all pretty bland and straightforward. Still, it seems to ease my fears a little, but I'm afraid that might become a habit I won't be able to shake (eg realizing I wouldn't dare to drive if I hadn't planned it all out). Note though that I'm not yet accustomed to just driving places, while a lot of people can drive to places almost on command. Furthermore I usually don't have a GPS with me.  

In trying to combat it, I've tried some breathing tricks, like the 7-11 method (7 second breathe-in, 11 second breathe out) the difference in time has an automatic calming effect on me. 

Alcohol also reduces the fear, but obviously prohibits me from driving.

I don't want to take any medication, I'd be frowned upon as everyone here seems to expect the 'ideal' family, and having to break with that image would dent my image even more. I don't know if talking to a professional would help, as it only manifests itself when I'm confronted with driving.

I try to go driving at least once each day (tried to go for one hour each day, but that's a bit much at the moment), and I can drive, shift and get where I need to be, but the fear keeps coming back. 

Still, once I get driving, I usually calm down pretty quickly and don't do too badly either (although I make some small mistakes now and then, but I know my traffic rules). That's why I wonder why this fear keeps coming back, I don't want to be afraid, I just want to drive a car like my 18yr old niece and my 78yr old grandma can.

Any ideas on what else I could try, or people who have faced similar anxiety related situations?

I'm a bit conflicted on whether I should accept said fear, sometimes I feel like I can trick myself into forgetting I have it, and then it won't rear its ugly head and I feel more relaxed. But if I remind myself of it (involuntary triggered by a random thought), things often get harder than they should be. So that makes me wonder whether I could perhaps force myself to forget I have such a fear?

743,my anxiety is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend.,"I started dating an old friend of mine about 3 months ago. I won't lie, we've had a tough go at things due to my jealous ex boyfriend, but other than that, things have been amazing between us.

Saturday, he called and said he wanted to go look into buying some hookahs and asked me to go with him. I told him I would as soon as I got done eating, which would be in 30 minutes. I called him as I was walking out the door 30 minutes later and he had already left without me and was already at the store. He said he didn't want it to get too late and miss out on being able to go. 

I was irritated, but held my tongue. After that, he said he wanted to stop by a friends house for 10 minutes and then he would pick me up so we could go out. I waited for an hour or more and then called him. He was still at his friends house, so I told him to stay and we would hang out tomorrow morning. 

He said he would come get me so we could go to church together.

Sunday morning, I get up, get ready, and he never showed, or called. I went into a panic at this point and my mind was going over stuff like 'Well he's mad at you, he doesn't want to be with you, that's why he didn't spend time with you yesterday, etc."" Vicious cycle and all that.

I tried to stay rational and thought that maybe he had just over slept and didn't set an alarm or something. He lives less than 5 minutes away so I drove by his house. His car wasn't there. More panic.

Later, he calls me and says that it was because he was helping someone do something, lost track of time, and had left his phone at home so he couldn't call me. He knows I have an anxiety disorder and said he knew I would be upset. I told him how I felt and that this kind of thing, where he says he's going to do something and doesn't, can't keep happening. 

He thinks that I'm overreacting, that I have trust issues with him, and that I need to get ahold of my anxiety. He says he understands that I have problems but he doesn't want to deal with me 'freaking out' and 'getting emotional' on him, because it 'happens every week over nothing' and that it's 'scaring him away.' 

Guys, I am terrified. I honestly feel like my anxiety is taking over my life. I wouldn't wish how I feel on my worst enemy. I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do. Any advice?

744,Could anxiety be causing my digestive system issues?,"I have had anxiety for a very long time (GAD, panic attacks and emetophobia). 

However, the past 6 months have been brutal. There was a death in my family and another member dealing with cancer. I had a stressful school schedule (I'm 21, in university) and some heart problems (I apparently have an abnormal rhythm but it's nothing to worry about - found this out after 4 months of worrying). 

After I found out about the potential heart problem, I went crazy. I worried about my heart beat ALL the time and then I started to worry about my breathing. Even AFTER the specialist cleared me, I still haven't been able to relax. I feel like I'm constantly on edge. And ever since this stuff started happening, my digestive system seems completely out of whack. I'm either constipated or plagued with loose bowels (not usually diarrhea though). It seems no matter what I eat or do, I can't bring my system back to normal. I also just got a new full time summer job, am finishing a summer school class (which I have missed 2 weeks of because of this issue) and have had some relationship issues in the past few weeks. 

I went to a doctor about it a few months ago and he felt around and asked about my symptoms, and basically told me it's stress related. But I'm STILL worried I have colon cancer or something. I have always had a serious phobia of vomiting but now I'm terrified of shitting my pants too or something. ",32,2013-06-10 16:56:35 EDT-0400

I'm a 43 year old male who has suffered from anxiety disorder since I was in my early 20's. Sometimes it is barely there and the coping skills that I have learned along the way are good enough to handle any temporary flare ups. I went through a lot of stress at work last year and it has caused me an increase in long-term anxiety to the point where I am now back on Klonopin on a daily basis. I hate being on medication, but it is sometimes a necessary evil. 

I am glad I found you guys though, it's a good reminder for me that I am not alone in this and that anxiety disorders are very common in this fast paced world. I want to give more to this subreddit than I get though. I'm an old hand at this and have learned a few tricks along the way.

766,How do you wake up every morning?,"Hi r/anxiety.  I am very very very glad I found this subreddit because it has been critical in treating my generalized anxiety disorder (which is just going to be a short term thing in my life) in conjunction with seeing my doctor and therapist.  

Usually when I wake up my alarms are blaring and I freak out.  I'll roll out of bed turn off both alarms with a snooze button and go back to sleep.  This will continue on and on until the day gets away from me and I more than likely miss an appointment.  This causes my anxiety levels to sky rocket once more and I retreat to my bed because it's ""safe warm and incredibly comfortable"".  

This morning however I woke up completely naturally.  I woke up to the birds chirping and sun rising and it felt **sooooooo** good to wake up without a pang of fear or anxiety in chest.  For the first time in a long time I could remember what it was to feel normal in the morning.  

Naturally waking up for me however was a complete fluke.  I'm in college and don't get the amount of sleep that I typically need most times so I have to rely on some sort of system that wakes me up.  

What can I do? How can I wake up more naturally without being worried about keeping my appointment dates on my calendar? ",42,2013-04-24 16:56:15 EDT-0400

My wife wants me to do things around the house(I have no problem doing it) but there are a few things I need to fix that I have no experience with, my oven for example, and I politely asked them to leave the kitchen so I could concentrate. They went to the next room and just got louder, I explained that I need some quiet so I can concentrate and try and fix the problem. It just kept escalating to the point that I slammed my oven door shut, knocked my cast iron skillets off the top of the stove and it broke a bunch of beer bottles. Now my wife is demanding that I 'get my lazy ass excuse for a man in the kitchen and clean up my mess'. I grabbed my laptop and headed for the garage and shut myself in it so I can relax. I know I over reacted but damn, all I wanted was a little peace and quiet.

771,Relationship Anxiety when GF is upset,"Im a 27 year old male. Part of the way my anxiety manifests itself is constantly worrying about my relationship. im in a relationship with a loving but sometimes snappy 27 year old female.

Last night as we got ready for bed, i notice she seemed disturbed. I asked what was wrong and of course she said ""nothing"" but she was clearly annoyed. I asked if i had done anything and she said she ""didnt want to get into it now"" because she ""doesnt want to fight""

we went to bed and i couldnt stop myself from going over and over the past few hours in my head trying to figure out what i had said and done wrong. I asked her again and she said ""baby just let it go! cant you just let it go?"" at this point anxiety really washed over me and i was shaky and nervous. since i had NO idea what i had done i began to wonder how bad it was....(the thing i seemed to have done) she refused to tell me and i began to tear up.

I said i was worried that all day tomorrow im going to be wondering what i did. and she said i was trying to ""guilt"" her into telling me what i had done. she said now i definitely cant tell you because then youll always pry for it.

she tried to comfort me though. she knows i have anxiety and that i worry about breakups and she told me ""im not gonna break up with you baby dont worry""

and thats the worst part because sometimes im totally normal,  and sometimes i worry that the slightest fuck up will cause her to dump me. the LOGICAL part of me knows that makes no sense and that she cares for me and wouldnt just do that at the drop of a hat. but the ANXIETY part of me is terrified from time to time.

I still dont know what i did wrong but im told it wasnt a huge deal and not worth talking about. She is Catholic and tried to pray with me in bed to calm me down. but i felt kind of patronized by it.

774,Recovered from severe anxiety disorder.,"The very first thing that I found out was how much food triggers anxiety.  I am MSG sensitive.  MSG is labelled under many other food ingredients including Maltodextrin or hydrolyzed vegetable protein found in many products ranging from almost ALL potato chips to yogurt to breads to peanut butter.  Another things was very sugary foods, try eating sugary food ONLY after eating a full meal of protein and complex carbs.  I may be msg sensitive but know that crappy food is a stress trigger for EVERYONE.

Side note:Once I started eating unprocessed food, I was always skinny but a pleasant surprise was a subtle 6 pack formed where my otherwise fatless but soft abdomen was and I discovered I could achieve a 6 pack quite easily.  Never in my life was this possible.

Once I cut taking vitamins with crap in them and only eating certain processed foods sporadically my immediate anxiety decreased I would say 50%.  I cannot explain to another person what this transition was like because I felt like I walked into another dimension.  I didn't know who I was anymore because my personality was accustomed to an anxiety disorder.  I was a new man... it. was. amazing.  I have only a vague memory of what my life was like before.

The next step was and honesty is the cure to everyone's anxiety, meditation.  But I never could meditate until it was explained to me by someone to think of it as being mindful, present, and in the moment of now, to focus on a slow exhaling breath while sighing slightly.  It is a RELEASING breathe.  It doesn't matter if a million things pop into your brain as long as you are always trying to focus on your breath again, it WILL work eventually.

Last point, if you need to see a therapist from any trauma to acute stressor in your life, or your job or something like that, all that other stuff will help without a doubt but you need to deal with the issues in your life too.  Therapy helped me tremendously.

Good luck!",3,2013-04-22 01:20:04 EDT-0400

783,Common distortions of thinking,"Was given this as a CBT hand-out:

1. **All-or-nothing thinking** (also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.

    Example: “If I’m not a total success, I’m a failure.”

2. **Catastrophizing** (also called fortune telling): You predict the future negatively without actively considering other, more likely outcomes.

    Example: ”I’ll be so upset, I won’t be able to function at all.”

3. **Disqualifying or discounting the positive**: You unreasonably tell yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count.

    Example: “I did that project well, but that doesn’t mean I’m competent; I just got lucky.”

4. **Emotional reasoning**: You think something must be true because you “feel” (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary.

    Example: “I know I do a lot of things okay at work, but I still feel like I’m a failure.”

5. **Labeling**: You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion.

    Example: “I’m a loser. He’s no good.”

6. **Magnification/minimization**: When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive.

    Example: “Getting a mediocre evaluation proves how inadequate I am. Getting high marks doesn’t mean I’m smart.”

7. **Mental filter** (also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.

    Example: “Because I got one low rating on my evaluation [which also contained several high ratings] it means I’m doing a lousy job.”

8. **Mind reading**: You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.

    Example: “He’s thinking I don’t know the first thing about this project.”

9. **Overgeneralization**: You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.

    Example: “[Because I felt uncomfortable at the meeting] I don’t have what it takes to make friends.”

10. **Personalization**: You believe others are behaving negatively towards you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior.

    Example: “The repairman was curt to me because I did something wrong.”

11. **“Should” and “must” statements** (also called imperatives): You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met.

    Example: “It’s terrible that I made a mistake. I should always do my best.”

12. **Tunnel vision**: You only see the negative aspects of a situation.

    Example: “My son’s teacher can’t do anything right. He’s critical and insensitive and lousy at teaching.”

Every little thing I do wrong I feel like everyone is watching me and that they are all just judging me. Every time my grades slip the slightest I immediately start stressing out and worrying over my future and how bad I'm going to mess it up.

But thats only the surface, around march my parents had a huge argument and my mother threatened to kick my father out. I had been listening and I guess they noticed and called me down. That only made it worst. My mom tried to get me to agree with her and my dad, who just was trying to calm her down and talk it out, did the same. Eventually I was able to get them to stop for the night and go to bed. They have slowly been rebuilding but recently I have noticed a change and think they are most likely are going to divorce. I don't know why but every since the night of the fight i cant stop thinking of the idea of them splitting up and how my life would change. No matter where I am it will find a way to creep into my head and give me some sort of anxiety attack. I dont know why the idea of them splitting up messes me up so much, because I know lots of kids with divorced parents who seem to do just find. But every second of everyday I cant stop but worry and get so much anxiety from it. Its only been recently that its become overwhelming, but it has crippled me socially. I'm not suicidal or anything but it just wont stop creeping into my head.

Thanks for reading if you did, I'm just looking for a place to get it all out. ",2,2013-10-03 04:03:45 EDT-0400

814,I pretty much defeated my anxiety,"Just as a disclaimer, I'm not advocating that this will work for anyone else in controlling their own anxiety. This is only my personal experience and how I decreased my anxiety level considerably. My anxiety was taking over my life for a while there, and I had frequent panic attacks. I changed a few key things in my life and now I feel completely normal; back to how my life was before anxiety. 

What I changed:
1. Started taking multi-vitamins, inositol, and theanine. 
2. Exercising every day; mostly lifting weights.
3. Changed my diet. This means more fruits/ vegetables/ whole grains. Also, I drink green tea and chamomile tea. 
4. Started meditating. I am not very progressive, so this was weird for me at first. But deep breathing exercises and mediation which focuses on pushing away negative thoughts really helped me calm down if I was about to have a panic attack. 

I hope this helps some people consider some alternatives when trying to control their own anxiety. Obviously do not do any of these things without doing research, and maybe talking to a doctor.

School is tough when you're having anxiety and you just want to curl up in to a ball. I am a B student but since certifying in to my major I've had trouble with a particular broadcast writing class. We have about 22 or so writing assignments and the class is strict on spelling proper nouns, names and addresses and one mistake in this regard results in an F. Apparently its normal to fail a few and I failed a couple early on and had some really bad anxiety for it. I did better for couple weeks but today I received another F. 

I know that if I try hard i can pass this class but there's always the chance that I don't and I'm very frightened of that. I could withdraw at the end of the semester if it comes to that but I pray it doesn't. I just really worry that anxiety is going to make me react like this to an adversity or bad news in my life. Im worried about failing this class in being behind, and Im worried that I'll have anxiety attacks like the last time I failed. Does anyone experience this type of anxiety as well? Any suggestions?

820,"I have GAD and I do standup. An explanation, possibly a rant.","So I got big points for a standupshot (btw /r/standupshots) but I feel I should explain how I've gotten where I am. I have bad anxiety, spent time on and off of meds, and have battled with alcohol and drugs. These days I still wake up with a pounding heart, still find myself afraid to leave my house some days, and am in no way ""fixed"" or ""better"". What I do is tell my anxiety to **fuck off.** 

I know this is not easy. It has never been for me either, but here is my process.

I wake up, and go for a bike ride. I work nights, so this is an option for me but the idea is the same: BE ACTIVE.

I head to work, and every time I feel anxious I make myself drink water. This is a bit of a mental trick. Again, as far as I know this applies only to me, but by attaching a positive reaction to a negative thought I find it helps to disarm the thought.

When done with work, I give myself ""me time"". This consists of literally anything that relaxes me. A big part of not being anxious (again, for me) is being a little selfish. Take a bath. Watch cartoons. Jerk it. Whatever you do, do not get down on yourself. Self loathing and anxiety are two sides of the same coin.

Once I was able to give myself a break, and love myself a little, I decided to do anything I could that would challenge my anxiety. I had history in comedy and theater, and found standup to be what I like to call ""free therapy"". I started telling crowds of strangers **everything.**

I realize that what we can feel can seem insurmountable, but it is not. There are not enough success/positive posts in this sub. I am happy that there is a place to rant and have attacks, but I urge anyone else here with a success story to come forward and talk about how you got where you are.

We will always suffer from our affliction, but in the end I believe we can take more from it than it can take from us.

I am, however, less stoked about driving 3 hours through a mostly rural area. It's not so much that I am scared of driving itself, but that I am scared of being in the middle of nowhere. My main fear is that I will get anxious and have a heart attack or something where no hospitals are around and where no one can get to me in time. I know this is highly irrational especially since I will have friends with me but I can't shake it at all. Does anyone else feel this way and of so how do you deal with it?

822,It's ruining my life,"I hope this is the right place to post. Ever since High School, I've had anxiety. Usually that of the social type. Never could really make friends and was afraid to talk to people.

I'm now almost 30 and it's spread to all aspects of my life. I avoid social situations. Any relationships I have me and my gf just fight. I always worry she could be cheating on me, that I'm doing something wrong, that she doesn't care for me as much. So it results in constant fights. Even after telling the person of my extreme anxiety, it start off with them understanding, but then annoys them to the point of constant fights and break ups.

I also am anxious about things that happened yesterday (in general, not about relationships all the time or anything, that's just one aspect). I'm constantly worrying about something I did yesterday. I'm constantly thinking the worst of what will happen today. And tomorrow? Forget about it, it's like the world will end. 

It has gotten so bad that once I tried to kill myself with the same medicine that is suppose to be saving me. I ended up taking a bunch of xanax, sleeping pills and shots. I woke up the next day not remembering much, but my dad (who I guess I was texting) did and drove me to the hospital, where I was admitted for a week in the psycward (really strange because I feel normal, just sick of my life because of this anxiety). Of course it comes with a nice side of depression. 

Some days (most) I don't want to even get out of bed to go to work. It's affecting my work, my life, my relationships. Everything! I've tried therapy for years, many different meds, and now all I have is Xanax which helps at least prevent panic attacks (but my lovely doctor wants me off them cause it's not ""long term"" but doesn't have me on anything else, so I'm starting to get worse again and he don't seem to care).

Any tips on what I can do? I am ready to explode, I can't have a normal life, I lost all my confidence and feel ugly and fat. I rarely can even leave the house anymore because I get too worked up. I dont' know what to do anymore.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, if so can someone point me in the right direction? I just want the cycle to stop. The most advice I get is ""just man up and stop"". People just dont' understand and think it's that easy. I'm at wits end. It's almost unbareable. Sometimes I have to take 2-3 xanax at once to dull the worry. (Doctor said that would be ok). I want to be better. I hate my life because of it. No one understands. They all think ""Oh I have that too and I just had to solve it myself and you can too!"" But they don't understand. I worry from morning to night, cry for hours sometimes and just want it to end so I can be happy.

Things I've tried:
Reading books on how to stop worry. Listening to stop worrying tapes and lectures, meds, therapy (had to stop, new insurance has a 30 co pay and that, on top of dr visits, just isnt affordable to me), hypnosis, the whole mirror thing (both positive and negative attempts to convince myself), motivational post-its, and so on. 

Please, any information would help. I just want it to go away and improve. I've been dealing with this for a good 18 years and nothing seems to help.  ",3,2013-03-18 18:25:14 EDT-0400

839,Just turned 26 and the biggest cause of my anxiety is the uncertainty of growing up.  Some reflections I wrote on my second adolescence. ,"Someone once dropped the phrase ""wrong side of 25"" in a conversation I was having about relationships and age gaps. Details of the discussion aside, the implication was obvious; the difference between your early 20s and late 20s is significant, much like the difference between your early and late teens.

I spent most of 2012 on neither side of 25 - rather right in the middle, an experience that only served to cement the meaning of the phrase for me.

I imagine I'm not the only person beginning to realize that adulthood isn't really a threshold you instantly cross once you get a degree and a job. That omniscient quality that our elders once seemed to possess was really nothing more than a facade, as if they were trying to guide us in the right direction only to reassure themselves through our successes that they themselves had found all the answers. The wisdom we gain with age isn't a sudden culmination of their efforts, but it’s the result of our own trial and error with our friends, our coworkers, and the other relationships we foster in the “real world”. And one day we might seek to validate it by passing it on to someone else.

I spent the last year teetering on the edge of a second adolescence. Part of me kept holding on to my college years, a time when consequences were trivial and mistakes could be laughed off. The other part believed that I had finally figured myself out and that the decisions I made were the manifestation of my newfound status as a “real person” or an “adult” or whatever ambiguous term I held up to the mirror that morning. But at the end of it all, I found myself unable to identify with either person. Someone said to me this year, “I liked you better when I thought you had it all figured out.” So did I.

It was equally as hard to find myself in reflections of my friends, as so many people in my generation are either reliving their college years in the city, married and settled in the suburbs, or struggling just as much as me to find their place in a world that was as unprepared for them as they were for it. We’ve all been standing on our own two feet for some time now, but there’s rarely a hint of stability or uniformity in our gait. We can at least find comfort in knowing that we’re not alone in our confusion.

It’s hard to tell if next year I’ll find myself on the “right side of 25”. I made a lot of mistakes this year, but no more than I did over the last five years. To think I’ll suddenly figure it all out and become an adult over the following months would only further the same misconception I’ve been following thus far.

I took a big step this morning in addressing uncertainties about myself that I’ve yet left unanswered, and I hope not to have to follow through on it alone. I’m still struggling to find any indication that I’m not merely a teenager who knows how to behave in public, but I doubt it will come from a single event or epiphany. I may be an adult in terms of my age and the responsibilities handed to me, but those aren’t metrics by which I choose to judge myself.

I’m an adult because I’m told to be. I’m an adolescent because I feel like one. And I’m a child because I learn like one.

There is no single definition or identity to which I can relate. Our 20s are a journey and our personalities are malleable. Our experiences may be different, but our questions are the same. What matters through this journey is that we foster the relationships and opportunities that allow us to bring ourselves to the table and learn from what we see. I’m fortunate to have the friends that have been with me for so much of my life, and I’m fortunate to be able to define myself by my own terms.

If one day you wake up and suddenly realize that you have all the answers, let me know. I promise I’ll take good notes.

847,First post. And guess what? I'm anxious about it ...,"Here's what's up:

I'll be 28 in June, I have a beautiful wife and three gorgeous daughters who all basically worship the ground I walk on (not to brag or anything). But every night when I come home from work, I'm full of anxiety about facing them. 

In December 2012, I lost a steady, great paying job of 2 years to ""downsizing"". I have since found employment, but it's not the same. It's through a placement agency, which has caused me nothing but stress, and the pay isn't even close. But it's something to survive on and I know that, but something deep inside of me feel its not enough. 
As a result of losing my last job, I fell behind on a lot of bills, car insurance included. It ended up being cancelled. I worked out a deal, however and thought all was going well after mailing in my small first payment. Wrong. They never received it, and it's caused me so much anxiety, I completely shut it out, forgetting all about it. My wife asks me about it often, and I have mini panic attacks every time. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is I'm anxious of facing my anxiety. It's affecting my relationship with my wife and kids, causing me more anxiety. I so desperately want help, but again, I'm afraid I may have another panic attack. 

All this anxiety stems from ( what used to be) a small case of Agoraphobia - the fear of large crowds or open spaces (large crowds for me) and its gotten worse as I've gotten older. I had a panic attack in fucking Costco of all places.

TL;DR - I'm panicking about everything, and it's worsening over time. I want help, but I'm too anxious to seek it out. It's ruining my marriage and I'm becoming a less attentive father because of it. ",6,2013-03-26 01:12:12 EDT-0400

852,I have all but cured my anxiety. I want other people to know there's hope for RECOVERY not just MANAGEMENT.,"I'm 25, have had panic attacks and social anxiety since I was 16, when my friend committed suicide. I thought this was just the way my life would always be. My panic attacks, PTSD, social anxiety, and impending doom started getting worse this year; I was increasingly convinced I was going to die, or at least throw up or piss my pants in public. I had severe anxiety whenever I had to talk to anyone, and moderate anxiety just waking up in the morning, which could escalate to panic without warning. It felt like the world was ending. I thought I was going completely insane and considered dropping out of my grad school program and getting inpatient psychiatric treatment. But that didn't happen. Instead, here's what worked for me:

1. **Therapy.** It was awkward and stressful and terrifying at first. Trust me, I had been avoiding it for so long. But I finally went, and kept going. It is seriously hard work, but when you are ready to put in the effort to be vulnerable and better understand yourself, it can be a transformative experience. I went once a week for 6 months, then twice a week for 3 months, and will continue once a week for however long I need to.

2. **Acupuncture.** I know it might sound fancy or expensive, but if you go to a community acupuncture clinic, each appointment costs $15, which is MORE than worth it if you have disabling anxiety. Plus you get to stay as long as you want. It helped me so much, especially at the beginning when my body was in a constant state of hyperarousal and tension; acupuncture was the only thing that could seriously relax me. [Check to see if you have a community acupuncture clinic close to you.](https://www.pocacoop.com/clinics/) I went twice a week for a month, then once a week for two months, now whenever I feel particularly stressed or feel like I want to indulge in deep relaxation.

3. **Finding something spiritual to ground me.** I'm not going to go into my beliefs, but it was something I was neglecting entirely. Once I had a renewed sense of spiritual presence, my anxiety (though persistent) didn't have as much terrifying weight, because I had more perspective on my existence as a whole. I don't care if it's yoga, stargazing, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, mindfulness, running marathons, or bird watching, but find something that makes you feel connected to living life in a deep, meaningful way. It made my anxiety less important, though of course not any less real.

4. **Being patient with myself.** I never expected myself to get better quickly. It has been 9 months of busting my ass to get to where I am. I've had to allow myself to just accept wherever I am in the process, including being frustrated and exhausted and scared and all that. This might be the most difficult part, especially for little old perfectionist me.

5. **Taking care of myself physically.** I eat whole, delicious foods that make me happy and only drink water and herbal tea. I get about 8 hours of sleep a night. Being consistently physically active (walking, biking, practicing yoga) definitely relieves some anxiety too, but I think it's most effective when done in tandem with other treatments (evidence suggests this, too).

6. **Watching these videos from the [Mindweather101: Navigating Mental and Emotional Distress](http://www.alloflife.org/Our-Classes/) ""class"".** The course is just a series of videos that you can watch whenever you feel like it (and it's free). One of the main ideas is that our brains are always changing. Thus even those of us diagnosed with a ""mental illness"" have brains with the capacity to change. Unfortunately, few mental health practitioners practice with this philosophy, even though there is tons of evidence on neuroplasticity. The class is about working with the attitude that you can recover fully from the mental health issues you are struggling with (like anxiety, but they tend to talk more about severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).

I know that everyone's experience with anxiety is different, but I just wanted to share with you all to celebrate how far I've come and to encourage others to reconceptualize their anxiety as something they can grow past rather than something you always have to suffer with. Thinking about my anxiety with this hope and insight has helped me grow so much without using any pharmacotherapeutic medication. My therapist offered prescription antianxiolytics but I declined and said I would like to try without first. Sure, there have been many times where I wished I had a benzo in my bag to pop in my mouth when my social anxiety seemed unbearable, but I survived without and with a lot of hard work I no longer have that need. I am not saying this intending to make people feel bad for using medications, but I want people to know that *you CAN recover to a point that you no longer need meds*. Getting on meds does not mean you have to depend on them forever. No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, and a lot of patience, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety. I feel less anxious and more joyful than I have in my entire life. I want to help others feel the same way.",50,2013-07-13 06:10:37 EDT-0400

858,"Running ""fixed"" my anxiety.","I know running isn't for everyone, but i swear it fixed me. I'd been on antidepressants my whole adult life, & struggled with extreme anxiety issues since i was a kid. I bounced around from one anti-anxiety med to another & i didn't like any of them, & none of them really worked. They just knocked me out & turned me into a zombie for long enough to calm down.

A few years ago after a terrible breakup I started running. A lot. And i started feeling better & getting over the breakup. And so i ran more. And more. And then one day i realized I'd been so much happier & less stressed lately, & that I hadn't taken or needed any of my meds in months. I guess i'm just burning off all of the extra energy that was building up & making me antsy & anxious, or something? I dunno. I just know it's working. Now I run anywhere from 3 to 10 miles a day (or longer on weekends) whenever possible. And believe me... whenever i have to go a few days without a good run the anxiety does creep back in. I've been off any & all anxiety meds & antidepressants for going on 4 years now.

I'm just putting this here for anyone who's having trouble treating their anxiety or doesn't want to have to take meds long-term...  I feel like running gave me my life back. It won't work for everyone, i'm sure, but i feel like it's worth a shot.",40,2013-07-12 02:50:49 EDT-0400
859,How the HELL do you guys keep a steady job??,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I really need to vent and ask for advice. 

I'm a recent college graduate, just voyaging out into the working world. However, my anxiety and constant self-doubt are really weighing me down. There are two major problems. First, my current job sucks the devil’s ball sack. Second, I’m generally very insecure about my place in the working world. 

Let’s start with the first problem. My employers are incredibly finicky and tend to make the smallest issues into huge catastrophes. For example, someone forgot to water my boss's office plant on Friday, and it wilted a bit over the weekend. MAJOR catastrophe, lots of finger-pointing and ""how did this fall through the cracks? This should be standard procedure!"" type emails. Now every time I get an email, I'm filled with a sense of dread that it's one of my employers, getting on to me about something I screwed up. If they turn such a stupid thing into such a huge deal, I'm terrified of what will happen if I do something seriously wrong (and I already have screwed up several times). A lot of the people in my office tend to be very rude and unsympathetic as well. My boss is a living stereotype: a very materialistic, sharp-tempered, merciless, go-for-the-throat type attorney. Frankly, I’m terrified of her. She sees me as a bumbling idiot (perhaps justifiably), and has no problem showing it. I'm trying to see the humor in the situation (because after all, it is very ridiculous), but I'm too high-strung and paranoid. I’m doing very menial work in a fairly toxic environment, so I don’t intend to stay with this job too long. However, I don’t want to be perceived as a quitter, and some part of me feels like maybe I’m just being entitled, and I should just suck it up. I am young and have relatively little work experience, so maybe this is how I have to pay my dues to enter the working world. 

But in general, I'm just very timid and insecure. I think part of it comes from a deep sense of self-doubt. I don't feel like I'm worthy enough for people to give me money for my services. Therefore, I'm incredibly paranoid about proving my worthlessness by screwing something up. I did very well in school, and rarely ever had these feelings of doubt, but now it’s a totally different ball game. I’m stuck in a rut where I feel guilty that I’m not contributing anything valuable, so I try to overcompensate by being extremely cautious and meticulous, which stresses me out and makes me more prone to screwing up. I’ve seen my coworkers make mistakes and bounce back, completely unshaken. How do they do that?? Whenever I make a mistake a want to curl up in a ball and cry about my incompetence. I’ve been working there about a month, and there’s still so much I don’t know. I can’t imagine how people go to work confident each day, knowing that they can handle anything that comes up. I am so far from feeling confident in this job, and I’d love to hear how other people with anxiety deal with stressful work situations. Thanks for your help! 

TLDR; My job sucks, and I’m very insecure about my performance. How do people gain confidence in their jobs? 

Edit: Wow, thanks so much for the advice and words of wisdom. You guys are the best! :)",51,2013-07-10 18:46:01 EDT-0400

862,EXERCISE!,"After tossing and turning around in bed for a few hours, I saw the wee sun a risin'. Being hopeless and reading articles about fitness/health, I decided to go out and just walk. That's all, just walk. I walked about 3 laps around my small neighborhood and it took about 45 minutes to an hour. It took my mind off all of the problems and paranoia and I felt great at the end. 

There's a huge difference for me between the anxious state and the healthy state, in the anxious state I am very hypersensitive and every little thing connects the dots on a bunch of stuff that's barely even connected to each other. I start to worry. The worry and the anxiety causes little spurts of adrenaline and it upsets my stomach. The cycle continues.

Make a change in your life and try to exercise daily, whether it be by walking or doing a marathon. Do what you find comfortable. I believe you can make the change just like I did and get rid of your anxiety :)",28,2013-07-08 16:24:26 EDT-0400

865,Something that has helped me so much...,"Hi Everyone.  

I'm new to reddit and was actually inspired to join because I wanted to share something that has helped me.  I posted something similar on r/depression as I suffer from both anxiety and depression, but no one's seemed interested so far =).  

I see so many posts about different medications (and I have been on sooo many over the last 10 years) and they've helped me tremendously.  I don't know where I'd be without them.  But I'd like to have a baby so I have been working on trying to either reduce or get off them over the last 6 months.  It's been a nightmare.  Some days I couldn't get out of bed.  My anxiety at work was so bad I couldn't concentrate so I had to keep going back up to my regular dosage.

I'm very luck to have a very forward thinking doctor and he suggested that I try CES.  It's a small machine (little bigger than a cell phone) that you attach to your earlobes, wear some glasses and put on a headset.  You start a program and the light, sound and small (non painful) electrical pulses to your ears all pulse in rhythms to regulate your brain waves.  There are actually a lot of studies on it and it's considered a safe alternative therapy for anxiety and depression.

I don't know if everyone responds well to it (I was the guinea pig for my doctor; he's now trying it on all his patients) but my mood is better, I have energy and drive and I can go to work without teetering on the edge of a panic attack.  And this is with reduced meds!

Anyway, I hope this doesn't come off as an advertisement.  My response to it has just been so drastic and it's helped me so much that I want to make sure people are at least aware of its existence.  It's not cheap (my unit cost about $400) and you should have a doctor who is familiar with it to guide you, but, for me at least, it has been amazing.  I had pretty much given up on the idea of a baby since I figured I was stuck on the medication, but now I have hope again.

If anyone has any questions, please post.  I'm happy to share my story and more details about CES if anyone has any interest.  I've read all the studies I could find =). 

Best of luck to everyone here!",9,2013-07-11 16:01:01 EDT-0400

867,One of my facebook fears has come true. Fuuucckk.,"One of my fears with facebook has always been that I will somehow accidentally end up liking something embarrassing (one of the reasons I never facebook stalk etc.) 

But today, after looking through my profile randomly, I discovered I had, about a month ago, liked an anxiety forum. I immediately went into panic mode, my blood ran completely cold and I felt sick. No-one in my life knows about my anxiety apart from a few very close friends, and I hovered over the little thing that shows who could see that 'like' and it said 'PUBLIC'. Shitshitshitshit. Still, at least I only liked the website, right? Nope. I followed the link and I turns out I somehow accidentally managed to like every single post on a thread on an anxiety forum about someone being afraid because they had a patch of dry skin on their leg and they suffered from hypochrondia.

I quickly unliked every post, but the damage was still done, that had been up for a whole month and I didn't know. I feel totally humiliated. If someone could help me feel better about this, I would be very thankful.

I've been overwhelmed with regret lately, thinking of how different things could have been if I had attacked my problems head on 5, 10, 20 years ago. Anyone else go through this? Thanks in advance for any advice.

EDIT: Thanks for the helpful responses so far. My therapist warned me when we began some months ago about how most people feel worse before they begin to feel better. Maybe it's unusual for it to have taken this long for that to happen, maybe it isn't.

872,My anxiety is jeopardizing my budding career and making life miserable,"I'm a 22-year-old college student (female). I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety order a few years ago but I've had it all my life, usually manifesting as a constant state of worry, ocd tendencies and constant feelings of failure. 

I have a 3.9 GPA on a 4.0 scale, am editor-in-chief of my campus newspaper, am working this summer for a very well known national newspaper and also a small-time community paper. It's my dream to be a journalist but it's so damn stressful. 

No matter how much I realize I need to start writing ASAP, I worry and stress out and procrastinate, and all these feelings compound on top of each other until I'm a curled up heap of nerves. I've made it through the summer okay so far, but I keep finding myself increasingly fucked each week. 
I sometimes wish I had a shit job where nobody would talk to me, like a night janitor or something, so I could do my thing, make money, and pursue my passions on the side. But I'm talented and have a killer resume. Everyone has high hopes for me, including myself, but I'm scared success won't be fulfilling. I fight off nihilistic feelings daily. 

A big part of this anxiety is that I'm scared to death of graduating. This is the last year I'll have any semblance of a childhood. I don't know who I am anymore, much less who I'm going to be. I feel like so much of my identity is based on being a young person, and now that it's time to be a responsible adult, I'm scared of losing who I am. This is a life transition that scares the living shit out of me. 

And finally, to top it off, feeling this way and procrastinating myself into a shit hole every week makes me feel incredibly lazy, irresponsible, and undeserving of the opportunities that have been given to me. I'm so tired of feeling guilty and scared and anxious and like a crappy human in general.

When I found this subreddit, I confess I made many throw away accounts asking questions and looking for support. I always recieved genuine replies, concern, advice and support from people who actually understand.

You all helped me find my own way through my anxiety!

I have good days and bad days, but this subreddit never fails to be forthcoming with support and generosity to a complete stranger on the other side of the globe.

905,I had no idea that what I've been feeling my whole life isn't normal. ,"For as long as I can remember, I've been anxious. You would never know from meeting me though. I'm personable and charming and outgoing and friendly. I'm fortunate enough to have been blessed with art skills, therefore I can get away with being the weird, nervous, arty girl. I've worked my anxiety into my personality, and it works. 

As far back as kindergarten, I was positive I would die if I walked into a classroom after the bell rang, and I would freak myself out so badly that my mom would let me stay home. 

My heart skipped a beat whenever the doorbell rang, and I would hide in the bathroom and spy out the window until they left. Forget about ringing other peoples doorbells, I literally didn't go to a friends house alone until I got a cellphone with texting capabilities so I could text them when I was outside. 

I don't call anyone, I don't walk anywhere unless I can see the path I have to walk, I frequent the same places so I don't get stuck somewhere.
The funny thing is, I love change. I love new places and new experiences, as long as I'm not alone. 

Anytime I get asked out or someone wants to befriend me, I immediately get sick. I don't have many friends, the ones I do have aren't aware of my anxiety. My boyfriend is amazing and super supportive, and my dog is the only thing that can really calm me down. It probably doesn't help that I'm scared of any and all medications. My boyfriend had me try marijuana for the first time last week. We smoked every day for the past week and a half, and I've found it doesn't help anything, it just makes me feel sick and my head hot. 

I've tried talking to my family, but my parents, as great as they are, have their own lives and are unreceptive most of the time. My panic attacks are always quiet and I'm alone so much that no one ever sees them, so it never got brought up while I was living with them. My sister thinks I'm being dramatic and keeps telling me to just ""get over it"" and that I'm just asking for attention. I believed her for a long time. I figured I was just overreacting and that I need to get over it. 

Up until today, I didn't know this was a real disorder. I just thought I was weird. 

I recently got hired at a restaurant. I'm completely capable of waiting tables without freaking out too badly. I hide it well. I'll say something stupid, stumble, drop some silverware, and walk away from a table with my cheeks burning and a death wish in my head, but I can control it on my face. When I get through a table without any triggers, I literally get emotional and have to hold back tears of joy. It's hard, but I thought I could handle another waitressing job. 

Yesterday, the thing that got me was the calendar app on my phone. I set 3 or 4 alarms for each shift so that I show up on time, and the app displays my next shift whenever I check my phone. I'm used to it, which is why this was strange. Every time I looked at my phone, I had a panic attack. Just the simple green box that said ""Server - 3:00"" set me off. As I get closer and closer to 3, I feel worse and worse. 

That's when I found r/anxiety. 

So now, I've been sitting here crying for the past hour, reading through all these posts, because I had no idea that what I'm feeling isn't normal, and that I can potentially do something about it. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still deciding if I can go to work today. I've got 2 hours. Right now, I'd rather just do a no call/no show, and sleep the rest of the day. I texted my mom and told her I'm serious about seeing a doctor, because I can't let this affect my life anymore. I think 22 years is enough. 

In the meantime, I'm glad I found you guys. So, hi, I guess. ",24,2013-01-01 22:57:15 EST-0500
906,50 Ways to Constructively Channel Negative Emotions,"**I found [this](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/50-ways-to-constructively-channel-negative-emotions) on /r/ZenHabits , a SubReddit I think most of the users here could benefit from!**

1. Play an instrument as a way to express yourself through sound.
2. Listen to music that fits your mood (see how to use music to manage your emotions).

3. Paint or draw as a way to express yourself through pictures (see creativity and happiness).

4. Create a personal diary, journal, or blog to keep track of your thoughts, feelings, and experiences (see the power of writing).

5. Dance as a fun way to exercise and release built up negative emotions and stress.

6. Go to the gym or workout (see the connection between physical and mental health).

7. Go some place where you can yell at the top of your lungs (sometimes it can be a helpful release of built up tension).

8. Watch a movie that echoes how you feel and provides a happy or inspirational ending.

9. Do yoga, tai chi, or some other mind-body exercise to release the physical stress behind your emotions.

10. Speak your thoughts and feelings to someone who is willing to listen.

11. Write a short story that focuses on similar thoughts and emotions to what you are experiencing.

12. Donate to a cause that you really believe in.

13. Ask yourself, “What are my emotions trying to tell me?” Often there is a thought process behind what we feel that we can learn from.

14. Learn how to reframe a negative situation in a more positive or productive light (see quick tips for reframing your perspective).

15. Do something kind for someone. Often creating pleasant feelings for others increases our own well-being (get started with one of these 30 acts of kindness).

16. Go out to your local park or a nature preserve. Nature can often help us get outside of our minds and appreciate the world around us more.

17. Photography, find a good place to take pictures. Then look through your set and find 1 or 2 photos that really speak to your current emotions.

18. Go for a drive with no particular destination in mind.

19. Lift weights or hit a punching bag to release stress.

20. Play a stimulating video game.

21. View anxiety or stress as motivators to act, not things that inhibit you (see the hidden power of anxiety).

22. Write a poem or song lyrics about what’s on your mind.

23. Practice a self-love meditation (see improve feelings of self-love in 5 minutes).

24. Try to solve a puzzle. It’ll help occupy your mind with something else, rather than just ruminating over the same problems (see challenge your brain – and other ways to maintain cognitive fitness).

25. Go outside for a light walk to help clear your mind.

26. Reflect on negative experiences and see what you can learn from them (read more at reflection improves learning).

27. Meditate on your thoughts and emotions without being judgmental. Don’t label them as “good” or “bad” – just accept them for what they are.

28. Channel your emotions into a competitive sport, like basketball or football.

29. Consider star gazing as an opportunity to stop and reflect on the bigger things in life (try the sky gazing meditation).

30. Respectfully confront someone who may be responsible for how you feel.

31. Engage in a simple pleasure to remind yourself of the finer things in life (such as a dessert or your favorite TV show).

32. Learn how to take criticism constructively, rather than letting it just get you sad or frustrated (see how to take criticism like a champ).

33. If a negative emotion is motivating you to do something destructive, try doing the exact opposite of what you feel.

34. Read a novel that temporarily takes you into a new world.

35. Join a forum or online support group that shares similar troubles.

36. Use negative relationships in the past as a resource to improve relationships in the future.

37. When reflecting on negative events in your life, try to see how they may have made you a better person. Often these experiences can build resilience in the long-term (psychologist refer to this as post-traumatic growth).

38. Channel your anger or other “high charged” emotions to drive you to be more productive.

39. Make tedious work more fun to help manage boredom or apathy (see blur the line between work and play).

40. Use stress or fatigue as a sign to take a break or enjoy some leisure time (see 50 stress relievers that take 5 minutes or less).

41. Wake up early and watch the sunrise. Learn to appreciate every new day as a clean slate.

42. Label your fears when you experience them and they become easier to face (see labeling negative emotions can help you overcome them).

43. Surround yourself with positive and supporting friends and family who can quickly turn your mood around.

44. Use your emotional energy to create positive affirmations that motivate you to grow and improve (see 75 affirmations for self improvement).

45. Find something to be grateful (see be grateful for your senses).

46. Channel your emotions and write your own daily prayer to help motivate and inspire yourself (see write your own daily prayer).

47. Think about role models in your life who may have overcome similar obstacles (see how we find motivation in other people’s struggles).

48. Use your energy to clean, organize, or redecorate your home or office space.

49. Read some inspirational quotes (see quotes I’ve collected).

50. Indulge in one of life’s simple pleasures (see 50 simple pleasures to brighten your day).",9,2013-01-02 06:09:21 EST-0500

908,Trick I've found to lower my anxiety. ,"I've started to get caught up in a cycle of anxiety again this December.  It has SUCKED because I was riding such a grandeur covered delusional wave for the longest time. I'm a 25 year old male, and this is my first post here. 
Push ups.. Seriously, just did 100 of them and it relieved so much pressure. I don't feel dizzy or lightheaded from the anxiousness.  Right after I was done my heart did pound pretty hard, but I rode through it and the result was a more confident relaxed body.   
I'm in decent shape, so if you can't do that many no big deal.  When our bodies go into that fight or flight mode and nothing happens, that's when we start hyperventilation and the carbon monoxide makes us light headed and what not.  Any physical activity is what your body is waiting for, it's expecting you to do something with the anxiety.  If you can only do 10 that's perfect!  Make sure you really exhaust yourself.  Your body is awaiting a tough strain, it's basically getting you prepped. 
I was working out all the time when the anxiety hit and instead of pushing through it, cutting out caffeine consumption and altering my workout.  I just stopped all physical activity, kept the caffeine and was also trying to stop drinking so much alcohol. It overwhelmed me.  
A personal thing I'd thought I'd share. and as someone who's lived with depression and anxiety my whole life, i just want to thank you for welcoming me into the community. ",20,2013-01-07 05:20:38 EST-0500

910,I think I'm making progress!,"There is a long road ahead and I still have struggles, but I am starting to see some progress. I am seeing it partially in the relationship I have recently officially started. I have a lot of anxiety in general and she hss been VERY patient with me. She finally knows a bit of why I act the way I do and why I get so nervous. Between her being patient and me going to counseling, I have slow become less intimidated by those around me, including her. Now I feel guilty that my fear had me concentrating on her ""flaws"" . But I have come to realize that it was my fear of a relationship and anxiety in general. I now do that less and less, and see her as the beautiful person she is much more. I love to be the man that makes her happy. Even when I had a bit of an attack a week ago. She didn't get irritated with me or force me to talk abiut what was wrong , she just let me know she is here for me. It is amazing what a supportive and positive person can do. I still have some insecurity to deal with and a lot of progress to make, but I'm on the right track. 

The couple of hours between us can be a challenge, but we are making progress. Just wanted to thank /r/anxiety for listening to me vent and providing stories to make me feel more normal and at ease. 

The relationship is going well for me so far. Hope I can keep from messing it up. Just wanted to let /r/anxiety know that it can get better. ",3,2013-01-02 21:52:41 EST-0500

915,[Rant] I feel alone,"I guess I'm not the only one here or anywhere for that matter that's feeling kind of lonely, but I feel like writing this nonetheless. I'll just give a summery of things that make me feel this way.

Firstly, I brought my xbox to my parents' for the holidays and yesterday my brother and I were about to play some games, when he wondered why I only have two accounts (his and mine). I realized that in the years that I have that thing, I've only ever played together with my brother, never with any of my friends.

I lay in my bed last night, after midnight, and I could here a group of neighbours shooting fireworks and talking and laughing and stuff, and I felt jealous. The same feeling came to me when I watched a New Years' concert and people were having fun. The thing is, if I were there, I'd feel very uncomfortable, anxious even, but I really wanted to feel like they felt in that surrounding. 

On the subject of New Years, I didn't get any messages from friends wishing me a happy new year. This probably won't be personal, but of course my mind thinks of the worst scenario, which is that they sent everyone else messages, but not me.

My two best friends gave started dating each other, which is also making me quite jealous. It's made me realize that I want to have a girlfriend, but I don't know how I could ever get a girlfriend if I keep being so anxious. How could I ever go on a date or be intimate with someone when I already feel nervous at my friends'. 

And lastly, [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/14s56g/defriended_on_facebook/), which still bugs me from time to time. ",18,2013-01-01 14:55:00 EST-0500
916,"In 2013, I resolve to face every attack I have head on. No more running from life. ","I've posted a few times here in the past month. I fell for a woman at work, and all my anxiety issues came back to me full swing over the idea of asking her out. Eventually I got the nerve to ask her out a couple times, and we ended up hanging out at the bar for about 4 hours and had a good time. She's ""not really looking to date anyone"". I don't even care. Well I do, but not overly. The whole process has left me full of life and energy and a huge feeling of self. 

I owned up and faced a situation that was giving me my worst anxiety attacks in years. It showed me where my best of friends were. It showed me where my strength was. That I can still conquer myself and that there's a lot of life yet to see. 

I am re-invigorated and re-awakened as of this month. The next year of life is going to be full of fight. I'm going to own every day of it, and take back my own damn life again. 27 is far too fucking young to quit, and just sounds like the perfect time to conquer the world.",4,2013-01-01 06:44:49 EST-0500
917,"Worried about sleeping, so you can't sleep, so you worry more about sleeping, meaning you still can't sleep. How do you break the cycle?","I'm working away from home. I've been out here for nearly 4 months. 2 more to go. However, recently I've started to have this problem. I had it back when I was 16/17. It's insomnia mixed with anxiety. 

Even just thinking about the run up to bed time makes me anxious. I suffered for 2 years through my college days (British) but it eventually left me. I know it's probably going to go again once I get back home because then I'll feel... well, at home.

One of my worst fears was laying awake in bed all night for 8 hours. this happened to me about a month back just before my first day actually at work, and since then it's just been torture when 8pm rolls around and I have to start thinking about bed.

My night routine is lay in bed around 10/10.30. Read until about 12. Sleep (hopefully) Then rise at 7 for work.

I worry I won't get enough sleep for the next day, even though I've done that day with no sleep. I worry about the effects on my health etc. fucking etc.

Any suggestions would be fantastic. Though mentally I'm able to laugh at this at night and say to myself it's only 2 months, but I'd still like the problem to go.

918,"[Help] How do I trust therapists again, after they were responsible for traumatizing me in the first place? ","My parents were really despeate to help me become healthy. I was agoraphobic at the time and after talking too a bunch of therapists with different titles they sent me to the hospital for testing. Completely unannounced and without telling me. I went into shock because of this. When I went back home, I went back into shock and went into a fit of rage and went sent in a psych ward. I suffered a lot of crazy, bat-shit things that I think a weaker person would have killed themselves over by now. I am not listing these specific abuses. But it was probably ""Classic PTSD"" because I was in danger of being assaulted, and being abused by workers and the other patients. 

After I got out of the hospital I tried to get help. My occupational therapist quit on me. I was getting help from a home care agency but I quit that too because there was no plan inplace so thigns didn't work out. It made me worse off because i became too dependant on workers to help me. I predicted this but no one would listen to me.

Anyways. It's to the point now where my gum line is receeding and I'm afarid that I am going to lose my goddamn teeth in a few years. I've been sick for a year or longer with as inus infection. I can't go to the hospital for testing without going into severe anxiety maybe ptsd. I want to get therapy done because there's someone who does EDMR therapy here. But I can not fucking trust therapists anymore because I'm actually traumatized *from* therapy in the first place.

tl;dr: I'm trauamtized from therapy. I want to see a new therapist but I can not work up enough courage. How do I trust therapists again after they literally caused me to get PTSD and be in a situation where I was almost assaulted and had to suffer a lot of abuse. ",10,2013-01-04 15:30:37 EST-0500

I don't want this to get worse and I really want to live a normal life again. Everyday I'm going to take it slowly. One step at a time, day by day. Its scary, but I know deep down its much scarier in my mind. I don't want to be my own fear. Theres so much in the world and so much to experience. I want to find myself again. To enjoy past hobbies and going outside and breathing fresh air everyday. The world is so huge that it can feel like it can be too much to handle. We need to remember that everyone lives their own lives and we all struggle to some degree. Its ok to be scared and not know what to do or how to handle situations. The first step is to just push yourself just a little and then keep adding on. I know I can do this and I'm ready to take as much time as possible to get me back out there. Slow progress is still progress. You can do it as well if you're in a similar situation as I am. You may need help and motivation from other people and thats fine.
At the end of the day, its just you. Spend your time doing what you love because that's all that matter.


**Edit**: I managed to go outside for a while today. It honestly felt strange. I felt anxious, I was worried about people seeing me. After a while, I was more comfortable. Maybe I felt ok because I haven't been outside since the winter and it is very warm out now. It was nice. Tomorrow I will try to push myself to go for a walk around the block.

942,Use deep pressure to calm yourself when anxious or upset like after a bad day or before a job interview! (X-post from LPT),"I started telling people about this in the comments of a different thread, but though I'd post here for all to possibly benefit from it.
Deep pressure is often used for individuals with autism or behaviour problems to help calm themselves. This can be from a weighted blanket or vest for example. However, it something that we all can use!
Pressure sends signals to your brain that help it regulate and calm down. Love the feeling of being under a heavy blanket or a great hug? That's why!
Some great ways to incorporate it are crawling under a heavy blanket, rubbing someone firmly on the back or arm, carrying heavy objects/backpack, or even pressing your feet down into the floor (great when in a waiting room to help you focus before an important meeting).

Here is the LPT thread, the comments have other ways to get deep pressure.

Now, I'd love to tell people about this. I have lots of people who try and help me, specifically my mom, but they say these things all the goddamned time, no matter how much I tell them it hurts.

And then, it's followed up by ""Why are you getting so angry? I'm just trying to help. I'm on your side."" or something of that nature. Now I can't fucking explain myself, because if I do they're just trying to help, and I'm just being an asshole or something. Then it's inevitably followed up by the ""Well when you get angry at me, I feel like I can't say anything or help "" AS THOUGH THAT FUCKING EQUATES TO WHAT I'M FEELING. 

And you know what, these people aren't bad. I know that. They are, after all, just trying to help, but what really hurts me is when they ignore my pleas for them to stop saying things like that to me, then complain about how they're ""Walking on eggshells!"" around me, all because I don't want them to remind me of my inefficiencies as a human being. 

These are people who don't get it. They've never felt like they were overwhelmed with life and anxiety, so they can't POSSIBLY FUCKING IMAGINE how anyone else could be. It just blows my goddamned mind that even after being TOLD that they are being giant flaming doucheballoons, they still continue ""trying to help!"". 

And you know what, I try and be nice. I try and explain why I feel the way I do, and then get immediately interrupted by ""OH YEAH I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY I GET SCARED SOMETIMES YOU SHOULD JUST STOP BEING SO SCARED AND DO THINGS"". It's frustrating. 

More so frustrating when you get the person who tells you exactly what you know. ""You really have to do your schoolwork. I know it's boring, but you really just have to power through it.""

I. FUCKING. KNOW. THIS. I. FUCKING. CAN'T. 

""I shouldn't be forbidden from saying a phrase""

IT'S COMMON FUCKING COURTESY. Just be mindful of the goddamned problems other people have! It's not incredibly difficult - just please, oh please, don't ask me why I feel the way I do. If I knew that, I WOULDN'T HAVE ANXIETY. 

How do you get it through these people's thick fucking skulls that I really don't like to be reminded of my problems by being told what my problems are and how ""easy"" they are to fix.

And the most important, I've lost 30 lbs, my cholesterol dropped to within the normal range, and I went from being diagnosed with pre-diabetes to having my A1C levels within normal range.

When people hang out with me they always comment on how I'm not really there. I can never enjoy what I'm actually doing without also thinking of some worry in the future, whether it be like a hypochondriac worry or nervous about something in the soon or far future.

  I feel like my internal life is just bouncing from worry to worry and this is a miserable way to live. The last 6 months I was always worried I contracted HIV in the back of my mind whatever I was doing. I finally made myself get tested and it was negative yet I just found something else in my body to worry about. No amount of rationalizing make my worries go away, and since I'm only 19 I'm really scared this will be the rest of my life and I'll never be able to enjoy life.

959,Life is fucking weird.,"I'm having difficulty coping with the fact that I exist and will eventually die. Everything to me is so indescribably complex that I feel I have a responsibility as a human being to try to understand as much of this system as possible. While life is an experience I am grateful to have, it is causing me a great deal of anxiety. Basically what's been happening lately is I've been imagining Earth as an organic spaceship hurtling through space. Then I realize that I am a part of earth and by extension, the universe itself. These thoughts lead me to recognize the now cliche idea that I come from stardust, ""I"" am just otherwise unconscious atoms arranged in a particular order, the boundary between myself and everything else is an illusion, time as we know it is a human construct, and that I don't really exist. It's at this point where I kind of forget how to do things that should be automatic such as breathe, swallow, or walk and suddenly become aware of all my bodily processes that I do not control (kinda like that old 4chan copypasta). As you can probably imagine, these thoughts and sensations are amplified when smoking certain strains of cannabis. 

Isn't it strange how the only thing I've ever really been familiar with (myself, this world, this body) is causing me so much anxiety? Yet at the same time I am grateful to have these thoughts and question reality, which unfortunately is not the case for many people. I'm grateful to feel this obvious connection to the universe even though it gets scary at times. Now that you've gotten a glimpse at my perspective on things you can probably imagine that I have a bit of trouble functioning in society. I find it hard to convince myself to go to work to sell people expensive shit they don't need so I can buy expensive shit I don't need. I'm unsettled by the fact that I'm trading hours of my life for money. Sure, I could easily say ""fuck it"" and quit my job, go join a commune, and live off the grid, but I have become too accustomed to modern comforts. I want too much and I enjoy material goods (like my $600 phone that I'm typing this on) but I realize what I have and what I want are completely worthless in the long run. My friend who is really into meditation has told me that my wants are too small, which I agree with wholeheartedly.  

I think that life is too beautiful and too strange to waste time on pursuing capital. But what do I know? I am just another directionless 18 year old asking unanswerable questions while attempting to function in a sick society. I hope others are out there who have had a similar perspective on life that are willing to offer some guidance. 

Damn, that was long. I love the internet and the fact that I can share my discontent with strangers around the world. ",41,2013-06-22 17:46:13 EDT-0400

What's worse is that none of these comments were intended to be 'serious' - rather, it's a running joke or assumption among the people that know me.

I don't perceive myself as timid or weak, but clearly other people do. My anxiety usually resurfaces when I worry about the opinions of others, and after the last week, I am particularly paranoid when interacting with social groups.

962,Finally went to get help and the doctor made me feel like and idiot.,"I've struggled with agoraphobia for 8 years, I've never been able to afford health insurance and to be honest I've been so embarrassed I never attempted to get help. A week ago I felt like I was having a heart attack, went to the ER and was told I have panic disorder by the ER dr. Was instructed to go to their walk in office and see a regular DR. I finally got up the courage to go. I was terrified but for the first time in a long time filled with hope. I was finally making the first step to bettering my life. I told the dr everything and he told me ""borrow money from family and see a psychiatrist"" I explained that the closest one is 45 minutes away and I have panic attacks in cars. He said, verbatim, ""suck it up, agoraphobia isn't that bad, one of the main characters from the sopranos had it, and got help"" I feel like he belittled my problem and then compared it to a fictional character. (I've never seen the show so I don't know what he's talking about) I told him that I had a son and he tells me it's not fair to my son that I don't leave the house and he's sure my son would like to go to a park or something. I know this and beat myself up daily about it. He asks if I'm going to go to the ER every time I panic when I told him a few times I didn't know I was panicking. I left the place in tears and all he gave me was ""get help, good luck."" I feel like all this was a direct kick in the face. Idk where I was going with this. I just wanted to tell someone.

963,Stress of picking up an ativan Rx is just the *worst*...,"First, I've had the same (1-2mg/day lorazepam as needed) Rx since about 1998, and never had any issues abusing or misusing it. 

However, every time I pick it up at the pharmacy I feel I'm treated with suspicion. I keep getting asked these questions about why I'm taking it, whether I'm using it for the right reasons, and how many pills are left. I come to pick it up and the person at the counter sees a note and says the dreaded ""the pharmacist would like to talk to you first"". 

I have other prescriptions and never get these questions. It's a public place and it's incredibly stressful and embarrassing. I end up leaving feeling like I'm getting away with something or doing something wrong. It really feels like I'm being harassed for refilling a totally legitimate prescription. 

Any wise words?

Now its all over! I wish I could say that my years in uni were amazing and I made loads of friends but they weren't and I didn't. Honestly I'm just so glad its over. I didn't realise how much it was affecting me and how much of my anxiety was being caused by uni until the end of my second year. I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted, not completely but I feel like I can breathe again and the intense guilt and feelings of worthlessness are gone.

971,How I deal with my Generalized Anxiety without drugs,"I have had Anxiety issues for my whole life, my dad gets it, my mother gets it and so does my nan and granddad. It's very much in my genes. 

When my problem started to get bad, around 16/17 (I am 22 this year) I was having a terrible time. I looked on the internet and that seemed to make it worse, everything would set it off. I realised it's just a bad thought pattern, I would worry about something and go around in circles in my mind over and over whilst the anxious feeling would get stronger. So I said to myself I have to break those thought circles... As soon as a negative thought would come up I chose to ignore it, move on to a different thought. At first this was hard... I was basically reprogramming how I thought but after a few weeks of this my problems basically disappeared. I started smoking weed a lot more with friends and just having a good time, something I would never have been able to do. 
Why am I posting here if I am over my problems? well to be honest anxiety is something that will never go, you just have to learn to deal with it. Occasional I will slip back into that bad pattern of thinking but it is nothing like it was. I hope that my story helps some people who think they are stuck with anxiety.

Problem is, life is fucked up, weird and things don't always go the way we want them too. But I feel like in that, life is beautiful, and sometimes we need to wade through the shit. I'm an anxiety sufferer myself. I've recently decided to move to Los Angeles with my girlfriend whom I love very much. I've been kind of a dick to her lately though, as she's just as nervous as I am. I grew up wanting to make people laugh and do comedy, voice acting, commercials, etc. I've decided I'm gonna do that now, and of course anxiety starts to creep back into my life. I think the best thing to do is embrace the shit out of it. I'm never gonna eliminate anxiety altogether, and I've accepted that. Sometimes it's worse than others, and I think it's really interesting how all of our brains work. We can comfort each other and do all the research in the world, but once we get something in our mind, it's set. It's such an amazing and dumb train of thought. I hope all of you start to feel better soon, I really do. I look at this subreddit, and google searches, and the stuff/medicine out there for all of us, and it kind of pisses me off that people are making so much money off of us. If it helps, fine. But I see so many people on here writing about how something they're trying or have tried isn't working, and my heart goes out to them. I suppose I'm just anxious myself about this move in July.

981,"I've failed out of school, I have no idea how to learn like a normal person, I can't follow through with anything, I hide and break down every day[rant]","I never did well in school, I barely scraped by in highschool and after almost failing my first semester in college, I was assaulted on campus and used that as an excuse to stop going and I failed the next three. I had to come home and went to community college, but I failed there too. I'm scared to tell my parents, I already have a sister on disability for her mental problems and they're still half supporting her. I'm supposed to be the normal one, I'm supposed to be smart, I'm supposed to be able to support myself.

I get sick to my stomach as soon as I'm presented with learning material. I don't know how to ask for help. Beyond learning, I can't seem to follow through with anything in life because thinking about taking any steps forward makes me sick to my stomach, I start panicking and hyperventilate. 

I've been pretending to go to class for over a year, but instead I just sit in my car and have breakdowns.

I told my parents I'd pay for my community college classes, and the ones I failed out of I am still in debt for because I barely make enough to make payments at my job. I want to go back, but I can't afford it yet and I'm scared I'll fail out again. I don't think I can get a loan, my credit is probably already horrible.

I don't know how to tell my parents what's going on, I don't want them to treat me like they treated my sister, she went insane when they put her on anti-depressants. I spent most of my youth with a padlock on my bedroom door because she would steal from me and sometimes she got violent (She never hurt me, but did dislocate my mother's jaw, and they fist fought. I always held my mother after these fights and promised not to dissapoint her)

I have no friends. I go to a therapist sometimes for the assault situation but I don't like going because being there just reminds me of what happened. 

I want to find proper help, but I can't afford it, and I'm scared of medications. I'm scared to ask my parents, I don't think they can go through this again. They've said so before.

While fictional, I think this has a lot of parallels to what we face with anxiety disorders. For myself personally at least, I constantly worry about my anxiety. That's right: I worry about being worried.

How (objectively) ridiculous is that?

But I think the key is to understand and then accept that I'll likely have some amount of anxiety for the rest of my life, I'll probably always be bothered by X Y or Z trigger. But I can minimize its significance and thus its impact if I just accept these as things that happen in my life, just like any other routine event. 

So, like the Hulk, acceptance is at least half the battle.

I freak out sometimes because we get cussed out by customers. Among general stress.
I decided to tell my boss about my panic attacks, so that worst case scenario, I could get a couple of minutes to calm down and get my head back in the game.
Well, he kept on saying today (after I told him), things like (while I was washing the dishes), ""Don't go having a panic over washing dishes.""
He laughed about it, I awkwardly laughed.
He's not from the US, and is kinda not with the social norms of a lot of stuff. He says a lot of inappropriate stuff. But usually it's nbd.
But this is something that is really personal and really embarrassing for me. I mean, it feels like I can't cope with life sometimes.
 
Anywho, How do I bring up such a touchy subject without sending myself into a panic attack? What should I say to him? How should I say it so I don't get in trouble?

994,"Hopefully this gets someones attention - defeated anxiety sufferer, seeking advice.","I was diagnosed with anxiety discorder and depression approximately six years ago, I just turned 19 in December last year. It was from being bullied quite terribly to the point where I didn't eat/sleep/leave the house or leave my bed for that matter. I was in a relationship for two years, and he was amazing with the anxiety and panic attacks, at one point we were so serious we moved in together and at that time I was dealing with at minimum four panic attacks a day. 

After our relationship ended, I was the lowest I had ever felt and decided to finally seek treatment for this disorder, unfortunately no one around me really understood what I was going through, I wish I had reddit at the time to maybe do something like this, better late then never though I hope. So after almost a year of server therapy (which is by the way the hardest thing I ever did and ever will do) I finally stopped being anxious all the time, getting panic attacks, 99% of my social anxiety was gone, I was the most strong I'd ever felt, it sucked that because my friends didn't understand what anxiety really did to me and my mind it wasn't as celebrated as I expected it to be, anyway I should've been doing everything I couldn't do whilst I was dealing with this disorder, but my ex was leading me on for this entire time and the other week all of a sudden he stopped all communication and also started saying really mean things to me about anxiety too, this coming from the person two weeks ago that said ""I love you I want to be with you for the rest of my life."" 

Basically since then anxiety has come roaring back into my life, I'm feeling uneasy all the time, I keep feeling like I need to ground myself or grab onto something, I'm shaky and definitely dealing with a lot of anxiety related thoughts/pains. I'm also feeling pretty defeated to be honest, I mean I thought it was over, but I guess because he was my comfort zone and he was supposed to be there, anxiety is the only other form of comfort I have. 

I apologise for the length but if anyone is feeling bored and wants to give some advice, anything like that is appreciated because really right now all I feel is lost and I don't feel like I'm strong enough to get through it all over again.

I have been suffering from anxiety since I was 8 years old. I was in therapy for about 8 years and finally got my anxiety under control so I stopped therapy. 2 years ago I started abusing alcohol, and about a year ago I had a panic attack that landed me in the ER and was diagnosed with hypertension. Ever since that day my anxiety has come back ten fold. It is almost debilitating and has manifested itself in ALOT of physical symptoms. I am constantly in a brain fog and feel light headed, I have extreme exhaustion and nausea almost everyday and I feel like my body is shutting down. It is beginning to really effect my relationships (I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend) and I am terrified that my boyfriend will get fed up with the fact that I feel ill all the time and leave me. I was wondering if anyone else has felt this way (especially with the physical symptoms) I am trying to see a doctor but no one is getting back to me soon enough and I am really terrified that I will go to sleep and not wake up one day.

Thank you again!!!
P.S. Please feel free to forward on the survey link, the higher the amount of responses and the more varied the participants the more robust my research findings will be. Also please complete the full survey once you have started or the information will be lost!

1011,I didn't think this day would ever come.,"I just found this subreddit and really regret not looking earlier, but something amazing happened today and even though you're all strangers, I know you can relate and I need to share it.

I've been dealing with anxiety for just over 5 years now. Pretty much restricted to health anxiety and panic attacks about dying suddenly. It has been getting a lot better in the last couple years but every time I have a panic attack it feels like I'll never get better. But today showed me that not only is it possible, it's happening.

I had a tooth extracted today. I was very nervous about it, about the procedure for sure, but mostly for the aftercare. Taking a new medication has always been a massive trigger for me, especially ones that have noticeable effects. And I knew I would need and be prescribed Tylenol 3s. Last time I took them (also dental I think) I had a massive panic attack and probably ended up at the emergency room feeling like an idiot as usual. [I live alone and everyone I love lives almost 5000km away so my panic attacks would generally end up in the ER since I have no one else to calm me down).

So this morning the extraction went way better than they expected. Took only a few minutes and didn't need to cut my gums or anything. I decided not to take a Clonazepam (I take as needed and very rarely now) and try to tough it out. It was tough, but when it finished so quickly I was so relieved. Then I was off to the pharmacy for those dreaded Tylenol 3s...

It's now almost 10 hours later and I have NOT had a panic attack. I have just been chilling on the couch all day, watching tv and playing videogames. There has been some minor anxiety when I take each pill but I've been able to brush it off and I am almost in disbelief. 

A big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety. This is the first time since that I've dealt with something like this as a normal person and not someone who thought she was going to be found in two weeks cold and dead on the floor. I definitely feel the effects of the tylenol 3s, but it isn't scaring me like I expected or like it used to.

I don't even know what to say really. I feel like I passed through some important stage without really realizing it and now I can look back at my old self and all those hospital visits and know it can get better. I just needed to share this with someone. Thank you all so much for reading a stranger's revelation :)",5,2013-05-28 06:29:00 EDT-0400

1016,My personal steps for overcoming anxiety.,"Hey folks. I have physical anxiety. For the past few months it had been almost non-existent, but it's back in force again after a panic attack I had last week. My body is out of equilibrium, which has caused a lot of episodes of panic, as well as extreme fatigue, brain fog, wanting to cry my eyes out, etc. I've overcome this once before, though, without medications. In fact, I was prescribed Hydroxyzine today, took 5 mg and felt even more brain fog and nervousness. I snapped out of it, but the symptoms are still lingering. I feel compelled to share what helped me get through this last time, because this time I was too quick to jump to meds. 

-- Try to help solve someone else's problem: The worst times of anxiety are when you feel like you can't escape your own head. The entire universe feels like it exists between your ears--that's the number one way I'll describe it with people. If you have a friend you think is going through something, talk to them. Not only do you distract your brain from anxiety, but you also feel good and sharp. 

-- Do something creative: Graphic design was always my niche. Whenever I'm doodling my mind relaxes and focuses. Just like with talking to people, whenever you can do something highly functional with your own mind, you realize how much of it is still really there. Sometimes I'll do this for hours, and the results make me so proud that I get focused on that--not my anxiety.

-- DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS: I cannot stress this enough. The first few things that will pop up on any google search are usually worst-case scenarios. When I first had anxiety I had neck and head pressure, scalp burning, vertigo, diziness, panic attacks, etc. The first thing that came up on Google search was some guy thinking he had some unknown disease...he let it ruin his life. Every. Symptom. I had. I freaked the fuck out. Turns out, these people are simply hypochondriacs who have failed to deal with their problems constructively. You can convince yourself of having anything if you try hard enough. Nothing is more reassuring than seeing a medical professional and having them simply smile at you sand say, ""You've got anxiety. It's tough, but it's not the end of the world. Stay calm."" Whenever I feel compelled to google my symptoms I remind myself of how my doctors have shared laughs with me during discussions--reassuring that what I have is temporary and can be dealt with. 

-- Talk to yourself. Or be funny: I've been blessed with a pretty joking personality. A lot of times, if I'm driving and feeling anxious, I'll just start making really stupid, ambiguous noises. Ironic, because it would appear to the people on the outside that I'm losing my mind, but in the end it helps me remind myself I'm still here. 

-- Exercise: One of the best things I ever did was start a daily walk/jog up and down the mountain next to my house. Giving your body somewhere else to dispose of energy makes a huge difference!

-- Eat right: Tuna, blue berries, bananas, non-fried chicken, rice, cereals and trail mix. Chocolate is actually decent too. Avoid excess caffeine. 

-- Whatever anyone says, don't drink or smoke: This may be controversial, but both of my bad anxiety episodes were sparked by substance abuse. First it was alcohol, then it was marijauna. Both caused panic attacks for me. 

-- Sleep schedule! 

-- Herbal tea: Kava seems to help my body relax at night. 

-- Sing: I do karaoke twice a week. When I do karaoke, my anxiety is gone. Singing is fun, and again helps get the mind out of the funky zone. 

-- Talk to friends about it. Get your anxiety in the open. Not being open about your anxiety can actually make you feel more stuck in your own head, which causes more stress. 

-- Remember, you're fine. There's a lot of people out there who have terminal diseases. Yours is not one of them.",14,2013-05-22 09:38:14 EDT-0400

I've learned to deal with panic attacks but I never realized how pathetic I looked and sounded while experiencing it. My friends must think I'm the biggest loser on earth. 

Just thought I'd share because I need someone to talk to but I'm not going to tell anyone I know how I cry like a baby when I'm having a panic attack.",15,2013-05-25 15:31:51 EDT-0400

It makes me feel completely isolated and like the whole world wants me to fail and be miserable. It's like being afraid all the time even though nothing is wrong. It makes me feel like I need to find a way to get my head out of the real world or else I'm going to have a melt down and what's even more scary is I don't know what that melt down would consist of. It's like a black sludge surfacing in the middle of my spine a d spreading across my chest and wrapping around my lungs and then my heart and then squeezing them both while whispering to my brain ""you're a terrible person and no one loves you. You don't deserve to be happy. Everything you've ever done wrong in your life will catch up to you and bury you. You're going to die, cold and alone, just like your fucking father."" now. Now can you get why I don't talk when I'm feeling that way?

1022,Any artists with anxiety?,"Never posted on here before, so here it goes.

I came to a recent realization after having another panic attack that Anxiety is well and truly taking over my life. I'm going to start getting some help with it soon, but in the mean time I was wondering if anyone was in a similar position...

Basically I'm a recent uni graduate and it's my ambition to become an artist and tell stories. However, ever since I was a teenager, I have had the hardest time trying to draw or even pick up the pencil to begin drawing. 
Sounds silly I know, but I instantly start worrying about failing as an artist, whether I'm doing it right, what others will think etc. I know a lot of artists or people in the creative industry get this anyway, but it has got to a point now where I can't progress as an artist. I feel too ashamed of the standard of my work to apply for jobs, and even when I find the motivation I start putting myself down.

Sorry if I'm not explaining too well, but are there any other artists out there who experience something similar? If so, how do you try to overcome it?",18,2013-05-22 21:53:04 EDT-0400

1024,Had so much anxiety recently that I had to go to the emergency room for chest pains. Psychiatrist won't help me,"Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere.  Right now I'm thinking I'm being monitored by my neighbours so typing this is very embarassing, but screw it.  Every single day when I hear them come down the stairs of the building I feel like they're gonna break down the door and kill me (or at least beat me up and rob me).  I have a walking stick I have to use sometimes and I like having it near me, in case I need a weapon to defend myself.
 
Going outdoors is terrifying.  I'm better at doing it before, but it's actually getting harder and harder each time.  I have to prepare by meditating, again for longer and longer each time, and checking myself in several mirrors to make sure I'm not hallucinating that I've put clothes on and they're actually there, and my zipper is done up, and I even sometimes take photos of myself.  Then when I actually go outside I hear constant laughter, and I don't know whether that's a hallucination, or just misinterpreting real people's laughter, but it's like being paraded down the street as a huge laughing stock, and because I can never work out exactly why everybody is laughing and staring I get anxiety attacks and have to run into shops or bars to hide.  Whern walking past someone on the sidewalk I very often stumble because my legs tense up or something and get weak, and that's embarassing.  I can't urinate in public bathrooms anymore.  I used to be fine if I went in the stall but even that I can't do anymore cos I think people can see through the walls.  So I have to either be dehydrated or have a painful bladder.

Every single noise scares me when I'm in my apartment.  I can hear people laughing from the street outside and I'm convinced it's cos they can see inside my apartment, so I've been blocking up the windows with sheets of thick paper and making sure the curtains are fully closed, and it's pretty dark in here now but it helps a bit.  I'm constantly being observed and filmed wherever I am, which is pretty annoying. 

I've apparently been really really tense recently because I had to go to the emergency room for chest pains and tightness and uncontrollably fast breathing.  There's nothing wrong with my heart and they think it's chest muscle strain.  But every time I feel pain in my chest I get very worried it's a heart attack and I sometimes try not eating for a day or something so I have a lower chance of it, or something.

I guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?  I'd rather not have more and more pills as I already take loads every day anyway, but they'd be better than drinking in the morning before I leave my apartment, which is the only thing that helps at the moment.  But my psychiatrist doesn't seem to care about it, or address it, and I've asked him directly about it.  I've never not had social anxiety to an extent, so it's a separate thing from the schizophrenia.  No anti-psychotic has ever got rid of my symptoms, just got rid of some of the anxiety from them, but I've never been good at going outside, sometimes going days without food because I run out and am too scared to buy any.

I doubt anyone has read this far but if you have, thank you.  I needed to write this all down even if I didn't post it here, because it makes it easier somehow.  Of course I've had to type it with my wireless off so my neighbours can't access it, and then very quickly post it.  Of course they can still read my thoughts so that doesn't help much I guess.

1031,My e-mail sent to a Psychology teacher at the high school I went to who said Anxiety isn't a disorder but something people just need to get over...,"It has come to my attention that in one of your classes you said that anxiety isn't a real disorder and it's something people need to get over. Now I hope this is a misquote, because there were probably more than one person in your class that suffers from Anxiety, and because of that statement were left feeling like there is no hope or fix. It is common knowledge that Anxiety is a mental illness and I emphasize illness. As someone who has suffered from this illness for ten years, I am appalled that that this rumour is going around. Along with Anxiety comes depression and we should be teaching that there is a fix, you can get better, it's not just something you get over. If you believe this to be true I will happily show you studies as well as friends of mine who are sick with the illness as well. I know you, and I am not putting words in your mouth, but it was brought to my attention and I was really upset about it. If I would have been in your class, and have heard that, I would have felt hopeless, especially if this class was a psychology class. I am sorry if this is all untrue but I just have felt uneasy since it was brought to my attention. I think Anxiety is an epidemic throughout the school system and needs to be seen as an illness, not some negative stigma. I would be glad to talk to you about this in person or anyone who needs someone to talk to. Like I said, I hope it was a misquote but I just want kids/young adults to feel safe and comfortable with the person they are, and not be told to get over it.

1033,Is it normal to feel as though your anxiety and problems are entirely unique to YOU and that everyone else is experiencing something different?,"I have always felt that whenever I have a bad experience that I am experiencing something worse than what others do. For instance if a friend doesn't message me back on Facebook or I have an awkward exchange with someone, or in general a bad experience, I always feel as though this experience would only happen to me. and only me. I know that other people suffer from anxiety, depression, loneliness, and mad thoughts that even lead some to suicide, but my negative experience is some how separate then these. I logically know that this is most likely untrue, and that I am experiencing the same feelings that everyone else is, yet I feel mine is worse and I don't have anyway of know exactly how other people feel.

Anyone else feel this way? I've never heard it talked about on this subreddit, or even in years of therapy talking with my psychologist. I have extreme low self confidence which I think might be the cause.

1034,Does anybody else feel that they are more sensitive people in general than most others?,"Now that I've found a good medicine, I have made a lot of improvement, I've stopped having panic attacks. But I still find that I am sensitive to things that really don't get to others. For example, today I watched the Hunger Games movie with my family. But afterwards, I'm sort of in a mild depression. Thinking about the violence and unfortunate lives of the people in the movie just sorta got to me. And the other day, I had to get up and walk away when the family had Dr. Phil on because it was giving me anxiety thinking about how dire the situation was for this guy who drinks too much and all the stress he and his family was going through. My parents found it surprising that a story about a drunk person would be stressful to hear about at all.

My whole life I've been more sensitive of a person than others. Is this a common trait to those with anxiety/depression problems? Is there some way to become less sensitive?",32,2013-11-28 05:29:38 EST-0500

> You can still relax with your inbox being full.

> In fact, it'll never be empty. If you don't do it, somebody else will.

> Slow down. Take deep breaths.

> No point in living in the future. No fear in the now.

> Enjoy the little things. They're bigger than you think.

> In 100 years... All new people.

> At least you don't have to travel like some jobs do.

> Count your blessings.

> If a hardened, starving kid in India could know what you were feeling, what would he think? All of your luxuries, opportunities, and fortunes... compared to his reality. It's happening somewhere.

> Others have it worse than you. Be grateful for what you have.

> The gauntlet makes you stronger.

> It's not the load that brings you down... It's how you carry it.

> Put the ball in someone else's court.

It's what I look at when I'm experience an anxiety episode induced either by work stress, or my hypochondria.

It helps me regain my perspective. A lot of these are thought-terminating cliches, which are effective in helping, well, terminating thoughts. Including anxious ones.

These are little phrases and sayings that mean something to me and have an impact on me, but maybe for you it's something else.

1040,Goddammit. Apparently I've wasted half my life obsessing over something that was never true.,"I was born with a heart defect. It's fairly common and is usually corrected with surgery when kids are like 3-6 years old. Mine was discovered when I was 15. I had just moved and needed a sports physical to play volleyball. All throughout middle school I did volleyball, swimming, and track, so I had done plenty of physicals in the past and never thought there would be a problem.

The new doctor heard a murmur. Since that was the first we had heard of it, I was sent to a specialist to get an ultrasound done. My doctor came back and said there was a hole in my heart and it was large enough that I needed to get surgery or my heart would wear out and I would die when I was 30. Obviously, I opted for the surgery. Even though I had it done, I couldn't get the ""die at 30"" thing out of my head. I have always known it wasn't rational, and as much as I knew nothing bad would happen at 30, I've always been extremely afraid of getting that old.

My last echo was done when I was 18, to make sure everything was good. They said everything looked perfect, but to get checked out every 10 years or so just in case. I haven't had any real problems, but I do get palpitations and my feet go numb when I'm having a panic attack.

Well, I'm 28 now so it was time to go again. Yesterday I went to a cardiologist for the first time in a decade and had told him all about the surgery, how it was caught late, etc. I told him about what happens during panic attacks and he didn't really seem concerned (in a good way. I don't mean that like he was cold and unfeeling about it).

Then I mentioned the ""surgery or die at 30"" thing. He looked at me and said ""they really told you that?"" He went on to say that people with defects like mine DO have a decreased life expectancy, but it's normally like 50-60 if they don't get fixed, and IF my defect was bad enough to make me die at 30, there's no way I would have been doing sports because my heart would not have been able to keep up the necessary blood flow. He assured me that since it got fixed, my life expectancy is pretty much normal. 

I can't even put into words how frustrating it is that I've been absurdly anxious about turning 30 for nearly half of my life, and not only is it not an issue since I had the surgery, but it wasn't even a true statement in the first place.

I'm pretty sure that all of the time I've spent stressing about dying early did more damage to my heart than the defect ever could have.",7,2013-11-23 00:09:21 EST-0500
1041,Sometimes feel on the verge of a heart attack all day.,"Hi /r/anxiety.  I'm looking for advice/guidance from others who have felt this way and have found a way to manage it.

Every so often - sometimes 2 days a week or sometimes only one day every 2 weeks - out of nowhere I will feel constantly anxious. I'm currently experiencing it.  I wouldn't call it a panic attack because I don't feel frozen or like I'm panicking.  I feel like I can still think clearly enough... from the descriptions I've read of people's panic attacks I don't think I've ever experienced one.  

Basically when I get this way, my throat hurts, my stomach is painfully clenched, and I feel this uncomfortable buzzing in my head and body non-stop all day long.  When I get this way, no distractions make it stop, no amount of rational thinking makes it stop.  Like right now, I have nothing in the foreseeable future to be *that* anxious about.  Thinking about getting to do things I usually really enjoy doesn't help at all.  Even if I tell myself I'm going to play video games for a couple hours and then sleep in tomorrow, nope, still feel like I'm about to die.

I sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication.  And I would like to avoid it too but I'm open to it if it would really help.  

I'm wondering if anyone else has had these types of symptoms of anxiety and has found relief for it.",7,2013-11-27 00:03:35 EST-0500

1048,How I got rid of my anxiety (and a big thank you to r/anxiety!),"To start off I wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit. I used to be a big lurker of r/anxiety when things were tough and knowing other people were going through the same problems as me really helped me through a very difficult time.

You don't see too many success stories on forums like this and I think it's because honestly once your anxiety's gone there's not many reasons to go back. If anything it just puts you back on edge.

Anyways I wanted to give back to the people who helped me and if this helps even one person I'll be very pleased.

In my mind there are 3 areas of improvement you need to focus on to get rid of that daily mind melting anxiety.

1. Lifestyle Changes
2. Coping Techniques
3. Belief Changes

I'll go into detail for each one but I think the first two are really important for decreasing your anxiety level (back to normal) and the third is necessary if you don't want it to come back.

1. Lifestyle changes:This category is about respecting your body and giving it what it needs to get better.

Start with food. If you don't have the vitamins your body needs it can be difficult for your muscles and brain to relax. Focus on fish (Omega3s), probiotic yogurt, and make sure your just generally get a healthy diet. Caffeine should be cut back or just simply quit drinking coffee and soft drinks all together.
Exercise. It may suck at first but exercising is probably the most relaxing thing there is. Try jogging, lifting weights, sit-ups, really anything that you can do for a prolonged period of time. It'll help you sleep and it lets you zone out of the anxiety if you're really pushing yourself.
 
2. Coping techniques: It's important to understand what triggers your anxiety and things you can do to bring it down once it's up.

Meditation is amazing but takes some practicing to do right. Once you figure it out you can do it anywhere and it instantly relieves stress.
Progressive muscle relaxation is similar to meditation but a lot easier to do. You tense one set of muscles as hard as you can for twenty seconds then exhale and feel the tension release. This is perfect for getting rid of constantly tense muscles.

The most important thing is realizing that when your thoughts start racing you're simply being irrational. I know the feeling, one minute your convinced you're going insane and the next you think you're having a heart attack. I still have a bit of hypochondria so whenever I have a weird new ailment I promise myself not to look it up on the internet because i'm just going to trick myself into thinking I have something that I don't. It helps to have someone you can talk to about these things who can give you rational advice when your mind starts to go into overdrive. 

I also find being busy helps a lot. If you're busy you have far less time time to stew about how your feeling today. So do something, take up a hobby, spend more time on work or with your friends just don't sit in your house alone.

On that note the worst thing you can do is avoid your anxiety. You will never get better by just avoiding everything in your life that stresses you out. I know how incredibly hard this is but you have to do it, giving in to the disease is not an option. This includes using recreational drugs to feel normal. You need to address the underlying issue.

3. Belief Changes: This is what will change your life and hopefully eliminate your anxiety for good but it's also the hardest of the three tasks to do.

I was convinced for about 2 years that my anxiety was ultimately incurable. I had many different theories as to why (it was genetic because my mom used to have anxiety/I've always been sorta anxious. I smoked too much weed and it warped my mind, etc.) I really was not in a good place. Constant panic attacks, weird symptoms and hopelessness made me seriously depressed. I would go through periods where I felt like I was getting better but it would eventually come back. This was because I didn't really believe I could get better. I thought anxiety was a part of who I was and that scared me immensely. It took a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes to realize that while maybe I was more prone to anxiety than others my thoughts and beliefs were the real problem.

It was during a long run when I had an epiphany. I couldn't feel any anxiety, it was amazing. The anxiety quickly returned but I realized then and there that the real problem was my constant focus on my my anxiety to see if it was still there or getting worse. There really wasn't any part of the day when I wasn't aware of my anxiety and that awareness made me anxious. I decided to simply stop reacting to my anxiety. It didn't go away at first. But it was amazing how quickly it got better, now that I believed I could. I simply stopped paying so much attention to it and went of with my life. Eventually it occurred to me that it wasn't thinking about it at all because it was gone. I've been that way for 2 years now and though I will occasionally freak myself out now and then I always remember that i'm the one in control and it never last for more than a day. More importantly I'm happy, healthy and living the life I want to.

In conclusion it's not easy getting rid of anxiety but I think for the majority of people it's possible but you have to believe you can. Try using steps 1 and 2 to get yourself to a place where you realize your thoughts ultimately control your emotions and then make those thoughts positive. You might have a lot of setbacks and it won't happen all at once but with perseverance you can get to where you want to go. All the best and be kind to yourself.

1055,A simple thought that has really reduced the severity of my symptoms.,"I've been struggling with Anxiety for a few years now, mine has always manifested in a very physical nature (light headedness, weakness, blotches in vision, cold sweats, burning etc...). It's been quite a while since it's been at a level where it completely debilitated me and fingers crossed that I can maintain management of it now. 


In those times when it was unbelievably terrifyingly bad, depression hit strong as your mind starts focusing on thoughts like 'is this the rest of my life now', 'is it ever going to end', 'can I stand this for the rest of my life/do I want to live it' etc.... You begin to think and act on this assumption that it is going to last forever. 

Having had it for awhile now where I've been through so many waves of better and worse, better and worse I realized that no one feeling/sensation/thought/attack/whatever is going to last forever. 

Usually, the saying 'nothing lasts forever' has negative connotations (i.e. life, childhood, fun etc..) but it's also true for all the bad stuff in life (i.e. pain, anxiety, depression, stress etc..). This train of thought took emphasis off the symptoms I experience on a day to day level. I knew that when I felt horrible, I knew it was going to pass eventually. Over time, what this did was allow my brain to maintain focus on other things and less on my symptoms and I began to notice they weren't as obtrusive and severe as they once was. 

It's simple and you'll probably say duh, but really try and drive that into your way of thinking. IT WON'T LAST FOREVER. ",17,2013-01-09 17:14:18 EST-0500

Normally when you wake up abruptly you should have some fight or flight to make you aware of your surroundings quickly so that you can act upon what woke you up.

As you are all aware, we have way too much of that instinct. 

So one summer home from college, when my 'wake-up anxiety' was at its worst, I woke up to hear my mom screaming my name from her room across the hall. I woke up and was ready for action, but incredible anxious. Apparently my dog had a seizure and now he could not move. Panicking and also trying to control my moms wails I was able to get her on the phone with an emergency vet who told her to keep calm and keep our pup on the floor.

As soon as could pass the phone to my mom, I went to the bathroom and vomited, then took a zofran and buspar, as I was completely unable to control my anxiety. It was absolutely ridiculous! But still makes me laugh.

1069,UPDATE: I finally started taking meds (Citalopram) and found a therapist.,"Hi!

A while ago I wrote a post about how I finally gave in and started taking Citalopram. This my update after 8 weeks.

I take 20mg (one tablet) every morning. The phase of side effects was very managable. I got pretty much all common side effects but almost all have gone. The only thing remaining is the yawning all the time, sexual problems (I pretty much have no libido anymore) and I think I may have sleeping issues due to the meds.

Do the meds help? I'm not so sure. What I noticed is that it stabilized my mood. Even on days where everyone can kiss my ass and I sleep till 3pm, I get up but don't feel the usual self-hate, no feeling of ""god damnit another fucked up day"" anymore. I just don't give a shit, so even if things look grim, I'm not in a bad mood. That doesn't mean am happy-on-drugs and psyched, I just don't slip into the lows so much, which is a good thing.

Does it help with the anxiety? It should as Citalopram is anxiolytic meaning it should resolve/ease the anxiety. I'm not really sure it does. According to my therapist, this may be a sign it's not working as after 8 weeks you definitely should feel a change. As an example, it took all my willpower to go get a haircut two days ago. I only managed to get my hair cut because noone was there so I didn't have to wait and sit down, or else I would've bailed, so I guess it's not working as supposed. Going to the doc soon to see if I need to up my dosage or possibly switch medication (oh boy...).

Regarding the therapist:

I was incredibly lucky to find a therapist that does behavioural therapy as well as depth psychology (the classic  ""is your childhood responsible for all that"" basically). So far I have been in 4 or 5 sessions and while I think the guy may be solid, I didn't get any solid advice so far. Mostly, I talk about how I've been doing, then we talk about certain problems, but the feedback so far has been pretty much useless and for my taste way too much esoteric. I hate it. I want a solid plan on how to tackle my misguided thoughts, I don't want to ""feel the energy of the room"" or something like that, it won't help me buy bread and it won't help my manage 8 hours of work.

Luckily my boss is very considerate and I've been working half-days for a few weeks. It helps a lot, but it helps by removing stressful situations. I don't think I got any better, I just don't have to power through 8 hours now. I'm pretty sure working full days would easily result in the same issues I had when I worked full days.

So to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me. Luckily, the meds seem to stabilize my mood or I'm pretty sure I'd be in another big low.

Thoughts and comments much appreciated!

I really like her and I have no reasons to think she might not like me or that we won't hit it off... but the more I feel things might work out between us, the more anxiety I get!

It's like my scumbag brain doesn't want me to be calm and happy and optimistic.

I have my anxiety under control otherwise with a therapist and medication, and have for several months, but this is my first time dating since I got help.

Can anybody advise me here? It's interfering with my life again, and I won't see my therapist for another week yet...


**EDIT:** Thanks for your help everybody. The advice really helped, the lunch date went great, and I'm going to see her again. Everything seemed positive for awhile after...

1084,I'm so afraid of sex...,"Let me preface this by saying I've had social anxiety for about 7 years. It's taken many forms, from agoraphobia to general interactions, but for the past year or so, it's turned to sex. I've had sex before, and I enjoy it. I've only had it really with one person in high school, and once last year with another girl in my first year of college.

I'm just so anxious that I won't be able to provide. That I other can't get it up because of my anxiety (has happened a few times) or that I finish too quickly (has also happened a few times). I like the thought of sex on my own, like fantasizing about it. But whenever the thought becomes real, or I'm put in a situation where it's possible, I get so stressed out.

I've met this insanely beautiful girl, and apart from this problem and that I'm not an insanely built guy, I'm decently attractive physically and personality wise. But I know that a girl like her would want sex before establishing a relationship and wouldn't deal with problems like this.

1088,"24/F, Socially-Anxious & Depressed Virgin. I'm sex-obsessed and struggling with primal urges vs my self-respect. Advice?","I suffer from anxiety, social anxiety, and depression, along with self-esteem issues. I've never dated, been in love or even been kissed. Although in the past guys have apparently shown an interest in me but I'm terrible at receiving and giving signs of attraction so I often overlooked flirting guys, assuming they were just being nice because 'most guys wouldn't find me 'attractive' or would like me if they 'really' got to know me anyway.' (People have complimented my looks before, it just boils down to low self-esteem I guess).

Anyway I'm here today because I need some advice about sex and relationships. This is super embarrassing to admit but my problem is that I'm *extremely* sex-obsessed. I'm horny nearly all the time and just want to lose my virginity and start FINALLY having sex. I'm an intelligent person, I run a small business, yet I fear that due to some insatiable, primal need I'll end up going to bed with the first guy I get the chance to do it with. ...And part of me wants this. 

I don't have many friends, especially since I moved cities last year. I don't have any male friends and now that I'm no longer in university, I don't get to meet guys often (not sure how to talk to them anyway). And I also don't get crushes often but I've noticed that whenever I do these days (about once per year or less), my mind goes straight past friendship and love, and I start fantasizing about how our sex life would be. (My most common fantasy is of the guy eating me out, something I've lusted to experience for awhile now). I hate that my mind goes straight to the gutter, when a few years ago I couldn't even fathom thinking about a crush sexually without feeling sick.

There's a handyman, a friend of the family, he's 29, tall, good-looking and really nice. He also has an 8 year old kid. Anyway he's been showing me signs of interest for a while now (even asked me out to drinks once) and although the better part of me doesn't want to mix business and relationships (and doesn't want to mess with a guy 5 years older with a *child*) the horny, irrational me just pictures us having sex and him going down on me. 

I'm afraid that if he comes on to me more I'll give in and try to have sex with him as soon as I get a chance. I'm partly ashamed by this because I've always believed in waiting to have sex, waiting till you're certain the guy loves you and vice versa. But these days I just want to fuck. I'm 24, never even been kissed, and in a way I feel like I have zero standards. I don't want to disrespect myself or ruin any potential relationships by obsessing over sex and rushing into it. I'm just so horny these days that I've kind of stopped caring. ... Yeah, I'm a walking contradiction.

Has anyone else been through something similar? Can I get some advice? I haven't been given a good reason why not yet, so I really think I'll sleep with this guy if I get the chance. I may never get a chance to be that intimate with anyone again. And I just wanna feel what it's like, burn off some pent up frustration.

1090,The techie take to understanding anxiety,"It's amazing how many anxiety sufferers don't understand anxiety and how to properly clear it so here is a quick analogy I use.  My background is in computer science, I spent 10 years programming computers and have since left that field in favor or reprogramming subconscious minds.

The key thing is knowing how the subconscious/unconscious mind works. What is important to know is that, just like a computer, the mind is constantly collecting and storing information based on our experiences (creating our memory).  Based on the information being stored in our memory the subconscious is then creating programs that are always running (lets call them system processes of the mind). These programs are what define our habits, beliefs and behaviors. Some of the ways new programs get created is through repetition (for example if someone keeps putting you down it can turn into a program that reinforces low self esteem) or via traumatic events.

In the case of anxiety, the subconscious mind is also running programs designed to keep us safe. For example, lets say you've got a headache and take a couple of Tylenol capsules. Through the process you end up significantly choking on one of the pills as it gets lodged in your throat. Luckily, the pill eventually dislodges but this can cause the subconscious mind to believe that pills are a risk to your safety.  It can then launch a program that will create a fear response (hence anxiety) at the thought of taking pills (thinking it is keep you safe) or even a physical response (maybe your throat muscles tense up as you're getting ready to try to take a pill).

Remember that when it comes to anxiety we are dealing with the subconscious/unconscious ... so those who are unaware of the cause of their anxiety may simply be unaware of the root events that created the program. For example, you may have had an experience at the age of 2 (maybe attacked by a dog) that you no longer consciously remember although a program created at that time can be creating fear/anxiety in relation to dogs.  It may also be a program created from habits you subconsciously picked up from your parents (very common), siblings, schoolmates, etc ...

All that being said (and this may already be obvious) for those who are trying to avoid taking medications or get off medications you need to look into and clear the root cause of your anxiety (the malevolent program) in order to properly eliminate it permanently.",13,2013-09-03 22:03:13 EDT-0400

I've been on antidepressants for a few years. Doesn't seem to do anything. I have been put on more than one kind, more than one dose.

The only thing that gives me any relief is anti-anxiety medication. I rarely have any, but when I take some it's the only time I feel normal, and I so rarely feel remotely normal that it makes me cry in relief. 

I never really get any help from the counselor or psychiatrist. The counselor gives me sleep and diet tips, and my psychiatrist told me I have anxiety but that there's no cure (just take these pills).

1095,"Switching from Paxil to Zoloft, wish me luck! Will keep everyone up to date in comments","Hi everyone, I just wanted to share the experience I am starting today - switching from Paxil to Zoloft. I hope input from r/anxiety may help, and that I can contribute back useful information for those who need/want to make a switch, too.

So, I've taken Paxil for years, and I've always struggled with weight and appetite issues with it. It's unfortunate because Paxil helps my anxiety quite a bit, but I've also gained about 60 pounds with it, and have an uncontrollable appetite. My diet never really changed over the years. If I had to choose, I'd take the weight (my anxiety was crippling), but I'd always wanted to have it both ways. 

With psychiatrist supervision, I've tried cutting back Paxil dosage, as well as switching to Zoloft before. This will be my second attempt at the Zoloft switch.  Currently, (well, through yesterday!), I took 30mg of Paxil once a day. 

During the cut-back attempt, the plan was to cut my dosage to 25mg, then to 20mg, and possibly 15mg if it still kept the anxiety in check. After about a week of 25mg, I was going through serious withdrawal from Paxil. I experiencing severe ""brain zaps"", and also started getting horrible nausea. Increasing the dosage back fixed the problems in about 24-48 hours (of which I slept through the majority off). It was probably the worst I'd felt in my life, in terms of overall crappiness.

A little over a year ago, we made the attempt to switch from Paxil to Zoloft. The idea was to go from 30mg Paxil to 20, then 10, then 0. I have forgotten the exact dosages, but at the same time, Zoloft was to go 1/3 dose (w/20mg of the Paxil), 2/3 dose (with 10mg Paxil), and then full. After a few days of the 20mg Paxil with 1/3 dose of Zoloft, I started having the brain zaps again, and facing depression problems. It sucked, although not as bad as the attempt to lower the Paxil dose. I resumed full Paxil dose, and felt much better quickly.

So why try the direct switch? Well, a few studies and articles seem to say that the direct switch works better (as well as some anecdotes I found on other anxiety forums). Unfortunately, the one really in depth article I had bookmarked is a 404 now, but if you can find a cache of it, here is the link: http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=x20030828225122296270 My doctor said he thought there was no harm in trying it, and my wife is well aware of the change and will be on the look out for anything weird or dangerous (like depression) along with myself. My hope is I will be able to manage my anxiety and weight on Zoloft. Even if Zoloft doesn't allow me to control my weight better, it would be a success to me to know I overcame the problems of going off Paxil.

Wish me luck! :-) Any advice is greatly appreciated!",23,2013-09-07 00:11:08 EDT-0400

1097,Fear going crazy/schiz or snapping and doing something horrible. Anyone have similar experience?,"  So I have been through it all over the last year or two.  Thought I had heart trouble, scared of cancer ran all manner of medical tests etc etc.  I tried to get on lexapro and that was a mistake for me, I guess me and that medicine just didn't mix.  

  I thought I was going out of my mind so I stopped taking it (with doctors approval of course).

  I am now grappling with what I can only guess is a mix of harm ocd, anxiety and a phobia of developing schizophrenia or psychosis.  Honestly I don't know a lot about those disorders, and don't really want to. I know enough about them that I worry endlessly about developing symptoms of them.

  I am seeing a therapists and bother her and my regular doctor have assured me that I show no signs of either, but of course that only keeps me cool for a while then it returns again.

  Whats even more awesome, I've developed a bunch of eye floaters recently (causes in part from an eye injury that happened recently I believe) and that hasn't helped, seeing little white and black spots all over my vision lol

I havent even driven a car, even though i own and restored a 68 mustang with my dad. I just cant do the unknowns. I want nothing more than to be able to get into my car and drive around the city and pick up friends for a change, but it seems impossible. I was diagnosed as having an anxiety and severe panic attack issue at about 15. I saw a therapist for over 5 years and it really helped for a day or so, but I lost my insurance about 4 months ago. So the doctors cant see me because I am already in to much debt with them. So I lose my access to my klonopin, prozac, and hydroxozine. I found a clinic that has refilled my prozac but wouldnt refill klonopin for 3 months of visits. So... hardcore klonopin withdrawl, 4 mg a day for 3.5 years to cold turkey. I wanted to die, but i dont give up like that, i do love life. I actually could have died and the doctors didnt seem to care about me. I just havent gotten out of the deep deep hole that I went into after that withdrawl experience and the original anxiety ontop of the ""old days"" panic attacks. 
I am in college and have done great up until this end of the year, i can barely get out of bed in the morning and half ass everything with no interest. So about 3 weeks ago i decided im just going to push as hard as I can to be happy. I go play basketball with friends the next day and the first lay up, my knee dislocates and i land full weight on the bottom of the same leg. Broken leg/chipped kneecap without insurance, so now i owe more money then I have got in the last 5 years and i feel like im falling deeper and deeper into this pit. I try meditation, breathing exercises, diets, and my love Cannabis. All of these work to an extent and cannabis works like my klonopin but happier. I do have asthma though, so my cannabis smoke is expensive and not as frequent as it was when i wasnt in crazy debt to stay healthy. So i do fiend for my weed or klonopin now. Ill go weeks without cannabis and now klonopin for about 3 months. I just want this ache in my stomach to be relieved. Now im stuck on the third story with a broken leg and no elevator. Im so done with living like a piece of shit that has nothing to give, because i know i can get out of this and become a great and productive person.

Eat more raw fruit + veg and cut down on sugar

Avoid caffine

Take omega 3 + zinc every morning

Start the couch to 5k running program/ get bike fixed

1117,Cognitive impact of Anxiety,"Hi,

It was recently explained to me that what I am currently experiencing is 'Depersonalisation', as a result of years of anxiety. From what I've read, the description of dp is on the whole accurate, especially the deadening of emotion, to the point where the anxiety itself doesn't seem to manifest either emotionally or somatically anymore. Rather I'm just zoned out 24/7 and pretty much nothing affects me. This I am starting to understand and come to accept.

 More worrying for me of late (I have only recently started to address these issues, having previously thought the dullness I was experiencing was part of my personality) is the cognitive toll it has taken. It feels like my mind is blank for large portions of the day. I lack creativity, organisation, clarity in my thinking, that is when I am thinking at all. My memory is atrocious across the board, whether it be short term, long term, relating to facts/dates/names/things I've read literally 5 minutes ago. My ability to process information has declined significantly. If I am listening to someone speak, I hear the words but I am not registering what they are actually saying, not understanding. I come out of a lecture and am hard pressed to recall what exactly we've been talking about. I also get a feeling of intense pressure in my head after trying to concentrate and take in material. Not like a headache per se, it's difficult to describe. It's making things really hard for me academically.

 There's two levels to it, the depersonalised me is apathetic to it all and just goes about his business, uncaring. But then there's what I consider to be the 'real' me (who hasn't surfaced in sometime), who would find the subject material interesting and would love to think about it and talk about it and explore it further. I often think of myself like this. Divided. I have had brief periods of (relative) clarity and have felt closer to the 'real' me and I can only describe those periods in one word: elation. These periods were mainly brought about by a short period of using Aniracetam, though and the effects wore off after a few months. I've read up on DP/Anxiety a bit and these specific cognitive effects (specifically the blank mind, which is very concerning) are not mentioned all that much. Does the emotional deadening go hand in hand with some of these cognitive deficits? By working on reconnecting with my emotions (with the help of a counsellor), will it lead to improvements in my mental functioning? Would medication be of use in such a situation? I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm 21 and want to make progress, but it's all a little overwhelming right now and I'd love to get your thoughts on this.

I really appreciate any response to this.

Thanks :)

1118,"Anxiety + depression, not a good combo","I just want to vent. I can go out of the house, I can put up a facade of confidence when talking to people, or at least I try to, but on the inside I'm a mess... I have so much fear, to what? I don't even know anymore... I've been dealing with this all my life.

I'm so tired of feeling in danger. When I'm at home I can at least relax, when depression doesn't hit me hard.

I don't like living like this. I also don't like taking meds, they helped but they made me so sleepy and lazy that it's almost the same as being dead.

I've tried exercising, meditation, and my confidence seems to have improved, or at least that's what I project. But on the inside, the fear is the same, and I can't control it no matter what I do. My heart starts beating fast, my hands feel cold, and I'm once again that little girl that used to be abused by everyone.

Why can't my anxiety go away? And why can't I stop being a victim of things that are long gone?",14,2013-11-09 01:16:36 EST-0500
1119,"[Relaxing] It might sound strange, but napping when I'm anxious really helps","I noticed that if I'm getting a lot of anxiety, if I go to my bed and just lay down and try to sleep, even if I don't fall asleep, it lowers my anxiety after a few minutes. It might sound difficult to nap while panicking, but try it sometime to see if it works for you (if you are at home.) I think laying down somewhere comfy and closing your eyes must send a message to the brain to rest and calm down since sleep is pretty good for that.",3,2013-11-08 10:28:04 EST-0500

1121,[Rant] Your health is the only thing that matters,"*I know this is really long but I just need to get it off my chest, You can skip all the fluff and read the last paragraph if you'd like. There might also be some trigger warnings in here (self harm/suicide)*

I started my first semester of college in August. The week before I moved I felt great, I was ready to go and get out of the town I grew up in. My anxiety was no where in site. The college that I moved to was six hours away from home and I wasn't bringing a car so I was basically going to be stuck there for a while. Move in day was awful, I was throwing up on and off all day and my boost of excitement from before was gone. Once everyone left and It was just my roommate and I, I started to relax a bit more. For the first 4 days I was there I didn't eat a thing. I tried to force myself to eat but then my anxiety would rear its ugly head and tell me to stop. 

Things eventually got easier. Once classes started I was pretty preoccupied with my work. I was making friends surprisingly and everything was okay. My roommate and I had met on our schools website and we had a lot in common so we decided to request each other to room together. She was a lot different in person. I could tell that she lied about a lot of the things that she had said on that website but I tried to get along with her. About 3 weeks into the school year I had my first panic attack. I found out that my roommate had been saying stuff to other people about me and frankly I couldn't believe it. I confronted her about it and she starts crying and apologizing and such so I forgive her. This happens about 4 more times after that and I just tell her i'm done. Theres been numerous times that she had tried to kick me out of my room and tell me to move out so I told my RA about all these things. My roommate never came back that weekend and on monday she started moving all of her things and she was gone. 

Two days later I have a knock on my door. Campus police say that they had an anonymous call stating that there were drugs in my room. They had to search through everything and found nothing. The cop just looks at me and says ""You look really nervous, If you have anything just give it to us"". OF COURSE IM NERVOUS. I don't like cops in the first place so the second I opened the door I just think ""oh shit"" and my hands start shaking. Im almost 100% sure it was my old roommate that reported me. 

Things start to die down and now we are up to last weekend. My youngest brother was turning twenty one so my dad came down with him so he could celebrate with my oldest brother who lives in town. Every time that they would drop me off to go back to the dorms I feel like I died a little inside. I felt like I was being put back into a cage that was far too small for me. My head literally felt sick and that if I were to open my skull up my brain would be green. I hit a low point. I cut myself that night. I haven't self harmed in about 4 years so this was a huge thing to me. The past week I had to force myself to watch a movie or occupy my mind so I wouldn't hurt myself but that night, I couldn't take it anymore. 

The next day was the dad that my dad and youngest brother were leaving so we went out to lunch and back to my brothers apartment. I lost it. It feels like each time I have a panic attack it gets even hard to deal with. I just wanted to curl into a ball right then and there and just disappear. I couldn't go back to school, that place would kill me. So I told my family everything. 

Getting help is the hardest thing to do, trust me but if it is a matter of life and death they need to know these things. If I would have stayed there for another week I don't know if I'd be here today. I'd rather drop out of college now that to risk failing it or killing myself. Anxiety is the gateway drug to other mental disorders. I thought for the longest time that it was my anxiety making me feel this way but looking back at it now I have developed depression as well. I packed up my things and left that school. The second I walked in the door of my house I felt so much better and know I made the right decision. Telling someone that you want to kill yourself is one of the hardest things to do but its also the smartest.

TL;DR: Getting help doesn't make you weak. The only thing that matters is that you stay healthy. ",2,2013-11-11 19:50:44 EST-0500
1122,Finally went to a psychiatrist.. left worse than I went in.. (wall of text),[deleted],24,2013-11-08 17:34:00 EST-0500
1123,1 situation from 2 points of view: with anxiety and without,"So this happened to me today and I thought it gave a really interesting perspective/summary of what it's like to have anxiety problems. Figured you guys could probably relate. (Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope you'll give it a read!)

As I was driving home from school today, I was sitting at a red light when in the corner of my eye I noticed a big, weird black bug crawling on my car, right along my driver's side window. My window was rolled up but I was super startled because it was right next to where I was resting my arm. I'd never seen a bug like it before in my life, it was a little bigger than a US quarter.

I immediately started freaking out. As the light turned green, I tried to accelerate fast in hopes it would fly off the car. But instead it kept crawling, right past my window and out of my range of vision. I was really freaked out and proceeded to have a panic attack, crying and feeling claustrophobic in my car the rest of the way home. 

When I got home I told my boyfriend (who does not have a problem with anxiety) what happened. His response: ""So? It was on the outside of the car, you were fine."" 

I said, ""But I don't know if it could have gotten in through any of the cracks in my car. What if it came in through the A/C vent and blew onto my face? I turned the A/C off to prevent it but what if that just made it easier somehow for the bug to crawl in? What if it came out in the heating vent and landed on my feet? What if it crawled up my pants leg? What if it was hiding in the crevices of my side-view mirror? What if it laid eggs in there? What if it laid eggs in my A/C vents somehow? What if there was already a colony of those bugs living in the car? Does it bite? Does it sting? Can it fly? Do they get any bigger than the one I saw? Is it poisonous? What if it got inside and jumped on me and I swerved into traffic and got in a wreck and died? What if I got in a wreck and killed someone else? What if it was hiding on the outside of the car and when I opened the door to get out at home, it jumped on me? What if the entire outside door was covered in a swarm of those bugs but I just couldn't see it from inside?"" I couldn't stop rubbing off my legs because I could swear it felt like bugs were crawling on them.

My boyfriend is super awesome and supportive but he was really shocked because none of those things would have occurred to him. He would have just said, ""Huh, well at least it's on the outside"" and not given it another thought.

And that's the difference between having anxiety issues and not.",0,2013-11-14 12:59:10 EST-0500
1124,I just pissed in a towel in the bedroom...,"Just one example of my anxiety. 
I am at my Aunts house. It is 4AM and I have to pee very bad. The bathroom is down the hall. But in order to get there I have to pass my Aunt's room and she keeps her door open. I don't want to risk the chance of disrupting her sleep. I know that she wouldn't care the least either even if I would wake her up. 
But still, I don't want to be an annoyance. So I decide I will find another way. I look around the room and decide to relieve myself in a dirty towel. I will just soak the towel in the shower that day and wash it. Crisis averted.
But why do I do this to myself everyday over such trivial things??? The amount of stress I needlessly add to my mind and body in going to kill me quicker.",1,2013-11-14 16:27:02 EST-0500

I'm just really proud of myself because it's something I've been trying to get myself to do since about November. The process itself was painful because I had to call (something I detest with every fiber of my being) and then I got transferred because I called the wrong number (which of course made me feel stupid and I should have known because it was on the website and how am I supposed to make it in this world if I can't do the most basic things...insert the spiral of self-loathing) and the phone call was long because it took the person I was talking to and me a while to figure out a day that works. But now that it's over I'm feeling slightly better. Of course now I have to worry about what I'm going to say/what will they think/are they going to think I'm making this up?

I think I need more than just popping pills.  I was once a musician and performed before many people.  Now I'm nowhere near that.

1133,Pre-event anxiety keeps me home.,"I have dealt with my social anxiety pretty well. I almost never have problems with it. I can even be outgoing sometimes. 

What I am having trouble overcoming is this anxiety and overthinking that I do before a scheduled event. It is particularly bad with work stuff. I have low self-esteem, compounded by an emotionally abusive family. I struggle to get out and try things, even though I *know* that I'll do fine. 

For example, I'm a photographer. I will book a gig, and get nervous about how well I will do. I ruminate about it and the fear builds. When the time comes, I will often panic and cancel, or even just not show up. You can imagine how devastating this can be to a career. I did the same thing in college - I got a number of failing grades because I stopped showing up, due to a fear of some kind of embarrassment or catastrophe. It has kept me from coming anywhere near my potential in life. 

Any ideas on what exactly this is, or what to do about it? I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but she isn't helping me much with it. I've been in therapy for years for depression and anxiety and substance abuse, but this issue is very pervasive.

1136,Just took the public bus for the first time. Everything turned out better than expected :),"So I've been avoiding using city buses for as long as I can and I'm not really even sure why. But my husband recently got a new job that requires use or our only car and I knew I'd have to suck it up and be brave sooner or later or I'd be stuck at home for 5 hours a day for 5 days out of the week which would also drive me insane. 

Today I think I had an extra dose of bravery in my Cheerios because I decided to finally take the bus to go out. I was a bit anxious making sure I got off at the right stops but it was actually really easy and turned out to be fun too! I did get off at one of my stops too early but I only had to walk a tiny bit extra so it was no big deal. And going home will be just as easy. 

I just wanted to share this with a group of people who would understand and possibly encourage someone else to do something they've been a bit scared of too. It may turn out to be really fun like my experience! I met a cool guy and had some good conversations. :)

But an important little part of my story here was that I wasn't forced to do this. I didn't have to go out today. (I just wanted to go grab coffee since I've been sick and away from my favorite coffee place for too long.) Sometimes, our best victories are the ones we don't need to have. We just want to. And honestly, those feel the most satisfying and empowering to me.

1145,Some (hopefully helpful) thoughts,"Hi r/anxiety. 

My happiness rating over the last month or so has gone from a 2 or a 3 to about a 7 or 8. I know that anxiety comes in many different forms but I wanted to share some thoughts here in the hope that it will help someone. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0

I was watching this a while back and thinking about how true this was.  
Except, it isn't just a ride, because you have control over it. I have heard the phrase ""Don't take life too seriously"" many times in my life, but never before have I really understood it. I say understood because, it's not as though I didn't agree with the message of it, I just didn't know how people did it. I started to say to myself, ""It's just a game"", just like any of the video games I love to play. 

Now, I suppose this will apply more to the people who aren't religious here... but I started taking solace in the fact that my life is insignificant. I can live it any way I want, and I don't want to live it anxious and depressed. 

Now, I have been taking Viibryd for a while, so that may be contributing quite a bit as well, but I feel as though my perspective shift was very helpful as well. I imagined all the horrible things that could happen and then my perspective on life popped in and said ""oh well"". 

Here's an example: as I was writing this, I was worried for a second that people would read this and say ""You're obviously just feeling the meds"" or ""why can't I feel like that?"".

I guess I just see the anxious thoughts now and go ""yeah, but I'm still gonna post it. Why not? Let's see what happens. Maybe this post will be seen by friends/family, maybe it'l pop up 10 years from now in a job interview, but whatever.""

tl;dr, perspective changes on life can affect your subconscious and let you worry a little without caring about the worrying. 

Hope this helps. ",9,2013-02-06 23:04:13 EST-0500

All of those questions are so essential for me to know in order for me to be able to work there. I wonder what a non-anxiety person must think of those questions. Haha.

1158,[X-post from r/depression] I tried something new today and it was really nice :),"I just got back an hour or so ago from my first stint of volunteering at a barn. The reason I'm posting about it is doing something like this might help others like I can feel it helping me. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, and it's taken me a long time to work up the gumption to look for a little bit of volunteer work to fill the time. My main goal was to volunteer doing something that made me happy.

The barn I volunteered at today is attached to a school for children with special needs (medical, disabilities, etc). Some of the kids get lessons that are, more or less, equine therapy for them. My job was to be in charge of the horses and lead them around the ring. I have some horse experience, but even so I was very nervous about today. What if the animals could sense my anxiety? Would that make things more dangerous for the kids?

Actually, my anxiety lessened a lot when I was around the horses (and one pony). It was almost like biofeedback, where you can visually see what your mental state is doing. So I made a point to relax, and the horse next to me relaxed. By the end of the fourth lesson and the end of my volunteering time I wasn't at all anxious. There were even some instances where the horses would presses their noses or heads against me affectionately, as if they liked me and I made them feel better for being there.

It was so nice to feel like I can do good again. If you have an opportunity to just give a little time to something like this it's worth it for you. Even if it's only an hour a week. Today, honestly, was therapy for me that was effective in a way that pills and professionals are not. Both have their place, but this was just...different. And good.

1186,I met my favorite band [update],"FUCKING WINTERSUN!

I went. Here is an [album](http://imgur.com/a/u8Udt) full of pictures. An hour or so before I was supposed to meet them I almost talked myself into not doing it. But, I did it and it was amazing. I had almost nothing to say. They asked if I saw them in December and I told them I had my ticket to go but had a massive panic attack and literally couldn't leave the house. 

It was such an incredible opportunity over all. I can't believe they came back so soon AND that I won a contest to meet them. I let my anxiety stop me from going the first time but this time I forced myself to go and it was honestly one of the best shows/experiences I've had so far. They are very nice people and if you're into metal, I strongly suggest checking them out :P Hopefully they come back to Portland next year when their new album is released. My reddit user name is actually a song of theirs, Starchild, which was the last song played!

Don't let your anxiety consume you. I have off days, a lot of the time. But I feel like this was huge for me as someone who suffers from panic disorder, social anixety and agoraphobia. ",11,2013-08-26 07:42:00 EDT-0400
1187,Had a breakthrough moment today I need to share with people who understand its significance.,"Growing up, my biggest fear was moving away to college. All my fears were confirmed during my first year when my anxiety became so pronounced that I started going to therapy and was diagnosed with GAD. Prior to this, I thought I was just sensitive and a nervous person. Nope. This brought about new fears about travel and adjustments and being away from home. I was terrified for my second year but time really does help and I was able to have an amazing year. I never thought I'd ever take part in any study abroad program because of my anxiety. The thought of flying across the world (already have a fear of flying as it is) not knowing anyone and living there for 4 months (longer than I have ever spent away from home) made me sick to my stomach. But after my first quarter of my 2nd year went so well, I decided to apply. Fast forward to spring, I FREAKED about it. I was into the program and set to go in august but almost dropped out because of the fear. But I knew how bad regret feels so I stuck it out. I was scared all summer but managed to get through the flight (thank you ativan) and made it here without panicking. I thought I'd wake up the next morning in a panic like I usually do when my mind is still in a nervous mess. But I woke up feeling fine and ready to take it day by day. 


It's been a week now and I finally got time to be by myself in London today. I went to the Kensington Gardens to write in my journal and listen to music. I sat on the lawn looking at the sunset in front of Kensington Palace and while watching geese and birds fly by, I realized....I'M FUCKIN' DOING IT. I made it here. I'm facing that fear. I'm stronger than I thought. I made more progress than I thought. I thought I could never do this but I did it and I'm gonna continue to do it till it's done and there's no more ""biggest fear.""

1190,I haven't been able to leave my dorm for 3 days now,"I just started college, moved in a few days ago. Ever since then even the thought of going outside gets me jittery. They are doing freshmen welcoming events right now till Monday and I have not gone to a single one of them, including meals( also mention that while I am hungry, the second I think of going out that hunger inverts into a upset stomach ). Now I am taking meds for my anxiety (gabapentin 300mg twice a day,bupropion sr 150mg three times a day), while they do help deal with my physical symptoms, they don't remove them and do little for the mental ones.

 I think the problem is how little social experience I have. My entire life things tended to be done for me, even when I was asked a question my mother often butted in and answered it for them. But i'm on my own now, I have to do things for myself. Even when I could have done things by myself I didn't, I would like to avoid it instead hoping I would either get someone else to do it or hope I won't need it.
 I have a tendency to brake down when talking to strangers, the analogy i often use, the pressure a normal person feels giving a speech to thousands is the same I feel ordering from McDonald's. I'll get a clear plan in my head, go through it a lot trying to perfect it and when the time comes to try it, it collapses. I'll stutter one of the first words, mispronounce others and my mind goes in emergency panic mode because my plan failed. After that I'll end up talking fast and rambling in a nervous kind of voice. I'll always feel awkward in this situation, from the very first stutter I feel like I'm making a fool of myself. Because of this I try the hardest to avoid social interaction. I'll let people walk over me in order to avoid it. There is a school counselor I was supposed to go to, but I can't even will myself to go to her,

I'm also rather disappointed in myself, college was something I was looking forward to my entire life. A place where people actually wanted to learn, and would actually learn useful things. But here I am, crumbling apart, half of me wants to go home and hide in my room, the other half is shunning the first one for trying to ruin my dream.

I'm not really sure what I should do.I emailed the counselor to see if they could help but I didn't get a response yet. I haven't eaten anything real for 3 days now, I'm hungry but that feeling goes away when I try to open my door to leave. Along with this constant internal conflict I have no idea what to do and just end up spending all day in my room.",12,2013-08-24 18:10:39 EDT-0400
1191,"I won a contest to meet one of my favorite bands, part of me doesn't want to go.","This is only the second time they've done a tour in the US, its the Finnish metal band Wintersun. I missed their show in December because I literally could not leave my bedroom. I was on my way to leave, stepped outside and started crying and came back in and hid under my blankets... Honestly, one of my biggest regrets. I couldn't believe I let anxiety ruin something like that for me.

Today I got an e-mail telling me I had actually won. Of course my excitement level was through the roof at first but then it kind of started to sink in and now I'm VERY worried about having a panic attack and from there I just spiral into possible scenarios or outcomes. What if it happens and everyone notices? What if it happens and they think I'm weird? What if I'm asked to leave? Then I think things like, well maybe I just shouldn't go.. I forget to think of the positives and can't reassure myself. 


The last year has been a real struggle anxiety wise. Sometimes I can't leave my house, a few times its so bad I can't leave my bedroom. A few months ago I told my therapist my anxiety was getting better and I was having fewer panic attacks and eventually we determined it really wasn't better, I just avoid any situation that could trigger a panic attack or that might cause an increase in my anxiety. So, hello agoraphobia!


Tuesday I went to this metal show/event called Summer Slaughter at the same venue and it wasn't bad. However, I had taken more ativan than usual. I'm not scared of the venue, venue is fine. I would be fine even being around so many people in a tiny, crowded place (where I start to think crazy things like what if there's a shooting... -.- ) without ativan. 


I just fail, completely fail, in social situations. Funny thing is, I notice it or at least think I notice it but no one else ever does. Sometimes when I get more comfortable with people I mention it and they tell me they didn't notice it. I don't want to miss out again, the fear of a panic attack is very real to me. Especially since I'll actually be meeting them.

1193,How I got out of my anxiety and depression stricken life,"Hello, I'd like to first thank the /Anxiety community for helping me kick-start my journey to where I am today. Seeing people committed to helping one another really hit me in a positive way. Thank you.

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I would break down and cry, no motivation or energy to get out of bed, I could not meet new people, I would have a panic attack, and so on. I took Sertraline, 2 anti psych meds and a sleeping medication for 3 years.

I first started moving about when I had a sudden realization one night: **""I have to do something with my life, I have try to enjoy life. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain""** I wanted to go out, I wanted to have fun, to have friends, to smile like how I see people on social media. But how could I do it if I couldn't even talk to a person? to put it shortly, I kicked myself in the ass. I forced myself.

I took the first step with **online chatrooms** it didn't matter where it was, if there was a person I can talk to regarding anything, I'll try it. I started with a simple ""Hello"" and I would get a panic attack before they can even reply and disconnect. But I kept at it. The pain and anxiety going through that was excruciating, but then again, what else do I have to lose? It soon slowly seeped into me, talking to people online. A couple months later I slowly started moving to video chats, I would instantly disconnect upon seeing the person, but then again, I kept at it. After 5 or so months, I applied this to real life and my comfort level slowly leveled out. I cannot stress how bad I've felt through the process. It's a grind. 

Through this painful and scary process, I went from the person that cried getting up from bed, have strong panic attacks seeing people, to a person that can go out and live a normal life. I recently got together with the girl of my dreams. If I can do it, so can you. I believe in you. Test yourself, learn to love yourself. (I teared up having my first real conversation in years to a person because I was holding in anxiety)

I'm apologize for this being very poorly written. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask privately 
or here.

**Edit:** Present day, I found myself to be able to befriend strangers and keep up online webcam chats for hours. I found techniques to maintain a conversations when lost. The most important thing to do in my experience is ask questions. It's lame but the format I used would be : Relate to the question you're about to state -> ask the question. If not in person a example would be ""I'm not doing anything at the moment. Rolling around in bed, you?""",10,2013-08-24 18:00:33 EDT-0400

Year by year, it has only gotten better. I wanted to say this because I see a lot of cries for help here, but people don't really think about coming here when it's not an issue for them. I imagine some people might get a bit discouraged. I wanted to say that it can get easier. It has for me, it will for you. Hang in there, comrades.",6,2013-08-26 16:12:56 EDT-0400

1196,"I just need some support for Lexapro withdrawal, and want to confirm that's what's wrong with me...","EDIT: Forgot to put in the title that this was cross-posted to /r/depression as well.

This is a throwaway account. TL;DR at the bottom.

I [M/25] have been on Lexapro (10mg) for a little over one year. I went on Lexapro after being hospitalized for anxiety and depression/PTSD. The anxiety and depression were triggered by the end of an emotionally abusive relationship, which brought about a lot of self-analysis, which brought up a ton of other issues in my life that I was unhappy with (career path, finances, re-surfacing memories of child abuse). I spiraled into uncontrolled analysis/anxiety/suicidal ideation/unhappiness. Essentially, my depression manifests as workaholism/self-improvement-aholism... Can't turn off the brain... I had been in therapy for 5 years prior to all this, so I am pretty self aware, but still have a lot to learn.

Now, a year+ later, I am doing much better. I am starting a new job that has tripled my income. I am in a much healthier place with my family, who regret their actions when I was a child, and I am dating a guy who is kinder than anyone I've ever dated before. This guy actually came to see me in the hospital when I was voluntarily committed. We were just friends at the time, but he knows what he is getting himself into, so-to-speak. I still spend much of my day working and tackling side-projects, but I have learned to take a break every night and simply ""have fun"" / relax.

Lexapro has been a great help, but I'm tired of being a different person. I don't have as many emotions. The range of emotions is smaller. I also went from being extremely high sex drive to having zero drive at all. It's only gotten worse over time. I added in Wellbutrin to see if it would help, and it has not. I'm ready to be off of all drugs, slowly-but-surely.

I tried coming off of Lexapro once before and when I attempted it I thought it would be a piece-of-cake because I was feeling so great. I went from 10 mg to 5 mg and after a week or two I felt very anxious and had some crying spells. I went back on my full dosage because I was very busy at the time and needed to focus more than I desired being drug-free. I was also single at the time, so being non-sexual was not bothersome.

This time around I want to come off of the drugs because I want my full range of emotions when I start my new job. I want my slightly-anxious ""type A"" organized tendencies to come back which help me excel at work. I also miss having sex and as nice as my boyfriend is, I know that he misses sex too and it's getting to him. My last psychiatrist also told me that coming off at some point is good because if I ever relapse, I can go back on to 10mg instead of increasing my dosage. It keeps my ""arsenal of drugs"" a little more open.

This time around, I went from 10mg to 7.5mg by cutting tablets. I was at 7.5mg for a week and a half. Then I dropped to 5mg a few days ago. Last night I really noticed the difference. I have been having an increase in obsessive thought behaviors (mainly about my ex boyfriend, which is definitely obsessive since it's been 1.5 years since the split and we haven't spoken in nearly 8 months. Also, he was abusive in many ways.). I am also more irritable and notice my current partners flaws much more than I notice his good traits. I am constantly debating if this relationship is for me (which isn't something I would have been doing a few weeks ago), and I'm worrying that I am getting in over my head and that the relationship will never work out. My boyfriend is upset with me that I am self-medicating without the help of a psychiatrist. I am mad at him that he won't just trust me. This is probably sparking the obsessive thoughts about leaving him. All of this is happening in my head, and I don't want to talk about it because I don't want my anxiety to be a burden. So instead I am much quieter than normal, and he notices that. He asks what is wrong, and I tell him it's just side effects.

Essentially, I'm not being present in-the-moment and I am having more and more cognitive distortions come up in my head. I also have had some nausea and dizzy spells, and a few ""brain zaps,"" but nothing terrible.

I am planning on staying at 5mg for a little while. I don't have health insurance right now until my new job starts so I don't have a psychiatrist or a psychologist right now. I plan on staying at 5mg until I get a psychiatrist who can help me reduce my dosage further. I am simply posting this for some emotional support and hopefully so that people can reassure me that these side-effects are real and that I am not ""crazy,"" and that it's not ""all in my head.""

I also wouldn't mind advice on dealing with the side effects and advice on seeking out new mental health professionals. Ideally I wish I could just see one person who would perform talk therapy and also diagnose drugs if I needed them. If anyone else out there has depression that is similar to my own, (workaholism / self-improvement-aholism) I would be curious to know what kind of talk therapy has helped you?

**TL;DR:** Been in therapy for five years. Took Lexapro for the last year+ to help with anxiety/depression/PTSD. Want to come off. Second attempt. Decreasing dosage slowly. Feeling what I think is withdrawal: tired, dizzy spells, increased obsessive thinking and worrying, melancholy, etc. Advice? What works for you besides drugs?

1198,Stomach pains and noises in class!,"This started a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure it's because of anxiety!
I can even feel the pain building up when I wake up, sometimes even the night before. All I can think of during the lecture is when It's going to rumble and make noises, and how I can prevent it (like finding my pen and write something, cough, etc.). 
I told my therapist and he said ""Don't worry, no one will notice anyway"". Well that's definitely not true! I've heard giggling from strangers. One time an asshole friend (sitting a few rows away from me) even got up from his seat so he could look at me and laugh (at least I'm not taking classes with him anymore!). Another time, in a very small and quiet classroom, friend was constantly looking at me in pity saying things like ""poor you, that must be so embarassing"" etc. Of So people DO notice! It also gets painful. I can't focus in lectures anymore, and it's going to make college difficult for me if I don't get over this. I've skipped lots of lectures simply because of the silly stomach thing :( 

I know that this is entirely psychological. It never happens anywhere else, only in classes and lectures where it's quiet. It has nothing to do with what I eat. If I stay home instead of going to class, my stomach is completely fine. Does this happen to anyone else? Any idea what I can do about it? I know the key is to NOT worry about it but I have no idea how!
